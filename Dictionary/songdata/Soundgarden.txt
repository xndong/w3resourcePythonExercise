We see the vipers of distance  
Crawl into our lives everyday  
Breeding our Eden's of hatred  
Pathetically stupid and unkind  
We couldn't look a saint in the eye  
  
On the storm  
It's time to go  
On the storm  
It's time to go  
  
Marching in lines of contradiction  
Forgetting the history we make  
Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke  
We lack the Moses, to look  
A saint in the eye

Far beyond the road  
Between your house and home  
There is a churning storm  
Of hailing burning bones  
  
Tiny baby cries  
Little, tiny pawn  
In the profit gain  
Tiny baby grows  
  
Mother, who's your man  
Is he doing what he can  
To make a proper home, home  
By overturning other stones, stones  
Father, mighty man  
Loves his little boys, boys  
Shows them how to kill  
To save his precious stones, stones  
  
Far beyond the wheel  
Spin your life around  
By driving flesh and blood  
Deep into the ground, ground  
  
Far beyond the wheel  
Steers life around  
By driving flesh and blood  
Deep into the ground, ground

In my eyes, indisposed  
In disguises no one knows  
Hides the face, lies the snake  
And the sun in my disgrace  
Boiling heat, summer stench  
'Neath the black the sky looks dead  
Call my name through the cream  
And I'll hear you scream again  
  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
Won't you come (Won't you come)  
  
Stuttering, cold and damp  
Steal the warm wind tired friend  
Times are gone for honest men  
And sometimes far too long for snakes  
In my shoes, a walking sleep  
And my youth I pray to keep  
Heaven sent hell away  
No one sings like you anymore  
  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
Won't you come  
  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
  
Hang my head, drown my fear  
Till you all just disappear  
  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
Won't you come  
  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
And wash away the rain  
Black hole sun  
Won't you come  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun)  
Won't you come  
Won't you come

Promise something,  
Kill me right away if I start to get slow  
And don't remember  
How to separate the worm from the apple  
Don't wait 'til tomorrow,  
Kill me right away if I start to listen  
To the voices  
Telling all the mouths what they need to swallow  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again  
  
I was thirsty,  
I remember that you gave me some water  
I was angry  
Everything at once you gave me no trouble  
I was crying,  
I remember that you gave me your shoulder  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again, born again  
  
Do that for me, it's the least that you can do  
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you  
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing  
'Til I'm born again, born again, born again, born again

Run away  
Now it's Halloween  
Shave your head and burn your sheets  
Evil could be right next door  
What do blind dogs believe?  
I don't want to know  
  
Blind  
Following blind  
  
Run away  
Now it's Halloween  
The safe bet is on your knees  
Bow your head to the Trinity  
That's what blind dogs believe  
But I've heard that before  
  
Dead on my feet  
While my nightmare walks  
I fell asleep  
Where the freeway talks  
Suffer to swim and dying to sink  
These things in the air  
They will make you think  
Make you think  
Make you think

All turns around  
All together we stumbled  
In there, a million pounds  
Everyone with a raise around  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
While we spill some more  
  
Once we were at the end  
The end of a long road  
Living to the skies  
All the other remained crowns  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
  
In the summer these days  
Children are alone  
All alone with the point  
  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
  
Mountains are around  
All together we tumbled down  
  
And the smoke lies  
On the valley floor  
And the blood dries  
While we spill

Nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard I try  
Nothing is closing my eyes  
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight  
And nothing seems to break me  
No matter how hard I fall nothing can break me at all  
Not one for giving up though not invincible I know  
  
I've givin' everything I need  
I'd give you everything I own  
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone  
I've given everything I could  
To blow it to hell and gone  
Burrow down in and  
Blow up the outside world  
  
Someone tried to tell me something  
Don't let the world get you down  
Nothing will do me in before I do myself  
So save it for your own and the ones you can help  
  
Want to make it understood  
Wanting though I never would  
Trying though I know it's wrong  
Blowing it to hell and gone  
Wishing though I never could  
Blow up the outside world

Follow me into the desert  
As thirsty as you are  
Crack a smile and cut your mouth  
And drown in alcohol  
'Cause down below the truth is lying  
Beneath the riverbed  
So quench yourself and drink the water  
That flows below her head  
  
Oh no there she goes  
Out in the sunshine the sun is mine  
  
I shot my love today would you cry for me  
I lost my head again would you lie for me  
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand  
I lost my head again would you cry for me  
  
Close your eyes and bow your head  
I need a little sympathy  
'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone  
Who isn't me  
So kill your health and kill yourself  
And kill everything you love  
And if you live you can fall to pieces  
And suffer with my ghost  
Just a burden in my hand  
Just an anchor on my heart  
Just a tumor in my head  
And I'm in the dark  
  
So follow me into the desert  
As desperate as you are  
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven  
And all the little pigs have God

I'm addicted to feeling  
Stealing love isn't stealing  
Can't you see that I understand your mind?  
  
I'm a walking believer  
I'm a ghost and a healer  
I'm the shape of the home inside your heart  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I don't care if you want to cry  
I'm a soldier for hire  
Killing all you admire  
And you live in the cloud but that will change  
  
Not looking for a brighter side  
Crooked steps will take me higher  
I don't care if you want to cry  
  
Blood raining down  
Cuts a deep, deep river  
And we're diving  
And we're diving  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you  
  
I'm a walking believer  
I'm a ghost and a healer  
Can't you see that I understand your mind?  
  
By crooked steps  
Right behind you

Sitting here like uninvited company  
Wallowing in my own obscenities  
I share a cigarette with negativity  
Sitting here like wet ashes  
With X's in my eyes and drawing flies  
  
Bathed in perspiration drowned my enemies  
Used my inspiration for a guillotine  
I fire a loaded mental cannon to the page  
  
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial  
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride  
Sitting here like wet ashes  
With X's in my eyes, and drawing flies  
  
Hey what you yelling  
About, conditions, permission, mirrored self affliction  
Hey what you yellin' about sadist's  
Co-addiction, perfect analogies  
hey what you yellin' about conditions  
permission mirrored self affliction  
  
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial  
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride  
Sitting here like wet ashes with X's in my eyes  
And drawing flies

I think it's turning back around  
And I think I like it  
I think it's turning back around  
Though I don't know why it is  
I think it's turning back on me  
I'm down on the upside  
I think it's turning back on me  
Now I'm the good ride  
  
And nothing's gonna put me out  
It's backing down and under  
I'm down on the upside now  
It's turning back around  
Turning back around  
  
I think it's coming on the wind  
Just like you said it  
I think it's coming on the wind  
And I'm gonna let it  
  
I think it's turning back on me  
Everything's easy  
I think it's turning back on me  
Everything's real to me

I can count it on my fingers  
I've got all my reasons not to feel  
I'm numb as rigor mortis  
Scared by monkey faces  
Drowned in shark fins  
  
But I don't feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Now I'm in the mirror  
Now it's getting clear  
I fear that I'm in you  
Now I'm into plastics  
Now I've made a mask  
It looks like fish heads  
  
But I don't feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Face pollution [Repeat: x4]

Whatsoever I've feared has come to life  
Whatsoever I've fought off became my life  
Just when everyday seemed to greet me with a smile  
Sunspots have faded and now I'm doing time  
Cause I fell on black days  
  
Whomsoever I've cured I've sickened now  
Whomsoever I've cradled I've put you down  
I'm a search light soul  
They say but I can't see it in the night  
I'm only faking when I get it right  
Cause I fell on black days  
How would I know that this could be my fate  
  
So what you wanted to see good has made you blind  
And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine  
So don't you lock up something that you wanted to see fly  
Hands are for shaking  
Not tying, no not tying  
  
I sure don't mind a change  
But I fell on black days  
How would I know that this could be my fate

All of seventeen  
Eyes a purple green  
Treated like a Queen, she was  
On borrowed self esteem  
  
She would do a dance  
A painful masquerade  
Spinning you into her web  
Along her vain parade  
  
In her uniform  
Studded brass and steel  
Kissing lipstick, napkin stains  
And smearing sincerity  
  
Along her vain parade  
Along her veins  
  
Time crept up on her  
She's early gray  
Her reflection looks concerned  
As flowers hit her grave

Fopped last night and the night before  
I had to fopp outside and then I went indoors  
Fopped so hard I made the people warm  
They stood back and gave me all the floor  
  
I did the fopp, the fopp  
they wouldn't let me stop  
Yeah I was foppin' and rockin'  
Had the house hoppin'  
  
Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was  
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your  
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor, everybody was Foppin'  
  
Fopp with me and I'll fopp with you  
Foppin' is the brand new thing to do  
Fopped so hard that I lost my shoe  
I fopped so tough they had to make some room  
  
Break your leg, don't you fopp your back  
Do your thing, don't you give no slack  
Shake your hips and then you turn around  
Well first you fopp it up  
And then you fopp it down  
  
Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong  
We'll be here foppin' all night long  
I'm too short, baby, and you're too tall  
But when we're foppin' that don't mean a thing at all  
  
Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was  
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your  
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor,, everybody was Foppin'

Long time coming  
It seemed to take me through  
Long time coming  
Many served the few  
And long to taste the shame  
That bows down before you  
  
Long time coming  
It seemed to get me by  
Long time coming  
It seemed to satisfy  
You longed to taste the shame  
That everybody tries  
  
Shame shame  
Throw yourself away  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can take  
If it sits upon your tongue  
Or naked in your eyes  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can try  
  
Long time coming  
It seemed to take me through  
Long time coming  
Many served the few  
And long to taste the shame  
That bows down before you  
  
Shame shame  
Throw yourself away  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can take  
If it sits upon your tongue  
Or naked in your eyes  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can try

Get on the snake  
With a swarm of motor flys  
Get on the snake  
Under the cola colored sky  
  
Don't worry, everything's clean  
Road worthy, hungry and mean  
  
Get on the snake  
Where the metal river bleeds  
Get on the snake  
Where you never will believe  
  
Hey baby, what's your disease  
My hearts bleeding  
I'm dying to leave  
  
Get on the snake  
Where the water turns to steam  
Get on the snake  
With a suicide machine  
  
Don't worry, everything's clean  
Road worthy, hungry and mean  
Hungry and mean  
Hungry and mean

Swings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
You can hear her calling everywhere you turn  
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn  
The words get stuck on the tip of your tongue  
She's the real thing but you knew it along  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at you, your mouth watering  
Look at you your mind spinning  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just a girl you want  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
She swings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want [Repeat x 2]

The hand of God lays high above me  
I'll be good if you really love me  
Let me feel your mighty crunch  
As you rub me out like water, fire, coal, etc  
  
Let it be known today, if you've got two hands  
You're supposed to pray  
Fingers of fire, coal and lead  
Fondly love me till I'm dead  
  
The hand of God is thick and callous  
Bruised and torn from stones and sticks  
The hand of God has got a ring about the size of Texas  
Made of steel and rust, my fingers smear  
  
Let me try on your hand, and see if it fits  
Don't worry I won't touch anything unholy with it

I see that smile  
I see that smile  
I see that smile on your face  
  
We hear you cry  
We hear you wail  
We see that smile on your face  
  
We see you laugh  
We see you dance  
We take that away every day  
  
We see you cry  
We turn your head  
Then we slap your face  
  
Bow down  
Bow down  
Bow down with your life  
  
Head down  
Head down  
Head down hide that smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
I see you try  
I see you fail  
Some things will never change  
  
We hear you cry  
We hear you wail  
We steal that smile on your face  
  
Bow down  
Bow down  
Bow down with your life  
  
Head down  
Head down  
Head down hide that smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high you've got to smile  
  
Head high  
Head high  
Head high like a song you like

Head injury, head injury, head injury  
You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard  
My hands on my head, your words are like arrows  
My hands on my head, there's permanent damage  
  
Head injury, head injury, head injury  
  
You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail  
You got a fist for me, sure to impale  
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows  
My hand on my head, my mind in shambles  
Head injury

Lyrics by hiro yamamoto  
Music by kim thayil  
Heretic, burn at the stake  
Witch float like a log  
  
Wine from the blade on the night of the full moon  
Voices that call spirits in waiting  
Sharing the drink of the bond  
A broth of roots and charms  
Spells under a twisted tree  
  
Heretic, burn at the cross  
Witch, float like a log  
  
Flask over fire, from cobwebs of cellars  
Turning metal into gold  
A secret till the last word's untold  
  
Accused and convicted  
For nothing I suffer your fear  
Nailed to a burning cross  
Heretic, heretic  

Holy water on the brain  
And I'm losing sleep  
Holy bible on the night stand  
Next to me  
As I'm raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
Trying to take my  
Indigence away from me  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Bloody murder is the best  
I've heard her scream  
Holy devil in the flesh  
Some might believe  
And they take thine  
Majesty so seriously  
It's the big lies  
That are more likely to be believed  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Damn the water if it's life  
You want to drink  
Mind your mother if  
It makes you feel at ease  
As you're raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
It's the big lies that are  
More likely to be believed

And you stare at me  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out  
Like you've been carrying a load  
And you swear to me  
You don't want to be my slave  
  
But you're staring at me  
Like I need to be saved  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Thorns and shroud  
Like it's the coming of the Lord  
And I swear to you  
That I would never feed you pain  
  
But your staring at me  
Like I'm driving the nails  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
And you stare at me  
In your Jesus Christ pose  
Arms held out like it's  
The coming of the Lord  
  
And would it pay you more to walk on water  
Then to wear a crown of thorns  
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich  
Then to bury you poor  
In your Jesus Christ pose

Stretch the bones over my skin  
Stretch the skin over my head  
I'm going to the holy land  
Stretch the marks over my eyes  
Burn the candles deep inside  
Yeah you know where I'm coming from  
  
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me  
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you  
  
Slip down the darkness to the mouth  
Damn the water burn the wine  
I'm going home for the very last time  
  
So throw it away, you don't have to take me  
Make no mistakes I'm what you make me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you  
  
I see you turn around and burning down  
The feeling stars to sink  
I feel the hurt surround me  
Please dissolve me  
She's resolved to be  
  
Heal my wounds without a trace  
Seal my tomb without my face  
I'm going to the lonely place  
  
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me  
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me  
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it  
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you

Heard it from another room  
Eyes were making up just to fall asleep  
Love's like suicide  
Dazed out in a garden bed  
With a broken neck lays my broken gift  
Just like suicide  
  
And my last ditch  
Was my last brick  
Lent to finish her  
Finish her  
  
Bit down on the bullet now  
I had a taste so sour  
I had to think of something sweet  
Love's like suicide  
Safe outside my gilded cage  
With an ounce of pain  
I wield a ton of rage  
Just like suicide  
  
With eyes of blood  
And bitter blue  
How I feel for you  
I feel for you  
  
She lived like a murder  
How she'd fly so sweetly  
She lived like a murder  
But she died  
Just like suicide

Tears of the feeble  
Hands of the Slaves  
Skin of the mothers  
Mouths of the babes  
Building the towers  
Belongs to the sky  
When the whole thing  
Comes crashing down  
Don't ask me why  
  
Under the shelf  
The shelf of the sky  
Two eyes, two suns  
Too heavenly blinds  
Swallowing rivers  
Belongs to the sea  
When the whole thing washes away  
Don't run to me  
  
I'll be going down  
For the rest of the slide  
While the rest of you  
Harvest the gold  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall  
  
Under the red  
Break of the lights  
Heroes in the stretches  
Inch to the site  
Blowing the pieces  
Belong to the wind  
When the whole thing  
Blows away  
I won't pretend  
  
I'll be going down  
For the rest of the slide  
While the rest of you  
Harvest the souls  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall  
  
Behind the blood red break of the lights  
Lies the wreck of you for the rest  
Of your life  
  
And the wreck of you  
Is the death of you all  
And the wreck of you  
Is the break  
And the fall  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the death of you all  
I'm the wreck of you  
I'm the break and the fall

Little Joe, run for the border  
Leave your home  
Go where the reptiles roam  
On the side of the border that is your home  
  
Little Joe, eyes of your lover look back on you  
As you run for cover  
Though stick and fire and may break your bones  
There's a light in the tunnel that leads you home  
  
Little Joe, just like your father  
Your eyes will water, your guts will splatter  
Though sticks and fire, sticks and fire  
Won't break your bones, it is a lie  
  
Little Joe, run for the border  
Leave your mother and father  
Go to where the reptiles roam  
They're waiting for you, Little Joe

What if all you understand,  
Could fit into the center of our hand,  
Then you found it wasn't you,  
Who held the sum of everything you knew,  
  
We're insane but not alone,  
You hold on,  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise, (Oh yeah)  
What if the one thing that I missed,  
Was everything I need to pass the test,  
And if I fail what happens then,  
Can I still count on you as a friend  
  
We're insane but not alone,  
You hold on,  
And their gone  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise  
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again  
  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
Like the sun we will live and die,  
And then ignite again,  
Like the sun we will live to rise,  
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

There's no time to keep it low  
I've been deaf now I want noise  
You stay down  
But I won't be quiet  
I'll hammer on until you fight  
  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
  
If you've got some time to kill  
Slow resistance wins the war  
Well I know  
But that's no way to go  
You can't resist the louder pull  
  
Well that's right  
I want something to explode  
I've been deaf  
Now I want noise

Hello don't you know me  
I'm the dirt beneath your feet  
The most important fool you forgot to see  
I've seen how you give it  
Now I want you to receive  
I know that you  
Would do the same for me  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way  
  
For all of your kisses turned  
To spit in my face  
For all that reminds me  
Which is my place  
For all of the times when  
You made me disappear  
This time I'm sure you will  
Know that I'm here  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way  
  
My place was beneath you  
But now I'm above  
And now I send you a message  
Of love  
A simple remind of what  
You won't see  
A future so holy without me  
  
I'm know I'm headed for the bottom  
But I'm riding you all the way

Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Break, if you like the sound  
If it gets you up  
If it brings you down  
  
Share, if it makes you sleep  
If it sets you free  
If it helps to breath  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Pray, if you want to pray  
If you like to kneel  
If you like to lay  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave

I don't care if it takes some time  
I'm gonna make it right  
I'm gonna make it right  
  
Turn the head three hundred and sixty degrees  
Bite the hand that feeds  
I don't care if it tasted like Poisson  
Rip the legs from the thighs  
Feed the prison, open the eyes  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
I'm gonna feed the prison, feed the prison  
  
Color in the lakes of red  
Pile of bones for my bed  
I'm gonna take some time, I'm gonna take some time  
[mystery scream]  
Feed the prison  
Not a tear will be shed  
The only color is red, red  
I don't care if it takes some time  
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right  
Turn the head three hundred and sixty degrees  
Bite the hand that feeds  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
Feed the prison and open the eyes  
  
Not a tear will be shed  
The only color is red  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
I'm gonna feed the prison  
I'm gonna feed the prison  
I'm gonna feed it

I had a dog he was a mix  
He loved me like a God  
But I was just a kid  
The kind mother likes  
Now I'm big like the sky  
And I'm down sized inside  
I'll put this all to rest  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
I'm getting all depressed  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
I got my father's sense  
And my big brother's pants  
And I look like a man  
And I feel like an ant  
Just a speck on the ground  
Growing like a weed  
A fleck of a seed  
  
I'll put my hand in flames  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
Feels like I'm born again  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
And I'll keep hanging from your hair  
And I'll keep playing in the sand  
Just as long as I can

When new damage comes  
It's faceless poison  
A new world order  
It's new damage done  
  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
Get out before you drown  
  
When new damage comes  
It's a word of plague  
A new world order  
A new world for hate  
  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown

I've got war on my mind blood on my hands  
And love on my head  
So open your hands open your mouth  
Let it be said  
You know I've got it made in my mind  
Don't waste my time it's not going to change  
So say what you want spit it out loud  
  
And I'll pay no attention  
  
They're gonna tell you where to walk  
When to smile and just what to say  
They say have your own flu  
Make your own mind  
And don't make waves  
But if you got a handful of change  
Don't throw it away it's gonna come  
So say what you want, suck all my  
Suck on my brain

Watch for vipers and poison snakes  
Feeling fingers make no mistake  
Grabbing that pull your hair  
Stealing everything there, everything  
  
Restless widow in the dark  
Careless looks for a spark  
Near the trap fate rears it's head  
No hesitation, victim dead  
Just from the start it's the end  
  
And it's all the same in the end  
It's all the same in the end  
  
Spider moving up your wall  
To the ceiling he slowly crawls  
Weaves a web above your bed  
Egg that cracks falls on your head  
  
And it's all the same  
It's all the same  
No hesitation, victim dead  
Just from the start it's the end  
  
No wrong no right or guilt admission  
It's all the same  
You've been bitten, you've been bitten

Come on in and take me on an override  
Been stuck inside and up all night at Dave's  
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage  
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
Close the door and pull the shades  
And climb the walls  
Feel medicine heal the lines of age  
I'm here and now I'm gone  
I'm there and far beyond  
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
I'm on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the (spire) why  
On and connected I'm over floating now  
I'm over floating alone  
  
Hold the potion up  
Tear your shadow down  
Remember to forget and then rename your shame  
  
I want to make it right  
  
I'm on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the (spire) why  
On and connected I'm over floating now  
I'm over floating alone

I want to be  
A cowboy star upon the screen  
Oh hey and I want to drive  
My cowboy car across the scene  
  
Oh hey and I want to write  
The magazines the housewives read  
And I want to be  
In control of everything  
I want to be King  
  
I want to make the toys  
You buy for Christmas Eve  
Yeah and I want to be  
The father of the ethnic child  
Who stars on T.V.  
  
Oh yeah and I, I want to write  
The magazine the housewives read  
  
Oh hey and I want all the leaders  
Of the Third World  
To answer to me  
  
I want to be King  
I want to be King  
So maybe now the Pope  
Will bow and kiss my ring  
I want to be King

I caught the moon today  
Pick it up  
And throw it away all right  
I got the perfect steal  
A cleaner love  
With a dirty feel all right  
Fall out and take the bait  
Eat the fruit  
And kiss the snake goodnight  
  
Common ruse dirty face  
Pretty noose is pretty hate  
And I don't like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
Let your motor race  
Pick it up  
And get this mother gone  
Out from and far away  
The wooden snake  
This thing has got me on  
  
Diamond rope silver chain  
Pretty noose is a pretty pain  
And I don't like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
I don't care what you got  
I don't care what you need  
I don't want anything  
And I don't like what  
You got me hanging from

Standing with my enemies  
Hung on my horns  
With haste and reverie  
Killing with charm  
  
Only happy when you hurt  
Only deadly in a swarm  
Only healthy in the dirt  
Only empty in your arms  
  
I play, I'm sick and tame  
Drawing the hordes  
I wait, and show the lame  
The meaning of harm  
The skull beneath my feet  
Like feathers in sand  
I graze among the graves  
A feeling of peace  
  
Only bending when you break  
Only feeding when you're cold  
Only healing when you ache  
Only feeling when you don't

Listen, hear he is inside  
One who lives while others lie  
I close my eyes and walk a thousand years  
A thousand years that aren't mine  
It seems he's near me when I walk  
One who loved what love denied  
He lives these years that I walk blind  
All these years can not be mine  
  
Tomorrow begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
  
A thousand doors a thousand lies  
Rooms a thousand years wide  
He walks in the cold sun and wind  
All these years can not begin  
  
Tomorrow begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow  
Begat tomorrow

Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Moving is breathing and breathing is life  
Stopping is dying  
You'll be alright  
Life is a hammer waiting to drop  
Drifting the shallows and the rowing won't stop  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Can't see the sky, nothing's on the horizon  
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps risin'  
Can't fall asleep 'cause I wake up dead  
I just keep polling, I just keep rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Rowing is living and living is hard  
But living beats losing all that we are  
All that we know of, and all that we feel  
All we remember, imagine the real  
All we remember, imagine the real  
  
Hey!  
  
I heard an echo but the answer had changed  
From the word I remembered  
That I started out sayin'  
Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars  
The current is leaving  
I'll get mine  
You get yours  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Hey!  
  
Rowing is bleeding, bleeding is breathing  
Breathing is feeling, running, and freezing  
We're getting dirty but I started out clean  
  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing  
Keep on rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row

You wired me awake  
And hit me with a hand of broken nails  
You tied my lead and pulled my chain  
To watch my blood begin t boil  
  
But I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Too cold to start a fire  
I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones  
I'll take the river down to still water  
And ride a pack of dogs  
  
I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Hits like a Phillips head  
Into my brain  
It's gonna be too dark  
To sleep again  
Cutting my teeth on bars  
And rusty chains, I'm gonna break my  
Rusty cage and run  
  
When the forest burns  
Along the road  
Like God's eyes  
In my headlights  
When the dogs are looking  
For their bones  
And it's raining icepicks  
On your steel shore  
  
I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run

Painted blue across my eyes  
And tied the linen on  
And I'm on my way  
Looking for the paradigm  
So I can pass it off  
Is it on my side  
  
Is to the sky  
Looking to the sky and down  
Searching for a ground  
With my good eye closed  
  
If I took you for a ride  
Would you take it wrong  
Or would you make it right  
Looking for a pedestal  
That I can put you on  
And be on my way  
  
Is it to the sky  
Looking to the sky and down  
Searching for a ground  
With my good eye closed  
  
Stop you're trying to bruise my mind  
I can do it on my own  
Stop you're trying to kill my time  
It's been my death since I was born  
I don't remember have the time  
If I'm hiding or I'm lost  
But I'm on my way

Written by ben shepherd  
I woke up in a burning house  
I was nailed down to the floor  
I looked outside my window  
And there is going to be a July snow  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go  
  
This guy once said  
That the tires only flat on the bottom  
But that guy wound up dead  
When his girlfriends daddy shot him  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go  
  
The leaf that fell the tree  
The straw that broke the camels back  
My daddy spilled his cup in the river  
And that was enough to break the dam  
  
Show me  
Show me  
Show me the go  

I wish a wish I dream to dream  
I try to try and I live to live  
And die to die and I cry to cry  
But I know why  
  
Somewhere in my dreams  
Things that should  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for the dead  
In laughs of love  
  
From the likes of her  
To time of me  
Like to moon to earth  
Or the sky to sea  
Only were no longer  
Allowed to be, to be  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
Of those who should  
Live in all the keeps  
Echo all the worlds  
In laughs of love  
  
For times that pass my life  
I'll search for the sky  
That she wonders by  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
That the skies hold  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for her bed  
In laughs of love

Feel the rhythm with your hands  
Steal the rhythm while you can, Spoonman  
Speak the rhythm on your own  
Speak the rhythm all alone, Spoonman  
  
Spoonman, come together with your hands  
Save me, I'm together with your plan  
Save me  
  
All my friends are Indians  
All my friends are brown and red, Spoonman  
All my friends are skeletons  
They beat the rhythm with their bones, Spoonman  
  
Feel the rhythm with you hands  
Steal the rhythm while you can, Spoonman  
  
Thank you, good night people

I'm not stoned but I wanted to tell ya  
When I'm in the mood, I could think of playing there  
Going to Seattle where the rock's so heavy  
With all them sex dogs in my Chevy  
  
At the XTC, party, everybody's invited  
Cool! give it dude, we're plastic like you  
Going to a show, rock's all night  
And everyone I hate is at the party tonight  
I said Sub Pop Rock City  
  
Hello  
(Jonathan Poneman) This is Jonathan  
Hey Jon  
(JP) I just want to know, what the heck's going on?  
Well you know, I have this problem  
(JP) What the heck's going on?  
Yah, okay, well do you think you'd have too much trouble if we got rid of  
our sideburns?  
(JP) At your earliest convenience  
Well, I know you've said that before, but do you think Bruce would mind?  
(Bruce Pavitt) This is Bruce Pavitt  
Bruce, I mean, kay, could we have our dollar back Bruce?  
(BP) Bye

If this isn't what you see  
It doesn't make you blind  
If this doesn't make you feel  
It doesn't mean you've died  
Where the river's high  
Where the river's high  
  
If you don't want to be seen  
Well you don't have to hide  
And if you don't want to believe  
Well you don't have to try  
To feel alive  
  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Alive in the superunknown  
Alive in the superunknown  
Alive in the superunknown  
First it steals your mind  
And then it steals your soul  
  
If this doesn't make you free  
It doesn't mean you're tied  
If this doesn't take you down  
It doesn't mean you're high  
If this doesn't make you smile  
You don't have to cry  
If this isn't making sense  
It doesn't make it lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get yourself afraid  
Get yourself alone  
Get yourself contained  
Get yourself control  
  
[Chorus]

She looked at me with dignity  
She said there's something you gotta see  
Even though this country's headed for war  
This nation is prouder than ever before  
  
Yeah that was spirit in the air  
We're more American than anywhere  
And I just smile cause I could tell  
This little girl was going to  
Hell  
  
Now I wouldn't mind  
If you swallowed my pride  
Make me feel alright  
Yeah now deep inside  
Feel alright  
  
Hey, all the warmth in her heart  
Couldn't keep my blood from running cold  
Cause I fell for her looks  
Now I want to go for her throne  
I tried to tell her a thousand times  
But little girl didn't understand at all  
  
Now I wouldn't mind  
If you swallow my pride  
Make me feel alright  
Yeah now deep inside  
Feel alright  
  
Alright  
You can swallow my pride  
  
Now I wouldn't mind  
If you swallowed my pride  
Make me feel alright, deep inside  
Feel alright  
Pride... pride... pride  
You can swallow my pride

Hey you slave, go hang your owners  
Draw your names among their ashes  
Lay your children on their thrones  
Gather 'round and fall right down  
  
Here at sundown nothing is when  
Everything is all right  
Switch opens  
Opening around and let's the garden rise  
Switch is on  
  
Hey, you patients  
Where's your surgeon  
Left with your  
Insides open  
Hung your hearts out  
On the table  
Gather 'round and fall right down  
  
Feel the air now  
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine  
Switch opens  
Nothing is when everything is all right  
Switch is on

Though I can't put my hands on you I can feel you now  
In the bones and the blood flowing needles on the ground  
In the ether I sail to you floating on the fumes  
Run aground on the shore for you simple wreckage  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
  
Though I can't put a name on you I will cry it out  
In my heart I will hold what my bloody hands have dropped  
Run aground on the floor for you simple wreckage  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
In your ghost light  
  
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow  
I only know I've made it home when I drown in your ghost light  
  
In your ghost light  
  
Taree! Taree! Taree!

I'm sittin' in a magic hat  
With smoke and mirrors  
And tire rubber fires  
Watch me disappear  
What made it slow you down  
Sucking on a ball and chain  
Another motherfucker goes down the drain  
Hard headed fuck you all  
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll  
  
Sick in the head sick in the mouth  
And I can't hear a word you say  
Not a bit, and I don't give a shit  
I got the glass, I got the steel  
I got the love to hate  
All I need is your head on a stake  
Hard headed fuck you all  
Just add it on the hot rod death toll

You hide your eyes  
But the ugly truth  
Just loves to give it away  
You gave yourself  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
You share but money can't give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away  
  
I painted my eyes  
Ugly isn't what I want to see  
I painted my mind  
Ugly isn't what I want to be  
  
I don't mind but the truth  
Don't look that good on me  
Throw it away  
  
I don't think I really  
Understand you  
And I can't see why  
I'd ever want to  
  
And even if it isn't mine to say  
I'll say it anyway  
It's ugly  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
But money can't give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away

Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everything's been discovered  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But it's only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
There's nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Hey Mr. Shame  
Have you got a name  
I don't feel like calling you Buddy  
I don't want to hear your story  
I don't want to hear why  
And I don't even care if you're sorry  
  
Many secrets have you  
Many secrets you have  
But it's only a matter of time  
Did you finally decide  
There's nowhere to hide  
And really no reason why  
  
Strong is your body  
Strong are your bones  
Strong as your bloody lie is uncovered  
  
Small creature are you  
Small creature you are  
How quickly you are uncovered  
Naked and cold  
Mumbling and crying  
Knowing everything's been discovered

From the start of life  
To your dying day  
In the dark of night  
And in the burning light of day  
  
It's a bloody fight  
And you can't walk away  
There's no rest in sight  
And I struggle just to slave  
  
I'm tired of living on the front line  
Of this  
  
[Chorus]  
Unholy war, unholy war  
We try, we fight, until we die  
Unholy war, unholy war  
You see, you know, you'll always be  
Unholy  
  
I see your burning fuse  
From a mile away  
You take the world's abuse  
Then you bow your head in shame  
  
You gotta learn to bite the hand  
That pulls your chain  
There's too much sanity  
It will make you go insane  
  
I'll fight when we're all on the same side  
Of this  
Unholy war, unholy war  
We try to fight until we die  
  
Unholy  
When you're all alone - Unholy  
With your thoughts of pain - Unholy  
You're a burning fuse - Unholy  
  
Can you break the strings? - Unholy  
You're shaking in your boots  
You met your end today (?)  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll see we've all got hell to pay  
And we got battle wounds  
In the lion's cage  
We'll all be W's  
  
Beneath the numbers on the page (?)  
As we cry 'til the battle is over

I think I know the answer  
I stumbled on and all the world fell down  
And all the sky went silent  
Cracked like glass and slowly  
Tumbled to the ground  
They all say if you look hard  
You'll find your way back home  
Born without a friend  
And bound to die alone  
  
I'm thinking of your highness  
And crying long upon the loss  
I've found  
And on the plus and minus  
zero chance of ever  
Turning this around  
  
Why doesn't anyone believe  
In loneliness  
Stand up and everyone will see  
Your holiness  
  
They say if you look hard  
You'll find your way back home  
Born without a friend  
And bound to die alone
