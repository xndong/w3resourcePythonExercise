Do you hear the thunder  
Raging in the sky?  
Premonition of a  
Shattered world that's gonna die  
  
In the Age of Reason  
how do we survive?  
The protocols of evil  
Ravaging so many lives?  
So many lives  
So many lives  
  
Mystifying silence  
Talking Peace on Earth  
We should judge each other  
For ourselves not what we're worth  
  
Sustainable extinction  
A fractured human race  
A jaded revolution  
Disappears without a trace  
without a trace  
without a trace  
Alrigth yeah  
  
Always felt that there'd be trouble  
Mass distraction hides the truth  
Prozac days and sleepless hours  
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit  
  
oh yeah,  
these time are heavy  
And you're all alone  
The battle's over  
But the war goes on  
  
Politics, religion  
Love of money too  
It's what the world was built for  
But not for me and you, oh yeah

Super animation, turning on a nation  
And they're saying:  
"All moving parts stand still"  
Since he was elected  
Adrenaline injected  
Hear him saying:  
"All moving parts should kill"  
Just like the hero  
He's got them all on the run  
Yes, he's won, yeah, yeah  
Since he passed the motion  
They're building in the ocean  
And he's saying all men  
Should all be free  
What a combination, peace and radiation  
And he's saying free men  
Should fight for me  
Just like his mammal  
He seems to get his pleasure  
From pain and the rain  
Ain't that strange?  
Very strange, yeah!  
I like choking toys  
You've got to see me before  
You meet the boys  
Teacher's burnt the school  
He's had enough of sticking  
To the rules, alright  
People stop and see  
He's got to be more decadent than me  
Just to pass the time  
He gets his kicks from  
Licking off the wine  
Pretty silly ladies  
All Cynthia's and Sadie's  
Call him on and he  
Takes their numbers down  
Says he is a woman  
I should have seen it coming  
And she's saying  
She's married to a clown  
Just like a lady  
She'll keep guessing  
Through the night  
Not tonight, well, I might, oh, alright, yeah!

There's no end, there's no beginning  
To the old man's story  
Does he still remember me  
From lives gone by  
Oh I see his spirit rising  
Upon the back of time  
I've got nowhere to hide  
Will he keep a place for me  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternity's wings  
  
In his eyes an ocean's burning  
Swollen seas of tears  
Troubled mind the beating  
War drums in his ears  
No one ever hears his warning  
Am I the one he calls  
When they tell me they're afraid  
Some say I'll be put away  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternity's wings  
My blood will spill my blood  
  
My blood will spill my blood  
  
In the wisdom of the prophet's  
Never ending tale  
Open up the eyes  
Within your mind, he says  
Crowned in his ancient glory  
There's a king within us all  
Some will say it's all in vain  
That he doesn't have a name  
  
He is the king of all kings  
The keeper of light  
He holds eternity's wings

I still remember how it used to be  
I thought the only thing  
That mattered was me  
You always told me it was just insane  
  
To feel such joy  
While others feel pain  
There's no way to change this angry heart  
'Cause when love goes  
  
It will tear you apart  
And it's been this way since time began  
It's a desperate search for a promised land  
And the years slip by like so much sand  
  
So many people who are dying to live  
It tortures my heart  
They've got so much to give  
I never saw it as a battle before  
  
To win the fight  
There has to be more  
And there's no way to change this angry heart  
'Cause all these fears  
  
Will tear you apart  
And it's been this way since time began  
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man  
To live each day and never understand  
  
And it's been this way since time began  
It's a desperate search for a master plan  
And the years slip by like water through your hands

Can you see me, are you near me?  
Can you hear me crying out for life?  
Can you tell me, where's the glory?  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When it's over you'll find the answer  
Running in the whispering rain  
Anno Mundi? can you wonder!  
Truth of thunder, life or blame  
  
Do you see a vision of a perfect place?  
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?  
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?  
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?  
There are people laughing  
They're all laughing on you  
If only they could see what you're saying is true  
Still generals fighting, making war on the world  
Don't they know, don't they know?  
No, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
The wind in the night blows cold  
Your eyes are burning  
As the sands of our time grow old  
Anno Mundi  
  
Do you follow the path that so many tread?  
Are you among the blind so easily lead?  
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?  
Depend on another to fight it alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you see me now, can you hear me now?  
Can you tell me, where's the glory?  
Ride the days and sail the nights  
When it's over, you'll find the answer  
Runnin' in the rain  
  
There's a hope that's growing and a vision too  
All those angry hearts now reach out for you  
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?  
No longer the fool, the vision is done

We are the star demons, reaching out yeah,  
We want to touch your world,  
We are the dream makers, pure and sweet yeah.  
We're gonna change your world.  
  
When you're tired of giving reasons  
And freedom fighting freedom  
If you're searching for an answer,  
We can bring you back to Eden.  
  
There's no need for pain and anger,  
The power of peace can destroy the gun.  
Leave behind man's vanity yeah,  
And living life on the run.  
  
When you're tired of giving reasons  
And freedom fighting freedom  
If you're searching for an answer,  
We can bring you back to Eden.  
  
Is god forgiving, is this the final warning,  
Watching as the future turns.  
Science fiction, real life addiction.  
The human race will never learn.  
  
When you're tired of giving reasons  
And freedom fighting freedom  
If you're searching for an answer,  
We can bring you back to Eden.

Precious cups within the flower  
Deadly petals with strange power  
Faces shine a deadly smile  
Back up on you at your trial  
Chill and numbs from head to toe  
Icy sun with frosty glow  
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?  
Why'd you go read no tomorrow  
Feel your spirit rise with the priest  
Feel your body falling to its knees  
Take your walk of remorse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Take your body to a corpse  
If you want all remorse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Now from darkness, there springs light  
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright  
Wall of Sleep is lying broken  
Sun shines in, you are awoken

Oh the devil is rising with the moon  
He cries and my blood runs cold.  
Oh no never was the darkness so black,  
No light and nowhere to go.  
  
My spirit is crying for a love  
So tired of being alone.  
I remember He came here to steal,  
And You are His stealer of souls.  
  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it's calling out my name.  
Oh it's calling my name.  
  
I've been blinded, lost and confused,  
Darkness will call me no more.  
Heaven is no friend of mine,  
No god ever knocked on my door.  
  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it's calling out my name.  
Oh it's calling my name.  
  
I'm standing on the dark side of time  
Reaching for the power of Her hand.  
She's weaving an unholy light  
And calls from Lucifer's land.  
  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it's calling out my name.  
An angel of Hell is rising,  
Heaven's no friend of mine.  
  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it's calling out my name,  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it causes so much pain.  
  
An angel of Hell is rising,  
Heaven's no friend of mine.  
I see a Black Moon rising,  
And it's calling out my name.  
  
It's calling my name,  
This spirit's crying for love.  
  
Heaven's no friend of mine.

As you look through my window  
Deep into my room  
At the tapestries all faded  
Their vague and distant glories  
Concealed in the gloom  
The icy fingers of forgotten passions  
Softly brushing my lips  
At the tips of my primitive soul  
  
As you look through my door  
Deep into my room  
Can you feel the mighty wall of power  
It's waiting waiting in the gloom  
The distant shadows of forgotten champions  
Those who live in me still  
And will rise when we challenge and kill  
  
Born again  
You'll be born again  
  
Look at this prince of evil  
Fighting for your mind  
Fighting all priests of shame  
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed  
At the hearts of mutant gods  
Who think we're all the same  
They're controlling our minds  
And they use us for fortune and fame  
  
As you look through my window  
Deep into my room  
At your future and freedom  
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles  
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations  
Softly brushing your lips  
As we rise when we challenge and kill  
  
Born again  
You'll be born again  
  
If you want to be a king for a day  
Just do what I say  
  
Everybody's got to think like a hunter  
Just search for your pray  
  
Be alive through the night and the day  
Just do it my way

I'll play your game  
But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price  
Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last  
The fear inside just up and died  
Time will tell if i am wrong  
It won't be too long  
You thing I'm chasing shadows  
In the dark  
Well I'm not born to lose  
I'm not born to lose  
You curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view  
It won't be too long  
You don't scare me 'cause you're  
Hard to see and it's time  
That you were gone  
It won't be too long  
You think I'm chasing shadows  
In the dark  
Well I'm not born to lose  
You think I'm chasing shadows  
In the dark  
What you gonna do about it now  
What you gonna do about it now  
It won't be too long  
It won't be too long  
It won't be too long  
You think I'm chasing shadows  
In the dark  
What you gonna do about it now  
What you gonna do about it now  
Ain't nothing I can do about it now

Once upon a nightmare  
Once upon a time  
You're running from temptation  
You got lost  
And found that you don't  
Belong to anybody  
You're all the same  
Just another number  
Cross it out  
Whenever you don't behave  
  
Someone got the doctor  
He knows what to do  
Throw some bones and mumble  
The devil's inside of you  
  
It might be contagious  
It might change the plan  
Get back in your tiny boxes  
Even if you can't  
We say you can  
  
Join the congregation  
Everybody's got to get in line and  
We never justify  
The choir sings a never-ending lie  
  
Pre-chorus:  
When you thought you were free  
You didn't need a reason  
No reason to survive  
  
Chorus:  
As the big door closes  
And you waiting for the nail  
Somebody tell the world  
You're buried alive  
  
Once upon a nightmare  
Once upon a time  
You're running from tomorrow  
You got lost  
And found that another  
Day has turned to ashes  
Taken by the wind  
Frozen seeds of sorrow  
Never to begin  
  
Join the celebration  
And everybody's got to get in line and  
We never justify  
The choir sings a never-ending lie  
  
Pre-chorus:  
When you thought you were free  
You did not need a reason  
No reason to survive  
  
Chorus:  
As the big door closes  
And you waiting for the mail  
Somebody tell the world  
You're buried alive  
  
One more nightmare  
Just one more time  
Join the congregation  
Everybody get in line  
  
Celebration  
The choir sings a lie  
As you call  
The hammer falls  
And no one hears you cry  
I'm buried alive

In this last and final hour, you can't hide  
There's nowhere now that you can run  
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light  
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings  
Summon your fears from hell  
  
It's the call of the wild Calling you  
  
In this last macabre hour, witches cry  
And turn to dust before the moon  
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives  
To call the tune of lucifer  
  
It's the call of the wild Calling you  
  
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams  
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seems  
  
All you gotta do now is stay free  
You're the one they turn to when hell screams  
  
Fear of the devil has no place among the brave  
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won  
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light  
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings  
Summon your fears from hell  
  
It's the call of the wild Calling you  
  
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams  
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seems  
  
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams  
Hero, don't believe in fate, it ain't what it seems  
  
Hero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul  
Hero, It's the call of the wild  
Hero, Tearing your soul

How many tears must we cry before learning,  
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.  
  
Why do you believe that we've got something coming,  
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,  
Too far away.  
  
In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,  
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.  
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,  
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.  
  
All I need is understanding and the right to survive,  
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.  
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,  
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.  
Too far away.  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.  
  
How many tears must we cry before learning,  
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,  
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.  
Too far away, too far away, too far away.

Where do you go when your conscience takes over  
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,  
Did you imagine, that no one would notice  
Just a secret to take when you die.  
  
All the world is watching you, every tongue is  
Screaming sinner.  
  
How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep  
Making darkness a place you despise,  
Where is the god, that once was your strength  
Are you sure he was there from the start.  
  
All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide,  
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.  
  
When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie,  
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn  
About the child, he's running wild,  
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,  
We say oh, go to hell.  
  
We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin  
Cardinal sin,  
We point the finger, laugh in your face,  
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race.  
  
Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.

I feel unhappy, I feel so sad  
I've lost the best friend, that I ever had.  
She was my woman, I love her so.  
But it's too late now, I've let her go.  
I'm going through changes.  
I'm going through changes.  
We shared the years, we shared each day.  
In love together, we found a way.  
But soon the world, had it's evil way.  
My heart was blinded, love went astray.  
I'm going through changes.  
I'm going through changes.  
It took so long, to realize.  
And I can still hear her last goodbyes.  
Now all my days, are filled with tears.  
Wish I could go back, and change these years.  
I'm going through changes.  
I'm going through changes

Waiting for the revolution  
New clear vision - Genocide  
Computerize god - It's the new religion  
Program the brain - Not the heartbeat  
  
Onward all you crystal soldiers  
Touch tomorrow - Energize  
Digital dreams  
And you're the next correction  
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it  
  
Take a look at your own reflection  
Right before your eyes  
It turns to steel  
  
There's another side of Heaven  
This way - To technical paradise  
Find it on the other side  
When the walls fall down  
  
Love is automatic pleasure  
Virtual reality  
Terminal hate - It's a calculation  
Send in the child for connection  
  
Take a look at the toys around you  
Right before your eyes  
The toys are real  
  
Midnight confessions  
Never heal the soul  
What you believe is fantasy  
  
Your past is your future  
Left behind  
Lost in time  
Will you surrender?  
  
Waiting for the revolution  
Program the brain  
Not the heartbeat  
  
Deliver us to evil  
Deny us of our faith  
Robotic hearts bleed poison  
On the world we populate  
  
Virtual existence  
With a superhuman mind  
The ultimate creation  
Destroyer of mankind  
  
Termination of our youth  
For we do not compute

Too much near the truth they say  
Keep it 'til another day  
Let them have their little game  
Delusion helps to keep them sane  
  
Let them have their little toys  
Matchbox cars and more kids joys  
Exciting in their plastic ways  
Frozen food in a concrete place  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain  
  
Alright!  
  
I don't know what's happening  
My head's all torn inside  
People say I'm heavy  
They don't know what I hide  
  
Take a life it's going cheap  
Kill someone no one will weep  
Freedom's yours just pay your dues  
We just want your soul to use  
  
Your gonna go insane  
I'm tryin' to save your brain

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine  
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul  
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning  
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah  
  
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever  
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits  
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending  
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air  
  
In dreams I think of you  
I don't know what to do with myself  
Time has let me down  
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,  
the endless search for where you are  
(sail on, sail on)  
  
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine  
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul  
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady  
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!  
  
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!  
Don't leave your heart on the other side!  
Her eyes are an endless flame  
Desire with a special name  
Don't ever fall in love!  
Don't give your heart away!  
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!

Don't come closer, cos it ain't safe here,  
Just turn around now and walk away.  
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,  
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,  
Behind those eyes.  
  
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,  
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,  
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,  
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your  
Hands.  
From a cross of thorns.  
  
Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that  
Ring in my ears.  
We're still waiting, losing patience. Will all the lies  
Of, 400 years.  
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here,  
Sometimes I wonder,  
What goes on there, behind those eyes.  
  
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,  
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,  
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,  
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your  
Hands.  
From a cross of thorns.  
  
We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day,  
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread,  
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once  
Spoke, fade away.  
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.  
  
Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've  
Done,  
It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns.  
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,  
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of  
Thorns.

Midnight, something don't feel right  
It's been too much, too far away from home  
Hard life, living the hard life  
I can't resist, I'm falling  
To the danger zone  
  
All day long I'm pushed and shoved  
I just can't get enough  
In the danger zone  
  
Red light, don't stop for no red light  
You know I'm always trouble on my own  
Lonely, ever so lonely  
I've got too much time  
I'm heading for the danger zone  
  
All day long I'm pushed and shoved  
I just can't get enough  
In the danger zone  
  
I'm eager, eager to please  
I can't stand no more  
It's got me on my knees  
  
Ain't gonna feel no hurt  
Ain't gonna feel no pain  
I got nothin' left to lose  
I ain't got no shame  
Don't try to stop me  
Just leave me on my own  
I'm gonna live or die  
In the danger zone  
I'm living in the danger zone  
In the danger zone  
Hard life, I'm living the hard life  
I'm gonna take a chance  
In the danger zone  
Lonely, ever so lonely  
I'm gonna live or die  
In the danger zone4  
Midnight, can't wait until midnight  
Help e I'm falling to the danger zone

A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears  
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears  
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed  
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealed  
  
Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing  
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin  
Yeah, in ruin, yeah  
  
You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul  
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole  
Indoctrination by a twisted desire  
The catechism of an evil messiah  
  
Dear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing  
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin  
Yeah, in ruin, yeah  
  
Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy  
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy  
You have taken my life  
Now it's your turn to die  
  
Can you sleep at night? when you close your eyes  
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?  
Or do you deny you're responsible  
For the victims of the sins you devised?  
  
What you gonna tell them when they ask you? well then  
Is your conscience pure in your heart?  
There is no exemption when you seek redemption  
For all the lives that you've torn apart  
  
Your molestations of the cross you defiled  
A man once holy now despised and reviled  
You took possession while confessing my sins  
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah  
  
Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing  
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah  
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah  
In ruin yeah

Silence is mocking, the dawn of a new day  
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way  
The Evil of her nature, collects in her eyes  
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light  
  
Baptised with fire, to wild to be tamed  
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man  
Let no one put asunder, the power or the pain  
He is the master of hell, riding again  
  
Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain  
Devil and Daughter - is this the end  
  
A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind  
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned  
But Satan never listens, to the words that they send  
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end  
  
Devil and Daughter  
He's got the power she's got the pain  
Devil and Daughter  
She'll break any woman and take any man  
Devil and Daughter  
Hand in hand with the reper

The Devil Cried  
  
One fine day in Hell  
The master told a story  
Someone lied so well  
He sent him back to Glory  
  
There are whispers between the screams  
That this deed can be done  
Even sinners must dream  
And I can be the one to make the Devil cry  
  
I can win this game  
If all things come together  
I know this sounds quite strange  
I won't be smart, just clever  
  
It's the law on the other side  
Just the kill lets you run  
And how many have tried?  
I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry  
  
At last my time has come  
I must not give him pleasure  
I can be the one  
One chance or burn forever  
  
So I told him about my pain  
And the life I've been through  
He just smiled and the laughter came  
Then I told him that I love you, and the Devil cried  
  
Tears from his eyes  
Eyes of fire  
And the Devil cried

Yell with the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Your back's to the wall  
Then chain the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,  
You run, you run!  
  
Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:  
You'll never get old  
Life's fantasy, to be locked away and still to think you're free  
You're free, we're free!  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
Die young  
  
Die young, die young  
Can't you see the writing on the wall?  
Die young, gonna die young  
Someone stopped the pain  
  
Goto the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Your back's to the wall  
Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,  
You run, you run!  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young, young!  
Die young, die young!  
Die young, die young, young!  
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!

The neon lights are shining on me again  
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend  
I need a lady to help me to get through the night  
If I could find one then everything would be alright  
  
The sleepy city is dreaming the nigh time away  
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today  
I see a man,he's got take away women for sale  
Yes for sale  
Guess that's the answer  
'cause take away women don't fail  
  
Oh dirty women,they don't mess around  
Oh dirty women,they don't mess around  
You've got me coming  
You've got me going around  
Oh dirty women,  
They don't mess around  
  
Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen  
Gotta be good then everything will be o.k.  
if I could score tonight then I will end up happy  
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day

Let's try getting to the sky  
Hang on or you're going to die  
Sour life can turn sweet  
It's laying at your feet  
Sweet child with an innocent smile  
Watched closely all the while  
Don't be fooled when he cries  
Keep looking at the eyes  
  
Good life is contradiction  
Because of the crucifixion  
If you're ready and have the need  
I will take your soul and plant my seed  
  
You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day  
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away  
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel  
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal  
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs  
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers  
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise  
And icy fingers fan electric lies  
  
We're disturbing the priest  
Won't you please come to our feast  
Do we mind disturbing the priest  
Not at all not at all not in the least  
  
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face  
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace  
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light  
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside  
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away  
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day  
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear  
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near

Is this the end of the beginning?  
Or the beginning of the end?  
Losing control or are you winning?  
Is your life real or just pretend?  
  
Reanimation of the sequence  
Rewinds the future to the past  
To find the source of the solution  
The system has to be recast  
  
Release your mind  
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul  
Your life's on overload  
Is this your fate?  
  
Will you decide what makes you an entity  
That's your identity  
Well if you don't know  
Which way to go  
  
You might be lost and confused  
A second chance no time to lose  
  
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul  
Transforming time and space beyond control  
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate  
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late  
  
You don't want to be a robot ghost  
Occupied inside a human host  
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly  
Synthesized until they set you free  
  
Alright-okay, alright  
Till they set you free  
Alright-okay  
Till they set you free  
  
I don't want to see you, yeah  
I don't want to see you, yeah

No one said it had to be this way  
Why are we the victims of their final word  
  
Dying world is killing us so slowly  
I believe no god may save us now  
  
Can't you see what I see  
Sinners say your prayers tonight  
Your judgment day is here  
Child tomorrow will die, not even  
Born jesus our questions  
He never seems to hear  
Dying for the answers may be  
The price we pay, to find the  
Key to our lives  
Is there a heaven is there a hell  
Who's this god, tell me there's  
No god above, why  
We chose what lord, deep  
Within our souls  
He's not one thing  
We are his spirit  
We could save this world  
From destruction day  
Can't you see what I see  
  
You and I victims of their word  
As the masters of power  
Try to poison our world  
  
Greed money taken over  
Their souls, you're  
Just mechanical brains  
Politicians don't know  
Just don't know  
We can chance this world we  
Live in, don't let it die

Something about the way that you look on me,  
You watch every move, every word, every fantasy,  
Got no time for love, there's something on your mind,  
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside.  
  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
People say the woman's got an evil eye.  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.  
  
I turn away but still I see that evil stare,  
Trapped inside my dreams I know you're there.  
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all,  
First inside my head, then inside my soul.  
  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
People say the woman's got an evil eye.  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.

I've seen a look of evil in your eyes  
You've been filling me all full of lies  
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds  
Do well best, someone else has better seen  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
  
Now I know just what you're looking for  
You want me to claim that child you bore  
Well you know that it must he not be  
And you know the way it got to be  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
  
Wickedness lies in your moisten lips  
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip  
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed  
Do you whish that you could see me dead  
  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me  
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

I think about closing the door  
And lately I think of it more  
I'm living well out of my time  
I feel like I'm losing my mind  
  
I should be at the table round  
A servant of the crown  
The keeper of the sign  
To sparkle and to shine  
  
Never, no never again!  
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can  
Never, this is the end  
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man  
Help me, tell me I'm sane  
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain  
Save me, take me away  
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!  
  
I've got to be strong  
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world  
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!  
We are falling off the edge of the world!  
  
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!  
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done  
Over, it's over at last  
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past  
  
We're falling off the edge of the world!  
Yes, the edge of the world!  
It's the end of the world!

The chapter is opened and the pages are turned  
The writting say many things but who was concerned  
  
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?  
When it's lost gone forever  
  
For years they told me what I should to do  
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to  
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth  
And it feels good to me  
  
The world is turnin'  
Forever turnin'  
Forever yearnin'  
For the love of life  
And you're wrong if think that I'm afraid to love  
  
I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you  
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?  
  
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?  
When it's lost it's gone forever  
  
It feels good to me, etc.

If I had to live again, I'd change everything,  
'Cause everything I do, you know that I can't win.  
You say it isn't right, but you say it isn't wrong,  
How the hell am I supposed to please everyone.  
  
Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do.  
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you,  
You said it isn't right, but you said it isn't wrong.  
I wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
  
You know it's gonna get you now, and you know it starts to bring you down.  
  
Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do,  
I ain't here for everybody, but I ain't here for you,  
It seems I have to fight, for all the things I want,  
Wish somebody could tell me what it is that I've done wrong.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
  
It's forbidden.  
  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
The best things in live aren't given, these things ain't for you and me,  
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.  
Makes me wonder what you see.

The horizon breaks, where a figure stands  
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command  
  
[Chorus]  
He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
  
He newer speaks, but his task we're told  
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silver mountains won't save you from hell  
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell  
Oh your weakness your past  
The Lawmaker comes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's the Lawmaker

Winged with steel they fill the air  
The soldiers of fortune will ride  
In the sights of the enemy's gun  
Those who have taken their oaths tonight  
Are well prepared they know they'll  
Do or die even if it's suicide  
  
Let's take a chance  
As the skies will Burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return  
  
Dressed to kill where eagles dare  
The fate of a nation's at hand  
Is this the answer to the prayers  
Come the dawn, through the blood  
Red skies return with tears  
In their eyes, and they  
Recall thou shalt not kill  
  
And in the morning  
They'll take a hero's bow  
And make the ever lasting flight  
  
Hear them calling up above all  
Across the skies  
Hear them calling up above from  
The other side  
  
Here them call!  
  
Let's take a chance  
As the skies will burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return  
  
Let's take a chance  
As the skies will burn tonite  
Wasted lives and spirits run free  
On the wings of no return

Watching the universe at the end of another day  
Fatalistic ships froma distant shore  
In the back of my mind I could see she was standing there  
Like the feeling you have  
When you've been there before  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was as cold as the day, yeah  
She said I'd got it coming  
And then she took me away, yeah  
  
She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream  
I thought it's over me, she wasn't all she seemed  
  
She took my hand and then she started to speak  
She told me she'd had the call  
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul  
She looked into her crystal ball  
She read my fortune then she read my mind  
She didn't like my thoughts at all  
  
She showed me shadows, a spectre of life  
My soul just wanted to scream  
She stared so deeply into my eyes  
That's when I fell into a dream  
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me  
And she read me with her eyes, she said  
  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now, now, now  
  
Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag  
You are the queen of all hell  
You took my body,now you're wasting my soul  
You've got me under your spell  
And as the sun shines on another day  
You're gonna take my mind as well,it's over  
  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy

Livin' in the fast lane is easy  
Till you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When you're out of control  
A slip of the tongue when  
It's done, is often hard to  
See it through  
So never let your words be lies  
Or they'll come looking for you  
  
It's a hard life to love  
  
For the price of glory you left  
And threw your fortunes away  
Never really cared too much for  
The job or the pay  
  
You're standing in the rain with  
No cover but you never complain  
You're an angry young man face to  
Face but your mirrors insane  
It's a hard life to love  
  
I'm simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And you're simply denying the fact  
That you're blind and I see no more  
I see red - I only see red  
  
Think of all the times I was  
Hurting but you felt no pain  
Think of all the lies you told me  
Again and again  
And still you see the truth  
From those who continue to lie  
And now you're seeking life  
From those who are living to die  
It's a hard life to love  
  
I'm simply refusing a part in your world  
And I see how it burns  
See how it burns  
And you're simply denying the fact  
That you're blind and I see no more  
I see red - I only see red  
  
Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy  
When you run out of road  
Friends will turn to strangers  
When you've nowhere to go  
Don't give a damn when you're lost  
Cause you'll die from it all  
Laws were made to be broken  
And you do it for the thrill of it all  
It's a hard life to love  
It's a hard life to love

Old men crying, young men dying  
World still turns as Father Time looks on  
On and on  
Children playing, dreamers praying  
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone  
Has it gone?  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Oh, it's a hard road  
  
Whirlwind churning, lovers learning  
On this path of life we can't back down  
Is it wrong?  
Widows weeping, babies sleeping  
Life becomes the singer and the song  
Sing along  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Carry your own load  
  
Why make the hard road?  
Why can't we be friends?  
No need to hurry  
We'll meet in the end  
  
Why make the hard road?  
Why can't we be friends?  
No need to worry  
Let's sing it again  
  
Brother's sharing, mother's caring  
Nightime falling victim to the dawn  
Shadows small  
Days are crawling, time is calling  
To the Earth that not that life has gone  
Love line drawn  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Carry your own load  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Oh, it's a hard road  
  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now

Look through the people, and on through the mist  
To the hill of the headless cross  
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this  
And the power of darkness is host  
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul  
With and Angel that fell from the sky  
Borne on the air, the screams and the wails  
Of the masses appointed to die  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross  
  
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light  
Cut the crucifix half to the ground  
There's been no escape from the power of Satan  
On a nation so brave and so proud  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross  
  
How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key  
And the master is calling your name  
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?  
Does the talisman protect you from pain?  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross  
  
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light  
Cut the crucifix half to the ground  
There's no escaping the power of Satan  
On a nation so brave and so proud  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture, oh no, oh  
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross  
At the Headless Cross, oh, at the Headless Cross  
Where will you run to?  
At the Headless Cross  
Look, to the Headless Cross

In these days of confusion  
You've turned angry and cold  
You say it's an illusion  
There's no fire in your soul  
  
Say you don't love me  
Say you don't care  
But don't leave me standing here  
Your heart's like a wheel  
  
Just waiting to roll  
It's longing for freedom  
To get out on the road  
You're hungry for something  
  
That you may never find  
So many reasons  
Your love has made you blind  
You say you don't love me  
  
You say you don't care  
So don't leave me standing here  
Don't leave me standing here  
You say you don't love me  
  
You say you don't care  
Don't leave me  
Don't leave me standing here  
Life ain't been easy  
  
Full of passion and pain  
Told me no reason  
Why I was to blame  
Don't leave me standing  
  
Don't leave me standing  
Don't leave me standing  
On my own

Sing me a song, you're a singer  
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil  
The devil is never a maker  
The less that you give, you're a taker  
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell  
Oh well  
  
The lover of life's not a sinner  
The ending is just a beginner  
The closer you get to the meaning  
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming  
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on  
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell  
I can tell  
Fool, fool  
  
Oh uh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion  
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life  
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer  
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on  
  
They say that life's a carousel  
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well  
The world is full of kings and queens  
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams  
It's heaven and hell, oh well  
  
And they'll tell you black is really white  
The moon is just the sun at night  
And when you walk in golden halls  
You get to keep the gold that falls  
It's heaven and hell, oh no  
  
Fool, fool  
You've got to bleed for the dancer  
Fool, fool  
Look for the answer  
Fool, fool, fool

Rising with the sun, the work has been done  
But the people are starting to stare  
Called from the afar to court of the Czar  
Could it be something is wrong?  
  
You stand face to face and your heart gathers place  
For the answer to a question a prize  
If only you had known to be honest was wrong  
For the work that you've done you will pay with your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Into the black where the night  
Never ends and the light  
Leaves a scar on your soul  
Where your heart used to hold  
Your love here!  
Heaven in Black  
  
Inside there's a voice saying was there a choice  
You'd still be entombed in the night  
Lucifer's to blame, the reason for the flame  
They've taken your sight but they'll not take your God  
  
[Chorus]

Take me to the river baby drink my wine  
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line  
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs  
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers  
  
When will you show me a sign  
When will you throw me a line  
  
Help me to the answer baby set me free  
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea  
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face  
Keep me out of trouble and I'm living disgrace  
  
Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name  
Standing in a line with the shadows of fame  
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs  
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers

I am anger  
Under pressure  
Lost it cages  
A prisoner  
The first to escape  
  
I am wicked  
I am legion  
Strength in numbers  
A lie  
The number is one  
  
I, I, I  
Everything that I see is for me  
  
Yes, I am giant  
I'm a monster  
Breaking windows  
In houses  
Buildings of glass  
Rebel rebel  
Holy outlaw  
Ride together  
Don't try it  
The power's in one  
  
I, I, I  
I am standing alone  
But I can rock you  
I, I, I  
  
On the edge of the blade  
But the knife can't cut the hero down  
  
I am virgin  
I'm a whore  
Giving nothing  
The taker  
The maker of war  
I'll smash your face in  
But with a smile  
All together  
You'll never  
Be stronger than me  
  
I, I, I  
Right here on my own  
But I still rock you  
I, I, I  
Don't follow behind  
Just leave me on the outside  
  
I, I, I  
I am standing alone  
But I can shock you  
I, I, I  
On the edge of the blade  
But no one makes the hero bleed  
(No, no, no)  
  
I am hunger  
Feed my head  
All together  
You'll never  
Never make the hero bleed  
(No, no, no )

Across the desert of the burning dark, a  
Darkness which illuminates you,  
There's a place you've always wanted to be,  
Whose pleasures always did escape you,  
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near  
Ever felt so far  
And now it's here within your grasp, a never  
Ending burning says it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future  
Behind you history  
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think  
That's the way it's supposed to be.  
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is  
Lies, oh yeah.  
  
You better run from the holy man, the eyes that  
Will are set uppon you,  
Listen not to verse and prayer, song that thrill  
And voices tempt you  
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has  
Light ever seemed so dark.  
Pilgrims of sabbocracy, hear the hounds of  
Heaven, as they bark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i  
Witness, a dream.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i  
Witness a dream.  
Oh, just a dream.

In the daylight, comes darkness, on the verge of  
Night a fear is born,  
Sweeter than the dream, the reality of you,  
Immaculate, deception.  
  
From the spirit runs poison, and the wheel of  
Fortune is ever still,  
Sweeter than the light, the darkness of your soul,  
Immaculate, deception.  
  
Something has touched, the spirit inside,  
Once there was love now there's a void.  
Nights of deception, ghosts in my mind,  
Am I bewitched, slave to desire.  
  
It's knowing that times keeps rolling on, night after  
Day, day after night,  
It's knowing that feeling of coming home, to where  
My spirit lies.  
  
It's knowing that feeling of coming home, to where  
My spirit lies.

Thunder shattered the dawn  
Raging with fury, the king has come  
The power of terror will reign  
There is no mercy in pleading  
  
In for the kill, no quarter be shown  
Live for the thrill of battle alone  
Blessed by the will to die for the throne  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
Freedom is taken by storm  
The blood on his hands is still running warm  
The power of terror will reign  
There is no mercy in pleading  
In for the kill, no quarter be shown  
Live for the thrill of battle alone  
Blessed by the will to die for the throne  
In for the kill  
For the kill  
  
Thunder shattered the dawn  
Raging with fury, the king has come  
Death and destruction riding the storm  
Blood on his hands still running warm  
  
In for the kill  
The king has come

No one told me the way I should feel  
You left an aching heart  
Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on  
You were the one friend I had  
You gave me so much love  
Now the tears remind me you're gone  
  
It still haunts me there's a silence  
Where you used to be  
It still haunts me  
Just an empty space in history  
It still haunts me  
But life must go on, and on  
  
It's still haunting me  
It's still haunting me  
Haunting me  
Haunting me  
It's still haunting me

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the night sky they blast  
Through the universe the engines whine  
Could it be the end of man and time?  
  
Back on earth the flame of life burns low  
Everywhere is misery and woe  
Pollution kills the air, the land, the sea  
Man prepares to meet his destiny  
  
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the black sky so vast  
Burning metal through the atmosphere  
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear  
  
With the hateful battles raging on  
Rockets flying to the glowing sun  
Through the empires of eternal void  
Freedom from the final suicide  
  
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun  
Escape from brainwashed winds and pollution  
Leave the earth to all it's sin and hate  
Find another world where freedom waits  
  
Past the stars in fields of ancient void  
Through the shields of darkness where they find  
Love upon a land a world unknown  
Where the sons of freedom make their home  
  
Leave the earth - to Satan and his slaves  
Leave them to their future in their graves  
Make a home where love is there to stay  
Peace and happiness in every day.

I am iron man  
Has he lost his mind?  
Can he see or is he blind?  
Can he walk at all,  
Or if he moves will he fall?  
Is he alive or dead?  
Has he thoughts within his head?  
We'll just pass him there  
Why should we even care?  
  
He was turned to steel  
In the great magnetic field  
Where he traveled time  
For the future of mankind  
  
Nobody wants him  
He just stares at the world  
Planning his vengeance  
That he will soon unfold  
  
Now the time is here  
For Iron Man to spread fear  
Vengeance from the grave  
Kills the people he once saved  
  
Nobody wants him  
They just turn their heads  
Nobody helps him  
Now he has his revenge  
  
Heavy boots of lead  
Fills his victims full of dread  
Running as fast as they can  
Iron Man lives again!

Told you once about your friends and neighbours  
They were always seeking but they'll never find it  
It's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Where to go and where to see  
It's always been this way and it can never be  
It's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Give it all and ask no return  
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn  
That's it's alright, yes it's alright  
  
Don't you know that it's so good for you  
You can be making love and see it all go through  
But it's alright, yes it's alright

The highway's screamin', callin' out your name  
'Cause every road that you travel on  
There's a price to pay  
A thousands eyes are starin'  
But the blind still lead the blind  
  
[Chorus]  
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run  
Jerusalem?  
  
You say you walked through the valley  
You say you've seen the signs  
Echoes call you from a distant age  
Or is it in your mind?  
  
Then a thousands souls rise from the sea  
Holding up the sun  
And an angel cries beware your lies'  
It could be the end of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger  
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When an angel cries - Jerusalem  
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem  
When an angel cries - Jerusalem

Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone  
People avoid him, they know the street's his own  
Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild  
Mean as a tiger, society's own child  
  
Those who try to burn him pay  
You don't do that to Johnny Blade  
He's the meanest guy around his town  
One look and he will cut you down  
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade  
  
Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend  
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?  
He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate  
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate  
  
Rivals all across the land  
He kills them with his knife in hand  
He's the meanest guy around his town  
One look and he will cut you down  
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade  
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade  
  
Well you know that Johnny's a spider  
And his web is the city at night  
He's a victim of modern frustration  
That's the reason he's so ready to fight  
  
He's the one that should be afraid  
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?  
  
Oh he knows his future's decided  
And he ain't gonna change it, no way  
He was born to die in the gutter  
He'll keep fighting 'till the end of his days  
  
Been alone all through his life  
His only friend is a switchblade knife  
He's the one who should be afraid  
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?  
  
You fool the people  
Who's fooling who?  
It's time to listen  
The fool is you!

Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears  
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would 'pear  
Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky  
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died  
Yeah!  
  
They're coming home again tomorrow  
I'm sorry it won't be for long  
With all the pain I've watched you live within  
I'll try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye  
  
Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain  
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again  
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything  
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?  
Yeah!  
  
They're coming home again tomorrow  
I'm sorry it won't be for long  
With all the pain I've watched you live within  
I'll try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye  
  
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more  
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure  
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah  
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars  
Yeah!  
  
They're coming home again tomorrow  
I'm sorry it won't be for long  
With all the pain I've watched you live within  
I'll try my hardest not to cry  
When it is time to say goodbye

Sweet woman are you feeling right  
What was it that you did last night  
You made me crazy you made me fly  
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye  
Ooh what's the matter with me?  
I'm just a runner I was born free  
But since I met you I can't leave you alone  
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home  
  
Keep it warm rat the place by your side  
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride  
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone  
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home  
  
D'you hear the rumour that is going around  
Say I'm ruined 'cause I've settled down  
It's not true well maybe half and half  
You know I love you but I still like a laugh  
Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time  
Sweet woman I can't stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong  
  
I'm like a gypsy I need to roam  
But don't worry I'll be coming home  
I need the danger I need the thrill  
I need to know what is over each hill  
Ooh I'm a different man I'm still running but you understand  
Since I met you I can't leave you alone  
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home

Well people look and people stare  
Well I don't think that I even care  
You work your life away and what do they give?  
You're only killing yourself to live  
  
Killing yourself to live  
Killing yourself to live  
  
Just take a look around you what do you see  
Pain, suffering, and misery  
It's not the way that the world was meant  
It's a pity you don't understand  
  
Killing yourself to live  
Killing yourself to live  
  
I'm telling you  
Believe in me  
Nobody else will tell you  
Open your eyes  
And see the lies, oh yeah  
  
You think I'm crazy and baby  
I know that it's true  
Before that you know it I think  
That you'll go crazy too  
  
I don't know if I'm up or down  
Whether black is white or blue is brown  
The colors of my life are all different somehow  
Little boy blue's a big girl now  
  
So you think it's me who's strange  
But you've never had to make the change  
Never give your trust away  
You'll end up paying till your dying day

There's a place just south of Witches' Valley  
Where they say the wind won't blow  
And they only speak in whispers of her name  
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness  
It eats right from her hand  
With a crying shout she'll search you out  
And freeze you where you stand  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil in my mind  
She's queen of the night  
All right!  
In a place just south of Witches' Valley  
Where they say the rain won't fall  
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah  
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness  
She can't face the light  
With an awful shout, she'll find you out  
And have you for the night  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil on my mind  
She's queen of the night  
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley  
Don't dream or close your eyes  
And never trust your shadow in the dark  
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision  
Around  
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found  
Lady Evil, evil  
She's a magical, mystical woman  
Lady Evil, evil on my mind  
She's queen of the night  
She's the queen of sin  
Look out, she'll pull you in!  
Lady wonder!

Well it's a cold world  
And I'm in the middle  
Caught in the in-between  
  
I don't belong here  
So I'm writing to you  
It's wrong here  
Where I'm sending you some  
  
Letters from earth, yeah  
  
Well it's a new world  
And now I'm a stranger  
Stranger than you know  
  
I don't belong here  
And I'm writing to you  
With blood on my hands  
  
What if I send you madness  
What if I send you pain  
And letters from earth, ooh  
All right  
  
Come on it's another game  
But you gotta play on  
Cause they say it's just pretend  
Ask them why they say you'll never, never die  
Come on the game is called the end  
  
Well it's a cold world  
And I'm in the middle  
Caught in the in-between  
  
I don't belong here  
So I'm writing to you  
Hey let me explain  
  
What if I send you confusion  
What is the time and the pain worth  
Oh no no  
I'm only sending  
Letters from the earth  
  
Letters from earth

Writhing and screaming, the pain just won't go  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
Tourted and flaming, you'll give birth to hell  
Living a nightmare  
It is a pity, you'll pray for your death  
But he's in no hurry  
  
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls  
  
[Chorus:]  
Nowhere to run  
Your fate is in his hands  
Your time has come  
You'll live to his command  
I'm warning you  
The worst is yet to come  
The killer who  
Remains a mystery  
  
I that believe in the stories of old  
Would never fight it  
Demons and curses that play on your soul  
Like something ignited  
  
You never imagined such a fate could follow you  
(You never thought it was true)  
And when it's your time I wonder how  
(And what you'll do)  
Your kinds of troubles running deeper than the sea  
(So what you gonna do about it)  
You broke(the rule)  
You've been(a fool)  
The little doll is you, yeah!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Writhing and screaming, the pain just won't go  
He'll show you no mercy  
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try  
Escaping his curses  
  
[Chorus:]

Just before you die  
They say you see your life go flashing by  
Cold dark endless nights  
To burn in hell or bathe in ever light  
  
Well I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't want to die  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
I live inside a lie  
  
Days pass by too soon  
Waiting for the rising of the moon  
No escape from here  
Facing death but is your conscious clear?  
  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
Watching my life go by  
And I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't wanna die  
  
Well I don't wanna live forever  
But I don't want to die  
I may be dreaming or whatever  
I live inside a lie  
  
Don't want to life forever  
But I don't want to die  
Don't want to life forever  
But I don't want to die

He's just a loner  
He never says hello  
A friend to no one  
He's got no place to go  
  
He don't look happy  
He look through furtive eyes  
He ain't got nothing  
No one to sympathize  
Alright now  
  
He hides himself away  
His secrets not revealed  
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed  
  
A solitary man  
An enigmatic child  
A riddle never solved  
A prisoner exiled  
Alright now  
  
I wonder if the loner can assimilate  
A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate  
C'mon now  
  
Has he ever tried to be happy?  
Reached out from inside  
Someone on who he can depend  
It's getting to late to recover  
He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend  
Don't descend  
Don't descend  
Don't descend  
Don't descend  
  
No understanding of things we already know  
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go  
Alright yeah  
  
Communication's an impossibility  
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy  
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head  
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead  
C'mon yeah

It's complete but obsolete  
All tomorrows become yesterday  
In demand but second hand  
It's been heard before you even play  
  
Up to date but came too late  
Better get yourself another name  
You're so right but overnight  
You're the one who has to take the blame  
  
Everyone just gets on top of you  
The pain begins to eat your pride  
You can't believe in anything you knew  
When was the last time that you cried  
  
Don't delay you're in today  
But tomorrow is another dream  
Sunday's star is monday's scar  
Out of date before you're even seen  
  
At the top so quick to flop  
You're so new but rotting in decay  
Like butterfly so quick to die  
But you're only looking for today  
  
Everyone just gets on top of you  
The pain begins to eat your pride  
You can't believe in anything you knew  
When was the last time that you cried  
Looking for today  
  
Glamour trip so soon to slip  
Easy come but oh how quick it goes  
Ten foot tall but what a fall  
Hard to open yet so easy to close  
Front page news but so abused  
You just want to hide yourself away  
Over-paid, but soon you fade  
Because you're only looking for today  
Looking for today

It's a loaded dice, that you throw this time,  
If you turn the Ace, it'll turn out fine,  
When you spin the wheel, and you get your call,  
South of the line, well the loser gets it all.  
  
One too many days, one too many nights,  
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,  
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose.  
  
Every face you see, has the staring eyes  
Every passing glance, makes you realize  
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose.  
  
God knows there's no good time.  
  
Too many days, and too many nights,  
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,  
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose,  
Yeah, yeah, Bad time to lose,  
Bad time to lose, Bad time to lose.

All your life you've been slipping and sliding  
Trying to find a way  
Sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay  
There's no turning back as you look  
The hangman in the eye  
  
Now hell's just your death away  
  
It's too late to say you care  
When there's evil in your stare  
You say you're not to blame  
In your head voices mocking every prayer  
  
Remember the face you saw  
That once was you  
Spirit high there's no way that  
You could lose  
Give him rope they said  
As you look the hangman in the eye  
Now around your neck you feel  
The noose  
  
In your head voices mocking every prayer  
Now you're lost forever  
  
I'm burning with fire it's time to  
Leave or get out  
I'm burning in fire I can't take  
No more so get out  
I'm burning with fire the wheels of  
Steel will grind you  
Burning in fire this time  
You're lost forever  
Lost forever!  
  
There's an evil in your stare  
Lost forever!  
And hell's just a breath away  
You're lost forever  
And there's no way out you burn  
With fire it's time to get out  
Get out, get out  
And there's no way out  
Lost forever

Look all around  
Can't you open your eyes  
Voices are calling  
  
Killing rain falling down from the sky  
Crying with nightmare tears  
  
Out on the street  
You'll see blood on the ground  
Cities are burning  
  
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul  
Goodbye now  
You're caught in his spell  
  
Your freedom is gone  
He's taken everything  
You ever had  
But if you're strong you'll survive  
You've got to hold on  
Open your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Behind the lies you will see  
The master of insanity  
Under the mask there will be  
The master of insanity  
  
Innocent minds  
They're the victims of shame  
Staring in sorrow  
  
Promises lying there  
Broken and crushed  
Confusion-just disappear  
  
What can you give  
To be left all alone  
When there's nothing at all  
  
Your freedom is gone  
He's taken everything  
You ever had  
But if you're strong you'll survive  
You've got to hold on  
Open your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Behind the lies you will find  
He's trying to get inside you  
Just open your eyes and you will see  
The master of insanity  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Between the lies you will find  
that he's trying to get inside you  
Out of the night into your mind  
He's always right beside you  
  
Yeah, between the lies you will see  
The master of insanity  
Open your eyes or you will be  
The master of insanity

The epidemic from a crystal lie  
Puts you in super over drive  
The methademic that is so hard to hide  
Insanely staring with wide eyes  
  
Hellucinating in a chemical Hell  
Ain't my idea of having fun  
Synthetic overload you're under its spell  
Your super nightmare's just begun  
  
You try to stop, but it controls you  
Your love affair with it won't last  
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction  
And in the end you're gonna crash  
  
You live too fast  
You live too fast  
  
You look just like a dead man alive  
Losing the fight for survival  
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate  
Waiting the Devil's arrival  
  
You live so fast you need more methademic crystal  
You never sleep you just keep goin'  
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol  
Each time you're dying without knowing  
  
You live too fast  
You live too fast  
  
What's the point it's killing you without you even knowing  
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going  
I'll see you there

Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call  
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh  
  
You've nothing to say  
They're breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
The Mob Rules  
  
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same  
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh  
  
It's over, it's done  
the end is begun  
If you listen to fools  
The Mob Rules  
  
You've nothing to say  
Oh, They're breaking away  
If you listen to fools  
  
Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground  
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around  
  
You're all fools!  
The Mob Rules!

Oh no, here it comes again  
Can't remember when we came so close to love before  
Hold on, good things never last  
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again  
Again and again and again  
  
Cry out to legions of the brave  
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street  
Ride out, protectors of the realm  
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights  
  
Circles and rings, dragons and kings  
Weaving a charm and a spell  
Blessed by the night, holy and bright  
Called by the toll of the bell  
  
Bloodied angels fast descending  
Moving on a never-bending light  
Phantom figures free forever  
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright  
  
[Chorus]  
Neon Knights!  
Neon Knights!  
All right!  
  
Cry out to legions of the brave  
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street  
Ride out, protectors of the realm  
Capatin's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights  
Again and again, again and again and again  
  
[Chorus]

People going nowhere, taken for a ride  
Looking for the answers that they know inside  
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme  
Snow White's mirror said "partners in crime!"  
  
Don't they ever have to worry?  
Don't you ever wonder why?  
It's a part of me that tells you  
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die  
Never, never, never say die again  
  
Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry  
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie  
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go  
Hold back, 'till it's ready, taking it slow  
  
Don't they ever have to worry?  
Don't you ever wonder why?  
It's a part of me that tells you  
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die  
Never, never, never say die again  
  
Don't you ever say die  
Don't you ever say die  
Never say die  
  
Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall  
Children get together, you can save us all  
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die  
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine  
  
There's no need to have a reason  
There's no need to wonder why  
It's a part of me that tells you  
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die  
Never, never, never say die again

Close my eyes starting dreaming  
See a vision filled with wings  
Head my way  
Feel the presence of unknown power  
Telling me to come  
This is the only way  
  
It's dream within dream  
Lost and lonely  
Don't get pulled by the devil's hand  
  
Silent screamer filled with fear  
As the night time shapes a face  
Then disappears  
Scared forever into believing  
That your mind has met the  
Prince of whom you see  
  
It's dream within dream  
Lost and lonely  
Don't get fooled by the  
Devil's hand  
  
It's dream within dream  
Fool forever, don't get fooled  
Forever  
Don't get fooled, be the devil  
  
In your eyes  
The evil spirit rises  
Blinded by the dark  
You fall into shame  
As the reaper takes you  
Down the spiral stairway  
You share the evil pit  
With Satan's name  
  
Nightmare it's got me runnin'  
Nightmare it's calling you  
Nightmare it's got me runnin'  
Nightmare it's calling you  
  
It's dream within a dream  
Lost and lonely  
Don't get fooled, be the devil  
  
It's dream within a dream  
Lost forever  
Don't get fooled  
  
It's got me running  
It's just a nightmare  
It's got me running  
It's got me running

Cold is the night  
Lonely till dawn  
Cry for the light  
For the love that won't come  
You said that you'd never  
Leave me alone  
  
I gave you my heart  
You cried for my soul  
An angel won't come  
This devil won't go  
Something is wrong  
I just can't get away  
  
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love  
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love  
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love  
But I'm a stranger in your arms  
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms  
  
Maybe it's right  
But I just can't understand  
The hurt that I feel  
For my love second hand  
I know I should leave  
But I just can't walk away  
  
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love  
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love  
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love  
I'm a stranger in your arms  
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love  
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love

As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud  
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud  
Misty horizons block your vision of the world  
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know  
  
The land you loved is now so barren and so cold  
The name of God rings out so high in your soul  
This time is masters will lead us by the sword  
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court

Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn  
And sometimes I'm warm as fire  
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain  
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah  
  
Too many flames, with too much to burn  
And life's only made of paper  
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain  
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over again  
  
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone  
And for their dreams that will all be ashes  
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain  
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again  
  
(Over)  
(Over)

Born in the window  
Cold blooded spoof  
Raised in the prison  
You called the school  
Taught young in legends  
Told what to do  
I handed my childhood  
Over to you  
  
Travelling endlessly, I'm searching for mind  
I'm almost afraid of what I will find  
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?  
I handed my future over to you, to you  
  
Over to you  
Future looks blue  
What can I do?  
  
Watching for freedom  
Fighting our wars  
Feeding our children  
Keeping your laws  
Someday you'll suffer  
And what I'll do  
I'll hand all your promises  
Over to you  
  
Standing inside myself, I'm losing control  
You made me believe in the stories you told  
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?  
I handed my future over to you, to you  
  
Over to you  
Future looks blue  
What can I do?  
  
Tears filled of sadness  
Stealing myself  
Which burning secrets?  
What to they tell?  
Mad politicians  
Can tell it true  
I handed my children  
Over to you  
  
All over, over to you  
All over, over to you  
All over, over to you

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind  
People think I am insane because I'm frowning all the time  
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy  
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
Can you help me, occupy my brain?  
  
Oh yeah  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Pariah from society  
Addicted to sobriety  
A product of a virgin birth  
Another god on earth  
Yes that's your fantasy  
  
You say that you can read my mind  
Be careful of what you might find  
You think that you can be like me  
And see what my eyes see  
But you're no friend of mine  
  
Do you believe every word I say?  
Make your own truth, and get out of my way  
  
I'm your pariah  
For you desire  
Ain't no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
An angel or the Antichrist  
A symbol of your own device  
Pathetic in your own sad way  
You're just one pill away  
From taking my advice  
  
Do you believe every word I say?  
Make your own mind, and get out of my way  
  
I'm your pariah  
For you desire  
Ain't no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
Do you believe that I'm from Heaven?  
That I descended from the sky?  
The graven image of a pseudo icon  
To worship me on high?  
  
I'm not your savior  
I got no wings to fly  
Just your pariah  
Don't look to me when your life is over  
  
I'm your pariah  
For you desire  
Ain't no messiah  
Just your pariah  
  
Ain't no messiah  
Just your pariah

We sail through endless skies  
Stars shine like eyes  
The black night sighs  
The moon in silver trees  
Falls down in tears  
Light of the night  
The earth, a purple blaze  
Of sapphire haze  
In orbit always  
  
While down below the trees  
Bathed in cool breeze  
Silver starlight  
Breaks down the night  
And so we pass on by  
The crimson eye  
Of great god mars  
As we travel the universe

Mortal Eyes, Looking Through A Veil Of Dreams,  
Hypnotised, An Ever Living Soul With Wings.  
Think You're God, But You Never Had Control,  
Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All...  
Chorus:  
My Colours All Ran Dry, And Now I See The World In  
Black And White,  
It's Too Late Now, It's Time To Kiss The Rainbow  
Goodbye.  
Poison Tears Running From A Palsied Face,  
Satan Nears, Descending On The Human Race.  
Think You're God, Don't You Wish You Had Control,  
Think You're Loved But There's No One There At All...  
Chorus  
Listen To The Wind, Hear The Gospel Blow.  
Tell Me That You Don't Hear What I'm Hearing  
And I Will Let You Go.  
Look Up To The Sky, Put Your Trust In Me,  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And I  
Will Set You Free.  
Look Into The Flame, See The Embers Glow,  
Tell Me That You Don't See What I'm Seein And I  
Will Let You Go  
Taste The Holy Blood, Running From My Veins  
Tell Me That You Ain't Feelin What I'm Feelin And  
I'll Take Away The Pain  
Yes I Will Now, Oh Yes I Will, It's Time To Kiss The  
Rainbow Goodbye.  

Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups  
Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He's gonna blow me away  
  
He makes me happy when I'm feeling down  
Take away my worry takes away my frown  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
  
If you wanna feel groovy, give the doctor a call, yeah  
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
Oh, right away

They say you came from heaven but I know that's not the truth,  
'Cause I don't think an angel could look anything like you,  
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone,  
You gotta be the closest thing to hate I've ever known,  
And if I didn't know better I'd say you had come alone to the party.  
Oh yeah.  
  
The light is always shining, but you swear that it's gone black,  
The tide is always turning, but you're never looking back,  
If I didn't know better I'd say times were pretty bad,  
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,  
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,  
Rusty Angels they can't fly,  
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.  
  
The gifts you bring are fire, and your dreams they turned to dust,  
Your flying days are over, and your wings have turned to rust.  
If I didn't know better, I'd say all you had is lost,  
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,  
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,  
Rusty Angels they can't fly,  
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.  
  
If you swallow just a little pride, you might find a little love inside,  
Open up and let somebody in, 'cause if you need somebody,  
You know it's not a sin.  
  
Rusty Angels they can't fly, Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,  
Rusty Angels they can't fly, no, Rusty Angels gonna die,  
Gonna die, yeah, you can't fly, oh no,  
Gonna die, oh yeah, you can't fly, oh no.

Feel so good I feel so fine  
Love that little lady always on my mind  
Gives me lovin' every night and day  
Never gonna leave her, never goin' away  
Someone to love me  
You know she makes me feel alright  
Someone who needs me  
Love me every single night  
Feel so happy since I met that girl  
When we're making love it's something out of this world  
Feels so good to know that she's all mine  
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time  
Someone to live for  
Love me 'til the end of time  
Makes me feel happy  
Good to know that she's all mine  
Lovely lady make love all night long  
Lovely lady never do me wrong  
I don't wanna leave ya  
I never wanna leave ya,  
Anymore no more  
Lovely lady, mystifying eyes  
Lovely lady, she don't tell me no lies  
I know I'll never leave ya  
I'm never gonna leave ya anymore no more  

There's a vision in the sands  
Rising from the ancient past  
Crying let my spirit go  
Lead my burning soul to rest  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
It's the call of the seventh star  
  
There's no shelter from the heat  
There's no mercy from this land  
Hear a thousand chanting souls  
Waiting judgment from god's hand  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
It's the call of the seventh star  
Hear the sound of fallen angels  
It's the call of the seventh star  
  
The pyramids will fall  
Turn to dust before the sun  
And the star will rise again  
Until destiny is done  
  
Hear the sound of distant ages  
It's the call of the seventh star  
Hear the sound of fallen angels  
It's the call of the seventh star

Oh, it's night again  
And the dark just killed the sun  
If the light must end  
You've got time to run away  
  
There's a door to dreams  
And it always lets you in  
But with a silent scream  
All the nightmares must begin  
  
Still you chase what you can't see  
Like death and pain and sin  
And the shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind  
  
You'll remember me  
I could make you disappear  
Be where you want to be  
Just as long as it's not here  
  
Well, I'm back and stronger  
And the first one's always free  
And it lasts much longer  
You can bet your sanity  
  
'Never more', the victim cries  
As I slip beneath the skin  
Like the shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind  
  
If words had names like red and green  
And two for sympathy  
Black and white and in between  
Then you'd be misery  
  
Every day is an inquisition  
Who are you? What are you? Why?  
I'm alive, I belong, I'll be back  
It's a half truth, still a whole lie  
  
In the garden of good and evil  
You'll know but you know  
The spider only spins  
The shadow of the wind  
The shadow of the wind

Is life everything you want to be,  
Does it give you everything that you need,  
Does it live up to your expectations,  
Are you ready for the celebrations.  
This is not for the weak of mind,  
Are you sure that you're my kind,  
Do you want to be part of me,  
Are you sure that you can really see.  
Are you chained to a life that you don't want,  
Is it hard for you to find a way out,  
Can you live without the love that you need,  
Are you sure that what you have is so real.  
This is not for the weak of mind,  
Are you sure that you're my kind,  
Do you want to be part of me,  
Are you sure that you can really see.  
All of your life, they try to take your cover,  
Turn you into another, and make you change your name.  
When you fall, it's up to you to recover,  
You can't depend on another, to help you with the pain, yeah.  
I'm shaking off the chains, I'm shaking off the chains.  
This is not for the weak of mind,  
Are you sure that you're my kind,  
Do you want to be part of me,  
Are you sure that you can really see.  
In the night, you say that you are falling  
People always calling, calling out your name.  
What do you know, a face appears at the window,  
Tapping on the window, the window of your soul.  
I'm shaking off the chains, I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm shaking off the chains, let me live again,  
Shaking off the chains, shaking off the chains.

There's no reason for you to run  
You can't escape the fate of the chosen one  
Black moon rising, in a blood red sky  
This time you realise that you're gonna die  
  
Drinking your blood brew is your answer  
That's what you plan to do  
No dreaming, time you cheat this master  
You're on your own going through  
  
Wind of mist has taken over your mind  
And you think you're on your own  
Don't believe you are the only one here  
Look around, you're not alone  
  
Feel the forces from another world  
Ghostly shadows fill your mind  
Evil power hanging over you  
As you freeze, you're like a child  
Look behind you!  
  
Somebody's calling  
Someone is near  
Feel yourself falling  
Falling with fear  
You tell yourself you're dreaming  
You realise you're screaming  
You know that this shouldn't happen to you  
You tell yourself that it's scary too  
But there is nothing you can do, oh!  
  
Ghostly shadows from the other world  
Evil forces in your mind  
Trapped between the worlds of life and death  
Frozen in the realms of time  
Look behind you!  
  
You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line  
Your body is crawling, but your senses are blind  
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brains  
Ice cold fingers, running through your veins

Got no time to be on the run,  
Got no holes in my shoes,  
You're the reasong all my friends have gone,  
But I won't run from you.  
  
So many promises, and you broke them all,  
Oh I'll forgive, but I can't forget,  
You know you're a fake, but I just can't take no more,  
'Cause I'm tired of it.  
  
I'm so tired, so tired,  
Sick and tired of it all,  
I'm so tired, sick and tired,  
I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah.  
  
You turn the truth, then you turn your back,  
You're a victim of yourself,  
The hate remains, the hurting still exists.  
I'm so tired of it all.  
  
I'm so tired, sick and tired,  
So damn tired, sick and tired of it all, oh yeah,  
I'm so tired, I'm sick and tired of it all.

If there isn't light when no one sees  
Then how can I know what you might believe?  
A story told that can't be real  
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah  
  
Fade away, fade away  
Vanish into small  
Fade away, fade away  
Break the crystal ball oh!  
  
It's the sign  
Feels like the time!  
  
On a small world, west of wonder  
Somewhere, nowhere all  
There's a rainbow that will shimmer  
When the summer falls  
If an echo doesn't answer  
When it hears a certain song  
Then the beast is free to wander  
But never is seen around  
  
And it's the sign of the southern cross  
It's the sign of the southern cross  
All right  
Sail away  
To the sign  
Oh  
  
From the book, the word is spoken  
Whispers from forgotten psalms  
Gather all around the young ones  
They will make us strong  
Reach above your dreams of pleasure  
Given life to those who died  
Look beyond your own horizons  
Sail the ship of signs  
  
And it's the sign of the southern cross  
It's the sign of the southern cross  
Fade away, fade away  
Break the crystal ball  
Fade away, fade away  
I can't accept it anymore  
  
On a real world, west of wonder  
Somewhere, nowhere all  
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer  
When the summer falls  
From the book, the word is spoken  
Whispers from forgotten psalms  
Gather all around the young ones  
They will make us strong!  
  
It's the sign of the southern cross  
It's the sign of the southern cross  
  
Don't live for pleasure  
Make life your treasure  
Fade away!  
Eight miles high, about to fall  
And no one there to catch you  
Look for the sign, the time  
The sign of the southern cross, yeah

Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster  
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone  
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story  
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along  
  
No reason to stay  
Oh, when I'm slipping away  
  
Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle  
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end  
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies  
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow  
  
Slipping away  
Slipping away  
Nobody to pay  
Look out, 'cause I'm slipping away  
  
Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection  
A future without a past, no more road to take me back  
Come if you will, just don't question my direction  
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun  
  
Slipping away  
Slipping away  
Got nobody to pay  
And you're slippin' away  
  
No more running in a circle  
It's time to move along  
Round, round, round we go  
A start without an end  
So I'm slipping away  
Slipping away

What you get and what you see  
Things that don't come easily  
Feeling happy in my vein  
Icicles within my brain  
(Cocaine)  
  
Something blowing in my head  
Winter's ice, it soon will spread  
Death would freeze my very soul  
Makes me happy, makes me cold  
  
My eyes are blind but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel the snowflakes freezing me  
  
Let the winter sun shine on  
Let me feel the frost of dawn  
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow  
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow  
  
Don't you think I know what I'm doing  
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong  
You're the one who's really a loser  
This is where I feel I belong  
  
Crystal world with winter flowers  
Turns my day to frozen hours  
Lying snowblind in the sun  
Will my ice age ever come?

My name it means nothing  
my fortune is less  
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness  
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on  
Everything I possessed - Now they are gone  
  
Oh where can I go to and what can I do?  
Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you  
You just laughed when I begged you to stay  
I've not stopped crying since you went away  
  
The world is a lonely place - you're on your own  
Guess I will go home - sit down and moan.  
Crying and thinking is all that I do  
Memories I have remind me of you

Sorcerers of madness  
Selling me their time  
Child of god sitting in the sun  
Giving peace of mind  
Fictional seduction  
On a black snow sky  
Sadness kills the superman  
Even fathers cry  
  
Of all the things I value most of all  
I look inside myself and see  
My world and know that it is good  
You know that I should  
  
Superstitious century  
Didn't time go slow  
Separating sanity  
Watching children grow  
Synchronated undertaker  
Spiral skies  
Silver ships on plasmic oceans  
In disguise  
  
Of all the things I value most in life  
I see my memories and feel their warmth  
And know that they are good  
You know that I should  
  
Watching eyes of celluloid  
Tell you how to live  
Metaphoric motor-replay  
Give, give, give!  
Laughter kissing love  
Is showing me the way  
Spiral city architect  
I build, you pay  
  
Of all the things I value most of all  
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth  
And know that it is good

So you think you know what's going on inside her head  
You think she wants your money but it's you she wants instead  
  
When you think about the things that she did long ago  
It breaks your heart but deep down boy you don't want her to go  
You feel your love so shattering  
You feel you want to die  
Just because someone did take off  
Telling you a lie  
  
If I were you I'd try again and try to make amends  
She only thinks of you, you know I'm talking as a friend

I want to reach out and touch the sky  
I want to touch the sun  
But I don't need to fly  
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon  
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon  
  
I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend  
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end  
I've been through magic and through life's reality  
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me  
  
Got no religion, don't need no friends  
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend  
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind  
I've seen the future and I've left it behind

Alright now.  
Won't you listen?  
  
When I first met you, didn't realize  
I can't forget you, for your surprise  
You introduced me, to my mind  
And left me wanting, you and your kind  
  
I love you, oh you know it  
  
My life was empty, forever on a down  
Until you took me, showed me around  
My life is free now, my life is clear  
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear  
  
Come on now, try it out  
  
Straight people don't know, what you're about  
They put you down and shut you out  
You gave to me a new belief  
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf

It's against my uniform  
To be a civil judge  
All the songs are history now  
'Bout rock stars and their grudge  
Let us cast our minds back  
To thirty years or more  
You took up all the vandals  
Will Hitler beat 'em all?  
  
And we're sad and sorry  
Really sorry that it happened that way  
Yes we're sad and sorry  
But why'd you have to treat us that way?  
  
Compare ourselves with others  
And cover them in sin  
Oh, God what a terrible  
A terrible state we're in  
There must be some way out of here  
A compromise that's right  
If we cannot work it out  
We're gonna have to fight  
  
Yes we're sad and sorry  
Really sorry that it happened that way  
Yes we're sad and sorry  
We cannot go on in those days  
  
I'm talking about my brothers  
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout sisters as well  
I wish you good luck  
Good luck!  
  
Oh, but the world's still on fire  
Chain the hope you take on, liar  
This fire  
We're on fire, we're on fire, yeah...

Take me through the centuries to supersonic years  
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears  
All I have to give you is a love that never dies  
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes  
  
Mother moon she's calling me back to her silver womb  
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb  
Seven hundredth unicorn is waiting in the skies  
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies  
  
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears  
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years  
With our love we'll ride away into eternal skies  
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies  
  
Woman child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams  
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means  
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above  
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love

Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,  
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you  
Falling  
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,  
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all  
Tonight  
  
When the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand  
That holds the knife,  
And the knife that cuts the cable, kills the spark that  
Feeds the life.  
  
[Chorus]  
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we  
Were able,  
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that  
Rocks the cradle.  
  
The oath you take is sacred, to save not steel a life,  
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked  
Through human eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,  
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you  
Falling.  
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,  
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all  
Tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that  
Steals the life.

What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power,  
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down.  
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now,  
I'm gonna tear your whole world down.  
  
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,  
The illusion of power.  
  
I can' get the emotional thing straight in my head,  
Everything I love dies to soon, or is already dead.  
Don't stand too close I spit and breath fire,  
Anything I've got now you cannot desire.  
  
You want to be my friend I promise you nothing,  
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you,  
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now,  
Killing me now.  
  
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,  
The illusion of power.  
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,  
The illusion of power.  
  
Powerful, who are you fooling?  
You're caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies  
And pitiful weaknesses  
Your souls secretes insecurity  
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror  
You're terrified of true power...you fear me...  
  
I can tell you stories of my  
Shaded past and I can  
Drag you down into the  
Depths of my soul.  
  
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,  
The illusion of power.  
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,  
The illusion of power.  
  
Why don't you come closer, Promise a story I will tell, yeah,  
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah  
I'll save you from your dreams.

The horizon breaks, where a figure stands  
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
  
He never speaks, but his task we're told  
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
  
Silver mountains won't save you from hell  
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell  
Oh your weakness your past  
The Lawmaker comes  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
He's the Lawmaker

Fire and water, wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World Possessions, endless tears  
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years  
  
World turns slowly, sun don't shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
Words are poison, passion bleeds  
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds  
  
The time of dreams has turned  
The night is gone and the light shines on  
Where darkness once would hide  
With spirits high, our fears were born  
  
[Chorus]  
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you  
Keep you from a restless heart  
Deceiver of night the stranger that laughs  
Within you, the reason for your restless heart  
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones  
  
Fire and water, wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World turns slowly, sun don't shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
  
Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer each step brings fear  
The eyes of they that see have evil stare  
Watch over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And He's the keeper if the Sabbath Stones  
  
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?  
What hand would strike and watch his people die? What life that takes, what
future did we earn? It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones  
  
What life that takes what future did we earn? It's our mistakes

There's a man who sees all there is to see  
What the future holds for all  
As the days grow dark with the grim and final warning  
Beware of the ones with invisible friends  
They will steal into your mind  
And all too soon the signs begin to show  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Don't be blind by fools again  
Fools again  
  
As the pages turn and the story's told  
From the visions he's seen  
The house on the hill  
With the haunted eyes that call  
no one laughed as madness came out  
To play it's game  
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Don't be blind by fools again  
Fools again  
  
Bells will take their toll  
On your way  
There's no way we're born to shine  
Before our time, all your life  
You're on your own  
Lonely road  
Lost in a time  
Let the light lead your way  
To the golden throne  
It's the only way  
  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up to the shining  
Don't be blind by fools again  
Rise up to the shining  
Live long live now  
Rise up the shining  
Don't be blind by fools again  
  
Oh rise up, to the shining  
Wise up they're gonna steal your mind  
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you  
No one laughed, no one cried  
You stayed too long  
You're finally gonna stay

The Thrill of it All  
Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift  
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift  
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry  
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die  
  
Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?  
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in Man?  
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold  
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold  
  
Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it  
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah  
Forget your problems that don't even exist  
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!  
  
So come along, you know you matter to me  
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah  
Time to stop all your messing around  
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!  
  
Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive  
Do you always have to be told, yeah  
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought  
Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah  
Oh yeah!

Oh what are you gonna do  
When there's a part of you  
That needs to run with the wind  
  
And the fire of burning yesterdays  
Can only light the way  
To lead you from  
The garden of the dark  
Stay out of shadows  
  
Now look like the change is on  
Tomorrow's never gone  
Today just never comes  
  
Go on and jump,yeah  
Into the hurricane  
You will forger the pain  
It's only there  
To exorcise your mind  
  
Looking at the world  
When you've open up your eyes  
You've got to see the promises they've made  
They're bloody lies and broken dreams  
Your silence screams  
  
You're living in a time machine  
And you can choose just who you are  
Someone that you've never seen  
Somewhere you've never been  
You're living in a time machine  
  
Oh what are you gonna do  
When every part of you  
Just needs to catch the wind  
  
And the fire of burning yesterdays  
Can only light the way  
To lead you from  
The garden of the dark  
  
Looking for the world  
When you've opened up your eyes  
You'll see you've got invisible chains  
They're only lies  
Not what it seems  
I hear your silent screams  
  
You're living in a time machine  
Nobody cares just where you go  
Taken where you've never been  
Somewhere you don't know  
  
You're living in a time machine  
Why do you stay who you are  
Be what you've never been  
Someone you've never seen  
You're living in a time machine  
Yeah

Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak  
Catch the fastest train around nine  
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache  
Before it takes me away from my mind  
  
Send me love and I may let you see me  
Send me hopes that can spin in my head  
But if you really want me to answer  
I can only let you know when I'm dead  
  
When sadness fills my days  
It's time to turn away  
And then tomorrow's dreams  
Become reality to me  
  
So realize I'm much better without you  
You're not the one and only thing in my heart  
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living  
So this time I'm gonna have to depart

Soon it's never more  
When you've got to pay for  
Promises, made in the night  
  
Call the magic one  
And with the magic comes  
Forever chained to the flame  
  
It's too late  
Too late for tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Do you feel a touch of evil  
(Then) It's too late  
  
To wish and make it so  
To feel the power growing  
Stronger, blessed by the dark  
  
And when the candle fades  
You can say it was a  
Joke you played  
So you must let me go, no  
  
It's too late  
You've said the word  
Too late  
Something heard you  
Too late, now the race is on  
And you're run out of road  
Too late  
For tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Can you feel the touch of evil  
It's too late  
  
Oh oh oh save me  
I believe in your name  
Oh oh I've fallen down  
But now I've found  
Nobody to take the blame  
  
Misery  
It's come to drag me away  
And when the hunter cries  
No alibis  
Get ready for judgment day  
  
As the candle fades  
You can say it was a game you made  
So you must let me go, let me go  
  
It's too late, you've said the word  
Too late, something heard you  
Too late, the spell is gone  
And this time you're the fool  
  
It's too late for tears  
Too late  
And no one hears you  
Welcome to forever  
Welcome it's too late  
Too late

It really was a meeting  
The bottle took a beating  
The ladies of the manor  
Watched me climb into my car and  
I was going down the track about a hundred and five  
They had the stop-watch rolling  
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive  
And yet my mind was blowing  
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good  
I had the tape deck roaring  
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn  
I went of exploring  
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it  
I was turning tires burning  
The ground was in my sky  
I was laughing the bitch was trashed  
And death was in my eye  
  
I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way  
I had the wheels in motion  
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains  
Inebriation  
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch  
In my imagination  
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch  
Inebriation  
  
Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain  
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again  
Ooh can you hear my lies  
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes  
  
So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again  
But there was no tequila  
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains  
'Cause there was no tequila  
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill  
We began to roll  
And as we get trashed we were laughing still  
Well bless my soul

She came from the past  
She was never meant to last  
Her destiny was fatal  
From the start  
A messenger from hell  
She cast a deadly spell  
On all of those who dare  
To cross her heart  
  
Ain't no use in you trying to run  
Fate has taken it's toll  
Just one look and the damage is done  
Burn your eyes  
Turn your heart into stone  
  
History foretold of a circle  
Cast in gold  
An evil seed of power  
Sealed within  
But fate has lent a hand  
Destroyed the golden band  
And freed her soul  
To wash the land with sin  
  
Ain't no use in you trying to run  
Fate has taken it's toll  
Just one look and the damage is done  
Burn your eyes  
Turn your heart into stone  
  
She cast a deadly spell  
She put a spell on you  
She's got evil in her heart  
Turn your heart into stone  
Turn your heart into stone

A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well  
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul  
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told  
So get a good hold, yeah  
  
Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are  
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far  
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know  
So let it all go!  
  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night, it feels so right!  
  
Night time sorrow, taken like a pain  
Black will not become a white, it's all the same  
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark  
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!  
  
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell  
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well  
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul  
So get a good hold, yeah  
  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night, it feels so right!  
Turn up the night!  
Turn up the night!  
If it feels right  
Turn off the light!  
Turn up the night!

One day in the life of the lonely  
Another day on the round about  
What do they need  
Somebody to love  
  
One night in the life of the lonely  
There's a miracle on the screen  
What did they see  
Somebody to love  
  
He guarantees you instant glory  
Get your money on the line  
  
Gotta send me a plastic Jesus  
There's a check in the mail today  
That's what I need  
Somebody to love  
  
We just won't eat on Sunday  
Gotta buy him a limousine  
Somewhere to live  
Somewhere to pray  
  
Every penny from the people  
Keeps the wolf outside the door  
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself  
But he'll give you more, yeah  
  
Holy father, holy ghost  
Who's the one who pays the most  
Rock the cradle don't you cry  
Buy another lullaby  
  
Jack is nimble, Jack is quick  
Pick your pocket, turn a trick  
Slow and steady, he's got time  
To commit another TV crime  
TV crime  
  
One day in the life of the lonely  
Back again on the round about  
What do they need  
Somebody to love  
  
Yeah  
  
One night in the life of the lonely  
Another miracle on the screen  
What did they see  
Somebody to love again  
  
A supermarket of salvation  
Take a look inside the store  
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself  
But he gives more  
  
Holy father - holy ghost  
Who's the one who hurts you most  
Rock the cradle when you cry  
Scream another lullaby  
  
Jack be nimble, Jack be slick  
Take the money, get out quick  
Slow and steady, so much time  
To commit another  
TV Crime, TV Crime

Leading us on, to the land of Eternity  
Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla  
  
The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods  
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace  
But someone among them had the skill of deceit  
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell  
  
[Chorus]  
When the winds of Valhalla run cold  
Be sure that the blood will start to flow  
When the winds of Valhalla run cold  
Valhalla  
  
The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved  
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hell  
The long ships are sailing and the chariots ride  
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Raise your hands  
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul  
Raise your eyes  
And Odin will lead us on  
  
They say that history repeats itself  
Upon the year of the seventh Century  
Well nobody knows no you never can tell  
So you'd better run now and hide away  
  
[Chorus]

Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison  
Tree,  
Give me your body and your soul.  
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past,  
This mortal life will take it's toll.  
  
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so  
Amusing,  
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.  
  
This park of natures fire, my only one desire,  
This world is hanging by a thread.  
  
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so  
Amusing,  
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.  
  
People always tried to change me, alter everything  
I am,  
Though you find this so amusing, you left me in  
This state I'm in.  
Virtual death  
  
You may think this existence, is just a human  
Weakness,  
Inside my mind it's near the end.  
Virtual death  
  
I'm losing, I'm fading fast. I'm dying, virtual death.

Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor  
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more  
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild  
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child  
  
Oh, walk away  
She's looking to love you  
There's nothing to say  
Just turn your head and walk away  
Walk away, walk on  
  
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all  
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls  
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why  
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die  
  
Can't see her fire  
But I can feel her heat, all right!  
It's rising higher  
I'm walking the wire  
  
Walk on by!  
  
Oh! Walk away!  
She's looking to love you  
There's nothing to say  
Just turn your head and walk away  
Oh, walk on by, walk away!  
Walk on!  
  
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher  
But don't be fooled! just turn your head and walk away!

Witches gather at black masses  
Bodies burning in red ashes  
On the hill the church in ruin  
Is the scene of evil doings  
It's a place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rats' innards  
I guess it's the same whereever you may go  
Oh Lord yeah  
  
Carry banners which denounce the lord  
See me rocking in my grave  
See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood  
See them stick the stake through me  
Oh  
  
Don't hold me back cause I've just gotta go  
They've got a hold of my soul now  
Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene (not sure about this line)  
Look in my eyes I'm there enough  
Yeah  
  
On the scene a priest appears  
Sinners falling at his knees  
Satan sends out funeral pyre  
Casts the priest into the fire  
It's the place for all bad sinners  
Watch them eating dead rats' innards  
I guess it's the same whereever you may go  
Oh lord yeah

Now the first day that I met ya  
I was looking in the sky  
When the sun turned all a blur  
And the thunderclouds rolled by  
The sea began to shiver  
And the wind began to moan  
It must've been a sign for me  
To leave you well alone  
I was born without you, baby  
But my feelings were a little bit too strong  
You never said you love me  
And I don't believe you can  
'Cause I saw you in a dream  
And you were with another man  
You looked so cool and casual  
And I tried to look the same  
But now I've got to know ya  
Tell me who am I to blame?  
I was born without you, baby  
But my feelings were a little bit too strong  
Now the whole wide world is movin'  
'Cause there's iron in my heart  
I just can't keep from cryin'  
'Cause you say we've got to part  
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone  
And watch you slowly take away  
A love I've never known  
I was born without you, baby  
But my feelings were a little bit too strong  
Just a little bit too strong

What's the use of paradise or everyday of livin'?  
They spend and learn in Heaven, sin in Hell  
  
What's the point of children  
When evil got before them?  
They learn in every tale we tell  
  
There's no point in being kind  
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?  
  
Oh Yeah!  
  
What's the use of power  
When the battle isn't equal  
And we're all too Scared to use it anyway?  
  
What's the point of reason  
When no one wants to listen?  
Deliverance is all too far away  
  
Oh what's the use?  
Oh what's the use?  
Tell me, oh, what's the use?  
What's the use?  
  
Love becomes an evil of the mind  
What's the use?  
  
What's the use?..

Long ago I wandered through my mind  
In the land of fairy tales and stories  
Lost in happiness I had no fears  
Innocence and love was all I knew  
Was it illusion?  
  
Soon the days went passing into years  
Happiness just didn't come so easy  
Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams  
Innocence was just another word  
Was it illusion?  
  
Lost in the wheels of confusion  
Running through furnace of tears  
Eyes full of angered illusion  
Hiding in everyday fears  
  
So I found that life is just a game  
But you know there's never been a winner  
Try your hardest just to be a loser  
The world will still be turning when you're gone  
Yeah when you're gone!

He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun  
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying  
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me  
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.  
  
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow  
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow  
  
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer  
For I believe Satan lives, in the souls of the dying  
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me  
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.  
  
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes  
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn  
  
Don't look in those sunken eyes  
Don't look and you'll stay alive  
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Can't die until Satan says you die  
And Satan takes your soul  
In the face of death or your toungue will blister  
  
Don't look in those sunken eyes  
Don't look and you'll stay alive  
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister  
Can't die until Satan says you die  
The Devil takes your soul  
With all his wrath he calls the reaper  
  
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying  
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed  
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow  
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow  
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying  
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn, burn, burn  
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer  
When Death Calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down

Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream  
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no  
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real  
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel  
I'll give you a star  
So you know just where you are  
Don't you know that I might be  
Your wishing well  
Your wishing well  
  
Look in the water, tell me what do you see  
Reflections of the love you give to me  
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy  
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, why?  
  
Time is a never ending journey  
Love is a never ending smile  
Give me a sign to build a dream on  
Dream on  
  
Yeah, throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream  
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no  
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy  
So let me fill myself with tears you cry  
  
I'll give you a star  
So you know just where you are  
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say  
Dream for a while  
Of the things that make you smile  
'cause you know  
Don't you know  
Oh, you know  
That I'm your wishing well  
Your wishing well  
Your wishing well  
I wish you well  
I'm your wishing well

I'm just a man and I am what I am  
Nobody will ever change my ways  
I don't need money and I don't need no lies  
I only need to live for today  
But I'd like to talk things over with you  
I want to hear the things you say, today  
Although you won't change my anyway, no no way  
  
I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you  
I want to set my mind all free  
You understand me woman, you give me time  
But I don't need no sympathy  
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved  
Instead of hiding in myself  
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way  
  
Nobody's gonna change my world  
That's something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel  
  
So listen to me now, hear what I say  
Please give me time and maybe love  
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me  
I need him now to set me free  
'Cause it may be that it's over for me  
If you don't hear the things that I say, today  
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way  
  
Nobody's gonna change my world, that's something too unreal  
Nobody will change the way I feel
