I try to discover  
A little something to make me sweeter  
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll be forever blue  
That you gimme no reason  
Why you make-a-me work so hard  
  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
  
Soul, I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
And if I should falter  
Would you open you arms out to me  
We can make love not war  
And live at peace with our hearts  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll be forever blue  
What religion or reason  
Could drive a man to forsake his lover  
  
Don't you tell me no  
Don't you tell me no  
Don't you tell me no  
Don't you tell me no  
  
Soul, I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll be forever blue  
That you gimme no reason  
You know you make-a-me work so hard  
  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
That you gimme no  
  
Soul, I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me  
  
Soul, I hear you calling  
Oh baby please give a little respect to me

In these days of mine for keeps I'm trying to hold on  
Suddenly you're all out of reach and everything goes wrong  
What we say and what we do are entirely different things  
Meaning lost straight through the roof  
That's not how it should be  
  
Easy like a bird  
I ride the breeze  
My mind is falling  
  
You're so ordinary  
You're my sanctuary in the morning, darling  
New sensation, love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way and I'll go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy land of milk and honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
I just don't know what to believe in  
If the truth be known  
Suffering from soul fatigue  
Weathering the storm  
  
What we say and what we do are entirely different things  
Whispered voices fill the room  
That's not how it should be  
  
Swaying like a tree  
I feel the sky  
Somebody calling  
  
You're so ordinary  
Be my sanctuary in the morning, darling  
New sensation, love vibration  
Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye  
  
You go your way and I'll go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion, darling  
  
[Illusion, darling...]  
[You're so ordinary...]  
[You're so...]  
[You're so ordinary...]  
  
Easy like a bird  
I ride the breeze  
My mind is falling  
  
You're so ordinary  
Be my sanctuary in the morning, darling  
New sensation, love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way, I'll go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
You're so ordinary, sanctuary  
Be my one in the morning, darling  
New sensation, love vibration  
Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye  
  
You go your way and I'll go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion  
  
You're so ordinary, sanctuary  
Be my light in the morning, darling  
New sensation, love vibration  
Heart to heart and a long goodbye  
  
You go your way and I'll go my way  
Life is truer than fiction  
In this crazy mixed up world of honey  
Life is just an illusion darling  
  
[Darling]  
[Darling]  
[Darling]

Cuts to the quick  
Pure emotion, a trip  
No word of a lie  
  
Pressed to your lips  
We collide, slowly twist  
Ardent and lithe  
  
Seeps into the ground  
Kisses the earth and I am found  
  
Love's young dream could be alien  
Strange ways, how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Just so it seems  
Softly potent, serene  
Vacant and shy  
  
You are everywhere  
Under my skin and in my hair  
  
Love's young dream could be alien  
Strange ways, how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Seeps into the ground  
Kisses the earth and I am found  
  
Love's young dream could be alien  
Strange ways, how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Love's young dream could be alien  
Strange ways, how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Love's young dream could be alien  
Strange ways, how we fly

As a means of release  
Pick up my little pieces of heaven  
'Tis a social disease when I cry  
As you head for the door  
I want it all, you can take it all leave it  
  
With the light coming in  
My desire to give in runs away with me  
If I'm not good enough and my love is too much  
Then forget it  
Now I am strong carry me home  
You can take it or leave it  
  
God help me but forgive my true intention  
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run  
All this time still falling out of love  
  
As we cut to the thrust  
This could well be the year of decision  
Do you know what I mean  
Like a song spinning round in my head?  
Now I am strong carry me home  
You can take it or leave it  
  
God help me but forgive my true intention  
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run  
All this time still falling out of love  
  
I want it all, give me it all  
I want it all, give me it all  
  
God help me but forgive my true intention  
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run  
God help me but forgive my true intention  
It hurts me but I've nowhere left to run  
All this time still falling out of love  
All this time still falling out of love

Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
All through the years  
  
If I could see the world through someone else's eyes  
If I could see through you would I cast you to one side  
And if you gave it all would I throw it all away  
Like the leaves in autumn winds  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
And if you held me here would the moment fade away  
Into obscurity like the night becomes the day  
For all the broken promises tell me where do I begin  
To throw my caution to the wind  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
All through the years  
  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years

Open your eyes I see  
Your eyes are open  
Wear no disguise for me  
Come into the open  
  
When it's cold outside  
Am I here in vain?  
Hold on to the night  
There will be no shame  
  
Always, I want to be with you  
And make believe with you  
And live in harmony, harmony oh love  
  
Melting the ice for me  
Jump into the ocean  
Hold back the tide I see  
Your love in motion  
  
When it's cold outside  
Am I here in vain?  
Hold on to the night  
There will be no shame  
  
Always, I want to be with you  
And make believe with you  
And live in harmony, harmony oh love

Wanderin' through the back roads  
And the rain comes rushin' down  
To resolve your love  
For this man in his twenties  
  
Am I right? Am I wrong? Or am I just dreaming?  
  
Climbing up the backstairs  
There's a chill wind in the air  
I wrap up from the cold  
Pull the blind in the window  
  
Who was here? Was it you? Or am I just dreaming?  
  
Look at all the lonely people  
Walking miles around the town  
I can see the old cathedral  
But I have to play it down  
  
Boats along the river  
Setting up their sails  
And life carries on as normal  
Although you're not around  
  
Waiting as the bus stop  
Laughing off the rain  
Shaking their umbrellas  
'Till it starts again  
  
Flowers in the water  
Floating off downstream  
Paper in the gutter  
Blowing in the breeze  
  
Am I right? Am I wrong? Or am I just dreaming?

Ooh there could be love in your eyes  
I could be loving you deep my baby  
Ooh there could be love in your soul  
I wanna feel the emotion  
  
Ooh there could be love in your heart  
I want to feel it so deep down baby  
Ooh I could love you so bad  
I want to give you devotion  
  
Oh what's the matter with me now baby  
Feelings are mixed up inside  
Come along and be mine only child  
  
You'd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now I'm in chains  
Not exactly what I'm looking for  
  
Ooh I'm putting magic aside  
I love the look in your eyes now baby  
Ooh it tells me you're mine  
I wanna dive in your ocean  
  
Oh what's the matter with me now baby  
Feelings are mixed up inside  
Come along and be mine only child  
  
You'd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now I'm in chains  
Not exactly what I'm looking for  
  
You'd better be careful or you might just get  
What you are looking for  
Now I'm in chains  
Not exactly what I'm looking for

Call me  
Any time just call me  
Tell me that you want me  
Feel it everywhere  
  
Hold me  
Never let go of me  
I love it when you hold me  
Tell me that you care  
  
And if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I could be with you  
If I could be with you  
  
Touch me  
You know you make it beautiful  
Everything is physical  
It really turns me on  
  
Miss me  
Every time you go away  
Don't you leave me lonely  
I hate it when you're gone  
  
And if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I would be with you  
If I could be with you  
  
Yeah and if the sky should ever fall  
Then I'll come running  
Just you call  
I could be with you  
Yes I could be with you  
Little darling  
  
I'm gonna wait for you  
I'm gonna wait for you  
Hmm love is coming  
Sure love is coming  
  
Want me  
Lovers say you want me  
And tell me that you need me  
Is all I wanna know  
  
I'll be  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
I love it when you haunt me  
Everywhere I go  
  
I come running  
If I could be  
I come running  
If I could be  
  
I come running  
I come running  
I come running  
I come running  
  
I come running back to you  
I come running back to you  
  
Call me  
Never let go of me

Sometimes when I get upset  
You chill me out and put it to rest  
When I feel in dangerous times  
You make a call and give me a sign  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
When life is bitter and sore  
Just one look changes it all  
Could never be a jealous young man  
Cause you hold the key to my hand  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
Because our love is real I won't dominate you, fool around  
And faith and trust is all there is and true creation  
Guards it with her soul  
  
Sometimes when I don't feel well  
Emotional fall under your spell  
You heal me I'm better inside  
Sure seems good to be alive  
  
You wrap me up in love a color so sublime  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself  
  
Goes to where I hurt the most and takes it all away  
You really know me more than I even know myself

Because you're so sweet  
You lift up my heart  
And I fall back again  
But I don't know  
Quite which way to turn  
  
The light in your eyes  
Touches the sky  
And I'm your man again  
And you hold me  
As close as close can be  
  
And many's the time  
That you've enchanted me  
Now I want you back  
Here in my lovin' arms  
For eternity  
  
You look and you smile  
Warm me inside  
Cause you're so good to me  
A beauty  
Filled with the joys of spring  
  
No love is too pure  
To give to the world  
In her naivety  
Or too tender  
To caress with a simple kiss  
  
And many's the time  
That you've enchanted me  
Now I want you back (I want you back)  
Here in my lovin' arms  
For eternity  
  
And many's the time  
That you've enchanted me  
I want you back (I want you back)  
Back in my lovin' arms  
For eternity

Blue Savannah  
Blue Savannah song  
Oh blue Savannah song  
Somewhere 'cross the desert  
Sometime in the early hours  
In a restless world  
On the open highway  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Blue Savannah song  
Oh blue Savannah song  
Racing 'cross the desert  
At a hundred miles an hour  
To the orange side  
Through the clouds and thunder  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
I'm on my way back  
And your love will bring me home  
I'm traveling fast  
And your love will bring me home  
Will I discover  
That your love will bring me home?  
Will I discover  
That your love will bring me home?  
  
Somewhere 'cross the desert  
Sometime in the early hour  
To the orange side  
Through the clouds and thunder  
  
My home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Home is where the heart is  
Sweet to surrender to you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Oh Savannah song  
To you only  
I send my love to you  
  
Oh Savannah song  
To you only  
To you only

The child in me again, he plays the fool  
Cry for joy, amen  
For after all, it's only love  
And the way you stir your coffee  
Like an angel in the morning  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Save your tears, don't mean much  
Is the guilty party me? I don't think so  
And it, it's no bed of roses lying here  
Tossing and turning  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
And these, these years of love and giving surely  
Must be something to you  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder

Never had a point of view  
'Cause my mind was always someone else's mind  
  
I never had to tell a lie  
Cause I left the choices up to them  
Don't know why but I did  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in it's love  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
I never had to call the tune  
'Cause I always drifted with the tide of the moon  
(Ah la luna, my love, my love, my love)  
  
I would go out every night  
Looking for someone to treat me right  
Not a chance (chance) not a hope (hope)  
In this world (world)  
  
Oh I want life  
Life wants me  
To breath in it's love  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be comin' back for more  
  
(More)  
  
Take me I'm yours  
Now I'm comin' up for air  
I'm gonna live my time  
For the rest of my life  
Then I'll be coming back for more (more)  
(oh yeah) (More)

Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay  
Would it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you  
For I can't help falling in love with you  

If I seem nervous will you show me what to do  
And does the world deserve us, application rushing through  
A long time coming, yes it's been a long time coming  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart it's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
We close our eyes and chase away the sorry things  
You make it easy for me life is but a dream  
Cried on your shoulder  
Dove into the great blue yonder  
  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
Touch my heart, it's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you, is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
No catch twenty-two  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
  
No misdemeanor, there's a ring upon my finger  
And my loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
It's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you, is a place where I surrender  
Touch my heart  
No catch 22  
And all my worldly goods I give to you  
Loving you is a place where I surrender  
In my heart  
It's not hard to do  
And all my worldly goods I give to you.

Go ahead with your dreamin'  
For what it's worth  
Or you'll be stricken bound  
Kickin' up dirt  
For when it's dark  
You never know what the night it may bring  
  
Go ahead with your schemin'  
And shop at home  
You'll find treasure  
While cookin' up bones  
But the knife is sharp  
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
Go ahead with your dreamin'  
For what it's worth

Kickin' up dirt

Go ahead with your schemin'

Had gone to sleep  
  
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming  
Souls are lifting only dreaming  
We'll be waiting some are praying  
For a time when no one's cheating  
  
The sunlight rising over the horizon  
Just a distant memory a dawn chorus  
Birds singing bells ringing  
In our hearts in our minds  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep  
  
And they covered up the sun  
Until the birds had flown away  
And the fishes in the sea  
Had gone to sleep

Fire of the sun  
Flowers crumble into dust  
The seed shall scatter and die  
Light in her eyes  
  
Pours black on their lives  
We gather round a funeral pyre  
And here we stand  
In old england's land  
  
Shattered glass on the ground  
There are no words  
To console this earth  
To restore old england's pride  
  
Never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed  
  
Here comes the man  
With the warm and gentle hands  
Her name burned into his brow  
Scorn in her eyes  
  
Her back to the cries  
We spit upon the life  
That never was  
And here we stand  
  
In old England's land  
The rose is choked by it's thorn  
She will cast salt for your wound  
Old england wears no crown  
  
Never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed  
We didn't want to hurt you  
But it's not over yet  
No never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed

Draw the line  
Don't want to waste my time  
On an unresponsive  
Kid like you  
Who made the effort  
You devil in disguise  
You just keep on trying  
To win affection with your smile  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Danger signs  
Opened up the eyes  
Of an unsuspecting  
Fool like me  
What about an effort  
What about tonight  
What's the use in trying  
When nothing's going right  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Can't you see  
That you're turning me  
Into a cold cold  
Kid like you  
Forget the effort  
Now you're not mine  
No more use in smiling  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Say you'd never leave me  
Tears they don't come easy  
Baby please don't leave me  
Baby (in the love that you're looking for)  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(In the love that you're looking for)  
Say you'd never leave me  
But babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
  
Baby cry so easy  
Expect me to believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
Tears they don't come easy  
And babe I can't believe  
In the love that  
You're looking for  
(The kind love you never felt before)

Can you make it all right?  
Can you make it okay?  
When the top don't come out right, you move the sunlight away  
Now I feel no pain  
I do my crying in the rain  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay  
And the way I feel I keep outside then make the heart break fade away  
And the nights are long and cold, I want you here my dear to hold  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Tear it apart and it's all in the name of love  
Now I feel no pain  
I do my crying in the rain  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?  
Everybody hurts when your playing the game of love  
Stumble and fall and it's all in the name of love  
Words don't come out right. Can you make it okay?  

Where do you go when you think about me?  
What do I do when I think about you?  
  
Skyline  
Passion  
City streets that I adore  
Shadows  
By me grow  
Rent collectors at my door  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
Looking from the window  
Kissing in the kitchen  
Fall so hard that I don't have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Mindless  
Game shows  
Flicking through the multi-screen  
Twilight  
Time is slow  
Fall so hard that I could scream  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
Fall so hard that I don't have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
All the things that I adore  
Ones I've chosen to ignore  
Rent collectors at my door  
I can't take it anymore  
  
Where do you go when you think about me?  
What do I do when I think about you?  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave

Collecting conversation from the silence of the room  
Misguided information telling lies will never do  
  
No better known occasion for improving the score  
Paid my contribution won't play this game no more  
  
I'm done with hesitating got no stationary blues  
Gonna use my imagination like the way I used to do  
  
Headlong into passion a sensational move  
Made the right connection I'm falling for the groove  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm swinging high and I'm swinging low  
And I'm getting down and I'm to and fro  
And that's the way the party goes  
  
I'm making no mistaking it's a true love picture show  
So forget the final curtain and forget the bitter blow  
  
Got a lot of combination it's a fusion of love  
Mention intervention been bitten by the bug  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm done with hesitating got no stationary blues  
Gonna use my imagination like the way I used to do  
  
Headlong into passion a sensational move  
Made the right connection I'm falling for the groove  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And that's the way the party goes  
And that's the way the party goes

(Don't say you love me)  
(Strange things that make me die)  
(Don't say you love me)  
(Strange things that make me die)  
  
I don't belong I'm still around won't steal you like a radio  
I'm still around I won't be long gonna treat you like an angel  
  
But don't say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say you'll cry  
  
I told you lies I'm still around won't steal your act my angel  
I won't be long it's still your round or serialize the radio  
  
But don't say you love me  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say (don't say) you'll cry  
  
(What do you say?)  
(What do you say?)  
  
Don't go on I see your eyes I screw you around my angel  
You're still my love it's in your eyes our song is on the radio  
  
But don't say you love me (what do you say?)  
Strange things that make me die  
Dance 'till we're high you're shy  
Don't say you'll cry  
  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you'll cry I'm high  
Don't say you'll cry

My eyes are closed and I've nothing more to say  
But I was so willing to give it all away  
  
And what a show  
I've loved you all I could  
  
When will I see you  
Is nothing understood?  
  
You thought I was stupid  
But now I stop (stop!) at nothing (I stop at nothing)  
I thought you were better  
But love's gonna take a man  
Yeah love's gonna take a man  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Heaven only knows  
At your every turn a scandal  
But how's it suit you  
When it's all too much to cope with?  
  
You thought I was nothing  
Before you stepped [stepped] into my life (stepped into my life)  
I thought you were clever  
But love's gonna take a man  
And you haven't got it in you  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me [Don't say your love]  
You know how much it means to me [Is killing me]  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me [Don't say your, your love is]  
You know how much it means to me [Your love is killing me]  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride

One rule for us, for you another  
Do unto yourself as you see fit for yor brother  
  
Is that not within realm of understanding?  
A fifty second capacity of mind, too demanding?  
  
Well the poor unfortunate you  
There are a myriad of things that you can do  
Like pick up a pen and paper  
or go and talk to a friend  
The history of the future  
No violence or revenge  
  
Your shame is never . . . ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
You are guilty a  
nd how you ever entered into this life  
God only knows, the infinite complexities of love  
  
We all have the ability  
Our freedom is fragile  
We all laugh and we cry, don't we?  
We all bleed and we smile  
  
Your shame is never . . . ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
You are guilty  
and how you ever entered into this life  
God only knows,  
you're not to sacrifice the art of love  
  
Your shame is never . . . ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows, the infinite complexities of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows,  
we're not to sacrifice the art of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows, the infinite complexities of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows, the ultimate necessity of love

First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore  
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more  
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide  
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?  
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real  
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun  
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms  
  
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore  
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more  
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide  
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?  
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real  
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun  
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

It's more than just a feeling  
When it gets inside and takes a hold of you  
You don't want to beat it  
'Cause the pain subsides and the hurt is gone from you, woah  
  
It makes you kinda wonder  
What are we supposed to do, woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
Elevating, elevating  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You can't fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
It's more than just a feeling  
And it's growing stronger, brighter by the day  
You just gotta feel it  
And you just can't doubt it, you can't hide the truth, woah  
  
All this light and this beauty  
And it's shining down all over you, woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You can't fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher

Everyday, it's a gettin' closer  
Goin' faster than a roller coaster  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
A-hey a-hey hey  
  
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster  
Everyone said go ahead and ask her  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
A-hey a-hey hey  
  
Everyday seems a little longer  
Every way, love's a little stronger  
Come what May, do you really long for  
True love from me?  
  
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer

Fly away  
From a broken heart  
You have your love I've got to know  
  
What you say to me?  
Why'd you throw it all away?  
Where you go to I don't know  
  
As tears of angels  
Whisper softly through the trees  
Calling to me  
Hear there gently sighing pleas  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
And I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart  
  
Fly away  
Upon the wings of love  
Though I'll be here again tomorrow  
  
Like an angel  
Falling softly upon her knees  
Calling to me  
Hear her gently sighing pleas  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
But I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart  
  
I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back  
I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack  
And I care if you forget about me  
And I cry  
And I cry  
'Til you take it all from my heart

Like a bubble that's floating  
On high above  
I won't break down  
I won't cry  
But the colors are melting  
I am fragile  
  
I've been acting so coldly  
And hope some day  
That you will forgive me  
  
You are the one  
That knows me for who I really am  
It'll all be gone in the morning  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
There's a light at  
The end of the tunnel  
I am crawling slowly  
I am small  
  
What's been up with me lately?  
Hardly know me  
Who's that in the mirror?  
  
You are the one  
That knows my moods of joy and anger  
You've been coping and lonely  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow

Sleepless nights don't bother me at all  
If dawn comes I won't worry  
Something deep inside keeps me awake  
I wish that you were here right beside me, woah  
  
I recall when I was very young  
And could not go to sleep  
My father sang me songs to make me tired  
But memories don't make it easier  
  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me  
  
Now I lie awake and it's no fun  
Tossing and turning  
I'd call you if it weren't so very late  
But telephones don't bring you close to me, woah  
  
I recall the times we stayed up late  
Wide awake but still dreaming  
There was nothing on this earth could make me tired  
But memories don't make it easier  
  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me  
So goodnight wherever you are sleeping  
And I hope that if you dream, if you dream, you dream of me  
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me

Looking in the papers makes me sorry to be human  
A little ray of hope won't hurt at all  
A price on every head and it's cheaper when you're dead  
Quality of life may have to fall  
  
Muffled voices, world in action  
Stir the peaceful, need for longing  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
  
Guess it's human nature to be cruel and heartless  
But that's no reason to shoot him when he's down  
Crawl in on your knees and then bite the hand that feeds  
The cages throw their shadows across the ground  
  
Where's the sense in senseless violence  
Hear the silence too forgiving  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace (grace, grace)  
  
Press your hands in, into the pavement  
Bathed in glory, here's your moment  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
(I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace)  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
(I cannot describe the fear inside my heart)  
  
I cannot describe the fear inside my heart  
(I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace)  
I hereby do swear to live my life in accordance with grace  
(I cannot describe the fear inside my heart)

How many dreams am I looking for in your eyes, in your eyes  
Ooh baby bet it seems that you're reaching down, all alone, on your own  
Dreams are emotion baby, you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know what's in your head, what's on your mind  
I'm searching for your love that's in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
I know I put you on a pedestal in my eyes, in my eyes  
I don't like it when you put me down 'cause it hurts, yeah it hurts  
Win some and lose some baby, you know you gotta try  
  
I feel it my heart and in my soul and through my veins  
Falling from my lips three little words 'I love you'  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
Dive into the ocean baby you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know what's in your head, what's on your mind  
I'm searching for your love that's in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending

I ain't never going home  
Cause I'm having a good time  
I ain't never going home  
Cause my time is come  
  
I'll wait for the winter to lie at my door  
White stretches out before me  
Leads me to the hall  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world to its feet  
  
I ain't never turning back  
Cause I've come this far  
And I'm lost within my tracks  
I will follow the north star  
  
I'll wait 'til the springtime is breathing at my door  
The wilderness before me  
Heeds the lion's roar  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world her hands and her knees  
  
I'll wait 'til the winter is lying at my door  
Time stretches out before me  
A stone's throw from the door  
  
White circles play within my mind  
Ices over and freezes life  
Time will come, time will come, time will fall  
Bringing the world to its feet  
Bringing the world to her hands and her feet  
  
Bringing the world to its feet  
I ain't never going home

Love leave me alone, I've got troubles of my own  
I do believe that I have paid the price  
For all the things I've said and done  
Every little thing that seemed to go wrong  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
Love leave me to sleep, let me wallow in my dreams  
See the icy past fade away  
The dawning of a brand new day  
The echoes of the past that still remind me  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?

Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room  
  
Anytime you're feeling lonely  
Like a ship without a sail  
Anytime that I fall and stumble  
Be my rock where others fail  
  
Anytime that you're feeling lonely  
Come along and be mine only  
All it takes is a little trying  
Please don't you leave me crying  
  
He don't want to know  
Just turn around and go  
  
Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room  
  
Anytime that you're feeling restless  
Take a deep breath and let it go  
Only know that it leaves me breathless  
Anytime that you're feeling low  
  
Anytime that you're feeling lonely  
Come along and be mine only  
I can see your future with me  
Can you fill the need within me?  
  
When I close my eyes  
You're the only one I love  
Take me darling  
  
If he don't want to know  
Just turn around and go  
  
Woah, woah  
There's enough for everybody  
The world she don't mind  
  
Woah, woah  
How my eyes adore you  
As you walk into the room

Don't justify  
For what you are  
And where you've been  
For who you are tonight  
So lonesome tonight  
  
Make believe  
Just hanging on  
You're crazy  
That's who are you tonight  
All over tonight  
  
Tell the world  
You're still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
Falling soft  
But raining hard  
So wrap up well  
It's freezing cold tonight  
So cold tonight  
  
Tell me all  
I need to know  
I'll spare your fears  
So sad to see tonight  
The tears you cry tonight  
  
I stayed away  
A long time now  
But I'll be home tonight  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
(Tonight)  
(All over tonight)  
  
Tell the world  
You're still afraid  
Been on this road too long  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me  
  
I bet you're mad at me  
Can't you read my lips  
I see your eyes of blue  
What you want from me  
It's not the way it should be  
You've got the world to give  
I gave you all my love  
But you're mad at me

How could I have been so cruel  
After all you've done for me  
I should go back to school  
To learn  
The ways  
Of love  
  
I see the tables turn  
Please don't desert me now  
I acted like a fool  
I know  
I just stumble  
Through the night  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though you're my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two (broke it all in two)  
Like a row of paper chains (a row of paper chains)  
My heart's not made of stone (heart's not made of stone)  
Though it seems to be that way  
  
Baby, what can I say?  
You mean the world to me  
Don't throw it all away  
I promise  
I'll change  
One day  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though you're my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two (broke it all in two)  
Like a row of paper chains (a row of paper chains)  
My heart's not made of stone (heart's not made of stone)  
Though it seems to be that way (my heart's not made of stone)  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though you're my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two (broke it all in two)  
Like a row of paper chains (a row of paper chains)  
My heart's not made of stone (heart's not made of stone)  
Though it seems to be that way (my heart's not made of stone)  
  
I broke it all in two (broke it all in two)  
Like a row of paper chains (a row of paper chains)  
My heart's not made of wood (heart's not made of wood)  
Though it seems to be that way  
  
(Heart of woo-oooh-ood)  
(Heart of woo-oooh-ood)

Come and hold me  
And dissolve me  
But I never do what I am told to  
You enthuse me  
Don't abuse me  
At the worst of times you'll never lose me  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't get me wrong  
I can be strong  
When I could fall in love with you  
Don't let me down  
Take me to test  
When I could fall in love with you  
Like a child  
Like a child  
  
I was dreaming  
We were sleeping  
And you held me tight to keep believing  
Don't upset me  
I won't let you  
Fall into a space that's empty  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus x 2]

If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
  
Remember that late night last September when you held me in your arms so
tight?  
I was feeling kind of low, my heart was blue, I was empty 'til you came  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
  
Like a knight in shining armor you came over to save me, what a bolt out of
the blue  
Just one look into those eyes you had me fallen completely head over heels in
love with you  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
  
And you saw me, I was falling head over heels in love with you  
  
Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall  
Did I try to deny we would fall a  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?

Make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know what you're talking about  
I don't believe you go and ever find out for yourself  
Always got a lot to say  
Well I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you care about the consequences  
I don't believe you share in what you know we know is true  
Turning keys and locking doors  
I won't accept that anymore  
Won't accept that anymore  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know about the hearts you've broken  
I don't believe you show what your intentions really are  
Can you hear? What have you done?  
There's not enough for everyone  
Not enough for anyone  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could, you know I would

You are on one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided?  
You are on one side  
I am on the other  
Are we divided?  
Why can't we live together  
There are no rights  
This isn't your decision  
We need to talk of changing things  
But no one wants to listen  
It doesn't have to be like that  
It doesn't have to be like that  
It doesn't have to be like that  
  
A heart on the inside  
The same as any other  
Are we divided?  
Someone always has to suffer  
We are broken  
There's no one left to change it  
Is that the way it has to be?  
Why can't we rearrange it?  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
What is the secret  
In calling me a brother?  
Are we divided?  
Always one against the other  
We are strong now  
Put down the ammunition  
For what we know is right  
Is gonna breakdown this division  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
(One against one)  
(One against one)  
It doesn't have to be like that  
You are one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided?

Don't be naive,  
Don't deny what you see.  
Where lies the truth?  
Hidden deep, in-between.  
Dance through the night,  
From sublime to extreme.  
Lift your voices high,  
From a whisper to a scream.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
Dance through the night,  
From sublime to extreme.  
Lift your voices high,  
From a whisper to a scream.  
You hang your head down low,  
Like a slave to the scene.  
But you'd be pretty and pure,  
Wrapped up, hip in your teens.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
  
There has to be a little passion in your life.  
You've got to put the world to rights,  
Before too long. (before too long)  
When I was young I thought that everything was good,  
But how it slowly fades away...  
  
I'll be going away soon,  
Through the warm,  
Whoa ooh (going away soon)  
To the warm.  
Whoa ooh  
Don't be naive,  
Don't deny what you see.  
Where lies the truth?  
Hidden deep, in-between.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la

I wasn't jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice  
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
(Don't go sharing your devotion)  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what you've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce  
I used to think I was sensible  
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me

It wasn't me that saw you standing by the neon-lit door  
It wasn't me that saw you clinging to somebody I deplore  
Baby, don't show your face, don't move in my direction  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
It wasn't me that heard you whisper a name I'd never heard before  
It wasn't me that heard you steal out to meet behind a secret door  
I've been suspecting, I've done my own detecting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
It wasn't me that saw you pick up a letter fallen on the floor  
It wasn't me that heard you say you couldn't love me anymore  
There's no mistaking, I guess I'll just be waiting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal

  
Before it all gets written down  
You've got to re-arrange to create your own illusion of truth  
Know that it's good and it's real  
Before it all gets written down  
You don't have to face the future alone  
Everybody has to deal with a tricky situation  
Know that it's good and it's real  
Before it all gets written down  
Love me that's all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me it's all you have to be  
To make it right  
You've got your head high up in the clouds  
Know you really got to be a down to earth person  
Know that it's good and it's real  
Before it all gets written down  
You don't have to face the future alone  
Everybody has to deal with a tricky situation  
Know that it's good and it's real  
Before it all starts getting you down  
Love me that's all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me it's all you have to be  
To make it right  
Love me that's all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me it's all you have to be  
To make it right  
You've got your head high up in the clouds  
But you really got to be a down to earth person  
Know that it's good and it's real  
Before it all starts getting you down  
Love me that's all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me it's all you have to be  
To make it right  
Love me that's all you have to do  
All night long  
Show me it's all you have to be  
  
  

On and on and on  
Here's the break of dawn  
Coming through the window, heart  
Pull yourself a chair up, love  
On and on and on  
Quiver like a reed  
Let yourself a go-go, old one  
Honor me a solo, young man  
Careful not to give yourself away  
There is still tomorrow and a heart-felt meaning  
When you get that feeling you'll recall a night of love in motion  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so  
Time is rolling on  
Blending with the mind  
Love the way you tease me, heart  
Tear another layer off, love  
Listen to the stillness of the day  
Drawing ever closer like your heart is beating  
And when I hear it beating I will recall a night of love in motion  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so

Waoh Oh Oh Oh! Waoh Oh Oh Oh! Waoh Oh Oh Oh!  
Waoh Oh Oh Oh! Waoh Oh Oh Oh! Waoh Oh Oh Oh!  
  
I'm crazy flowing over with ideas  
A thousand ways to woo a lover so sincere?  
Love and hate what a beautiful combination  
Sending shivers up and down my spine  
  
For every Casanova that appears  
My sense of hesitation disappears  
Love and hate what a beautiful combination  
Sending shivers up and down my spine  
  
And the lovers that you sent for me  
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee  
So I return them to the sender  
And the note attached will read  
How I love to hate you  
I love to hate you  
I love to hate you  
I love to hate you  
  
Oh you really still expect me to believe  
Every single letter I receive  
Sorry you what a shameful situation  
Sending shivers up and down my spine  
  
I like to read murder mystery  
I like to know the killer isn't me  
Love and hate what a beautiful combination  
Sending shivers make me quiver  
Feel it sliver up and down my spine

Yes I drink away the hurt, and wishing that the ghost would fade away  
There was something more I had to do before you turned and walked away  
Promises broken easily  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Pins and needles climbing up  
The spite of bold cathedrals ever high  
I'm not sure that I could cross this river, I'm not sure I want to try  
Shadows is that's left of you  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Like moths in the night  
Promises broken easily  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Like moths in the night  

"You've done it all  
You've broken every code  
And pulled the rebel to the floor  
You've spoilt the game  
No matter what you say  
For only metal, what a bore  
Blue eyes, blue eyes  
How can you tell so many lies?  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There's nothing left  
All is gone and run away  
Maybe you'll tarry for a while  
It's just a test  
A game for us to play  
Win or lose, it's hard to smile  
Resist, resist  
It's from yourself you'll have to hide  
Come up and see me to make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There ain't no more  
You've taken everything  
From my belief in Mother Earth  
Can you ignore my faith in everything?  
'Cos I know what faith is  
And what it's worth  
Away, away  
And don't say maybe you'll try  
To come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, just running wild"  
Repeat to fade

Stories from the deepest part of my heart  
Delving under, cause to wonder  
Why am I falling apart?  
  
Scattered all around this topsy-turvy room  
Will I find the one who takes me there too soon?  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
Whispered in some lonesome voice, too afraid to come out of the dark  
Sinking down into the covers  
Sleep to the beat of your heart  
  
Spinning all around this most peculiar room  
Will I find the one who takes me there too soon?  
  
Do be kind and civilized and don't descend into the dark abyss  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
Do be kind and civilized and don't descend into the dark abyss  
  
When the night is cold and you can't find anything  
And your will to survive's at an all-time low  
The spirit will fly and return with a new-found energy  
So keep it within and delight as your garden grows  
  
And the man up in the moon is shining  
Good fortune down on me  
And the man up in the moon is shining  
Sweet love  
Sweet love

It won't be easy, it won't be hard  
To find the reason, to find the rhyme  
To get your feet back on the ground  
To get your feet back on the ground  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
  
It won't be out there, it can't be far  
Falls like a teardrop to the star  
A wall of silence all around  
A wall of silence all around  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
  
The miracle of love blinds me with your charms  
The miracle of love, take me in your arms  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love

The night  
Is like a lovely tune  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
How white  
The ever constant moon  
Take care  
My foolish heart  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to find on an moment such as this  
For they all have that very same sensation  
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss  
Your lips  
Are much too close to mine  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
But should  
Our eager lips combine  
Then let  
The fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that could fade and fall apart  
It's love  
This time it's love  
My foolish heart  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to find on an moment such as this  
For they all have that very same sensation  
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss  
Your lips  
Are much too close to mine  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
But should  
Our eager lips combine  
Then let  
The fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that could fade and fall apart  
It's love  
This time it's love  
My foolish heart

I've got her picture  
It's there on the wall  
I can't remember why  
I keep it at all  
The doors are cold and  
All the windows seem gray  
I write the book  
There's so much more I should say  
  
[Chorus]  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
  
And now it's over  
I write it all down  
No one to notice  
One less face in the crowd  
Our eyes are open  
When it suits us to say  
Dear god in heaven  
Show no mercy to me  
  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
Lost for you  
  
I shed no tears  
And there's no reason for shame  
A small consolation  
Hides a stone with her name  
Just a victim  
Still the light shines all bright  
I've got her picture  
Think I'll hold it tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
Lost for you

Turn around, look at what you see,  
in her face, the mirror of your dreams  
Make believe I'm everywhere, hidden in the lines  
written on the pages is the answer to a neverending story, neverending story.  
  
Reach the stars, fly a fantasy.  
dream a dream, and what you see will be.  
Lives that keep their secrets, will unfold behind the clouds.  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story.  
neverending story  
story  
neverending story  
  
Go! Show no fear, for she may fade away.  
In your hand, the birth of the new day.  
Lives that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds.  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story.  
Neverending story  
Neverending story  
Neverending story

Want to be a great dark man  
Being but a lesbian  
You are perfect, you are sheer  
If you are a red-haired queer  
  
That's life, one dice  
C'est la vie, ma cherie  
But it really doesn't matter  
  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
  
There won't be a great dark man  
If I am a red-haired queer  
You are perfect, you are sheer  
If you are a red-haired queer  
  
C'est la vie, pale sniff  
C'est la vie, ma cherie  
But it really doesn't matter  
  
Yellow teeth between pink lips  
Eye-line shadow with a crazy look  
Jewel behind the lobe of ear  
Rouge on my face hides my beard  
Long violet fingernails  
I adore those magic tails  
  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
No G.D.M., no great dark man  
No G.D.M., no great dark man

  
When you touch I love it so much  
Only then do I know that you're mine  
Strangely I long to be  
Just standing here right by your side  
For all the saintly things you've done  
It's not enough to hold you  
When all the changes surely come  
I'm pulling you back to my heart  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes  
I wanna know you're mine  
Don't know why I break down and cry  
When I know that you won't be around  
Come to me I surely be  
Just ready to lay on the ground  
For all the saintly things you've done  
It's not enough to hold you  
When all the changes surely come  
I'm tugging you back to my heart  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes  
I wanna know your mind  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
Our love will eclipse the night  
No more pain no sorrow  
Our love has taken flight  
Nothing lasts forever  
Just a brief glimpse in time  
I see it in your eyes  
  
  

Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
Looking for you,you were looking for me  
Always reaching for you, you were too blind to see  
Oh love of my heart why leave me alone?  
I'm falling apart, no good on my own  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
Why throw it away? Why walk out on me?  
I just live for the day, for the way it should be  
There once was a time I had you here by my side  
You said I wasn't your kind, only here for the ride  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?  
  
No emotional ties, you don't remember my name  
I lay down and die, I'm only to blame  
Oh love of my heart, it's up to you now  
You tore me apart, I hurt inside-out  
  
Oh l'amour  
Broke my heart and now I'm aching for you  
Mon amour  
What's a boy in love supposed to do?

Perchance to dream  
Drive into the waters edge yeah  
Splashing all over me  
Turning my world upside down  
Then I see, and I start to dream as if for the first time  
Suddenly as calm as can be skies full of wonder tears asunder  
Climb through the cold falling up to meet the road  
Something in my head will explode  
Oh baby dream, won't you come and share the world with me  
Time with me  
Tears on gem rocks tear out, tender to strike it with  
The loose rock can satisfy the lights of the soft wood.  
And then I see, and I start to dream marching in new shine  
Stars on my breath scares me the best flickering metal, shadows  
Fly through the air, falling up to brush the clouds  
Static in my hair I'm rushing out  
Oh baby dream won't you come and share the world with me  
Time with me  
And then I see, and I start to breath as if for the first time  
Suddenly, as calm as can be, sky full of wonder tears me under  
Fly through the cold, falling up to meet the road  
Something in my head will explode  
Oh baby dream, won't you come and share the world with me  
Some time with me  
Oh baby dream, won't you come and share the world with me  
Time with me  

Never get angry at stupid people  
Though I go crazy at the dullness of my life  
Sit and I stare through a dusty window  
An empty face stares back at me and cries  
  
My vulnerability rushes up to me  
And I'm left here  
The rebel without a cause  
And the deeper I delve into  
The consciousness of me with you  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
What hurts me most  
I'll never see your eyes again  
  
Though I get weary doesn't mean that I'm unwilling  
My body belies me, I'm a fertile mind  
And as I grow older the world forgets me  
And talks to me as if I'm some kind of child  
  
Their insensitivity washes over me  
'Til I'm left here  
The rebel without a cause  
The deeper I delve into  
The consciousness of me and you  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
  
What hurts me most  
I'll never see your eyes again  
The harder it gets  
I need to close my eyes  
I can't recollect  
I'll never see your eyes again  
I try to forget  
I'll never see your eyes again  
What hurts me most  
I'll never see your eyes again  
  
Don't touch me

The ebb and flow of the tide  
Will carry me forth into your arms  
And though I'll miss you tonight  
The thought of your love keeps me warm  
As the moon comes out over the water  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep  
The river sleeping sound  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
Soul will keep thee, rife and weepy, calling out to you  
The dip and roar of the crowd  
Will dizzy me forth into your arms  
And if we pass it all around  
We'll be of the same point of view  
As the world spins round, here ever after  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep  
The river sleeping sound  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
On a bed of silver sand  
I'll take you lightly by the hand  
And we'll dance on by the moon  
I shall be dreaming deep of you  
Shattered, dreamy, calm and sweetly, fool enough for two  
When the stars play hide and seek  
I shall be dreaming deep of you (I shall be dreaming)  
Precious and too sweet  
I shall pray love your soul to keep (I shall be praying)  
On a bed of silver sand  
I'll take you lightly by the hand (I shall be dreaming)  
And we'll dance on by the moon  
I shall be dreaming deep of you (I shall be praying)

(l. lovich)  
Let's face the music - I think that it's time.  
What's the use, when the future looks so unkind.  
Life and death - the choice we make.  
Revolution - the line in my mind takes.  
Win or lose, hey! what do you say.  
Got to change, change, change, change.  
Check it out and see - there could be a better lifestyle.  
My hopes are big as the sky,  
My dreams are wider than wide.  
One day we'll be absolutely crueltyfree!  
Rage!  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
What is this sad fascination,  
To rip off another's skin.  
Shame! shame! shame!  
Fancy people in furcoat - what a pitiful sight.  
Leather is dead - it's not so nice.  
Rage!  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
Stop! think! before you chew.  
Don't eat a creature, that won't eat you.  
Food for everyone,  
Let's all eat - it's so much fun.  
Let that chicken be! a cow is not a factory!  
Fast food slaughter - a criminal waste.  
We've got to tune ourselves into a new morality.  
Make some improvement on the human race.  
Rage, each time I turn around.  
Rage, it tears my heart apart.  
Rage, each time I see the blood.  
Hey, now! sentimental feelings are just not good enough.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, into the light.  
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,  
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.  
March on! unleash the spirit,  
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.  

Toe to toe, dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotized  
And they're stepping lightly  
  
Hang each night in rapture  
Back to back, sacroiliac  
Spineless movement and a wild attack  
Face to face sightless solitude  
  
And it's finger popping  
Twenty- four hour shopping in rapture  
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly  
DJ spinning I said "My My"  
  
Flash is fast flash is cool  
'Francois c'est pas flashe non due'  
  
And you don't stop sure shot  
Go out to the parking lot  
And you get in your car and drive real far  
And you drive all night and then you see a light  
  
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground  
And out comes a man from Mars  
And you try to run but he's got a gun  
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head  
  
And then you're in the man from Mars  
You go out at night eating cars  
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too  
Mercury's and Subaru  
  
And you don't stop  
You keep on eating cars  
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night  
And eat up bars where the people meet  
  
Face to face  
Dance cheek to cheek  
One to one  
Man to man  
  
Dance toe to toe  
Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars  
He's eating bars  
Yeah wall to wall  
  
Door to door  
Hall to hall  
He's gonna eat 'em all  
Rapture  
Be pure  
  
Take a tour through the sewer  
Don't strain your brain  
Paint a train  
You'll be singing in the rain  
  
Said don't stop to the punk rock  
Toe to toe, dancing very close  
Body breathing almost comatose  
Wall to wall people hypnotised  
  
And they're stepping lightly  
Hang each night in rapture  
Well now you see what you want to be  
Just have your party on TV  
  
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on  
And now he's gone back up to space  
Where he won't have the hassle with the human race  
And you hip hop  
And you don't stop  
  
Just blast off  
Sure shot  
Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars  
And eating bars  
And now he only eats guitars  
  
Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Rapture  
Rapture  
Rapture

Don't walk away  
I need you more than words can say  
I feel for you, this everlasting flame  
My everlasting flame  
  
I will wash away your tears  
Through the pain and through the sorrow  
Better days are still to come  
If you would only turn around and  
  
[Chorus]  
Reach out and touch me  
Reach out and hold me  
Reach out and touch me!  
  
You feel the rain  
I feel the tear drops run down my face  
You hide your fear in everlasting shame  
My everlasting flame  
  
We have wasted so much time  
So you're saying now it's over  
Better days are still to come  
Don't turn your back on me now, darling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will wash away your tears  
Through the pain and through the sorrow  
Better days are still to come  
If you would only turn around and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't walk away from me now darling  
I need you now much more than ever  
Don't you walk away from me my darling  
  
Don't walk away from me now darling  
(Reach out and touch me)  
I need you now much more than ever  
(Reach out and hold me)  
Don't you walk away from me my darling  
(Reach out and touch me!)

Love is cast ornately in your heart flame  
Chakra wheels are turning like a love train  
  
I could pray a hundred times  
Keep these demons from my mind  
Yeh I could pray a thousand times  
Stay in your lovin' arms entwined  
  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Drivin' the pain right through to my heart  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Ridin' the pain like a fool in the dark  
  
We shall blur the lines of definition  
Waves of love our only ammunition  
  
Tear my head out from the sound  
Throw myself upon the ground  
Take me to the burning tree  
It has this strange effect on me  
  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Drivin' the pain right through to my heart  
Oh that I should be ever so lonely  
Ridin' the pain like a fool in the dark  
  
Fascination never tasted sweeter  
My desire real and soaring freely  
  
You alone can save my soul  
You alone are my salvation  
You alone can make me whole  
Rescue me from condemnation

When I was a little girl  
I had a rag doll  
The only doll I ever owned  
Now I love you just the way  
I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper, love it stays  
And it gets higher until our day  
  
-Chorus:  
And, do I love you my oh my  
Yeah, river deep, mountain high (ya, ya, ya)  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
When you were a young boy  
Did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No I'll never let you down  
  
Cause it goes on and on like a river flows  
It gets bigger baby heaven knows  
It gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  
  
I had a rag doll  
The only doll I ever owned  
Now I love you just the way  
I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper, love it stays  
And it gets higher until our day  
  
Chorus  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
I love you baby like a robin loves to sing  
I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag  
I love you baby river deep, mountain high  
  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
Ah river deep  
  
Chorus

For the first time in my life I'm up to run away  
It's not a choice that I made easily  
  
It's not that I'm ashamed to face the light of day  
It's really just a case of self-delusion  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
That I should fall from grace implies a twist of fate  
But I'm open to the joys and woes of passion  
  
And who shall take the wheel when it's time for overkill?  
There's no release when destiny is calling  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
Somebody reach me  
Willing to teach me  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
I'll run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa

Why should it matter how i feel  
This old romantic down at hill  
Then again, if I'd known the outcome, sure you'd win.  
  
Illusion shattered, made them real  
A night of magic, fate is sealed  
Ran amok, and you knocked my tiny world for six  
  
It wouldn't have made the slightest , blindest bit of difference  
  
[Chorus]  
All together now, lets hear us pray  
Make it better now and savor the day  
I'm all over, save me darling!  
  
I feel it deep down deep inside  
Can not believe we're still alive  
That is good, cause i did not mean you harm, my love  
  
We took a shot at masquerade  
Came crashing down on love's parade  
We were young, were so full of teen emotion then  
  
We couldn't have made the slightest, blindest bit of difference  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We couldn't have made the slightest, blindest bit of difference  
All together  
  
[Chorus]

Say what, make out  
Say what, make out  
  
It's a crazy situation  
Keeps my body hot  
I want infatuation  
Something you ain't got  
  
This fire inside  
A love so bright  
  
[Chorus]  
Say what the hell you think you've done?  
Drive me higher and higher  
Make out there ain't nothing's going on  
Oh you're such a liar  
  
I got no future  
What's the use in keeping tight?  
Always wrapped up in yourself  
Oh you're alright  
Why should I fall?  
No love at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama said you're as good as dead  
If you don't call the shots yourself  
  
Say what  
Love, love, love  
Love don't come easy  
Make out  
  
Why'd you try to fool me  
I see, got no heart  
Threw me tried to rue me  
Tore my head apart  
See you, lover move on  
Seen the right from wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama said you're as good as dead  
If you don't call the shots yourself  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Like a vision flying round this room  
I did feel sure as my time too  
I've been inside your mind in outer space  
  
I feel the city crying, beg for more  
Threw a key chain across your floor  
A soul destroying motion holds your face  
  
Can you feel it?  
Do you want it?  
Do you get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby take my love  
Take my love  
  
A little party let's go deep  
Set your dream free fall at my feet  
I'm falling for you baby like a charm  
  
I never knew that life could be so sweet  
So unusual so complete  
I'm falling like a baby in your arms  
  
Can you feel it?  
Do you want it?  
Do you get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby take my love  
Taste my love  
  
Feel it?  
Want it?  
Get it?  
It's your last chance  
It's the last dance  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little of my love boy  
C'mon baby taste my love  
  
Searching for a better love  
Never mind the weather love  
C'mon taste a little love my love boy  
C'mon baby taste my love  
Take my love

She looks around  
There are snowflakes on the ground  
Here comes another lonely Christmas  
Stars in the night  
There is one there shining bright  
Shine bright for me this lonely Christmas  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
Christmas time comes once a year  
She knows this time he won't be near  
  
She phones her mum  
Says this time she cannot come  
Don't worry I'm with friends this Christmas  
Dad gets upset  
But in time he soon forgets  
Here comes another lonely Christmas  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
Christmas time comes once a year  
She knows this time he won't be near  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you  
  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I want to be with you  
And I wanted to say to you  
How much I need to be with you

I can't believe what is happening to me  
My head is spinning (Spinning)  
The flowers and the trees are encapsulating me  
And I go spinning (Spinning)  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that  
Really didn't know that  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
I close my eyes and I try to imagine  
What you're dreaming  
Why can't you see what you're doing to me  
My world is spinning (Spinning)  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
You were the baby of the class you know  
You were so young and so uncertain  
Suffer little children  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
He was the baby of the class you know  
He really didn't know that one and one was two  
Two and two were four  
He was the baby of the class  
He was so young and so uncertain  
Suffer little children  
Oh what a poor soul  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel  
  
Oooh, do we not sail on the ship of fools  
Oooh, why is life so precious and so cruel

Ever faithful I endure  
To listen for the sound of the siren song  
Ragged whispers of imprisoned sisters  
Cutting through real life drawing me nearer  
  
The colour of the pure in soul  
Like water shall fill the cloudless sky  
  
Try to feel the splendor of it all  
Embrace the honesty of nightfall  
Try to feel the anguish of it all  
Wrap yourself up  
In every facet of emotion  
  
Hearts that cry diamond tears  
Spirits that walk for a thousand years  
Hear them calling on that darkest morning  
Pulling me under, my thoughts disappear  
  
Can you feel love  
Can you feel joy  
Can you feel pain

Welcome to the world  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance  
What you hear, what you hear, what you hear is what you get  
  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance  
What you hear, what you hear, what you hear is what you get  
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah  
  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance  
Free your loving, pleasure of the dance

I close my eyes to the sound in the sky and I see  
Birds in the trees and pastures green  
Nothing to do with the time or the place, I perceive  
The rush of the sea beneath my feet  
  
Such a lovely world, oh so magical  
Precious like a pearl, wrapped up in a shell  
Build your house of stone on a bed of sand  
Time and tide will rise, washing through your hands  
  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
  
I lift my eyes to the sound in the sky and I hear it  
The voice on the breeze is so serene  
Nothing to do with the time or the place but I feel it  
Like dust on the moon beneath my feet  
  
Such a lovely world, oh so magical  
So the story goes, sing the madrigal  
What a lovely world, waxing lyrical  
See the lies unfold, hear the miracle  
  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
Hear your heart  
See the love  
Feel the soul lift up  
  
So the story goes  
The lies and the miracle unfold

Sometimes it's hard to be a woman  
Givin' all your love to just one man  
You have the bad times and he'll have good times  
Doin' things that you don't understand  
But if you love him, you'll forgive him  
For doin' things that you don't understand  
And if you love him, well be proud of him  
'Cause after all, he's just a man  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to come to  
And something warm to cling to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
And give him all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
And give him all the love you can  
Stand by your man

Tempered by greed, tall buildings breathe  
Give a sigh of relief when it's night  
Stirring from sleep, we night owls creep  
Is there any sign of life under this stone?  
  
Star chime, hollow and true  
Love child  
  
Weep for me, and I will set your wheels in motion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
  
Sheltered by creed, one piled on one  
Do you have a little room for one small one?  
  
Light shine, wild and free  
Sunrise  
  
Weep for me, and I will set your wheels in motion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
Stand by me, and I will fill you with devotion  
Walk with me the inner reaches of emotion  
  
Weep for me, the sands of time will fill the ocean  
Keep with me, like a roller on the ocean  
Walk with me, the inner reaches of emotion

We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!

Blinded by the vision  
I turn and face my back to the wall  
Cause I'm locked up in a rhythm  
The prism of a big glitter ball  
  
Wrapped around your finger  
I'm caught up in the middle with you baby  
With some laughter and drinking  
There's very little else I can do  
  
Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you  
I've been making eyes at somebody else  
You're no longer number one  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
You're rushing down  
Like a rollercoaster  
Night on the town  
Gonna make the most of  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning girl  
  
You're pushing and a-shoving me baby  
Like a bitch to the wall  
But you're driving me crazy  
Right up to fever pitch I could fall  
  
When you shine down your love light  
I'm getting blinded by the sights and sounds  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
I will see you  
I will get you  
I will see you  
I will get you  
I will see you  
I will get you  
Then I go and drop a bombshell upon you  
I've been making eyes at somebody baby  
You're no longer number one  
  
She loves the night  
And all that glitters  
Her name in lights  
Around the city  
Don't you mess your life up Sunday girl  
  
You're rushing down  
Like a rollercoaster  
Night on the town  
Gonna make the most of  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning  
We can dance 'til Sunday morning girl

Once upon a time  
Science opened up the door  
We would feed the hungry fields  
Till they couldn't eat no more  
But the potions that were made  
Touched the creatures down below  
And they grew up in a way  
That we'd never seen before  
  
[Chorus]  
Supernature, supernature  
Supernature, supernature  
  
They were angry with the man  
Cause he'd changed their way of life  
And they take their sweet revenge  
As they trample through the night  
For a hundred miles or more  
You could hear the people cry  
But there is nothing you can do  
Even God is on their side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gods will break the ice, and throw it in the air  
The creatures will decide who goes where  
  
How can I explain?  
Things are different today  
Darkness all around, no one makes a sound  
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now  
You can't escape, it's too late  
Look what you've done  
There's no place that you can run  
The monsters made, we must pay  
  
Maybe nature has a plan  
To control the ways of man  
He must start from scratch again  
Many battles must he win  
Till he earns his place on earth  
Like the other creatures do  
Will there be a happy end?  
Now that all depends on you  
  
[Chorus: x2]

On your own, when it all goes wrong, like you're in jail  
Torn in two, threw the blame at you  
Night met reveals  
There is no guarantee, what crazy heart like me  
Should I go curl up and die?  
Surreal  
Precious time is slipping away  
Revealed  
Don't go wishing your life away  
Unreal  
A fortune can spend it on anyway  
A steal  
Precious time is running away  
One line folds and the next strikes gold  
Finds me in jail  
Try to run gotta buy me some free time and bail  
There is no guarantee fool for a hangmans tree  
Should I go curl up and die  
Surreal  
Precious time is slipping away  
Revealed  
Don't go wishing your life away  
Unreal  
A fortune can spend it on anyway  
A steal  
Precious time is running away  
There is no guarantee, what crazy fool like me  
Should I go curl up and die?  

All the miles of glory really nothing to me  
It's our love here, we are invisble again  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
And searching for so long, it will stay with me forever  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
No religion and choruses again  
But it won't leave me desolate and angry  
Are there no poets in politics again  
  
See the window upon the free world closing slowly  
And poor men crawl upon your boney knees again  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
And searching for so long, it will stay with me forever  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Holy roller and passion play again  
On this day that I don't care to remember  
No religion and choruses again  
  
Imagine how it goes, I believe in sweet surrender  
  
I feel lost as a dying rose in embers  
No religion and choruses again  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Are there no poets in politics again  
  
No, I won't ever ask for your surrender  
Holy roller and passion play again  
On this day that I don't care to remember  
No religion and choruses again

Attention!  
Set your atom transmittor at 0-3-5.  
  
You are my sweet, sweet baby.  
You are my sweet, sweet baby.  
You are my sweet, sweet baby.  
You are my...aou!  
  
Aou!  
Attention! ship's computer to bridge.  
You are my sweet machine.  
You are my sweet machine.  
You are my sweet machine.  
Baby, you are my love!  
  
Aou!  
Aou!  
Did you know that i really liked this?  
I must disengage your recreational music.  
You are my sweet, sweet baby.  
You are my sweet machine.  
You are my sweet machine.  
Baby, you are my love!  
  
How did you know that i really liked this?  
Attention! ship's computer to bridge.  
Attention! ship's computer to bridge.

Guess I was a fool to let you see  
Vanity got the better of me  
The loser's got to love  
Caught up in a fantasy  
I'm screaming at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
(The love grabbed a passion fatigue)  
  
Threw me a line to pull me in  
Tripping upon a flight of fancy  
Until the break of dawn  
I never thought to call  
I'm stranded at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
(The love grabbed a passion fatigue)  
  
The loser's got to love  
Caught up in a fantasy  
I'm screaming at the gates of Heaven  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Gotta have some peace of mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
(The love grabbed a passion fatigue)  
  
Tell it to me one more time  
'Till you're blind in the face  
Stop me messing with your mind  
It's OK, good to be angry  
I never meant to make you cry  
See you hurt in this way  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue  
The love grabbed a passion fatigue

We go down  
To a foriegn land  
Dive through the clouds  
You hold the guiding light in your hands  
This must be all that there is  
Times don't come much more beautiful  
You can show me places that my eyes have never seen  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
You could be my angel who just  
Walks out of a dream  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
I have all faith in you  
And these tenderest moments (these tenderest moments)  
We circle low  
Embrace the night as she draws us in  
A holy shroud  
A veil to hide our tenderest moments  
This must be all that there is  
Times don't come much more beautiful  
You can show me places that my eyes have never seen  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
You could be my angel who just  
Walks out of a dream  
I'm followin' you  
Where are you taking me to?  
I have all faith in you  
And these tenderest moments (these tenderest moments)

Call it new technology  
And they use it to burn  
And they show no concern  
Work for their prosperity  
While the big wheels turn  
Now it's too late to learn  
  
Don't upset the teacher  
Though we know he lied to you  
Don't upset the preacher  
He's gonna close his eyes for you  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
  
Father worked in industry  
Now the work has moved on  
And the factory's gone  
See them sell your history  
Where once you were strong  
And you used to belong  
  
There was once a future  
For a working man  
There was once a lifetime  
For a skillful hand yesterday  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
  
There was once a future  
For a working man  
There was once a lifetime  
For a skillful hand yesterday  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Of a broken, of a broken dream

Just you know why  
Why you and I  
Will by and by know true love ways  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes we'll sigh  
Sometimes we'll cry  
And we'll know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
  

However hard they try to hold you back  
So you are stronger  
And there's the slightest ray of hope  
Or glimmer in your eyes  
  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you (love me madly, truly, deeply)  
  
I love you (take another lover)  
(love me madly, truly, deeply)  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you  
Every night you need to satisfy  
Your pangs of hunger  
  
As if your name were written out  
In lights across the sky  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say I love you (love me madly, truly, deeply)  
I love you (take another lover)  
(love me madly, truly, deeply)  
  
Take another lover  
But I will get you in the end  
There will be no other lover (take another lover)  
I will say  
  
However hard they try to hold you back  
So you are stronger  
Take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take another lover  
Take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take ano- take another lover

Lest we forget  
The speed at which the world is turning  
Careering through space and time  
On her fatalistic journey  
  
It scares me half to death  
That we tear ourselves apart  
A war of love or religion  
Close your eyes to the screaming  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession  
Turns the love to anger  
  
East calling west  
Falling onto stony groud  
We are lost in our vision  
We are primitive and fearless  
  
We send our message of confusion  
Across the great divide  
With our eyes full of wonder  
Still the world goes spinning by  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession  
Turns the love to anger  
  
Love is where the dream should lie  
It's not for us to reason why  
Or to ponder over strategy  
  
So come with us and take a ride  
Somewhere in the big blue sky  
Before it's too late, it's too late, it's too late  
  
Hope you find it baby  
What you're lookin' for  
Doesn't really matter  
If you're rich or poor  
'Cause you've had your day  
Yes you had your day  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession?  
Turns the love to anger

I heard you on the wireless back in '52  
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you  
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through  
Oh-a oh  
  
They took the credit for your second symphony  
Rewritten by machine and new technology  
And now I understand the problems you can see  
Oh-a oh  
I met your children  
Oh-a oh  
What did you tell them?  
  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Pictures came and broke your heart  
Oh-a-a-a oh  
  
And now we meet in an abandoned studio  
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago  
And you remember the jingles used to go  
Oh-a oh  
You were the first one  
Oh-a oh  
You were the last one  
  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
In my mind and in my car  
We can't rewind we've gone to far  
Oh-a-a-a oh  
Oh-a-a-a oh  
  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
In my mind and in my car  
We can't rewind we've gone to far  
Pictures came and broke your heart  
Put the blame on VCR  
  
You are a radio star  
You are a radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star

I want him, and I need him,  
And someday someway wooo I'll meet him  
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too  
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do  
  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
When he's near me, I'll kiss him,  
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him  
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care  
And I'll know it's gonna be alright cause we've got so much we share  
  
Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
(Johnny) no no he'll never do  
(Bobby) no it isn't him too  
They would never no they'd never never ever love  
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain)  
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above  
And being so in love  
  
Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh

What a situation  
Senses gone and left me  
Lies are like confetti on the floor  
  
Words are leading nowhere  
Delicate and tender  
Tender hooks that drive me to despair  
  
Storms are blowing  
Winds are calling to me  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
When a lover leaves you  
Cuts you without knowing  
The world just falls apart beneath your feet  
  
Talk is cheap and useless  
Nothing but excuses  
Lies are like confetti in my hands  
  
Storms are blowing  
Winds are calling to me  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried

I'd like to be a child again  
So many things to do  
Playground noise, and colored toys  
And everything brand new  
  
I'd like to be a pirate ship  
In search of hidden gold  
On ocean waves that swim away  
And sail around the world  
  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
I'd like to be a soldier  
A general I would be  
In battle and in glory  
With ten thousand men to lead  
  
I could be most anything  
There is so much to see  
I'd live a different story  
If you were next to me  
  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
I could be most anything  
There is so much to see  
I'd live a different story  
If you were next to me  
  
Where, where  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where, where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend

Where in the world did you go?  
Without a clue, without a word  
What on earth did I do wrong?  
You won't believe how much I hurt  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every day  
Can't you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
Enough to taste of bitterness  
Hits me in the face, someone else's wish  
Here I lay awake, alone  
Just wishing you'd come home  
  
You leave me desolate and torn  
Go and fight in someone else's war  
And so you put us both to shame  
Don't come near me  
Don't you make it go away  
  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
No ones getting younger anyway  
Can't you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
I can't believe the mess we're in  
My sense of humor wearing thin  
Gets away with murder every other day  
Can you hear me, won't you make it go away?  
  
Won't you make it go away?  
Won't you make it go away?

Who needs love like that  
  
There's something going on  
Something not quite right  
There's something strange  
Happening to me  
There's someone at the door  
Hear voices in my head  
It seems things aren't the way  
They ought to be  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
  
It seemed so clear before  
I held my point of view  
I kept my conversation  
Never changed  
Now it's all gone wrong  
Words are kind of hard  
Nothing else around me  
Looks the same  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)  
  
I'd like to understand  
Like to find out why  
I can't remember all  
The lines that you said  
But then I see your face  
And nothing really counts  
Don't tell me now  
This feeling will stay  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)  
  
Who needs love like that  
Who needs love like that  
Love can turn you upside-down  
And leave you cold  
It's plain to see  
You're losing all control  
(Losing all control)

Can't you see  
I love you  
Please don't break my heart in two  
It's not hard to do  
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart  
  
And if you say goodbye  
Then I know that I would cry  
Surely I would die  
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart  
  
There's no strings upon this love of mine  
It was always you from the start  
Treat me nice  
Treat me good  
Treat me like you really should  
I'm not made of wood  
And I don't have a wooden heart  
  
Muss I denn, muss I denn  
Zum stadtele hinaus  
Stadtele hinaus  
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier?  
  
Muss I denn, muss I denn  
Zum stadtele hinaus  
Stadtele hinaus  
Und du, mein schat, bleibst hier?  
  
There's no strings upon this heart of mine  
It was always you from the start  
Sei mir gut  
Sei mir gut  
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst  
Wie du wirklich sollst
