Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday

What else should I be  
All apologies  
What else could I say  
Everyone is gay  
What else could I write  
I don't have the right  
What else should I be  
All apologies  
  
In the sun  
In the sun I feel as one  
In the sun  
In the sun  
Married  
Buried  
  
I wish I was like you  
Easily amused  
Find my nest of salt  
Everything's my fault  
I take all the blame  
Aqua seafoam shame  
Sunburn, freezer burn  
Choking on the ashes of her enemy  
  
In the sun  
In the sun I feel as one  
In the sun  
In the sun  
Married  
Buried  
Married  
Buried

You need a path to cross  
Into a place where everyone you see  
Has had a time to try to Play!  
  
If you go get shot  
When you'll be what you name  
Protector of your gun  
Everyone plays with your gun  
  
Way, way, way, way  
Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain  
Want to see you try to play  
I want to describe you  
Put your name as a national woman  
I don't like your coffee  
I want to have your friendship  
As a jock, and to the top  
  
Way, way, way, way

Out here in the fields  
I fight for my meals  
I get my back into my living  
I don't need to fight  
To prove I'm right  
I don't need to be forgiven  
  
Don't cry  
Don't raise your eye  
It's only teenage wasteland  
  
Sally ,take my hand  
Travel south crossland  
Put out the fire  
Don't look past my shoulder  
The exodus is here  
The happy ones are near  
Let's get together  
Before we get much older  
  
Teenage wasteland  
It's only teenage wasteland  
Teenage wasteland  
Oh, oh  
Teenage wasteland  
They're all wasted!

I see a bad moon rising  
I see trouble on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightnin'  
I see bad times today  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
It's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a blowin'  
I know the end is commin' soon  
I fear rivers over flowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
Hope you got your things together  
Hope you are quite prepared to die  
Looks like we'er in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye

Beans, beans, beans.  
Jessie had some beans.  
He was happy, happy, happy,  
And he ate some beans.  
  
Naked, naked, naked,  
Sitting cross-legged.  
Naked, naked, naked,  
And he was happy, happy, happy,  
And he ate some beans.  
  
Wine, wine, wine.  
Jessie had some wine.  
He was happy, happy, happy,  
And he ate some wine.  
  
Beans, beans, beans.  
Daddy ate some beans.  
And he drank some wine.  
And he was happy, happy, happy,  
And he dranks some beans.

She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born  
She should have worn the crown of thorns  
  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have made her mother proud  
She should have stood out in the crowd  
She should have fallen on her stance  
She should have had another chance  
  
[Repeat x2]  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born

She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son

Why doesn't she need him for a father?  
Not only maidens can occupy my shack  
Goring my manhood turns a man off.  
Like Pepe LePew would say,  
Hey, hey, hey! -- then we clash!  
  
I got my diddly spayed  
  
She laughs about it.  
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right.  
Jacking themselves off polyester.  
I wanna jump, this isn't right!  
Hey, when am I getting it back?  
  
I don't know why,  
I got a joke too silly to say.  
Don't touch the balls.  
I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking hate!  
  
If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly. (If your world is getting ugly)  
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.  
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.  
Feeling can't help me romp  
Bill just fuck me, take me anal  
Billy's slit reminds me of someone.  
I'm sick of paying for the love boat  
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope  
And I say look!  
  
I got my penis spayed,  
I got a little tail,  
  
I got my dingaling spayed  
Nothing hard  
I gotta be around pussy  
Don't let me fall  
I got a heh-heh...well you can't live  
We got my dingaling spayed  
When ya gonna learn?

Big cheese make me

You really like my limousine  
You like the way the wheels roll  
You like my seven inch leather heels  
And goin' to all of the shows  
  
But...  
Do you love me?  
Really love me?  
Do you love me?  
  
You like the credit cards and private planes  
Money can really take you far  
You like the hotels and fancy clothes  
And the sound of electric guitars  
  
You really like rock 'n' roll  
All of the fame and the masquerade  
You like the concerts and studios  
And all the money honey that I make  
  
Your backstage pass and black sunglasses  
Make you look just like a queen  
Even the fans they know your face  
From all of the magazines

Baby you're going Down In The Dark  
Show my lonely night is fallen and I don't have very long  
Think [I] might of broke my boil  
Within my face might burn  
You're gonna make it better for a little while  
  
Baby you're gonna die someday  
See you in your crowded wasted , then you start to fade  
That when we start singing faster  
I wouldn't wait so long  
Won't get any easier in the Dark  
  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeahh  
You Will, You Will, You Will....

Portray sincerity  
Act out of loyalty  
Defend your true country  
Wish away the pain  
Hand out lobotomies  
To save little families  
Surrealistic fantasy  
Bland boring plain  
  
Hold me down in restitution  
Living out your date with fusion  
Is the whole fleece shun in master?  
Don't feel guilty, master writing  
  
Somebody said that they're not much like I am  
I know I can  
Make enough of the words for you to follow along  
I sink and then some  
  
Slippery pessimist hypocrite master  
Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard  
Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth  
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst  
  
Hold me down in restitution  
Living out your date with fusion  
Is the whole fleece shun in master?  
Don't feel guilty, master writing  
  
Somebody said that they're not much like I am  
I know I can  
Make enough of the words for you to follow along

One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"  
I don't care what you think unless it is about me  
It is now my duty to completely drain you  
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
I like you  
  
With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil  
You've taught me everything without a poison apple  
The water is so yellow  
I'm a healthy student  
Indebted and so grateful  
Vacuum out the fluids  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
I like you, you, you, you, you, you  
  
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"  
I don't care what you think unless it is about me  
It is now my duty to completely drain you  
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
Sloppy lips to lips  
You're my vitamins  
I like you

Silence  
Here I am  
Here I am  
Silent  
  
Bright and clear  
It's what I am  
I have  
Died  
  
Uhhhh  
Uhhhh  
Uhhhh  
Uhhhh  
  
Death  
With violence  
Excitement  
Right here  
  
Died  
Go to hell  
Here I am  
Right here  
  
Ow  
  
No mas  
No mas  
No mas  
No mas  
  
Death  
Is what I am  
Go to hell  
Go to jail  
  
In back of that  
Crime  
Here I am  
Take a chance  
Dead  
  
Die  
Other interpretations possible.

Bell on door clanks, come on in  
Floyd observes my hairy chin  
Sit down chair, don't be afraid  
Steamed hot towel on my face  
  
I was shaved [x3]  
  
Barney ties me to the chair  
I can't see, I'm really scared  
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip  
Pee-pee pressed against my lips  
  
I was shaved [x3]  
(In a way)  
I sense others in the room  
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume  
They take turns and cut me up  
I die smothered in Andy's clutch  
  
I was shaved [x3]

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid  
It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way  
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the
same  
I miss the comfort in being sad  
In her false withness, we hope you're still with us,  
To see if they float or drown  
Our favorite patient,  
A display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound  
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,  
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground  
I miss the comfort in being sad

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing  
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard.  
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend.  
My shyness, pet her flow.  
  
She's only been five months late,  
Even though we haven't had sex for a week.  
  
A meal a day, a meal, I say.  
And my heart's made my  
  
Somebody else already used the word aurora borealis.  
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer.  
  
She's only five weeks late,  
And I haven't had a date forever  
Ever...ever...forever!  
  
Wish I had more...more opportunity,  
More chances to remember some things  
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my...  
On my...on my, um...ah, on my...um...um...head.  
  
We'd have so much more diversity,  
And so much more input, so much more creative flow,  
If we had someone in school, a (GIT)...  
  
GIT...geeks...in...town.  
Ha!...Come on, Dave, think of one...  
Girls In Trouble  
It should be GIC, geeks with Charvels  
No, GWC  
  
Fuck, man, this is a waste of time!  
One more solo? Yeahhh! Yeaaaahh!  
  
You're personally responsible for...  
The entire strip...to be washed away...  
Cleansed...as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol  
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire.  
  
It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.  
  
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom,  
And his...silk...  
And he...he erected a beautiful city  
A city of stars.

I was born in the wagon of a travelling show  
My momma used to dance for the money they'd throw  
Poppa would do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Picked up a boy just south of Mobile  
Gave him a ride filled him with a hot meal  
I was sixteen he was twenty one  
Rode with us to Memphis  
And poppa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
  
Yip!  
Yahoo!  
  
She was born in the wagon of a travelling show  
Her momma had to dance for the money they'd throw  
Grandpa'd do whatever he could  
Preach a little gospel  
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good  
  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
We'd hear it from the people of the town  
They'd call us  
Gypsies tramps and thieves  
But every night all the men would come around  
And lay their money down  
Blahblahblahblah....  
Fuck it  
Fuck it all

Help him, he's fucking cornered  
Degrade him it might be fun  
  
Lightning fucking around in my head, etc  
Hold me, something's happening  
Help me, somebody help me  
Hold me, I'm fucking hungry  
Help me, I'm right here, who are you?  
  
Naked man you say you saw  
Fed them, to the pigeons  
Help him, he's fucking cornered  
Grade him, it might be fun  
  
Lightning fucking around in my head, etc...  
Help me, I'm fucking hungry  
Help me, I'm fucking up  
Hold me, some fucking help

Runny nose and runny yolk  
Even if you have a cold still  
You can cough on me again  
I still haven't had my fulfill  
  
In the someday what's that sound?  
  
Broken heart and broken bones  
Think about some capsules of horse pills  
One more quirky cliched phrase  
You're the one I wanna refill  
  
In the someday what's that sound?  
  
Most people don't realize  
That two large pieces of coral,  
Painted brown, and attached to his skull  
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer

Even if you own a wife  
Even if you like in my state  
I could never want a bribe  
I've been there no matter what that  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday  
  
Even if you wanted light  
I could never matter to play  
Even if you want a life  
Even if I like it you're sad  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
  
Even if you own a wife  
Even if you wanted, one thing  
I could never want a life  
I could never only, one day  
  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound  
In the Sunday with my sound

I can read, I can write  
I can breed, proven plight  
Nurse my greed, crease infold  
Is it me, or my ego  
Write some words, make them rhyme  
Thesis or story line  
Set the mood, something new  
Is it me, or my attitude  
  
If you want to put off an image  
The extremes, the extremes  
Act it out  
Practicing  
Perfecting  
Pressuring  
Onto me  
  
I will wade in the fire  
To explain your asylum  
Idle times, analyzing  
We'll compare all our sightings  
You must  
  
I speak to hear my voice

I don't care, I don't care, I care,  
I care, I care, I care if I'm old  
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind,  
I mind, I mind, a mind of my own  
Get away, get away, away, away, away, away from your home  
I don't mind, I don't mind, I mind,  
I mind, I mind, yeah...  
  
If you have, even if you need  
I don't even care, we could have a tree  
We could plant a house, we could build a tree  
I don't even care, we could have a tree  
She said, she said, she said, she said  
She said, she said, she said, she said

Get away, get away, away, away, away, away from your home  
I don't mind, I don't mind, I mind, I mind, I mind, yeah...

He is gonna chase you in and out of a dream  
You're not gonna thank him and I'm tired of this dream  
Take him on occassion in the back of the room  
If they don't show any affection he'll died in June  
  
See the stab wounds in his hands  
See him dying in his room  
He's dying in his room  
He's dying in his room  
Heading for me, heading this way  
He is coming, I don't care  
  
I don't want to thank you, well I don't mind  
Gave his only pleasures to a friend of mine  
He's not gonna catch you in a lighted room  
You don't thank him I know I should  
  
See the stab wounds in his hands  
You killed him, I don't care  
Keep a promise, you would too  
Keep a promise, you would too  
See the silence in his head  
He is coming, I don't care  
  
We're not gonna make it, well I don't mind  
They don't want to thank him, they don't have any time  
In a conversation whom they don't know  
They don't have any patience, they're becoming slow  
  
See a famine in his head  
See him coming at their heels  
He loves you, give him a chance  
I don't love him, I don't care  
See him starving, give her hell  
It is over, we don't care In His Room

Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam  
Sunbeams are never made like me  
  
Don't expect me to cry,  
For all the reasons you had to die  
Don't ever ask your love of me  
  
Don't expect me to cry  
Don't expect me to lie  
Don't expect me to die for me  
  
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam

I'm long gone from vertical, somewhere south is stopping me  
I'm long gone from the american dream, you may decide it's not for me  
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's not for you.  
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide there's nothing there  
Born in a junkyard  
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide that it's not good  
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stopping me  
I'm long gone but I'll let you through, you may decide it's not that good  
I'm long gone but I'll let you leave, you may decide on stopping me.  
Born in a junkyard  
Gone

[Chorus:]  
Where do bad folks go when they die?  
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly  
They go down to the lake of fire and fry  
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July  
  
I knew a lady who came from Duluth  
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth  
She went to her grave just a little too soon  
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now the people cry and the people moan  
And they look for a dry place to call their home  
And try to find some place to rest their bones  
While the angels and the devils  
Fight to claim them for their own

I'm so happy 'cause today  
I have found my friends  
They're in my head  
I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you  
We've broken our mirrors  
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care  
And I'm not scared  
Light my candles, in a daze  
'Cause I've found god  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head  
And I'm not sad  
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard  
And I'm not sure  
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there  
But I don't care  
I'm so horny, but that's okay  
My will is good  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I like it, I'm not gonna crack  
I missed you, I'm not gonna crack  
I love you, I'm not gonna crack  
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack  
  
I like it, I'm not gonna crack  
I missed you, I'm not gonna crack  
I love you, I'm not gonna crack  
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack  
  
I'm so happy 'cause today  
I've found my friends  
They're in my head  
I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you  
We've broken our mirrors  
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care  
And I'm not scared  
Light my candles in a daze  
'Cause I've found God  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I like it, I'm not gonna crack  
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack  
I love you, I'm not gonna crack  
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack

Truth covered in security  
I can't let you smother me  
I'd like to but it couldn't work  
Trading off and taking turns  
I don't regret a thing  
  
I've got this friend, you see  
Who makes me feel  
And I wanted more  
Than I could steal  
I'll arrest myself  
And wear a shield  
I'll go out of my way  
To prove I still  
Smell her on you  
  
Don't, tell me what I wanna hear  
Afraid of never knowning fear  
Experience anything you need  
I'll keep fighting jealousy  
Until it's fucking gone  
  
I've got this friend, you see  
Who makes me feel

Smell her on you

To make you a deal  
We've make a pact  
To learn from who  
Ever we want  
Without new rules  
We'll share what's lost and what we grew  
They'll go out of their way  
To prove they still  
Smell her on you  
They still, smell her on you  
Smell her on you

I really love you baby  
I love what you've got  
Let's get together, we can  
Get hot  
No more tomorrow, baby  
Time is today  
Girl, I can make you feel  
Okay  
  
No place for hidin' baby  
No place to run  
You pull the trigger of my  
Love gun, love gun  
Love gun, love gun  
  
You can't forget me baby  
Don't try to lie  
You'll never leave me, mama  
So don't try  
I'll be a gambler, baby  
Lay down the bet  
We get together, mama  
You'll sweat  
  
No place for hidin' baby  
No place to run  
You pull the trigger of my  
Love gun, love gun (repeated several times)

He's there in case I want it all  
He's scared cause I want  
He's scared in case I want it all  
He's scared cause I want  
All in all the clock is slow  
Six color pictures all in a row  
Of a marigold

He's scared cause I want  
He's there in case I want it all  
He's scared cause I want

Oh, it's your face, it isn't even  
True the jaws and claims  
You entertain and chew the fungus mold  
Is my intraction  
Oh, it's only a, it is infection.  
Only her tonight, until I pay  
Only her tonight, I fell asleep  
Oh, coming from, the diarrhea  
Oh, her tired form  
I come in peace and live a dirty book  
On the cloudy class, fender burn, and become a childhood mess  
Only her tonight, until I plea  
Only her tonight, until I sing  
Oh, take me back, lets just concise some  
Flies, bugs and fleas and even meal can't  
Stain the vaseline  
It's headed burger's out  
In case it learns and takes it's childhood such

Fill me in on your new vision  
Wake me up with indecision  
Help me trust your mighty wisdom  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Show me how you question, questions  
Lead the way to my temptation  
Take my hand and give it cleaning  
As I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Easy in an easy chair  
Poop as hard as rock  
I don't like you anyway  
Seal it in a box  
  
Now you  
Damn you  
  
Fill me in on your new vision  
Wake me up with indecision  
Help me trust your mighty wisdom  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Show me how you question, question  
Lead the way to my gestation  
Take my hand and give it cleaning  
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud.  
  
Easy in an easy chair  
Poop as hard as rock  
I don't like you anyway  
Seal it in a box  
  
Now you  
Damn you  
Now you  
Damn you

You're always dancing down the street  
With your suede blue eyes  
And every new boy that you meet  
He doesn't know the real surprise  
Here she comes again  
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky  
She'll make you flip  
Here she comes again  
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky  
You kinda like the way she dips  
  
She's my best friend's girl  
She's my best friend's girl  
  
And she used to be mine  
You've got your nuclear boots  
And your drip dry glove  
And when you bite your lip  
It's some reaction to love

If I had to lose a mile  
If I had to touch feelings  
I would lose my soul  
The way I do  
  
I don't have to think  
I only have to do it  
The results are always perfect  
And that's old news  
  
Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth?  
  
I can't see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me  
  
If I had to lose a mile  
If I had to touch feelings  
I would lose my soul  
The way I do  
  
I don't have to think  
I only have to do it  
The results are always perfect  
And that's old news  
  
Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth?  
  
I can't see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
  
(x2)  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me

She seems to think, she seems too week  
She takes a week to get over it  
  
She likes the sea, she likes to see  
She likes to think she has all of it  
  
She likes the sound, she likes the sand  
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit  
  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
She's into guilt  
Guilt  
Guilt  
Guilt  
  
She likes to think, she likes to drink  
She seems too weak, she takes all the rent  
  
She likes the time, she owns the time  
She borrows time, to self-invent  
  
She seems too weak, she likes to see  
She likes to think she has all of it  
  
She likes the sand, she likes to stand  
She likes to sit, she likes to go

Wondering how I'm gonna find a way  
It's over  
  
One more day to complete my service  
One more time here to fade my servant  
One more day if I find a way  
Over

And I know a later time  
We could make it with you  
Leave the soul

She seemed to read minds  
And I know we were out of time  
Breathe the way here with you  
Dream the same on the dew  
Breathe the same on her

Breathe the shame on you  
Breathe the lie  
  
Old age

Take a step outside yourself  
And turn around  
Take a look at who you are  
It's pretty scary  
So silly  
Revolting  
You're not much  
You can't do anything  
Take a step outside the city  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is revolting  
You're really nowhere  
So wasteful  
So foolish  
Poppycock  
Who said don't look back?  
Don't believe 'em  
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant  
Cause they're gonna try and get behind you  
Don't you let them do it  
You know what I'm talking about?  
You hear me talking?  
You hear me talking?  
It's pretty scary it's so revolting  
Take a step outside the country  
And turn around  
Take a look at what you are  
It is amazing  
Take a good look  
You're no big deal  
You're so petty  
It's lots  
Take a step outside the planet  
Turn around and around  
Take a look at where you are  
It's pretty scary

This song is for lovers out there  
And the little light in the trees  
And all the flowers have gingivitis  
And the birds fly happily  
We're together once again my love  
I need you back oh baby baby  
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start  
Living without you girl you'll only break my heart...  
I can feel it I can hold it I can rub it I can shape it  
I can mold it I can cut it I can taste it I can spank it  
Beat it  
Masturbate it  
I been looking for days now  
Always hearing the same ol' city boy  
Won't you spank through?  
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could

As soft as a mouth (or "when the sorrow's loud")  
It'll soon have the cheese  
All flowers are there my love  
All the girls I have bleed  
We're together once again my love  
Will you be back, oh baby, baby  
  
I can't splange us sad, we lost it from the start  
Living without you girl, you only bring my heart, now!!!  
  
I can feel it, I can howl  
I can pet it, shave it, mould it,  
I can cut it, I can paste it, spank it  
Beautify you, weigh it.  
  
I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could.  
  
I can feel it, I can hold it,  
Pet it, shave it, mould it,  
He can cut it, he can paste it, Spank it,  
Beautify you, weigh it  
  
I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could.  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever, you wouldn't think it ever
could.

Monkey see, monkey do

I'd rather be deal than cool

Throw it out and keep it in  
(I don't know why)  
Have to have poison skin  
(I don't know why)  
  
Stay

God is gay

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable  
They travel far to keep their stomachs full  
They make their living off of arts and crafts  
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap  
They make a deal when they come to town  
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground  
She loves him more than he will ever know  
He loves her more than he will ever show  
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart  
Keeps her photographs close to her heart  
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when  
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend  
Which came as a surprise I spoke into his eyes  
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago  
  
Oh no, not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home  
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed  
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here  
We must have died along, a long long time ago  
  
Who knows? Not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world  
  
Who knows? Not me  
We never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the man who sold the world

I'm goin' to Hollywood, they'll see that I'm so good  
I won't care how I feel, and I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
I want to be a star, I'm going to have a car  
And you'll have to admit, I'll be rich as shit  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
I would give you some, if you only would have treated me nice  
You'll wish that you did, you'll feel pretty stupid  
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
It's fun to be a star, it's nice to have a car  
Yeah, you'll have to admit, that I'll be rich as shit  
And I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in  
  
The money will roll right in

It's an alliance...  
It's another lie... I'd say  
  
Fall in love tonight  
Even if my eyes  
Even though sometime  
I'm burning out tonight  
  
It's another thing that I'll write  
Feeling like I'll die by myself  
Why?  
  
It's mad enough tonight  
And for it's never cold  
  
It's not a right  
When I can, nevermind  
It's all mine...  
It's all mine...  
Inside I hide  
  
But I'd never mind...  
  
Then... I said...  
Minerals will make... The world  
If we did not have chemicals  
You would not be writing my...  
Death...  
Certificate  
  
Fighting is my friend  
My dog left me  
Yes I'm sad  
One more day, then I can climb inside, safe from you?  
  
Fighting isn't my friend  
When I will never have my friend  
Fighting silence as a friend  
I'm silent and I can't turn it around  
  
And she improvised  
Cause she was supervised  
And I was idolized  
I was idolized  
For those... For those... For those...  
I was aroused and fucked  
  
Finally...  
And I...  
Was in my trap  
And I...  
Another guy  
And a knife...  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
It's hard and boiled  
  
And sour, all again  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
It revolves, it revolves  
It revolves and around  
And over all  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
Liver and bones  
With the Ramones  
Come out and smile  
And I'll watch when  
  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your shit  
My milk is your  
My milk is your  
My milk is your shit  
  
My milk is it  
Psst... Got to get all of it  
Cause I can't fight

They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross for me  
  
They whooped him up the hill  
They whooped him up the hill  
They whooped him up the hill  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They whooped him up the hill for me  
  
He never said among them word  
They never said among them word  
They never said among them word  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
For me  
  
They bit him in the side  
They bit him in the side  
They bit him in the side  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross for me  
  
He hung his head and died  
He hung his head and died  
He hung his head and died  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross

I'm not gonna make it through  
Something else is something new  
I'm not gonna make it dream  
Suicide is something mean  
I'm not gonna make it through  
It's something else, it's something new  
I'm not gonna make it through  
It's something else, it's something new  
Born in a Junkyard  
  
I'm not gonna make it through  
Something else is something new  
I'm not gonna make it scream  
Suicide is something mean  
I'm not gonna make it through  
Something else, it's something new  
I'm not gonna make it dream  
In this house it's something mean  
  
Hold it in your gut.

May day, every day, my day  
Could've had a heart attack, my heart  
We don't know anything, my heart  
We all want something fair, my heart  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart  
Queen of lies, today, my heart  
One more on the phone, my heart  
One more at the door of my heart  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Mean heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
  
Yeah

I said I want to fuck you inside  
I said I want to fuck you aah  
I said I want to meet you

Can all it be impossible  
When a villain in the face of god  
On a sunday  
  
And I feel like a motivation  
I'm on a mission to kill myself  
  
Yes she is my skinhead girl

She's gonna take me for a whirl  
Yes she is my skinhead girl  
Yes she is my little pet  
  
Make ready for affection  
But I met my love  
  
Originally by unrest

I would never bother you  
I would never promise to  
I will never follow you  
I will never bother you  
Never say a word again  
I will crawl away for good  
  
I will move away from here  
You won't be afraid of fear  
No thought was put into this  
I always knew it would come to this  
Things have never been so swell  
And I have never failed to fail  
  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
  
It's so warm and calm inside  
I no longer have to hide  
There's talk about someone else  
Steaming, soon begins to melt  
Nothin' really bothers her  
She just wants to love herself  
  
I will move away from here  
You won't be afraid of fear  
No thought was put into this  
I always knew it'd come to this  
Things have never been so swell  
And I have never failed to fail  
  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
Pain  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know you're right  
You know your rights  
You know your rights  
You know your rights  
Pain
