If this is the life you crave honky tonks night and day  
Well I guess I have to learn to like it too  
I'll try hard to be like you I wanna do the same you do  
I'll meet you on your side of town because it's you  
I could never love another if we go down we'll go together  
I wanna ride where the tight care is you  
Where the wine and liquor flow stay there till it's time to close  
Right or wrong I'll tag along because it's you  
[ steel ]  
I could never love another...  
Right or wrong I'll tag along because it's you  
  
  

Today is a far cry from yesterday for yesterday the love was mine I need today  
I've walked on many miles since you've been gone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window and the phone you'll find me waiting here all
alone  
I've thought about leaving but I'd go right on grieving  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
If the phone should ring I wonder what I'd say  
Would I tell you that I love you in the same sweet way  
If you look through the window I'll be home  
Somewhere between the window and the phone  
Somewhere between the window...

Who's that sneakin' down the fire escape  
Who's that peekin' through the garden gate  
Who's on the loose but can't be found Big Daddy's Alabamy bound  
Big Daddy's Alabamy bound Big Daddy's Alabamy bound  
Police is searching but he can't be found Big Daddy's Alabamy bound  
Somebody ran off with the major's wife somebody tried to take the sheriff's
life  
Somebody stalled the judge's ragged old gown Big Daddy's Alabamy bound  
Big Daddy's Alabamy bound...  
[ banjo ]  
Highway patrol and the FBI is out a huntin' this criminal  
They got their hound dogs sniffin' the ground Big Daddy's Alabamy bound  
Big Daddy's Alabamy bound...

You just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
You've thrilled at the thought of each stranger's arms you find  
Everything that's yours to hold just can't satisfy your mind  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
If you had me in a mansion filled with gold  
If I lay at your feet my heart and my soul  
You'd still crave the grapes on your next door neighbor's vine  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
  
You just gotta walk...  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line

Now if you love me please don't tease  
If I can hold then let me squeeze  
My heart goes round and round  
My love comes a tumblin' down  
You leave me ah  
Breathless ah!  
I shake all over and you know why  
I am sure its love honey that's no lie

Cause there's just no more dreams...

Got in a little trouble at the county seat  
Lord they put me in the jailhouse for loafing on the street  
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man  
He said forty five dollars or thirty days in the can  
That'll be cash on the barrelhead son you can make your choice you're twenty
one  
No money down no credit plan no time to chase you cause I'm a busy man  
  
Found a telephone number on a laundry slip  
I had a good hearted jailer with a six gun hip  
He let me call long distance she said number please  
And no sooner than I told her she shouted out at me  
That'll be cash on the barrelhead son not parting cash but the entire sum  
No money down no credit plan cause a little bird tells me you're a traveling
man  
  
Thirty days in the jailhouse four days on the road  
I was feeling mighty hungry my feet a heavy load  
Saw a greyhound coming stuck up my thumb  
Just as I was being seated the driver caught my arm  
That'll be cash on the barrelhead son this old gray dog is paid to run  
When the engine stops and the wheels won't roll  
Give me cash on the barrelhead I'll take you down the road

You've been playin' it cool

And this ain't no ice cube that you're with tonight  
So don't you dish me out the cool love  
(Give me that cool love)  
It don't move me at all  
(Move me at all)  
And if you'd live it up, baby

There's a cowboy that I know ridin' in the rodeo  
He's a feller that I'm fondest of  
I love him and he loves me and that's the way it ought to be  
But he drives me crazy when we're makin' love cause he always starts to yodel
(yodel)  
Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin' bright  
And I knew I was under his spell  
He was gazin' in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs  
Then like Tarzan he'd let out a great big yell And he started into yodel
(yodel)  
Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile  
And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit  
When the parson said will you promise always to be true  
My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel (yodel)

Crazy  
I'm crazy for feelin' so lonely  
I'm crazy  
Crazy for feelin' so-o blue-ue  
  
I knew  
You'd love me  
As long as you wanted  
And the-en someday  
You'd leave me  
For somebody new-ew  
  
Worry  
Oh why do I let myself worry  
Wonderin'  
What in the wor-orld  
Did I do-oo-oo-oo-oo  
  
I'm crazy  
For thinkin' that my lo-ove  
Could hold you  
I'm crazy  
For tryin', crazy for cryin'  
And I'm crazy  
For lo-ovin' you  
  
Oh crazy  
For thinking that my lo-ove  
Could hold you  
I'm crazy for tryin'  
And crazy for cryin'  
And I'm crazy  
For lo-ovin' you-ou...

Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man  
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand  
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E  
The words we're hiding from him now tear the heart right out of me  
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today me and little J-O-E will be going
away  
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me  
I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E  
Watch him smile he thinks it's Christmas or his fifth birthday  
Cause he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play  
I spell out all the hurting words and turn my head when I speak  
But I can't spell away this hurt that's dripping down my cheeks  
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today...  
I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E

Tell me did you miss me while I was gone  
did you wanna kiss me when you were alone  
Did you sit and stare at the telephone  
did you miss me while I was gone  
Our love is came so suddenly and still is so new  
I just want to know if you feel like I do  
Did you think about me while I was away and  
did every hour seem like a day  
Was it something inside that you just couldn't say  
did you miss me while I was away  
Our love came so suddenly and still is so new  
I just want to know if you feel like I do  
Tell me did you miss me while I was gone did you wanna kiss me when you were
alone  
Did you sit and stare at the telephone did you miss me while I was gone  

It's over I filled our world with hurt  
I cheated and I lied to you and piled up so much dirt  
Now I'd lost the only one in life I held so dear  
I slowly bury your love in the dirt behind my years  
You had every right to leave as far as I'm concerned  
You gave all your love to me got nothing in return  
You tried and I'll bet you'll cry at least the million tears  
But they just couldn't wash away the dirt behind my years  
You had every right to leave as far as I'm concerned  
You gave all your love to me got nothing in return  
You tried and I'll bet you'll cry at least the million tears  
But they just couldn't wash away the dirt behind my years  

You say, you got a lotta vinegar and spices  
In the kisses that you wanna give to me  
But mama told'a me that sugar is the nicest  
So take your vinegar away and let me be  
(Let her be)  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a your vinegar too

Always can supply me with enough to satisfy me  
So go leave'a me alone, ah  
You know I don'a wan'a  
(Don'a wan'a)  
You say you wan'a me to smoke'a your tobacco  
I've'a gotta me a cigarette too  
You think I wan'a ride your big'a Cadillac'a  
But I will make my little Chevrolet'a do  
(Let it do)  
Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  
Don'a wan'a ride your big'a Cadillac'a too  
I've already got a sugar baby dolly-hoo

Don'a wan'a, don'a wan'a any kisses from you  

(These empty arms I'll have no more)  
Empty arms that long for you and they wait dear just for you  
And these arms will stay this way till you return to them someday  
  
Each lonely night I go to bed I hold the pillow where you used to lay your
head  
Empty arms but not for long cause my baby is coming home  
And when he walks through that door these empty arms I'll have no more  
(These empty arms) I'll have no more (I'll have no more)

Fancy satin pillows that you bought  
For me to place beneath my head  
I must admit they're very nice  
But I would rather have your arms instead  
To have you here beside me just feel your warmth  
So very close is what I need  
More than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows  
I don't mean to be unkind  
But I can't use 'em both and I thought  
Sharing them was what you had in mind  
In the stillness of the night to have your arms  
Reach out and pull me close so tenderly  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows  
I don't mean to be unkind  
But I can't use 'em both and I thought  
Sharing them was what you had in mind  
In the stillness of the night to have your arms  
Reach out and pull me close so tenderly  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  

GET ALL EXCITED  
Writer Bill Gaither  
  
Get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
I said get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
Get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
Jesus Christ is still the king of king's  
Jesus Christ is still the king of king's  
Jesus Christ is still the king of king's  
You talk people  
You talk about you talk about thing's that really aren't important at all  
You talk about weather,  
You talk about problems we have here at home and abroad  
Get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
I said get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
Get all excited go tell everybody that Jesus Christ is king,  
Jesus Christ is still the king of king's

Jesus Christ is still the king of king's  
  

I know what you're doing and I'll save you the trouble  
I saw you wink for the waiter to slip me a double  
If you want some barroom swinger I'm not the one  
'Cause I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out in the world drinking ain't the thing for a sweet
young girl  
I didn't listen then but now I'm here to shout  
That my dear old mama knew what she was talkin' about  
So if you want another round just order one  
'Cause I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
  
Don't bother bringing a bottle when you call  
'Cause I like my kisses straight or not at all  
I want to be sure I remember everyone  
And I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out...  
No I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun

I haven't cried a tear all day and the hurtin's gone away  
Have I finally grown used to mssing you  
In the lonely hours tonight will I long to hold you tight  
For have I finally grown used to missing you  
  
For I must not let go of the greatest love I'll know  
Is there still a change that you'll come back to me  
It would be more than I could take and I know my heart would break  
If I've really grown used to missing you  
  
Oh I must not let go...  
Have I finally grown used to missing you

He is my reason for living he is my everything  
I remember my days of darekness without sunshine or sight to lead my way  
Then a whisper of his voice softly called me to the arms of my Saviour to stay  
He is my reason for living he is the king of all kings  
  
I'm proud to be his possession he is my everything  
After the lightning and the thunder after the last bell has rung  
I want to bow down before Jesus and hear him say well done  
He is my reason for living...  
He is my reason for living he is my everything

The way you treat me baby  
Cheat and tell me lies  
I guess I shouldn't care at all  
But still I sympathize  
  
'Cause you've got heart trouble, comin' on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on  
Well you think that you don't need me baby  
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
You say that love can't touch you  
You feel no pain at all  
You think that you're above it baby  
But I believe you'll fall  
  
'Cause you've got heart trouble, comin' on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on  
Well, you'll get down on your knees baby  
Beggin' me to come back home  
  
You tell me, you'll find someone else  
But on one's gonna care  
'Cause you have left a trail  
Of broken hearts everywhere  
  
Now, you'll got heart trouble comin' on  
Yeah, you'll got heart trouble comin' on  
Well you'll know just how it feels baby  
When you're left here all alone

Just when I think I've forgotten you and our cheating love's at an end  
I vowed to myself I'll see you no more but here we are again  
  
That dimly cafe where I first met you slowly has turned into our secret
randezvous  
Our vows belong to others that makes our love unfair  
But I just can't seem to find a way to end our love affair  
Just when I think I've forgotten you...  
[ guitar ]  
Just when I think I've forgotten you...  

I don't want to hear it no more fussin' and a fightin' baby hold me tight  
Just let bygones be bygones let's think about tomorrow our future's bright  
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see you were the only one
for me  
But now I see the light and everything's gonna be alright baby hold me tight  
[ Pa pa pa pa pa pa ]  
I know I was wrong I was just a fool too blind to see...  
[ Pa pa pa pa pa pa ]  
  
  

Well how come you say you will when you won't tell me you do baby when you
don't  
Let me know honey how you feel tell me truth now is love real oh ah ah no
honey don't  
Yeah honey don't honey don't honey don't honey don't  
Say you will when you won't ah ah honey don't  
Well I love you baby and you ought to know I like the way that you wear your
clothes  
Everythin' about you is a doggone sweet you've got a way to knock me off of my
feet  
So ah ah no honey don't  
Well honey don't...  
Now sometimes I love you on the Saturday night  
But Sunday morning you don't look right  
You've been out to paint the town ah ah baby been slippin' around  
So ah ah no honey don't  
Well honey don't...  
  
  

I got a guy, I like him fine  
But he takes me for granted all of the time  
To teach him a lesson, make him mad  
I went out on a date with the best friend he had  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Oh, late, last night, when I came in  
He demanded to know just where I'd been  
But I really put him right in his place  
Instead of an answer, I laughed in his face  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
He said my heart is on my sleeve  
And if I didn't change that he would leave  
Well, you should've seen him, was his face red  
When I laughed and told him just go right ahead  
That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad  
So he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Well, the moral is to play it cool  
Let your guy know you're nobody's fool  
When he gets to thinking you're all his own  
Let him know that you can take him or leave him alone  
That makes him mad, boy, hot dog, that makes him mad  
And he'll hug you and he'll kiss you and ask you not to do it again  
  
Yeah, he'll hug you and he'll kiss you and he'll squeeze you and please you  
And ask you not to do it again  

I betcha my heart I love ye I betcha my dreams are of ye  
That's why I sing so loud I'm floatin' on the cloud I betcha my heart I love
ye  
I woke up this morning so early remembered your hair was curly  
I rolled over and then I dreamed of you again I betcha my heart I love ye
(yodel)  
[ guitar ]  
I'm out of this world I betcha it started the day I metcha  
When you're close to me it's just like TNT I betcha my heart I love ye  
Well I betcha my heart I love ye... (yodel)  
  
  

I kiss him goodnight and tell him I love him then I keep my rendezvous  
Knowing that when I go to sleep I'm gonna dream about you  
I can't make my dreams understand that it's wrong  
To dream about you when with him I belong  
I've made vows to God and I've made vows to man  
But I just can't make my dreams understand  
[ guitar ]  
My fingers are crossed when I say I'm happy but lying just don't make it right  
And each night when I go to sleep I dream you are holding me tight  
I can't make my dreams...

Teardrops fell the night you said  
I love you, dear and you were wed  
I watched you while you held her hand  
Sand I bowed my head and cried again  
I cried again when I reached home  
Then stared your picture all alone  
I've thought of things that might have been  
And I bowed my head and cried again  
I took your letters from the shelf  
And read aloud just to myself  
But just before I reached the end  
And I bowed my head and cried again  
I've thought of nights so long ago  
And all the love I wanted so  
And then the fate had took a hand  
And I bowed my head and cried again  

I can tell him his toy gun won't kill Indians  
And the towel around his neck don't make him strong  
I can tell him there's no Easter bunny  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
He still looks for you every morning he's cried every night we've been alone  
I can tell him there's no real Santa but I don't know how to tell him that
you're gone  
  
I can tell him his broomstick's not a pony  
And wearin' daddy's boots don't make him grown  
I can tell him there's no to ferry  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
Cause he still looks for you...  
I don't know how to tell him that you're gone

(You walk by and I fall to pieces)  
I fall to pieces each time I see you again  
I fall to pieces how can I be just your friend  
(You want me to act like we've never kissed)  
You want me to forget pretend we've never met  
Oh I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet you walk by and I fall to
pieces  
  
I fall to pieces each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces time only adds to the flame  
(You want me to find someone else to love)  
Someone who'll love me too the way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new you walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I GO TO THE ROCK  
Writer Dottie RMBO  
I go to the rock  
Where do I go,  
When there's nobody else to turn to  
Who do I talk to,  
When nobody wants to listen  
Who do I lean on,  
When there's no foundation stable  
I go to the rock  
I know he's able  
I go to the rock  
Chorus:  
I go to the rock of my salvation  
I go to the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend I go to the rock  
Where do I go (x2)  
When the storms of life are threating  
Who do I turn to  
When the winds of sorrow blow  
And is there a refuge in the time of Tribulation  
I go to the rock  
I know he's able  
I go to the rock  
CHORUS (x2)  
I go to the rock (x4)  
You can go to the rock (x4)  
I go to the rock (x6)  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend  
I go to the rock  
  

Well I thought that you were a wantin' romance  
But all you ever do is dance dance dance  
So I boppity bop the whole night long to the knocked out music of a jukebox
song  
One thing I gotta know I gotta know I gotta know  
If our love's the real thing where's my weddin' ring  
Yes we rocked and rolled till the broad daylight  
You're a little too pooped to kiss your baby goodnight  
I know you've had it when the rockin' is through  
So I let you go home what else could I do  
One thing I gotta know  
  
Well I thought that you were a wantin' romance  
When you're on that floor you're cool man cool  
But when it comes to lovin' you need to go to school  
You know I'm longin' for a weddin' day but all you ever do is play boy play  
One thing I gotta know

I walked with you and talked with you and held your loving hand  
We loved awhile I lived awhile and thought that fate had it planned  
Then someone stole my angel and I lost what I loved most  
I may never get to heaven but I once came mighty close  
I may never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings  
Or walk a golden staircase while the distant chorus sings  
Oh but I once held your sweet love and felt your tender touch  
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much  
I may never get to heaven but I didn't miss it much

I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more darkness, no more night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I wandered so aimless, my heart filled with sin  
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more darkness, no more night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered alone  
Worries and fears, I claimed for my own  
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more darkness, no more night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I was a fool to wander and stray  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more darkness, no more night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I can't put my finger on this love of ours life with you keeps changing every
day  
One minute you're all sunshine and the next you turn to showers  
But I wouldn't want you any other way  
I've been through your crazy moods so many times  
More than once I've been the one who pays  
Oh but nothing really matters just as long as you are mine  
Cause I wouldn't want you any other way  
When you touch me when I'm sleeping I wake up at heaven's door  
And I kiss you on the pillow where you lay  
With your arms around me tightly I could ask for nothing more  
And I wouldn't want you any other way  
With your arms around me tightly...

Just as I expected here you are back at my door  
Telling me the things you ain't gonna do no more  
And just as I expected you wanna love me again  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
I'm not the type of girl that's gonna let you down  
I'll point the right direction to get you out of town  
And if you need a guiding hand to find the road to sin  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
[ dobro ]  
Well if you think you'll get your kicks by hanging around  
Well honey here's a kick that I help you cover ground  
And what don't you just take yourself go back to where you've been  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
I'm not the type of girl...  
I'd like to help you out way which way did you come in  
  
  

I'd rather have a broken heart a two time love I want no part  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
Don't want to share that kind of love it ain't the kind I'm dreamin' of  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
I'm gonna kiss your love goodbye I'd rather be a bird that flies  
I'd rather search for better things than see a bird with broken wings  
The dreams I've dreamed I tear apart I'm gonna stop before I start  
I'd rather have I'd rather have a broken heart  
[ guitar - fiddle ]  
I'm gonna kiss your love goodbye...  
  
  

If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
If I made a scene each time you were mean we'd be quarrellin' all the time  
But I don't cry and I don't get mad I try to take the good with the bad  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time  
  
[Strings]  
  
Now and then you say you love me I try to believe you do  
Then you turn right around and hurt me like I was nothing to you  
But I love you so and I'll stay somehow my tears won't flow and my head won't
bow  
If I'd cry every time you hurt me I'd be cryin' all the time

If I had a hammer I'd hammer in the morning  
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land  
I'd hammer out danger I'd hammer out a warning

land  
If I had a bell I'd ring it in the morning I'd ring it in the evening all over
this land  
I'd ring out danger I'd ring out a warning

I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters ah ah all over this land  
Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell  
And I've got a song to sing all over this land

Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell...  
  
  

Oh, if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
A guy that stays true is hard one to find  
I've heard my old flame is now on your mind  
But if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
Has he told you of the joys that we knew?  
Or does he pretend he loves only you  
'Cause if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
Someday you'll know his love isn't real  
He'll come back to me and then how will you feel  
'Cause he'll cheat on you like he cheated on me  
So send him back now while your heart's still free  
'Cause if you knew what I know  
You'd be glad to let him go  
You'd be glad to let him go  

You have to leave me all by myself dear and I've been crying the whole night
through  
But I've been telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you  
Your friends are trying so hard to tempt me there's no use trying cause I'll
be true  
And darling you don't have to worry nobody else will do  
  
I know this waitin' can drive me crazy don't mind this waitin' it's nothing
new  
For I'll be telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you  
Maybe a long time before I see you so we can do what we used to do  
But I'll be telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you

I'm in the middle of a heartache half out half in  
Not quite out of love with you not too much in love with him  
I'm in the middle of a heartache half way half blue  
Can't give all my love to him when I'm still in love with you  
Just when I think that I've forgotten you the mem'ry of your love grows dim  
That old pain starts again of wanting you more than I ever wanted him  
I'm in the middle of a haertache heart old heart new  
Can't give all my love to him when I'm still in love with you  
  
[AC. Guitar ]  
  
Just when I think...

There you go and baby here am I oh well you left me here so I could sit and
cry  
Oh will you apology what have you done to me but it really doesn't matter
anymore  
Do you remember baby last September when you held me tight each and every
night  
Oh well you was so dazy how you drove me crazy but it really doesn't matter
anymore  
There's no use in me of cryin' I've done everything and now I keep on tryin'  
I've thrown away my nights wasted all my days over you  
You'll go your way I'll go mine now and forever till the end of time  
I'll find somebody new and baby we'll say we're through  
Honey you won't matter anymore  
  
Do you remember baby last September...  
No sugar you won't matter anymore

People see us everywhere they all think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive I know it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
My hopes my dreams come true my life I give for you  
My heart or wedding ring my all my everything  
My heart I can't control you lure my very soul  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
Well I'm a losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale  
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail  
Well I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb  
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans  
Now the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail  
I've got a tiger by the tail  
Well every night you drag me where the bright lights're found  
There ain't no way to slow you down  
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail  
I've got a tiger by the tail

Jealous heart oh jealous heart stop beating can't you see the damage you have
done  
You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one  
I was part of everything he planned for and I know he loved me at the start  
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for all because of you oh jealous heart  
[ steel ]  
Jealous heart why did I let you rule me when I knew the end would bring me
pain  
Now he's gone he's gone and found another and I'll never see my love again  
Through the years his memory will haunt me even though we're many miles apart  
It's so hard to know he'll never want me cause he heard your beating jealous
heart  
Cause he heard your beating jealous heart

Why must I love a heartless one?  
Who'll never know the harm she's done  
Though love is blind, I should have known  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
I climb the stairs up to my room  
But, no one meets me in the gloom  
And the silence tells me, she is gone  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
These walls will hide me, when I cry  
And pray that heaven lets me die  
What good is life, when hope is gone?  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
I pray my memories at last  
Will fade into the distant past  
And if I must live and love alone  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
Just call me lonesome from now on  

Why must you treat me as if I were only a friend  
What have I done that's made you so different and cold  
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again  
Will you be happy when you are withered and old  
  
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine  
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave  
But if you'll say that forever that you will be mine  
Think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save  
  
When you are weary and tired of another one's gold  
When you are lonely remember this letter my own  
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold  
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone  
  
While I am writing this letter I think of the past  
And of the promises that you are breaking so free  
But soon I'll bid my farewells to this whole world at last  
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me

Oh let me go, let me go, let me go lover  
Let me be set me free from your spell  
You made me weak cut me deep I can't sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we're through  
Oh turn me loose, what's the use  
Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go  
  
Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we're through  
Oh turn me loose, what's the use  
Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go  
  
Oh let me go, let me go, let me go lover  
Let me be set me free from your spell  
You made me weak cut me deep I can't sleep lover  
I was cursed from the first day I fell  
Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you  
How I pray that you will say that we're through  
Oh turn me loose, what's the use  
Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go

Just one more dance, just one more chance so I can talk to you.  
Don't run around, don't turn me down and I will try to prove  
I would do anything you want me to.  
  
Just one more dance, just one more chance let me talk to you.  
Don't go too far with that crowd at the bar

Just one more dance, just one more chance let me talk to you  
  
Don't go too far with that crowd...

When you said you were leaving tomorrow that today was our last day  
I said there'd be no sorrow that I'd laugh when you walked away  
But a little bitty tear let me down spoiled my act as a clown  
I had it made up not to make a frown but a little bitty tear let me down  
  
I said I'd laugh when you left me full of funny as you went out the door  
That I'd have another one a waitin' I'd wave goodbye as you go  
But a little bitty tear...  
  
Everything went out like I planned it and I really put on quite a show  
I thought that I was gonna stand it but when you've got through the door  
But a little bitty tear...  
When you said you were leaving...

Blow me a kiss from across the room  
Say I look nice when I'm not

Champagne, sables and such

Send me the warmth of a secret smile  
To show me you haven't forgot

Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Every day is a lost weekend  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
Just like a clown, I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember, your parting words were  
If you need me, I'll call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Just like a clown, I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember, your parting words were  
If you need me, I'll call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Well, I'm choking, choking on heartaches  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die

Livin' on free food tickets water in the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came through what can you do  
Tears from little sister cryin' cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch  
For the party to go oh but she knows she'll get by  
Cause she is livin' in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to  
Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can and she can  
It's a good thing you don't have a busfare  
It would fall through the hole in your pocket  
And you'd lose it on the snow on the ground a walking to town to find a job  
Tryin' to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone boy you'd better go home where it's warm  
And you can live in the love  
  
Livin' on dreams ain't easy  
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit and the chills stay away  
You take 'em in stride family pride you know that faith is your foundation  
And a whole lot of love and a warm conversation and plenty of prayer  
Making you strong where you belong  
And you can live in the love,  
Oh yes we live in the love

(May you never be alone like me)  
Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight  
I'm alone and oh, so blue tonight  
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea  
May you never be alone like me  
I believed the lies you told to me  
When you whispered dear I worship Thee  
Now here am I alone and blue  
All because I loved no one but you  
In the Bible, God's own words to say  
For every wrong someday you'll pay  
Now I pray the Lord to set me free  
May you never be alone like me  
May you never be alone like me

Long distance information give me Memphis Tennessee  
Help me find the party try to get in touch with me  
She could not leave her number but I know who placed the call  
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall  
Long distance information get in touch with my Marie  
She's the only one who's called me here from Memphis Tennessee  
Her home is on the southside high up on a ridge  
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge  
[ ac.guitar ]  
Last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye  
Hurry home drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes  
We were torn apart because her daddy did not agree  
Tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee  
Long distance operator more than this I cannot add  
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had  
Marie is only six years old so information please  
Try to get me through to her in Memphis Tennessee

Never knew what hurtin' was until today never thought that I could ever feel
this way  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you  
In my dreams I feel you laying next to me  
But the morning sun wakes up the loneliness in me  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you  
Was leaving me easy to do was someone somewhere waiting for you  
If this is what you wanted to do all I ask is a reason from you  
Walkin' the floor tryin' to keep my soul from wanting you  
And everywhere I look there's something else to remind me of you  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you hmm

Gettin' up was the first mistake I made today  
Maybe if I'd stayed in bed I wouldn't hurt this way  
For now I'll have to face the world admit that we're all through  
And begin my first day without you  
  
Goin' out was the next mistake I made today  
I tried to find a place to hide to pass a time away  
I knew I couldn't stand to see someone we once knew  
All alone my first day without you  
  
Goin' home was the last mistake I made today  
He's gone and now you're all alone the silence seems to say  
A million lonely nights to all I can look forward to  
As I end my first day without you as I end my first day without you

Just my heart's luck to be stuck with a fool like me  
The only thing I bring my heart is misery  
I can't hold on to you no matter how I try  
The only time your lips meet mine is when I'm gettin' kiss goodbye  
  
Someone always gets to hold you in their arms it seems  
While I'm left to hold the back of broken dreams  
Will my eyes get all the tears and my head gets all the aches  
And my heart poor old heart gets all the breaks  
  
My heart keeps begging me to stay away from you  
It knows darn well you're only out to make me blue  
Everytime I think I'm gonna hold you near  
  
Someone walks by gives you the eye and like a ghost you disappear  
Someone always gets to hold you...  
And my heart poor old heart gets all the breaks

They turned out the lights friends have said there goodnight  
Now there's no place to go but home  
I've had a beautiful evening for awhile I've forgot you were gone  
Now you're back on my mind how I hate closing time  
For there's no place to go but home  
No place to go but home and nobody home when I get there  
They turned out the lights friends have said their goodnight  
Now there's no place to go but home  
  
[ ac.guitar - steel ]  
  
I drive through this ghost of the city and I've never felt so alone  
It's the world's time to sleep and my time to weep  
For there's no place to go but home for there's no place to go but home

OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL  
Writers George Jackson, Thomas Jones  
Just take those old records off the shelf  
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Don't try to take me to a disco  
You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Rock 'n' roll  
Soothes the soul  
Days of old

The little things you say and do

Reuben James in my song you'll live again  
And the phrases that I rhyme are just the footsteps out of time  
From the time when I knew you Reuben James  
Reuben James all the folks around Madison County cussed your name  
Just a no count sharecroppin' black man who'd steal anything that he can  
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind  
Faded shirt the wrinkled brow the calloused hand upon the plow  
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James  
Flora Gray the gossip of Madison County died with child  
And although your skin was black you were the one who didn't turn your back  
On a hungry white child with no name Reuben James  
Reuben James with your mind on my soul and Bible in your right hand  
You said turn the other cheek there's a better world waitin' for the meek  
In my head these words remain from Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk...  
Reuben James one dark cloudy day they brought you from the fields  
To your lonely pine box came a preacher me and the rain  
To sing one last refrain for Reuben James  
Reuben James you still walk...  
Reuben James you still walk...

Seven lonely days make one lonely week seven lonely nights make one lonely me  
Ever since the time you told me we were through  
Seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you  
Oh my darling I'm crying hoo hoo hoo hoo there's no use in denying I've cried
for you  
It was your favorite past time making me blue  
Last night was the last time I'll cry for you  
Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears seven letters too I filled with my
fears  
Guess it never paced to make your lover blue  
Seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you  
Oh my darling I'm crying...  
Last night was the last time I'll cry for you  
  
  

I don't want your lonely mansion  
With a tear in every room  
All I want's the love you've promised  
Beneath the halo moon  
  
But you think I should be happy  
With your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrows  
While you play your cheatin' game  
  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare not drown my sorrows  
In the warm glow of your mind  
  
You can't buy my love with money  
'Cause I ain't never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I dare not drown my sorrows  
In the warm glow of your mind  
  
You can't buy my love with money  
'Cause I ain't never was that kind  
Silver threads and golden needles  
Cannot mend this heart of mine  

I never felt more like singing the blues cause I never thought that I'd ever
lose  
Your love dear why'd you do me this way  
I never felt more like crying all night cause everything's wrong and nothing
ain't right  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine  
There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you  
I never felt more like running away but why should I go cause I couldn't stay  
Without you you got me singing the blues  
  
I never felt more like singing the blues...

I see the shadows as they come to welcome the night  
Treading the time when I know I must turn out the light  
Here in the darkness I lie down to hurt once again  
From letting a mem'ry who's heart sings a song of the wind  
So much like a child yet so very much of a man  
He was a drifter and I wasn't hard of his plan  
He needed me when I met him so I took him in  
Not knowing someday he'd follow a song of the wind  
The wind sings the moving song of fields that'll always green  
The man who has heard its call can't leave a thing unseen  
If I should see him and he needs the warmth of a friend  
I'll try to help him for the short time he was in  
I won't be surprised when I wake and he's gone once again  
For he is a dreamer who follows the song of the wind  
Yes he is a dreamer who's heart sings a song of the wind  
  
  

People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Why don't they let us be  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But talk don't bother me  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
When they know I love you so  
I don't care what the people may say  
I'll never never let you go  
  
I've been abused  
In my heart and soul  
I've been abused  
Been abused, been abused, and I've been stoned  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Man, scandalize my name  
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes, anything to make me ashamed  
  
I've been abused  
In my heart and soul  
I've been abused  
Been abused, been abused, and I've been stoned  
  
People talkin' tryin' to break us up  
Man, scandalize my name  
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad  
Yes, anything to make me ashamed  
  
Oh, yes, I know  
Don't you know it, too  
Yes, I know it  
Don't you know it, too

They say we're young and undecided that we should wait before we love  
But this ain't no what they dinied us when they take away our right to love  
Though we're not together darling you're still a part of me my love  
But time will give a flame that's burning for they took away our ight to love  
  
Hear this song and listen closely the words I got from him above  
I asked him this and he's told me we're entitled to the right to love  
You'll be sad if you're unblessed that young hearts feel the meaning of  
True love they offer set us fancy they're entitled to the right to love

(The things I might have been)  
I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store  
I might have been without a gold just dream and nothing more  
I might have known a life alone but that's where you came in  
Your lovin' arms have saved me from the things I might have been  
  
I might have been a kind who roam a stranger everywhere  
Or one of those for stay at home with no one's lips to share  
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin  
Keep lovin' me don't let me be the things I might have been  
The things I might have been

There stands the glass fill it up to the brim  
Till my troubles grow dim it's my first one today  
There stands the glass that will ease all my pain  
That will settle my brain darling I'm on my way  
I wonder where you are tonight I wonder if you are all right  
I wonder if you think of me in my misery  
There stands the glass fill it up to the brim  
Till my troubles grow dim darling I'm on my way  
I wonder where you are tonight...

There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
I remember now that I'm older  
What you told me the day we had to part  
You promised with the new moon  
You'd be coming back to me  
Now many moons have passed  
Since then I'm waiting patiently  
There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  
So I'll keep on praying  
For your safe return someday  
And that we'll be the same sweethearts  
As when you went away  
There's a new moon over my shoulder  
And an old love still in my heart  

This land is your land this land is mine land from California to the New York
Island  
From redwood forrest to the gulf stream water this land was made for you and
me  
As I went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me an endless skyway  
I saw below me a golden valley and this land was made for you and me  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
I've roamed and I've rambled I've followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of a diamond desert  
And all around me a voice was sounding this land was made for you and me  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
This land is your land this land is mine land...  
  
  

I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name  
I had your love on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came  
My eyes held a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command  
I had your love on the tips of my fingers but I let it slip right through my
hands  
  
But I let it slip right through my hands  
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking I should've known right from the start  
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers to the love hidden deep in
your heart To the love hidden deep in your heart  
  
Somebody took you...

Oh, great good golly, he thrills me so  
When the apple of my eye whispers in my ear  
I get real speechless and I act so shy  
And all I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I go, well ah-ah-ah...  
What I'm tryin' to say is  
  
I love you, yeah!  
I met him one day at the candy shop  
My heart started poppin' like a popcorn pop  
When he walked up and said, hi sweety pie  
  
Well, all I could say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I went, well ah-ah-ah-bah...  
  
I love you, yeah!  
I love him so and he loves me too  
He's my flat top honey, stands six feet two  
I get an itchy twitchy feeling  
  
When he looks into my eyes  
But all I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
  
I go... oh-wah-eh honey  
I love you, yeah!  
All I can say is neenie-neenie-ny  
I get tongue tied, ooh  
  
I get tongue tied, yeah  
I go... oh-wah-eh honey... I want to say...

Yes I know I've been untrue  
And I have hurt you through and through  
Please have a mercy on this heart of mine  
Take me back and try me one more time  
  
If my darling you could see  
Just what your leaving done to me  
You'd know that love is still a tie that binds  
And take me back and try me one more time  
  
In my dreams I see your face  
But it seems there's someone in my place  
Oh does she know you were once just mine  
Take me back and try me one more time  
  
If you will just forgive me now  
I'll make it up to you somehow  
I'll promise never again to be unkind  
Oh take me back and try me one more time

(Yodel)  
I'm always blue, feeling so blue  
I wish, I had someone I knew  
Just to help me tuck away my blues  
Lonesome blues  
So won't you be that someone  
To help me lose the blues  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
(Yodel)  
I really need someone to love me, someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me, someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
(Yodel)

(Send me some violets I'm blue as can be)  
A violet fell in love with a rose and started it flashing from its head to its
toe  
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew  
A new love was born and the violet turned blue  
Roses are red violets are blue I'm sending red red roses to you  
If you care to send some flowers to me then send me some violets I'm blue as
can be  
[ choir ]  
I wanted my love to bouquet with you but just like the rose you've proven
untrue  
A flower that's wild they say has no home and just like the violet I'm left
all alone  
Roses are red...

Walk through this world with me go where I go  
Share all my dreams with me I need you so  
In life we search and some of us find I've looked for you a long long time  
And now that I found you new horizons I see  
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me  
[ guitar ]  
Walk through this world with me go where I go  
Share all my dreams with me I've searched for you so  
Now that I found you new horizons I see  
So come take my hand and walk through this world with me  
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me  
  
  

We'll sing in the sunshine we'll laugh every day  
We'll sing in the sunshine then I'll be on my way  
I will never love you the cost of love's too dear  
But though I'll never love you I'll stay with you one year  
And we can sing in the sunshine...  
I'll sing to you each morning I'll kiss you every night  
But darling don't cling to me I'll soon be out of sight  
But we can sing in the sunshine...  
My daddy he once told me hey don't you love you any man  
Just take what they may give you and give but what you can  
And you can sing in the sunshine you'll laugh every day  
You'll sing in the sunshine then be on your way  
Now when our year has ended and I have gone away  
You'll often speak about me and this is what you'll say  
Oh we sang in the sunshine you know we laughed every day  
We sang in the sunshine then she went on her way
