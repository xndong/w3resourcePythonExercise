You woke me from my sleep, we quietly crept  
Outside  
This memory I'll keep of bitter crimson  
Winter sunrise lost in the icy silence  
Our warm breath fading in the air  
I'm not sure why I tell you, still less what I mean  
It's like a dream and maybe there's no cause  
But in the end it's  
What you can give to someone  
How you can help to set them free  
Big world is turning as we dream tonight  
Big world we've got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right  
Big world help us through  
Get us through the night  
This world is wounded now and we inflict  
The pain  
We have to change our lives and think again  
'Cause in the end it's  
All that we're sure we're made of  
All that we know to set us free  
Big world is turning as we dream tonight  
Big world we've got so out of tune with you  
Now we have to put it right  
Big world help us through  
Get us through the night  
Keep on rolling through the night  
'Cause the big world is never gonna let you down  
If we learn to treat her right  
Then the big world is never gonna let us down  

Take your baby by the hand  
And make her do a high handstand  
And take your baby by the heel  
And do the next thing that you feel  
  
We were so in phase  
In our dance hall days  
We were cool on craze  
When I, you and everyone we knew  
Could believe, do, and share in what was true  
  
I said:  
Dance hall days love!  
  
Take your baby by the hair  
And pull her close and there, there, there  
And take your baby by the ears  
And play upon her darkest fears  
  
We were so in phase  
In our dance hall days  
We were cool on craze  
When I, you and everyone we knew  
Could believe, do, and share in what was true  
  
I said:  
Dance hall days love  
Dance hall days  
Dance hall days love  
  
Take your baby by the wrist  
And in her mouth an amethyst  
And in her eyes two sapphires blue  
And you need her and she needs you  
And you need her and she needs you  
And you need her and she needs you  
And you need her and she needs you  
And you need her and she needs you  
  
We were so in phase  
In our dance hall days  
We were cool on craze  
When I, you and everyone we knew  
Could believe, do, and share in what was true  
  
I said:  
Dance hall days love  
Dance hall days love  
Dance hall days  
Dance hall days love  
Dance hall days  
Dance hall days love  
Dance hall days  
Dance hall days love...

Don't be my enemy  
Don't be my enemy  
You had your dreams  
You required a scheme of things  
Evolved, resolved through the years  
And I had my part  
(When you wrote me)  
But you broke my heart  
(When you wrote me)  
You spend your whole time trying  
To burn me to the ground  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
I had a thought  
It was just a simple thought  
Of a friend, very close, very clear  
But then it stopped looking so straight  
(When you wrote me)  
You found the hate  
(When you wrote me)  
You spend your whole time trying to make  
Me look like your main fool  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what you're doing to me?  
Don't be my enemy  
Can't you see, what an effect this is having on me?  

I got your letter  
I felt so scared to  
Pick up the paper knife and read within  
I read the contents  
I got what you meant  
I know its hard for you but don't give in  
Maybe, maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe, maybe its all in the past  
  
Chorus:  
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh  
(You know I'll never give up on you)  
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh  
(You know I won't give up on you)  
oo oo - oo oo oo - oo  
You know I'll never give up on you  
  
I phoned the station  
For information  
To try and get the times of trains to York  
And on the platform  
I saw your hatform  
A kind of halo in the crowd - crush talk  
  
But baby baby don't run away  
Maybe, maybe it's just today  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I saw your sad face  
You dropped your suitcase  
And I appreciate the state you're in  
You mustn't hurry  
You mustn't worry  
I know it's hard on you but don't give in  
  
Maybe, maybe slow things go fast  
Maybe, maybe its all in the past  

I'll drive a million miles  
To be with you tonight  
So if you're feeling low  
Turn up your radio

They make reality  
But now the music's on  
Oh baby dance with me yeah.

On the edge of oblivion  
All the world is Babylon  
And all the love and ev'ryone  
A ship of fools sailing on

On her television, on her momma's radio  
She could paint a picture  
More alive than all she ought to know  
Her imagination running wild, she let it grow  
In her imagination  
Oh she found she loved him so  
  
[Chorus]  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
Looking for the man that she pinned on me  
The tears for a love that could never be  
Now it's all over  
They're raining on me  
Oh it's raining  
  
It's an empty world with a lifetime on your hands  
Oh we must believe that  
Something someone somewhere understands  
Our imagination wants to capture what we feel  
In our imagination  
Everything is real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
  
Baby, please release me  
From the power of your mind  
Baby, please release me  
Leave this crazy scheme behind  
Baby, please release me  
Baby, please release me  
  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
Now it's all over  
They're raining on me  
Oh it's raining  
  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
Tears fall from the eyes of the girl  
And the girl is watching me  
  
The eyes of the girl are following me  
(Eyes of the girl)  
Looking for the man that she pinned on me  
(Eyes of the girl)  
The eyes of the girl  
(Eyes of the girl)  
Looking for the man  
(Eyes of the girl)

Darlin', I believe in love  
Since I met you, baby  
I believe in love  
The way you hold me  
My heart is stirred  
You can control me  
Without a word  
  
Turn on your white light  
In my open eyes  
Oh girl, you hypnotize me (hypnotize me)  
I feel your white light  
You're so bright  
I'm hypnotized (I'm hypnotized)  
And as you're looking at me  
It's a deep ecstasy  
And no word is enough  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
  
Darlin', I believe in love  
In this hate-ridden world  
I believe in love  
Do you know the power  
You have over me  
Use it every hour  
Shine the light on me  
  
Turn on your white light  
In my open eyes  
Oh girl, you hypnotize me (hypnotize me)

Turn me on (with your love)  
Turn your light around (to mesmerize me)  
Turn me on (oo-oh)

And hypnotize me love  
  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love  
Just shine the light in my eyes  
And hypnotize me love

Meet me in a restaurant  
Meet me on the top of the world  
Meet me and we'll talk the language of love  
  
I'll meet you anywhere you want  
I'll meet you on a ballroom floor  
Meet me and we'll float to a level above  
  
I wish you'd drop what you're doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Let's go there today  
Go today, go today  
Everyway, rightaway  
Oh let's go  
  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way, there's no way  
No, no way  
  
Meet you on a mountain top  
Meet you at the end of the block  
As long as we can talk the language of love  
  
I'll take you in my arms again  
I'll take you to the edge of time  
Together we can reach for the heavens above  
  
I wish you'd drop what you're doing  
And get on the case  
We could blow this existence  
Right out into space  
And share a sweet isolation  
Let's go there today  
Go today, go today  
Everyway, rightaway  
Oh let's go  
  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I want your love  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I'm saying  
Take your cue from me now  
I'm saying baby, let's go  
Will you listen to me  
I'm saying baby, come on now  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way  
  
Meet me on the dance floor and we'll dance to the rhythm  
Get you feet in motion and we'll dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm  
Dance to the rhythm of love  
  
Oh,baby  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I want your love  
Let's go baby, let's go baby, come on  
'Cause baby, I'm saying  
Take your cue from me now  
I'm saying baby, let's go  
Will you listen to me  
I'm saying baby, come on now  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no  
Let's go 'cause we can't hold back no more  
There's no way

It's hard to recall how we were at school  
Our ambitions and conditions and our hopes for the future  
The teachers we had, our mums and our dads  
Their decisions and revisions and their hopes for the future  
But look at me now, I cannot count the cost  
Of all the friends I lost and though my heart did break  
Look at me now, I'm on the candle flame  
I have a different name, I have your hand to take  
But look at me now and here I am  
I used to believe in an idea received  
With concision, but derision was my natural reaction  
You cannot pretend that its all gonna end  
In a second to be reckoned like a soldier in action  
But look at me now, I cannot count the cost  
Of all the friends I lost and though my heart did break  
Look at me now, I'm on the candle flame  
I have a different name, I have your hand to take  
But look at me now and here I am  
Won't you look at me now?  

Let's go out tonight  
Put on your shoes  
Get away from here  
Far from the local blues  
Let's go out tonight  
Let's make our escape  
From the city lights  
And all the familiar shapes  
We can drive all night  
We can stop in a field  
Hear the starlight  
Traveling for millions of years  
Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)  
We can rock and roll  
We can dance all night long  
To the stars above  
And we won't be strong  
We can walk away  
To the rising dawn  
As people go to work  
Wondering why our clothes are torn  
Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)  
We'll be driving through the mountains  
In the cool and clearing air  
With the sunlight on the ocean  
And the diamonds in your hair  
And as you're falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby  
Sing your lullaby (repeat)  
We can find a place  
For the sun and the rain  
We can live a life  
Like a hurricane  
On a mountain top  
Or right by the sea  
As long as we're together  
It don't matter to me  
Let's go out tonight  
Let's escape  
Sing your lullaby (repeat)  
As the perfumes of the evening  
Mingle sweetly with the night  
We'll lay ourselves down  
In the light of the moon  
And we'll hold each other tight  
And as you're falling asleep  
I will sing you a lullaby  

What got into you got into me too  
What came over you is coming over me  
I've had enough of all the old stuff  
I saw the writing on the wall on my TV  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
They're saying the Devil's got a new job  
Start praying to a new  
A lot of Babel came down the cable  
Everybody can be famous for a day  
From shore to shore, a big department store  
Is all that's left of the American way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
Well, it's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, what are you afraid of  
Start praying to a new  
There's a big world  
In the street outside  
In their uniform of pride  
And they've all come  
To see a star from the east  
Is he man or beast? Decide  
Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied  
The second coming is coming anyway  
I see them pray for more on every dance floor  
I hear the word go out across the milky way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Success and money's what he's made of  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying on the airwaves  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying on the freeway  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying at the back door  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying on the dance floor  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying

Let's rent a place in town  
Somewhere we can call our own  
Let's knock these barriers down  
We need to spend some time alone  
Everything in the world has a name  
Oh doesn't it make you feel  
Like you've moved into a rented apartment  
Everything is real  
But it doesn't belong to you  
Chorus:  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
Let's get that empty room  
But first I really must be sure  
Every word, every name you know  
Will vanish when we close the door  
Just say oh (all the words are dead)  
Just say yeah (so we need to snakedance)  
Just say ugh (all the words are dead)  
Just say ooo (so we need to snakedance)  
Wrap yourself around me  
Help me start again  
Wrap yourself around me  
And girl let's snakedance  
Snakedance  
Don't give me talking, give me snakedance  
All the words are dead, so we need to  
Snakedance  
Nothing more be said, so we need to  
Snakedance  
If logic is a glass bead game  
And science is an iron wheel  
And your life is a riderless horse  
Dragging you by the heel  
You need a place where you can concentrate  
On what it is to be  
Don't think, don't speak any language  
The silence in the room  
Is all that belongs to you  
Wrap yourself around me  
Help me start again  
Wrap yourself around me  
And girl let's snakedance  
Repeat chorus twice  

(nick feldman)  
Baby ben really likes to swing  
Baby ben really feels like a king  
As the wail of the horns make his body sway  
Peggy sue likes to rock and roll  
Peggy sue gonna lose control  
As electric guitars play all her fears away  
Chorus:  
You gotta swing down tonight  
Swing it real tight  
Swing with your baby tonight  
You gotta swing down tonight  
It's gotta feel right  
Swing with your baby tonight  
Swing tight with your baby tonight  
Swing down, swing down tonight, swing!  
Baby ben knows just where it's at  
Baby ben wears a pork pie hat

With your baby tonight  

I want to paint your portrait in bright color  
I want to paint the lines in red and blue  
I want to make your eyes appear like starlings  
Saying, "Darling, I love you!"  
I want to set your face upon a landscape  
I want to show the love and toil and sweat  
I want to show your beauty like a crystal  
In an all-night launderette  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And you are the shape on the left  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And this is the sun in the sky  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And makes the great divide  
Between heaven and angels  
And earth and men  
  
I want to show what lies beneath the surface  
In little squares of purple, green and gold  
So everyone can see their own reflection  
In the mirror of your soul  
I want to paint your arrogance and beauty  
I want to paint the way you laugh at me  
I want to paint th world in which I see you  
Fixed for all eternity  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to paint your portrait in bright color  
I want to paint your personality  
I want to show the world just how I see you  
I want to show the world just how I see you  
You know that only I can guarantee you  
Precious Immortality  
Precious Immortality  
  
[Chorus]

(jack hues)  
Well I'm sitting on a hillside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the future laid before me  
Like a green and misty jewel  
And to climb above the tree line  
Is only for the fools  
So they say  
So they say  
Chorus:  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Being cool it's so easy to be cold  
Well I'm sitting by the seaside  
On the warmer side of cool  
With the ocean spread before me  
Like a blue and misty jewel  
And if I jump into the water  
Would an angel break my fall  
So they say  
So they say  
On the warmer side of cool  
What you feel in your heart is all  
I'm sorry if I offend you  
If I'm a little bit intense  
But I never did intend us  
To be sitting on the fence  
And even though I'm guilty  
Of making total sense  
I'm happy when it's all  
On the warmer side of cool  
Repeat chorus  
It ain't cool to be cold  

(wang chung)  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Fuck, shit, screw everybody, don't care, swear  
Do things without a care, are seen everywhere  
And write about each other  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Can't afford to eat, can't make ends meet  
Got nowhere to sleep, can't feel the heat  
Can't get out  
Can't find a voice to scream it out  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
Chorus:  
The world is a mosaic upon a golden floor  
Moving silently, darkly through space  
And our lives are the fragments and all that's gone before  
Broken jewels in excrement base  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
The world in which we live  
The world on which all we are depends  
Whoever could forgive  
The way we treat the world in which we live  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Get up, stand up, speak up, fight  
And do all the things that they think are necessary and right  
The world in which we live is peopled by people who  
Believe what they hold to be true, to be true for everybody  
Repeat chorus  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  
Millions over millions are the world  
Oh the world in which we live  

In the heat of the day  
Every time you go away  
I have to piece my life together  
Every time you're away  
In the heat of the day  
In the dark of the night  
Every time I turn the light  
I feel that God is not in heaven  
In the dark of the night  
The dark of the night  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room I'll live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
I wonder why we waste our lives here  
When we could run away to paradise  
But I am held in some invisible vice  
And I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
  
If I let myself go  
And for where I just don't know  
I'd maybe hit some cold new river  
That led out to the sea  
An unknown sea  
I'd either swim or I'd drown  
Or just keep falling down and down  
I think its that, that makes me quiver  
Just to keep falling down  
Down, down, down  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the way I'll live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
  
In every word that you say  
I feel my freedom slip away  
I feel the bars come down around me  
And I can't get away  
I can't get away  
  
I wonder why I live alone here  
I wonder why we spend these nights together  
Is this the room I'll live my life forever  
I wonder why in LA  
To live and die in LA  
I wonder why we waste our lives here  
When we could run away to paradise  
But I am held in some invisible vice  
And I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
  
I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
I can't get away  
To live and die in LA  
I can't get away  
To live and die in LA

This dance could never be true enough  
Oh, there's more than lead us to our destiny  
Entranced, we traveled, the two of us  
Oh, and I knew that only you could rest the world for me  
I live deep in the heart of things  
Feel such a part of things  
That remind me of you, love  
And I know whatever the future brings  
Wherever the pointer swings  
There will always be true love, you love  
True love is the answer to, to everything

Wake up, stop dreaming  
The sun is in the sky again  
There's a hole in the ocean  
And water's pouring through  
Oh, wake up, stop dreaming  
And wipe the sleep from your eyes  
Are you frightened of heights?  
Are you falling?  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
I'm talkin' 'bout dream and reality  
I'm talkin' 'bout love and brutality  
And I'm saying wake up, wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
Before the shutters start to groan  
Well it's something you said in the noon day sun  
But I don't recall, I don't recall  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
Stop this seeming half reality  
Don't turn your face away  
Look at me  
As you lie sleeping  
Someone's keeping everything I knew  
Don't try to run away  
It's all new  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
I'm talkin' 'bout dream and reality  
I'm talkin' 'bout love and brutality  
And I'm saying wake up  
Wake up, stop dreaming  
There's more than just two steps to heaven  
I'm saying that if you wanna get to heaven  
You'd better wake up  

You're awake as dawn breaks, another day  
And the gray clouds weep how you feel  
Oh but the way she touch you just brings you back to life  
Oh, don't let them bury your soul in concrete and steel  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start  
Feeling good, I said, feeling good  
As we're walking home there's a whispering  
From the city lights to the stars  
And the way she move her body next to me  
In her hair I breathe the air of Venus and Mars  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
Dream on, dream on  
If you're happy, feeling sad  
Dream on, dream on  
'Bout the things you could've had  
Then tell me what  
Oh, what's so good about feeling bad?  
Oh, tell [Incomprehensible]  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, baby, what's so bad?  
(About feeling good)  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
Break the chains of, baby  
(What's so bad?)  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad about feeling good? Yeah  
(What's so bad, what's so bad?)  
What's so bad about feeling good?  

(jack hues)  
I feel the tension  
In your hand  
I'm on a plane to a  
Foreign land  
So far away with no  
Telephone line  
I'm flying into spring  
And leaving winter behind  
I know it'll be winter  
In your heart  
Icy stone cold winter  
All the time we're apart  
Chorus:  
As I look at you  
Looking back at me  
The wordless tears in your eyes  
What's inside of you?  
What's inside of me?  
You may not realize for days and days  
The consequences of that gaze  
When love looks back at you  
When love looks back at you  
Love is a monster  
With a need to devour  
All who fall  
In her power  
And love is a sweet thing  
With a need to caress  
Security, stability and happiness  
I'm flying, flying from  
Reality  
Where two things can be true  
Simultaneously  
Repeat chorus  
I feel a cold wind  
In the street outside  
A plane flies low  
Through the rain-filled sky  
Winter's come to get me  
And it's tearing me apart  
As cool blue summer  
Floods your open heart  
Repeat chorus
