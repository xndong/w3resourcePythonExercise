If you don't look into your mind and find out  
what you're running from  
tomorrow might just be another day to run  
If you just sit and waste your time you'll be  
going where you're coming from (think about that)  
tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Someone must control your mind  
you're the one  
dark confusion's what you find when you run.  
I don't want to waste your time but I'm talking  
to you like a son  
Tomorrow might be just another day to run  
Walking down the road of life looking for direction sometimes  
my mind gets so mixed up I can't tell lust from affection  
Gonna stop in to a roadside church and get my mind a rest  
and Lord Jesus, help me get my soul together in the process  
Pretty ladies stand in line waiting for inspection  
ragged old men drinking wine trying to drown rejection  
I've been wasting too much time, I'm going to lose my  
mind unless, Lord Jesus  
You help me get my soul together in the process  
I see Tony Jr. fill up his arm with dope and dream  
about a valley but he lives in an alley  
filled with papers thrown away -- Lord tell me  
He's long on dreams and short on hope and sometimes  
he goes to rallies and stops by to see Sally just  
to pass the time away  
Lord tell me Tony tell me why do you want to get high  
enough to die.  

She couldn't stand me anymore  
so she just took the kids and went.  
You see, I've got a drinkin' problem,  
all the money that we had I spent.  
  
Now I must die by my own hand  
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone.  
Hey, hey, she's better off without me  
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone.  
  
Ah, she gave the most, took the least,  
she even had the priest come to our home.  
And I cried and prayed and promised  
that I'd leave the stuff alone.  
  
Now I must leave what I can't face,  
I hope she finds the kids a happy home.  
Hey, hey she's better off without me  
and I'm better off dead now that she's gone.  
  
She used to call her friend and cry,  
then the man cut off the telephone.  
She'd sit and cry while I went out  
and pawned the things we owned.  
  
Now I must die by my own hand  
'cause I'm not man enough to live alone.  
Hey, hey she's better off without  
me and I'm better off dead.  

City of the angels spread your wings for me  
I've been other places looking for my dream  
Eastern cities move to fast  
Southern ones to slow  
I can't go back to my past  
And I need someplace to grow  
  
City of the Angels  
Clear your cloudy skies for me  
I heard you got some places that I ought to see  
Heard you got a Disneyland not to far away  
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be  
  
City of the Angels spread your wings for me  
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see  
Heard 'bout your Disneyland not to far away from town  
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be  
  
I heard you got a Disneyland not to far away  
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day  
  
LA, LA, find a place for me  
Give me all your spaces please  
It's where I want to be

Might be that we have, different views sometimes  
  
But that's allright, you're still a friend of mine  
  
Sometimes you go your way  
  
Sometimes I go mine, but that's allright  
  
You're still a friend of mine.  
  
Might not like your lady, you might not like mine,  
  
But that's allright,  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You're still a friend of mine  
  
You changed my cloudy days to sunshine  
  
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine  
  
You make clear waters out of muddy  
  
I'm so thankful that you're my buddy  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a freind of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine

You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You changed my cloudy days to sunshine  
  
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine  
  
You make clear waters out of muddy  
  
I'm so thankful that you my buddy  
  
Your'e a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  
You're a friend of mine  
  

Day after day I'm more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
Now I'm feeling the straine  
Aint it a shame?  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm counting on you  
To carry me through  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And when my mind is free you know melody can move me  
And when I'm feeling blue the guitar's coming through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You've helped me along  
You're making me strong  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Repeat chorus 2 times)  
  
Now now now won't you take me?  
Oh oh take me  
Fly high...

Grandma's hands  
Clapped in church on Sunday morning  
Grandma's hands  
Played a tambourine so well  
Grandma's hands  
Used to issue out a warning  
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast  
Might fall on a piece of glass  
"Might be snakes there in that grass"  
Grandma's hands  
  
Grandma's hands  
Soothed a local unwed mother  
Grandma's hands  
Used to ache sometimes and swell  
Grandma's hands  
Used to lift her face and tell her,  
"Baby, Grandma understands  
That you really love that man  
Put yourself in Jesus hands"  
Grandma's hands  
  
Grandma's hands  
Used to hand me piece of candy  
Grandma's hands  
Picked me up each time I fell  
Grandma's hands  
Boy, they really came in handy  
She'd say, "Matty don' you whip that boy  
What you want to spank him for?  
He didn't drop no apple core"  
But I don't have Grandma anymore  
  
If I get to Heaven I'll look for  
Grandma's hands

Summer night in Harlem,  
Man it's really hot!  
Well it's too hot to sleep  
And too hot to eat.  
I don't care if I die or not!  
  
Winter night in Harlem,  
Oh oh radiator won't get hot,  
And that mean ole landlord  
He don't care if I freeze to death or not!  
  
Saturday night in Harlem,  
Ahh every thing's alright.  
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,  
The parties are out of sight.  
  
Sunday morning here in Harlem  
Now every body's all dressed up.  
The heathen folk just getting home from the party  
And the good folk just got up.  
Our crooked delegation  
Wants a donation  
To send the preacher to the holy land  
Hey hey lord honey don't give your money  
To that lying, cheating man..  
  
Saturday night in Harlem,  
Ahh every thing's alright.  
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing,  
The parties are out of sight.

Wonder who is it waiting for me  
At the end of heartbreak road  
Hope that she'll be tender  
Someone I can know  
  
Hope it just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that love's a good teacher  
When you're in it  
Even if it don't work out  
  
You ain't gonna never understand it  
Getting all done it  
Hey, hey, Lord, and find out  
What it's all about  
  
That's all right 'cause  
Heartache just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that love's a good teacher  
And even if it don't work out  
You ain't gonna never understand it  
Till you been all down in it  
And find out what it's all about  
  
That's all right 'cause  
Heartache just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go

Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am  
But in my heart there is a shower,  
I hope she'll be happier with him.  
Maybe the darkness of the hour  
Makes me seem lonelier than I am,  
But over the darkness I have no power,  
Hope she'll be happier with him.  
  
I can't believe that she don't want to see me,  
We lived and loved with each other so long.  
I never thought that she really would leave me,  
But she's gone.  
Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am,  
But in my heart there is a shower,  
Hope she'll be happier with him.

I can't write left-handed.  
Would you please write a letter-write a letter to my mother?  
Tell her to tell-tell her to tell the family lawyer.  
Trying to get a deferment for my younger brother.  
Tell the Rev. Harris to pray for me. Lord, lord, lord.  
I aint gonna live-I don't believe I'm going to live to get much older.  
Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen, bless  
his heart, aint never done nothing to, he done shot me in my shoulder.  
  
Boot camp we had classes.  
You know we talked about fighting-fighting everyday.  
And looking through rosy colored glasses, I must admit it seemed exciting
anyway.  
Oh, but someone that day overlooked to tell me bullets look better,  
I must say - brother - when they're coming at you than going out the other way  
And please call up the Rev. Harris. Tell him to ask the Lord to do some good
things for me.  
Tell him I aint gonna live-I aint gonna live to get much older.  
  
Whoa, Lord. Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen - bless
his heart-  
I aint never done nothing to, he done shot me in my shoulder.  

How do you do, Lucy?  
You sure been hard to find  
I heard you had a daughter six years old  
And I just can keep from crying  
  
Six years and Lucy  
Lord, have mercy  
That's a long time  
That's a long time  
  
Is she pretty? Has she grown?  
Does she sleep well in a room of her own?  
Can I see her? Does she know  
That I'm her daddy? I'm her daddy  
  
Did you give her love, love, one of my pictures?  
Does she carry, yeah, yeah, picture with her?  
Does she show it to the baby sitter  
And say, see that man, that's my daddy  
That's my daddy, yeah  
  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
Poor Lucy, poor Lucy, poor Lucy, oh Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy  
You should have told me, Lucy

I see the crystal raindrops fall  
And the beauty of it all  
Is when the sun comes shining through  
To make those rainbows in my mind  
When I think of you sometime  
And I want to spend some time with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just the two of us  
We can make it if we try  
Just the two of us  
Just the two of us  
Building castles in the sky  
Just the two of us  
You and I  
  
We look for love no time for tears  
Wasted water's all that is  
And it don't make no flowers grow  
  
Good things might come to those who wait  
Not for those who wait too late  
We gotta go for all we know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear the crystal raindrops fall  
On the window down the hall  
And it becomes the morning dew  
  
And darling when the morning comes  
And I see the morning sun  
I want to be the one with you.

Sometimes in our lives we all have pain  
We all have sorrow  
But if we are wise  
We know that there's always tomorrow  
  
Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
'Til I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
Please swallow your pride  
If I have faith you need to borrow  
For no one can fill those of your needs  
That you won't let show  
  
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
I just might have a problem that you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
  
Lean on me, when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long  
'Til I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
I just might have a problem that you'll understand  
We all need somebody to lean on  
  
If there is a load you have to bear  
That you can't carry  
I'm right up the road  
I'll share your load  
  
If you just call me (call me)  
If you need a friend (call me) call me uh huh(call me) if you need a friend
(call me)  
If you ever need a friend (call me)  
Call me (call me) call me (call me) call me  
(Call me) call me (call me) if you need a friend  
(Call me) call me (call me) call me (call me) call me (call me) call me (call
me)

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree  
There will be an answer, let it be  
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow, let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

May not know enough about you, babe  
That can only come in time  
Only know enough to make you stay  
On my mind  
  
Though I met you only yesterday  
And only for a moment then  
I knew I couldn't let you get away  
I just can see you, girl  
  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me  
  
Can't say I can't live without you, babe  
That's just some worn out loser's line  
May not know enough about you, babe  
But you stay on my mind  
  
[Repeat x4]  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me

On just and ordinary day, no reason, no reason for a fuss  
  
But even though, it isn't Christmas, let us love one another, let us love  
  
On just a day, just a day, no special name, no pretty presents, pretty
presents to exchange  
  
Make it a good day, just the same  
  
Let us love one another, let us love  
  
No special greeting, special greeting for the day  
  
No happy easter, no merry christmas, only how are you today  
  
Make it a good day, anyway  
  
Let us help one another, help your neighbor, he's your brother  
  
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us love, love one another  
  
Help your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, now let us love  
  
One another,  
  
Help your neighbor, he might not feel so good sometimes,  
  
Let us love, love one another, help your neighbor,  
  
Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us help, help one another  
  
Love your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, let us love  
  
Let us love, let us love, love one another, help your neighbor  
  
He's your brother, let us love one another, let us love  
  

Probably one of the nicest affections in the world  
Is that feeling that's there between  
A worldly old uncle and very innocent young niece  
  
Liza, won't you lay your head on my shoulder?  
Cry if you want to, I don't mind  
Seems as if you need some love and kindness  
And all I've got is time  
  
Wiser is the way when you grow older  
Nothing heals a broken heart but time  
I know what it means to need a shoulder  
So lay your head on mine  
  
Wiser is the way when you grow older  
Nothing heals a broken heart but time  
I know what it means to need a shoulder  
So lay your head on mine  
  
I know what it means to need a shoulder  
So lay your head on mine

When I wake up in the morning, love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something without warning, love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
Then I look at you  
And the world's alright with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day

You don't have to worry  
and don't you be afraid  
joy comes in the morning  
troubles they don't last always  
for there's a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your hear is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
You don't have to worry  
And don't you be afraid  
joy comes in the morning  
Troubles they don't last always  
for there's a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your heart is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
with Jesus I can take it  
with him, I know I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
So learn your tests and trials  
they seem to get you down  
and all your friends and love ones  
are no where to be found  
remember there's a friend name Jesus  
who will wipe your tears away  
and if your heart is broken  
just lift your hands and say  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I know that I can make it  
I know that I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
My life is in your hands  
with Jesus I can take it  
with him, I know I can stand  
no matter what may come my way  
my life is in your hands  
  
(repeat chorus all the way until the end)

When I was a little boy back in West Virginia  
We lived very close to a railroad track  
And I remember I used to dream about them trains  
And where they might go  
And the people that worked on the trains  
  
And the train made music, it made you feel good  
I can remember sometimes  
I could just stand off all by myself  
And just get funky listenin' to the train  
  
And I used to pick up a handful of gravels  
And throw 'em down on the ground for ties  
Yeah, and I'd make up songs, I'd sing  
  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
And wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
And a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He used to change his name  
To every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
And a railroad man  
No, he was a railroad man  
And a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
Used to change his name  
To every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
Wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
And he was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
Used to change his name  
[Incomprehensible] to every place he came  
His name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
You know, he was a good time railroad man  
Good time railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
It's alright  
Say you know it's alright  
If you've ever been downtown  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
  
You know, he was a good time railroad, road  
Good time railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He used to change his name  
To each and every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode, he rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
And wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
Oh, railroad man  
Oh, railroad man  
Oh, railroad man  
Stepped in front of the railroad train

Staring at shadows on the wall  
Wish I knew of someone I could call  
Someone who might understand it all  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Someone's lying with me in my bed  
Some stranger who don't understand my head  
Wish it was you lying here instead  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Drowning in a sea of pretty faces  
Being quite the man about the town  
Packing up and going different places  
But I show miss having you around  
  
I listen to the noises down the hall  
Think I'll move out of here in the fall  
I ain't exactly having me a ball  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Yeah, no

San Francisco morning coming clear and cold  
Don't know if I'm waking or I'm dreaming  
Riding with Fats Waller on the Super Chief  
He said, musics real, the rest is seeming  
  
Oh, deep pain  
Feeling that won't go away  
There's the sound of his soul in the air  
I can hear it up there  
And I know he left those soul shadows  
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind  
  
Soul shadows on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
Soul shadows on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
  
Standing by the window as a fog rolls in  
I swear I can hear a far-off music  
Jelly Roll is playing down in Storyville  
And Satchmo is wailing in Chicago  
You ought to heard 'em play  
Feelings that won't go away  
Left the sound of their souls in the air  
I hear out there and I know  
  
They left them soul shadows all on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
They left them soul shadows all on my mind  
On my mind, on my mind  
They left soul shadows on my mind  
They left them shadows on my mind  
They left them soul shadows on my mind

Who will buy a glad story  
That a young man has to tell?  
Come into my house of glory  
And I will treat you well  
  
Who will buy a sad story  
That a widow has to tell?  
Come into my house of lonely  
And I will treat you well  
  
Young and old, we all have stories  
That we all must try to sell  
Tales of how you get to heaven  
And how we been through hell  
  
Who will buy a perfumed story  
That a young girl has to tell?  
Sleep with me on satin pillows  
And I will treat you well

My friends feel it's their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me  
But my answer yeah to all that use me stuff  
Is I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me  
He told me that I ought not to let you just walk on me  
And I'm sure he meant well yeah but when our talk was through  
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish that you were in my shoes  
You just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Oh sometimes yeah it's true you really do abuse me  
You get in a crowd of high class people and then you act real rude to me  
But oh baby baby baby baby when you love me I can't get enough  
I and I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
Oh you just keep on using me until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do  
It ain't too bad the way you're using me  
'Cause I sure am using you to do the things you do  
Ah ha to do the things you do

A man we passed just tried to stare me down  
And when I looked at you  
You looked at the ground  
I don't know who he is  
But I think that you do  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
Ahh  
Something in my heart and in your eye  
Tells me he's not someone just passing by  
Ahh  
And when you cleared your throat  
Was that your cue?  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
Ahh now  
When I add the sum of you and me  
I get confused when I keep coming up with 3  
You're too much for one man  
But not enough for two  
Dadgummit  
Who is he and what is he to you?  
Well  
You tell me men don't have much intuition  
Is that what you really thinkin girl  
Or are you wishing?  
Before you wreck your old home  
And searcht another new  
Dadgummit  
Who is he, and what is he to you?  
(x4)

Lookin' at the pictures of the places  
That he'd been, an old man told me what he'd found  
Said it don't make no difference whether you're  
Out or whether you're in, though the world keeps  
Goin' round and round. Goin' round and round.  
  
Said he looked at the places talked of the faces that he'd seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down.  
Said it don't make no difference how many places you've been  
Said the world keeps goin' round and round.  
Goin' round and round  
  
Then he put up the pictures shook his head, and with a grin,  
He talked about his ups and downs  
Said it don't make no difference how many fixes you've been in  
No, the world keeps goin' round and round  
Goin' round and round.  
  
Betty Joe Johnson, don't you pull no Daisy Mae on me  
Daisy Mae she did me dirty, so I had to leave her for  
Anna Lee. Anna Lee she had big street feet.  
She spent her nights out on the row  
  
So I started seeing Sally Jackson, I had to let Anna Lee go  
Sally Jackson was a player  
Had another man along with me  
So I just took me one step backwards  
Checked up on old Anna Lee  
Anna Lee still had them street feet  
Liked to dance all night and sleep all day  
So I just took one more step backwards,  
checked up on old Daisy Mae  
Daisy Mae was still doin' dirty,  
so I'll tell you what I had to do  
Had to go just one step further Betty Joe Johnson  
Yeah, and that's how I know you  
  
Looked at the places talked of the faces in life he'd seen  
Then he turned the pictures upside down  
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been  
Said the world keeps goin' round and round  
Goin' round and round
