Somewhere there's music  
How faint the tune!  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How high the moon!  
There is no moon above when love is far away  
Too  
  
Till it comes true that you love me as I love you.  
Somewhere there's music  
It's where you are  
  
Somewhere there's heaven  
How near  
How far!  
The brightest night would shine if you would come to me soon  
  
Until you will  
How still my aching heart  
How high the moon.  
  
Somewhere there's music  
It's where you are...  
  
Somewhere there's music  
Music in the air  
Oh  
I love this heaven when you're near  
I want to hear the music  
I want to be where you are.

It's really been a long time  
Since I let somebody hold me  
Since I felt safe in somebody's arms, em em  
You were a good friend I could confide in  
But after all the lies he told me  
I couldn't let nobody in my heart  
I was torn apart  
All this time you've been right here  
He's been doing nothing but wrong  
And though the best thing in my life was  
Here with me all along  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
You'd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
He kissed away my tears  
And now they've disappeared  
You make me feel safe in somebody's arms  
You're the kind that can do me no harm  
These questions everybody asks me  
They say they've never seen me so happy  
But that's a secret between you and me  
They don't know nothing about us baby  
Can't let up  
Can't tell anybody that you're not from around here  
They don't know that you're an angel  
But now it's all so clear  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me there was an angel  
I never knew  
You'd give my heart the wings to fly  
Because of you  
Everything in my life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never Knew  
  
Is this a dream  
Are you for real  
You got me honey  
Feeling things that I never thought I'd feel  
You taught me love  
Don't have to break my heart in two  
That's just one more of those things  
That I never, never knew  
  
I never knew  
Right beside me  
There was an angel  
I never, never knew (that my heart could fly)  
It's all because of you baby  
My life is changing  
Turning it to  
The kind of heaven that I never knew

The moment I wake up  
Before I put on my makeup  
I say a little prayer for you  
While combing my hair now  
And wondering what dress to wear now  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
I run for the bus dear  
While riding it I think of us dear  
I say a little prayer for you  
At work I just take time  
And all through my coffee break time  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
My darling believe me  
For me there is no one  
But you  
Please love me too  
I'm in love with you  
Answer my prayer  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me

At first I was afraid  
I was petrified  
Kept thinking I could never live  
Without you by my side  
But then I spent so many nights  
Thinking how you did me wrong  
I grew strong  
I learned how to get along  
  
And so you're back  
From outer space  
I just walked in to find you here  
With that sad look upon your face  
I should have changed that stupid lock  
I should have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second  
You'd be back to bother me  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive (hey hey)  
  
It took all the strength I had  
Not to fall apart  
Kept trying hard to mend  
The pieces of my broken heart  
  
And I spent oh so many nights  
Just feeling sorry for myself  
I used to cry  
Now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
  
Somebody new  
I'm not that chained up little girl  
Who fell in love with you  
And so you felt like dropping in  
And just expect me to be free  
Now I'm saving all my loving  
For someone who's loving me  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive (oh)  
  
Go on now go walk out the door  
Just turn around now  
'Cause you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye  
You think I'd crumble  
You think I'd lay down and die  
Oh no, not I  
I will survive  
As long as I know how to love  
I know I will stay alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
And I'll survive  
I will survive  
I will survive... !

Many years ago my dad said: "Sonny  
Lady luck may never come your way.  
If it's love you want or only money."  
This is what my daddy used to say.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Co out and get it  
Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself  
Well

Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself.  
  
Waitin' round for someone who can help you.  
Someone who can help you find your way  
  
If you think there's no one  
You can turn to  
There's someone just a looking glass away.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh  
  
Wishin' and a-hopi.n' for your fortune  
Prayin' that you'll see your lucky dayIf you're lookin' for some inspiration,  
This is what my daddy liked to say.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it

"Been a lot of places.  
And met a lot of guys.  
One didn't have curly hair.  
And one had pretty eyes.  
But I don't know what's wrong with me,  
I couldn't seem to care.  
I just could not accept the love,  
They offered me to share.  
And I'm still yours.  
I'm still yours.  
I never thought when we broke up,  
That you'd be haunting me.  
I thought that when you let me go,  
That I would just be free.  
But I can't seem to tell my heart,  
I can't make it understand.  
There may be someone else for me,  
You're not the only man.  
And I'm still yours,  
I'm still yours.  
Oooh I'm like a slave  
Who's master,  
Cause he no longer reigns.  
Although your gone,  
My heart and my mind,  
Are still walked by your chain.  
If you can't leave my heart alone  
And stop toying with my soul,  
Then please come back.  
You've got my life to mold.  
To have, to hold.  
And I'm still yours,  
I'm still yours.  
I will always be your baby."

Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
He doesn't care if it's in below  
He's sitting by the fires glossy glow  
He don't care about the cold  
And the winds that blow  
He just says, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Ooh, wee, goes the storm  
Why should he worry  
When he's nice and warm?  
His girl by his side  
And the lights turned low  
He just says, let it snow, let it snow  
I don't care  
  
Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But that fire is, mmm, delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought lots of corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow  
  
When we finally say good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you'll only hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
Long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

I get a little peck and you're after to bed  
No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said

Let me know, let me know  
  
Let me know, let me know, I have a right  
To plan my future, get on with my life  
Tell me face to face, don't try to be polite

O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep the angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
  
O morning starts together  
Proclaim thy holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King  
And peace to men on earth

A bird came and brought you  
I'm so glad I got you, honey  
I must be the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Now I get to touch you like  
Like no one else can touch you, honey

You can stay forever  
And you can do whatever, honey  
That makes me the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Lucky, lucky me, yeah  
  
That other guy was nowhere  
So glad I didn't go there, honey  
I must be the luckiest girl in the world  
  
You know how to please me like  
Like no one else could please me, honey  
I must be the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Love is all around us like a big rainbow, yeah  
Nothing now can stop us, it's a great big goal  
A great big goal, hey  
  
No more nights of weeping  
I've found the love I'm keeping, honey  
I must be the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Cause no one gets to love you  
Like I get to love you, sugar

Lucky, lucky me  
It's a miracle that's meant to be  
Yeah, hey, hey  
  
Lucky, lucky me  
Yeah, yeah  
  
No more nights of weeping

I must be the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Cause no one gets to love you  
Like I get to love you, sugar  
That makes me the luckiest girl in the world  
  
Hey, hey  
Not the city but the world  
Lucky me  
Lucky, lucky me

My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Jehovah Jirah he is my God [Repeat: x2]  
  
All of the earth is his  
And the fullness there of  
He's everything that I need  
You can be sure of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So why should I worry bout the highs and the lows  
The ups and the downs  
And by my faith I know  
My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
[Chorus]

I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
Even though the pain and heartache  
Seems to follow me wherever I go,  
Though I try and try to hide my feelings,  
They always seems to show,  
  
Then you try to say you're leaving me  
And I always have to say no,  
Tell me why is it so.  
  
That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
Every time I think I've had enough  
And start heading for the door,  
There's a very strange vibration  
Piercing me right through the core,  
It says, "Turn around, you fool, you know you love him more and more."  
Tell me why is it so.  
  
Don't wanna let go.  
Never can say goodbye.  
Girl oo oo baby.  
Never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.  
Oh, I never can say goodbye.  
Girl oo oo.  
  
I never can say goodbye. No no no no no oo.  
Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now.  
I never can say goodbye.  
  
I keep thinking that our problems  
Soon are all gonna work out.  
But there's that same unhappy feeling,  
There's that anguish, there's that doubt.  
It's the same old dizzy hangup,  
Can't do with you or without.  
Tell me why is it so, don't wanna let you go.

Oh holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!  
  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh night divine  
  
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here come the wise men from Orient land  
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,  
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
  
Baby, baby  
I'm aware of where you go  
Each time you leave my door  
I watch you walk down the street  
Knowing your other love you'll meet  
But this time before you run to her  
Leaving me alone and hurt  
(Think it over)  
After I've been good to you  
(Think it over)  
After I've been sweet to you  
  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've known of your  
Your secluded nights  
I've even seen her  
Maybe once or twice  
But is her sweet expression  
Worth more than my love and affection?  
But this time before you leave my arms  
And rush of to her charms  
(Think it over)  
Haven't I been good to you?  
(Think it over)  
Haven't I been sweet to you?  
  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Think it over  
Think it over  
  
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient  
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation  
But each time you are together  
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Stop! In the name of love  
Before you break my heart  
Baby, think it over  
Think it over, baby  
  
Ooh, think it over baby

Used to hear me say  
Baby, I need you, I'm lonely and deprived  
And without your love I can't get through the day  
When you're gone my world just slowly fades away  
And I  
  
Gave you my lovin' every time you asked  
Gave my heart, held nothing back  
Now I see that you couldn't handle that  
Oh, how things have changed  
  
Maybe it was that I was insecure  
That won't happen anymore  
That was before  
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My only problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now  
  
Used to cry and cry  
Sit around and wait for you to dry my eyes  
And I know you're thinking here we go again  
Your broken heart that I have to mend  
  
Gave you my lovin' every time you asked  
Gave my heart held nothing back  
Now I see that you couldn't handle that  
Oh, how things have changed  
  
Maybe it was that I was insecure  
That won't happen anymore  
That was before  
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now  
  
Oh, you know I used to love you  
But oh, my friend, I can live without you  
Don't need your sympathy  
I'm letting you go free  
  
It used to be so predictable  
So innocent and so simple  
I can tell that you're surprised  
I'm someone you don't recognize  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
So don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
  
I've feel stronger than you know  
Strong and now I can do without you  
The pity that you show  
  
But don't mistake me for a fool  
Made a mistake  
My problem was loving you  
I'm stronger now

I use to think that love was just a fairy tale  
Until that first hello, until that first smile  
But if I had to do it all again  
I wouldn't change a thing  
'cause this love is everlasting  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
Ooh  
Girl you're everything a man could want and more  
A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside  
Holding hands as we walk along the shore  
Never felt like this before  
Now you're all I'm living for  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
Each day  
I pray  
This of love we feel will last forever  
Suddenly  
Life has new meaning to me  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  
You're in love  
There's beauty up above  
And things we never take notice of  
You wake up and suddenly you're in love  

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going to be spy  
To see reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said, many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas  
Merry Christmas to you!

Tonight, tonight,  
Won't be just any night,  
Tonight there will be no morning star.  
Tonight, tonight,  
I'll see my love tonight!  
And for us, stars will stop where they are.  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight... no morning star.  
Tonight...Tonight  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight... tonight...tonight  
Tonight will be no morning star  
Tonight... tonight  
I'll see my love tonight  
And for us, stars will stop right where they are.  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight...  
Tonight...  
Tonight...  
Tonight...

You always said my eyes  
Were the windows of my soul  
You could always fill my love  
And pain without been told  
I never knew how, but I don't  
Even dare to look at you now.  
  
So, if you see me walking down the street  
And I start to cry each time we leave  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
Make believe  
That you don't see the tears  
Just let me grieve  
In private 'cause each time I see you  
I break down and cry, ooh baby,  
Walk on by, ooh darling  
Please, walk on by,  
I don't want to you to see me cry  
Walk on by, please, please  
Baby, baby don't stop  
  
So, if you ever love  
Look the other way  
There is anything left to say  
Anyway  
  
I just can't get over losing you  
And so if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
Foolish pride  
Is all that I have left  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye, ooh baby  
Walk on by, oh sugar  
Walk on by (baby, baby don't stop)  
  
Baby, baby don't stop  
Walk on by,  
Walk on by  
Foolish pride  
Is all that I have left  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye  
Walk on by, baby  
Walk on by, sugar  
Walk on by, walk on by  
  
I don't want to see me cry  
Walk on by, walk on by,  
All the tears that I have cry,  
I don't have nothing left to say,  
Please take your head, look the other way,  
Wow, wow, wow, walk on by,  
Walk on by

Now you say it's the end  
Oh, but I think we can start over again  
Just to think of the time  
We were mellowed by spices of love  
Let's not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all of the time in the world to live it again  
Baby, we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
As our hearts join one more time  
Misunderstanding we could live behind  
Don't you think it ain't true  
I'm gonna keep on loving you  
Let's not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all of the time in the world to live it again  
Baby, we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
Baby, we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
With you out of my life I can't sleep at night  
I climb the highest mountains, swim the deepest sea  
To get to that love that belongS to me  
As our hearts join one more time  
Misunderstanding we could live behind  
Don't you think it ain't true  
I'm gonna keep on loving you  
Baby we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again and again and again, baby  
Now you say it's the end  
Oh, but I think we can start over again  
Just to think of the time  
We were mellowed by spices of love  
Let's not pretend  
This can be the end of this love affair  
We have all the time in the world to live it again  
Baby, we can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again  
We can start over again and again  
  

Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening?  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun  
With Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When it's cold  
Ain't it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland

When I was just a little girl  
I wanted the world at my feet  
Now all that's changed  
Cause I have loved and  
Now I do concede  
(You're all I need to get by)  
(You're all I need to get by)  
Like the sweet morning dew  
I took one look at you,  
And it was plain to see  
You were my destiny  
With my arms open wide  
I threw away my pride  
I'll sacrifice for you  
Dedicate my life to you  
I will go where you lead  
Always there in time of need  
And when you lose your will  
I'll be there to push you up the hill  
There's no  
No looking back for us  
We got love sure enough  
That's enough  
You're all  
You're all I need to get by  
Like an eagle protects his nest  
For you I'll do my best  
Stand by you like a tree  
Dare anybody to try and move me  
Darling in you I found  
Strength where I was torn down  
Don't know what's in store  
But together we can open any door  
Just to do what's good for you  
And inspire you a little higher  
I know you can make a woman  
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal  
Cause we, we got the right foundation  
And with love and determination  
You're all, You're All I need to get by.  
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more  
All the joys under the sun wrapped up into one  
You're all  
You're all I need  
You're all I need  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
You're all I need to get by  
All I need to get by...  
All I need is you...
