Standin' on the corner watchin' all the girls go by  
Drinkin' wine and whiskey smokin' joints and stayin' high  
I was young and crazy and I never thought that I could die  
Chorus  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet  
Goin' to the gravel pit and racin' til the break of day  
Smokin' in the boys room lookin' for some chick to lay  
I was young and crazy and life was full of girls and beer  
Now I'm gettin' older but I'm still crazy after all these years  
All these years  
Lookin' at the strippers hangin' out in tittie bars  
Life was Jim Beam whiskey, naked chicks, and fancy cars  
I thought I was bullet proof I was reachin' for the stars  
Chorus  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet  
Goin' to the gravel pit and racin' til the break of day  
Smokin' in the boys room lookin' for some chick to lay  
I was young and crazy and life was full of girls and beer  
Now I'm gettin' older but I'm still crazy after all these years  
All these years  
'59 Cadillac '57 Chevrolet

If you're feeling lonely  
And think you're the only one  
Left that's alone in a bar  
If you need somebody  
With shoulders to cry on  
Well, baby, I'm not very far  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When you're tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And I'll take the time  
To sing you a sad country song  
  
If you started drinkin'  
And still can't stop thinkin'  
About all those all nights alone  
If teardrops start fallin'  
And you keep on callin'  
To find out there's nobody home  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When you're tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And I'll take the time  
I'll sing you a sad country song

I came up the hard way  
And fought with my back to the wall  
Sometimes down to nothin'  
But right now, babe, we've got it all  
Looking back now  
When it comes down to facing the truth  
Ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
That's my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue white diamonds  
They can't keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
Well, you know if the time ever comes, babe  
When it's down to just win, lose or draw  
I don't Carewhat they take  
They can take what they want to  
As long as they leave you  
'cause you're the most precious thing of all  
  
Take my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue diamonds  
They can't keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
No I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you

I met her in Atlanta she was a dancing in a cafe  
With a price tag on her body and a tombstone in her eye  
You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring  
Past the other side of nowhere at a man she'd like to try  
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions  
Of her body fom the music or the crowd  
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket  
While she showed us everything the law allowed  
(Play it Pete Drake)  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment  
I was feeling weak from all the seeds I'd sown  
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body  
To some pleasures it had never ever known  
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me  
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun  
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder  
If she ever felt ashamed of what we'd done  
So I left her in Atlanta...

She packed her bags and moved to Florida  
I've been blue since she's been gone  
And this bowling green motel room  
Is now my old Kentucky home  
All she left me was some whiskey  
And these funny cigarettes she rolled  
It must have been her main intention  
To watch our dreams go up in smoke  
It's another blue grass morning  
I'm gonna blow my mind away  
In this smoke old motel room looks  
Like it's gonna be another blue grass day  
She's soakin' up the sun in Florida  
I'm smokin' up this motel room  
She's sippin' drinks down by the ocean  
I'm guzzlin' blue Kentucky moon  
It's another blue grass morning...

My hands are shaking as I'm sadly learning  
The truth behind your innocent disguise  
You never thought I knew that you had been untrue  
But I once saw the devil somewhere in your eyes  
  
And now you got the nerve  
To ask me where I'm going  
And I don't believe I'd tell you if I knew  
I'll be gone when the sun comes up tomorrow  
I believe it's time to say goodbye to you  
And it sure smells like snow in Bossier City  
But there ain't no weather quite as cold as you  
I'd sooner stand in mother nature's anger  
Than to spend another lonely night with you  
  
I'm talking but I'm feeling  
You're not listenin'  
My words they just fall  
Heavy on the floor  
Yes it's true that you knew  
I would not stay forever  
And you won't see me cryin'  
When I walk out your door  
And now you got the nerve...

Call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
I ain't got me nobody  
I don't carry me no load  
  
Ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
Well there ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
And I ain't hidin' from nobody  
Nobody's hidin' from me  
Oh, that's the way it's supposed to be  
  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin' on  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin' on  
Well I might go out to California  
Might go down to Georgia  
I don't know  
  
Well I dig you Georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
Well now I dig you georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
But I don't love me no one woman  
So I can't stay in Georgia long  
  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin' down the road  
I ain't got me nobody  
I don't carry me no load  
Oh mr breeze

He carries his ID's and his books bound in leather  
And a change of clothing and a picture of Anna when she was younger  
Least he forget her and in among his papers is a list of all the people that
he knew  
And many sent letters telling someone that he'd be there sometime soon  
Hey stranger aren't you the tiredness that remains  
When you think freedom can't be measured  
By the scuffles on your boots hey hey hey  
  
Now he dreams with Anna a life in the time they were together  
He was hard and she was supple where they lived out in the country  
She thought gentle like his hands upon her body  
And when Anna felt the cooling wind David felt the need to be blown down  
And when Anna felt the cleansing rain David fought the fear that he might
drown  
Hey stranger and now you wander through the country  
That you hope is much less frightening when it's quicker passing by hey hey
hey  
  
Now in southern Arizona at the Last Chance Diner counter  
Being questioned by the waitress he prepares for the desert  
With his fredom and a canteen of water  
La la la la la la...

Your life laid down, crucified.  
Your arms stretched out and open wide.  
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.  
  
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow  
Your blood flows down to me somehow.  
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.  
  
Praise to the lamb that was slain  
Praise to the Father who gave His son away  
  
The proof of love, the price of grace  
You traded all to take my place  
And died for me so I can be a child of God  
  
Praise to the lamb that was slain  
Praise to the Father who gave His son away

Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans,  
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans.  
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues  
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina.  
Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina  
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two.  
God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?  
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through  
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.  
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?  
Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky.  
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills.  
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up,  
Maybe I should go to California  
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through  
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.  
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?  
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina...  
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina..  
  

Crazy Mary from Londonderry  
Lives next door to the cemetery  
How many lovers have you buried  
We would shout running scared  
Along the green and golden paths  
That took us home away from Crazy Mary  
  
In the lamplight burning low  
Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...  
  
So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry...

How do you spell relief?

And it lasts me all night long

For an ailment such as mine  
I forget about the tears I've cried  
When the whiskey hits my mind

We're havin' fun now ain't we?

Used to go with my grandpa up to the town square  
Set him down up there on a picnic bench  
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there  
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids  
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old  
I believe it  
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world  
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch  
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow  
Said they was so young took two of them boys  
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger  
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit  
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County  
  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor  
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan  
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect  
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was  
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same  
  
Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself  
He had the best tobacco crop around  
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall  
Papa made his livin' on the ground  
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand  
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes  
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church  
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord....  
Someday when I'm grown I'll be the same someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same

Betty drove the semi she pulled up to the pump  
I thought I wanted a Coca-Cola and I started out on the jump  
She said hold it Dave come quick there's something you gotta see  
That man had got a dancing bear tied up to that old tree  
I said dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store  
Me and sweet Betty ain't never seen a bear that could dance before  
Well it's one step two steps three steps four  
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more  
Dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store  
  
Well these hippies walked up to the cage giving pills to that ole bear  
I don't know what it was they was giving to him it had him pulling out his
hair  
I tried to keep time with the music Lord with the beat on my tamborine  
Gave him some wine from a Mason jar and we all began to sing  
I said dance dance Dakota dance...

I'd sing the Red River Valley  
And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry  
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'  
Wonder Lord has every well I drilled ran dry  
We were friends me and that old man  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells  
And an old school man of the world  
Taught me how to drive his car when he's too drunk to  
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls  
And our lives was like some old western movie  
Like desperados waiting for the train like desperados waiting for the train  
  
From the time that I could walk he take me with him  
To a place called the Green Frog Cafe  
There was old men with beer guts and dominos  
Lyin' bout their lives while they'd play  
And I was just a kid that they all called his sidekick  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Now I looked up and he was pushin' eighty  
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin  
To me he's one of the heroes of this country  
So why's he all dressed up like some old men  
Drinking beer and playing moon and 42  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
  
Then just before he died I went to see him  
I was grown and he was almost gone  
We just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen  
And sang another verse to that old song  
(Don't cry Jack it's only Jesus comin')  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  
Like desperados waiting for the train  

It was too cold to stay in the north  
And LA seemed the most likely place I could be  
Those Malibu nights  
And those Hollywood lights were blinding me  
I longed for a lover to help me discover  
The key that would unlock love's door  
While diving the reefs  
Lord she changed my beliefs  
As we made love on the ocean's floor  
And she whispered divers do it deeper  
Jockeys do it shorter  
Brick layers always make it  
Just a little bit stronger  
Sailors do it wetter  
Soldiers do it better  
But cowboys stay in the saddle  
Just a little bit longer  
  
I moved from LA for a good job with pay  
Riding range for the Double Bar Jay  
Till the rodeo came out I put in my name  
For the bull riding contest that day  
The judges were watching  
But they never noticed the girl  
Standing close to my chute  
She'd picked me to win  
I could tell by her grin  
As she reached out and platted my boot  
And she said divers do it deeper  
Pilots do it higher  
Bricklayers always make it  
Just a little bit stronger  
Doctors do it cleaner,  
Bikers do it meaner  
Cowboys stay in the saddle  
Just a little bit longer  
Divers do it deeper...

Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
I can feel your body tremble  
As I hold you in my arms  
For you know, another woman has my name  
Now she knows it's you and me  
But she don't want to set me free  
We've shared it all, now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop

It's a fairytale morning, the ocean looks turquoise  
As if it was painted that way  
The waves how they rush from the shore or the island  
It carries my vision away  
The sun seems to blind that part of my mind  
That's searching for yesterday's rhymes  
It's the first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love  
She lays there and tosses her head on the pillow  
She peeks from the blanket to see  
She looks like a child but acts like a woman  
Whenever she reaches for me  
Her touch burns my skin and that makes me frightened  
She looks like a photograph there  
Its the first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love  
Yes, it's hard to believe I spent all this time here alone  
Trying to forget the heartaches that broke up our home  
Now they're gone  
Why, she's seen it all, from the start to the fall  
She knew I'd need some place to hide  
My wife, she had taking the baby and left me  
With all of this hatred inside  
She's been my friend, she helped me get over  
And now that I'm better I see  
The first day of something  
And I wonder if it could be love  

Mama taught us how to sing in harmony  
Grandma used to stomp her foot and slap her knee  
I can still hear daddy singin'  
Down by the old mill stream  
When uncle Jim played the fiddle  
You could hear it talk you could hear it sing  
  
And it echoed down the mountains  
To those Georgia pines  
Ran through Tennessee just like that old moonshine  
Old Joe Clark Cripple Creek Annie Get Your Gun  
I guess my old time favorite was yhat Fox on the Run  
Like a fox, like a fox on the run  
  
Grandpa played the dobro till the break of dawn  
Me I had this guitar and I'd strum along  
Carol played the washboard and the tamborine  
Little Mary Beth would always help us sing  
And it echoed down the mountains...  
Mama taught us how to sing in harmony  
Grandma used to stomp her foot and slap her knee  
I can still hear daddy singin'  
Down by the old mill stream

And it echoed down the mountains  
To those Georgia pines

Like a fox, like a fox on the run

Take the jib sail down boys take the jib sail down  
Turn this ship around boys before we run aground  
The fish aren't bitin' today boys fish aren't bitin' today  
I'm gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a sunk cause the fish aren't bitin'
today  
  
There's six foot waves and my stomach craves some good old Antiguan Rum  
I took some away for a rainy day and the rain she is startin' to come now  
Take the jib sail down boys...  
  
There's a northern wind and the lights are dim like a good fresh Cuban cigar  
I got me a hunch where there might be a bunch in the Captain's pickle jar  
So take the jib sail down boys...  
[ guitar ]  
The fish aren't bitin' today boys...

The last verse was the hardest the hardest to get through  
This verse for old lost lovers this song I wrote for you  
She's at the point of no return there's no more candles left to burn  
She's broken every chain that bound her to your soul  
She doesn't care what's right or wrong you've been her victim for too long  
She knows you're too weak to be strong you'll lose control  
Nothing seems to bother her she's as cool as cool has ever been  
She knows she can handle you you've been her fool since God knows when  
[ sax ]  
There's no more chances left to take you're just another heart she'll break  
You're not the first one or the last to come along  
She knows exactly how you feel you think you got a dirty deal  
You left your heart where she could steal it for a song  
[ sax - banjo ]

You know when I first started doing this album I thought  
All these songs about just gettin' the divorce  
And there was one thing I wanted to tell you darlin' darlin'  
Before the music stops for me and you and that's what you meant to me  
And even thought the divorce is final now  
I wanted to sing you this one last love song  
  
Your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For that's what love will do  
And darlin' (I'm so surprised) oh when I first realized  
That you weren't fooling me  
And darlin' they say that our love won't grow  
But I just want to tell them that they don't know  
For as long as you're in love with me our love will grow wider depper than any
sea  
And of all the things all the things that I want in this whole wide world  
Is just for you to say that you'll be my girl  
Oooh (wanting you) I'm wanting you (I'm so blue) oh that's what live will do  
  
I gave it a hundred and ten percent of my soul  
And I tried everything I could to hold it together  
But now that it's over I just wanted you to know  
That anytime you have sunshine you're gonna have bad weather  
Some people they can handle that and some people can't  
Just for the record another chapter in my life  
And you were that chapter just divorced  
Maybe they should write that on my tombstone darlin'  
Would that make you happy then  
Your precious love means more...

Far across the deep blue waters lives an old German's daughter  
On the banks of the old River Rhine  
Where I loved her and left her now I can't forget her she is my pretty
Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river each night when the stars start to
shine  
By the same stars above you I swear that I love you you are my pretty Fraulein  
[ fiddle - steel ]  
When the memory wanders away over yonder to that cute girl that I left behind  
In a moment of glory her face comes before me the face of my pretty Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river...  
You are my pretty Fraulein

I never meant to leave her my intentions were to stay  
It wasn't nothing she had done or nothing she could say  
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin  
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend  
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket there's no anchor on my feet  
If my sleepin' bag gets dusty and there's not enough to eat  
I may stay an extra day till I find another town  
You can bet there's not a lady that can show this freight train down  
And I'll be moving in the morning leaving you behind  
If anyone should ask you you can tell them they will find  
Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand  
And I'll always be remembered as a free born rambling man  
[ guitar ]  
Lord tell the children when they find me that I died but not in vain  
They can find reincarnation in the whistle of a train  
And each time they hear the whistle blow through the stillness of the land  
They'll know that I was happy as a free born rambling man  
And I'll be moving...

Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised  
Bought a motorcycle in his younger days  
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band  
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land  
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew  
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do  
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal  
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field  
  
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised  
  
Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew  
Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue  
A barefoot bearded swamp rat  
But a man above all others  
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers  
  
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised

When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me son  
We got a lotta land  
And a lotta hard work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your pappy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, I reached twenty one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
Left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said hold up the bank boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling my name  
He said he's teaching me a lesson now  
He's making me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch boy, fill it up  
I'm wantin' you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands  
Get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey David gotta get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big big man  
You better remember what old whispering bill told you in this song  
Get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you wanna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
I gotta little dirt on my hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands

When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me  
"Son, we got a lot of land  
We got a lot of work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put 'em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you're gonna grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands"  
  
Well, I reached twenty-one  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
I left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said, "Hold up the bank, boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way you'll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands, get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands"  
  
Well, it's four in the morning  
And the warden is calling' my name  
He said he's teaching' me a lesson  
Now he's making' me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch, boy, fill it up  
I'm wanting you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands, get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey, David got to get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah, if you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
You better remember what old Whispering Bill  
Told you in this song, get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big, big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands, son  
I got a little dirt on my hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands

She's taken to walking alone in the evening  
She's taken to sleeping all night in his chair  
Together they both had a reason for living  
Back when the felling of loving was there  
Then she took to dreaming when he wasn't looking  
And he took to looking for moments alone  
Together they drifted apart from each other  
Together they both knew the felling was gone  
Gone like the sparrow south for the winter  
Gone like the river out to the sea  
Gone like the leaves from the trees when its snowing  
Gone like the love that they once gave so free  
Till he took to starring at his lonesome shadow  
And she took to humming the words to some song  
They both felt it slipping that feeling of giving  
Leaving the feeling of being alone  
Each of them reach out for the other  
Together they go though the motions alone  
Trying to pretend that nothing else matters  
Making believe that their love isn't gone  

I painted quite a picture for the girls in her hometown  
And she was no exception to the rule  
Singing all them songs about the places that I've been  
Made a body feel just like a fool  
She was like the paper bag that once had held the wine  
Thrown without no caution to the wind  
I left her like the empty bottle lyin' on the ground  
Swearin' I'd pick her up again  
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun  
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home  
To-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do  
  
I said she was prettier than Paris in the rain  
Lord I filled her full of gypsy lies  
Swearin' I'd be coming back to fetch her in the spring  
Too ashamed to look her in the eye  
She looked about as simple as the cotton dress I've torn  
Sneakin' in her house at 3 a.m.  
Her mama liked to question me the day after and I was sure  
Her intuition told her where we'd been  
She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun  
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home  
She should have never listened to my songs to my songs  
She should have never listened to my songs  
To-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do to-do-do-to-do-do do-do-do

The key turns in the door the boards squeak on the floor  
And guilty footsteps linger on the hall  
I'd fight but I'm too weak pretending I'm asleep  
While hearing guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been  
True love has no pride but he's not satisfied  
Unless he has her at his beck and call  
I know now how he works so I'll fight dirt with dirt  
To stop those guilty footsteps in the hall  
  
Guilty footsteps always wake me up at night when she comes in  
Guilty footsteps tiptoe through my mind they tell me where she's been  
The next time she comes home she'll find herself alone  
Then she can read the writing on the wall  
I wonder if she'll take it or if she'll try to fake it  
When she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall  
Oh when she hears my guilty footsteps in the hall

I ain't gonna call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
Even though I know what all his daddy done before  
Hank weighs close to two hundred pounds and he stands about six foot four  
And it's hard to call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
Just a little bit of Waylon sure goes a long way  
But old Tex Ritter rode his horse and that was hell to pay  
Willie said don't nobody lay a hand on the bay  
Jimmie Rodgers is the only reason that I'm standin' here today  
And I ain't gonna call Hank Williams...  
[ guitar ]  
Hank sang it all right from the heart took the whole world by surprise  
Stood right next to Elvis in Memphis and looked him straight in the eyes  
Ten years later young Bocephus busted through the door  
And I just can't call Hank Williams Jr Jr anymore  
I ain't gonna call Hank Williams...  
Ten years later young Bocephus...

If grandpa was alive right now there ain't no tellin' what he'd have to say  
Why he had fifteen wives a living with him all when he finally passed away  
And though I've just got two now mama that's enough to keep me satisfied  
I haven't had a son yet but the good Lord knows the three of us have tried  
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch that we once spoke has been forgotten  
And the Mormon way of life is almost gone  
But now and then we gather down in Salt Lake City to raise our voices in a
joyful song  
And we sing Heavenly Father Holy Mother keeper of our children tiller of the
land  
Take us to the river in a horse and buggy  
Give us our salvation help us make our stand  
  
No ma'am I did not go to see the Reverend Brigham Young while I was there  
But I'm sure glad to know you wanted him to mention my name in a prayer  
I hope he did not preach about the young folks that refused to make the change  
Cause if he did I'm sure I got a little more than my share of the blame  
Cause the Pennsylvania Dutch...  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother...  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother...  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother...  
Heavenly Father Holy Mother...

He's taking it hard she's taking it easy  
She's living it up and he's living it down  
He's walking the floor looking for answers  
She's out on the floor all over town  
  
Ain't that the way that love goes when love goes to pieces  
Ain't that the truth when you find out you're living a lie  
Ain't love the reason we both took a chance on each other  
Ain't it each other we both swore we wanted to try  
  
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy  
She's drying her eyes but his are still wet  
He wishes he could just hold her until she remembers  
She wishes she could find someone to make her forget  
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy

Hey gypsy, hey gypsy come on home  
Even if it's just to paint your wagon  
Old hobo how long can this go on  
She's mending socks and sittin' home a naggin'  
Hey outlaw let's spend some time together she said outlaw  
It does matter whether we're alone come on home  
  
Hey drifter has your feeling for her gone  
Have you spent too many night out on the highway  
Hey loner she said hit the road and sing your songs  
It won't be long until I have your baby  
Hey outlaw let's spend some time together...  
Hey drifter (hey gypsy) hey outlaw (hey drifter)  
Hey loner (hey outlaw) hey hobo (hey drifter)  
Hey gypsy hey gypsy

I'VE DONE SOME RAMBLING DOWN IN MISSISSIPPI  
I'VE DONE SOME TIME IN TENNESSEE  
I SERVER MY SENTENCE IN A FENDER TWIN AMPLIFIER  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAT THAT SHIT ON ME  
  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON ME  
I PAID MY DUES TO THE MUSICIANS UNION  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON SLIM  
  
I'VE BEEN A RODIE FOR SATAN HONEY  
I WAS A SOUND MAN FOR THE DEVIL YOU SEE  
NOW I'm A GUITAR WITH THE HEART OF A BANJO  
HONEY DON'T YOU LAY THAT SHIT ON ME  
  
  

Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird  
That has fallen and broke its wing  
Terri she puts on her make-up  
And wonders what promise the new day will bring  
  
Debbie stays home with the baby  
While I work my hands to the bone  
Yeah I make a living they do the giving  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Jessie's the youngest she always needs  
Answers to questions that I just don't know  
Terri she can't sit still for a moment  
She's always in some hurry to go  
  
Debbie's been with me the longest  
We spend most of our time on the phone  
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind  
For this house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home

I got drunk in Austin Texas I missed my plane in North Carolina  
Spent all of my money on a long distance call  
Huntsville Prison walls so high I'm so lonesome I could die  
You could make a grown man cry if you wanted to  
Say goodbye to Houston for me give my best to San Antone  
Tell Dallas there's a change in plans I won't be comin' home  
  
Dallas lives in Winston Salem we got married in West Virginia  
Then we moved to Texas on a fifty acre farm  
I robbed a bank and shot a man ended up in Birmingham  
But I guess I tipped my hand and wound up in the pen  
Say goodbye to Houston for me...  
  
Houston is my oldest daughter says she's leaving for New York City  
She's gonna make her living reaching for a star  
San Antone's my only son please don't tell him what I've done  
Or that I had to use my gun for that I killed a man  
Say goodbye to Houston for me...  
Say goodbye to Houston for me...  
Say goodbye to Houston for me...

LONESOME, CRYING HEARTACHES  
THAT'S HUMAN EMOTIONS  
I NEVER KNEW, LORD  
TILL SHE WENT AWAY  
BEGGING, PLEADING, FORGIVENESS  
THAT'S HUMAN EMOTIONS  
THREES NOTHING AS LONESOME  
AS HEARING HER SAY  
SHE DON'T MEAN TO HURT ME  
SHE JUST WANTS HER FREEDOM  
REVENGE AIN'T WORTH HAVING  
WHEN IT COMES SO SLOW  
VIE HURT HER TO MUCH NOW  
FOR HER TO GET EVEN  
EVEN IF LEAVING  
MEANS NO PLACE TO GO  
  
SHE PACKED UP HER SUITCASE  
ALONG WITH THE BABIES  
BUT SHE LEFT HER PAINTINGS  
THEY HANG ON THE WALL  
ITS HER WAY OF TELLING ME  
JUST WHAT ILL BE MISSING  
MISSING HERS SOMETHING  
I HATE MOST OF ALL  
  
  

Just keep the motor runnin' this won't take very long  
By the time the police get here we'll be already gone  
We've got to leave 'em hangin' we can't leave 'em no clues  
Just take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin' banks Lord I love robbin' banks  
I always tell the teller thanks Lord I love robbin' banks  
  
I like to holler stick up when I walk through the door  
It lets 'em know their safe just isn't safe anymore  
I like to see their faces when I show them my gun then take the money and run  
Lord I love robbin' banks...  
[ guitar ]  
Five'll get you ten she'll push the burglar system  
Ten'll get you twenty years on some prison farm  
The first thing that I do is make 'em lay on the floor then take the money and
run  
Lord I love robbin' banks...  
Lord I love robbin' banks...

Grandpa I've been thinking about you lately  
Wondering if you'd found your peace of mind  
I guess you'd be proud to know your grandsons  
Never crossed that Mason Dixon line  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Daddy wore his Purple Heart so proudly  
Long before I turned into a man  
Buried with our flag across his casket  
I was still too young to understand  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Mama spent her last years in the garden  
While I took my turn behind a gun  
Lord I'd give my life to find the freedom lost within the old songs that you
sung  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again

If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you  
Another night for me is just beginning soon the wine will wash away all my
shame  
With every drink one more mem'ry will leave me come closing time I won't feel
a thing  
Here I am on my way to the bottom it's a shame the things a man will do  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you  
  
It's been a long long time and I miss you but this world I'm living in won't
let me go  
And it's too late to say that I'm sorry and why I left you for this God only
knows  
If I could climb the walls of this bottle

The old man was covered with tattoos and scars  
He got some in prison and others in bars  
The rest he got workin' on old junk cars in the daytime  
They looked like tombstones in our yard  
And I never seen him when he wasn't tired and mean  
He sold used parts to make ends meet  
Covered with grease from his head to his feet  
Cussin' the sweat and the Texas heat and mosquiters  
And the neighbors said we lived like hicks  
But they brung their cars for pa to fix anyhow  
He was veteran-proud tried and true  
He'd fought till his heart was black and blue  
Didn't know how he'd made it through the hard times  
He bought our house on the GI Bill  
But it wasn't worth all he had to kill to git it  
He drank pearl in a can and Jack Daniels black  
Chewed tobacco from a mail pouch sack  
Had an old dog that was trained to attack sometimes  
He'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake  
And there wasn't too much that he would take from a stranger  
There were thirteen kids and a bunch of dogs  
A house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs  
I spent the summertime cuttin' up logs for the winter  
Tryin' like the devil to find the Lord  
Workin' like a nigger for my room and board  
Coal-burin' stove no natural gas if that ain't country I'll kiss your ass  
If that ain't country it'll hairlip the pope  
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke  
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry and I've met Johnny Cash  
If that ain't country I'll kiss your ass  
[ steel ]  
Mama sells eggs at a grocery store my oldest sister is a first-rate whore  
Dad says she can't come home anymore and he means it  
Ma just sits and keeps her silence  
Sister she left cause dad got violent and he knows it  
Mama she's old far beyond her time  
From chopping tobacco and I've seen her cryin'  
When blood started flowin' from her calloused hand and it hurt me  
She'd just keep workin' tryin' to help the old man  
To the end of one row and back again like always  
She's been through hell since junior went to jail  
When the lights go out she ain't never failed  
To get down on her knees and pray because she loves him  
Told all the neighbors he was off in the war  
Fightin' for freedom he's good to the core and she's proud  
Now our place was a graveyard for automobiles  
At the end of the porch there was four stacks of wheels  
And tires for sale for a dollar or two cash  
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof  
Me and my family we was livin' proof  
The people who forgot about poor white trash  
And if that ain't country I'll kiss your ass  
If that ain't country...  
I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes concerning the great speckled bird  
I didn't know God made honky tonk angels and went back to the wild side of
life

If I give my love to you girl, will I get love in return?  
Or will I just get a fire, for as long as it will burn  
I'm not looking for a lover, I don't even want a friend  
I want this to last forever, and forever never ends  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me  
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play  
  
I've trusted you before, babe and you always let me down  
I came back to you believing, I was more than just a clown  
You say it will be different, this time your love is real  
Honey don't make me believe you, if that ain't the way you feel  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me  
If this is just a game, well honey I don't think I really care to play  
  
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize me with your eyes  
While saying that you need me  
If this is just a one night stand, I'd rather turn around and walk away  
Don't hold me in your arms and run your fingers through my hair  
If you don't love me

You said you were loving me  
You said I could never see  
The forest for the trees  
Where you're concerned  
  
Just another game you've lost  
And just another stream you'll cross  
And just another bridge  
You'll have to burn  
  
So you're on your way to Texas, girl  
You're Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
You'd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all  
  
But you won't think about me much  
And you won't even miss my touch  
And you won't ever see my face at night  
  
You are so intent on losing  
That's the kind of life you're choosing  
Now you've got me much too weak to fight  
  
So you're on your way to Texas, girl  
You're Amarillo bound  
You told me when I picked you up someday  
You'd let me down  
  
If you ever think to write me  
If you ever think to call  
If you ever think of me at all  
If you ever think of me at all

No more dirty dishes in the sink when I come home  
I don't have to worry if I'll spend the night alone  
I can go to sleep and leave my record player on  
You're not there to hear me if I cry  
  
There's no way to say how much your leavin' turned me on  
I get so excited when I realize you're gone  
You're just like another verse in some old country song  
I got tired of singin' long ago  
I don't even miss you when I go to bed at night  
Gee it's great to know that I'll win each and every fight  
No one's arms to hold me after I turn out the light  
And I don't even miss you anymore  
I don't have to feed the dog or take the garbage out  
It don't matter if the neighbors hear me when I shout  
Since you're gone there's not much that I have to think about  
I'm so happy being all alone  
There's no more dirty dishes  
(Lord I feel so good tonight)  
(Yeah and it's great to be single again)

I've got something to say, boys  
I've got something to say  
Just as soon as I can find a way, boys  
I've got something to say  
  
I was standing in a ally one dark lonely night  
There were three or four shotguns wanting to fight  
Now me and the devil we were seeing the light  
Looking for someplace to run  
  
And I said I've got something to say boys  
I've got something to say  
Just as soon as I can find a way boys  
I've got something to say  
  
I caught with a couple of friends  
I was just slipping out, they was just slipping in  
I was too hurt to laugh, I was to sick to grin  
Watching the woman I love  
  
The cop at the gate swore I was insane  
'Cause me and my pistol tried boarding a plane  
Now we were both loaded and its hard to explain  
How wed ever gotten that far  
  
I was the first one to get the last laugh  
When they said my son was to old for the draft  
That's when the government gave me the shaft  
Drafted my daughter instead

And I'd like to take you take you away  
And if you'd come with me we'd leave here today  
There's nothing to hold you as strong as this feeling  
And I've got to have you as soon as I can  
  
And I know you're worried about where you stand  
The ring that he gave you is still on your hand  
You want to be faithful you want to believe  
He's easy to lie to but hard to deceive  
And you say it's over between you and him  
He tells you he needs you but chances are slim  
That he even wants you as much as I do  
So why don't you go on and tell him you're through  
Cause I'd like to take you  
And I'd like to take you  
And I've got to have you as soon as I can as soon as I can

Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
  
Cigarettes and whiskey calm my shaking hands  
I just lost a lover to a one night stand  
Something temporary to late I had to learn  
Someone from her past sure it couldn't last a bridge she couldn't burn  
  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
  
Promises were broken dreams were left to die  
Empty words were spoken tears were in our eyes  
Something temporary those fears will fade away  
Please do the best you can to help me understand  
These games that people play  
  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
Your the only friend there's has ever been that didn't do me wrong  
Jack Daniels if you please knock me to my knees  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone  
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane since my babies gone

There's a stack of daily papers on her doorstep  
And the grass has grown up more than she'd allow  
Yes it looks to me to be a little more than a vacation  
Never knew that I'd miss her until now  
From both ends the candle seemed to burn much brighter  
I guess she saw the flame I tried so hard to die  
Looks like I'm the one that got caught in the middle burnt my finger  
I got there just in time to watch love die  
Yes I got there just in time to watch love die mhm mhm  
  
There's a change of address blank inside her mailbox  
And the key she usually left for me is not here  
Yes it's plain to see that she no longer needs an explanation  
Guess I should have known I would not find her here  
From both ends the candle seemed.  
But I got there much too late to say goodbye

I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miner's shoes  
Drink the mississippi river if it took A month of sundays  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
Chorus:  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
Cuss things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin' I could eat A ten-Penny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there ain't A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that ain't enough I'd start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could ride my pony through the eye of A hurricane  
Climb mount everest on A string  
Jump niagara falls in A burnin' barrel  
And bring ya back A hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the okefenokee  
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do  
If you just say the word  
I'd catch that great speckled bird  
And bring it back to you  
  
Chorus:  
I remember well the first time I kissed you  
'cause things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinking I could eat A ten-Penny nail  
And spit out A barbed wire fence  
Well there ain't A living creature gonna ever come between us  
I fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
If that ain't enough I'd start it all over  
Just to prove my love to you  
  
I could walk across kansas in A new york minute  
Climb the colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through arizona like A flat land lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim lake erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat A west virginia coal miner's shoes  
  
(Fade out)

Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman ain't nothing to lose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
I spent a lifetime looking for the answers somewhere in search of my soul  
I lost it in Nashville I found it in Austin I sold it in New Mexico  
Ten thousand miles of road dust can't cover the scars that I put on my arm  
And the bridges I'm burning will never erase the scars that they've put on my
heart  
Dying looks easy drifting gets harder I don't know which one to choose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
Laid back and wasted driven to drinking a woman ain't nothing to lose  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues  
Don't ever doubt it I'll live without it I'll give you the blues

Lately I've been thinking too much lately  
I've been staying kinda stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like I'm not making it alone  
Lately you've been colder than the weather  
Whether love was right or love was wrong  
Once you told me there was no one better  
Now you say you're better off alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream we've ever known  
Even though we're lying here together in this bed  
I believe we're laying here alone  
  
Lately I've been drivin' myself crazy lately  
This old house ain't been no home  
I thought you were something to hold on to  
When I could not make it on my own  
Lately you've been more than I can handle lately  
I can't handle being stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like I'm not making it alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream we've ever known  
Even though we're lying here together in this bed  
I believe we're laying here alone  
Lately I've been thinking too much lately

Well, I've fucked 'em all from Coast to Coast...  
Well you can talk about your lovers and your back door pimps.  
You can talk about your hollywood Fags.  
If you want to know the best love in the world then I'm the best mother-fucker
alive  
Jackie Onassis was a snuff queen for me before she ever got rich.  
And it would take a man a day and a half just to satisfy that bitch.  
Why the Queen of England gave me the keys to the whole damn Country of France  
And it only took me 15 minutes to get into her pants.  
Well, I've fucked 'em all from Coast to Coast, cause honey, that's my bag.  
Fact, I'm the only guy in the world who can make Linda Lovelace Gag  
doot doot doot duh...  
Now it ain't that my dick's so goddamn big, it's just that I know how to use.  
I'll never let no nickle-dime whore ever get the chance to abuse it.  
They can suck it for hours and hours on end, but I'll still be in control.  
And I won't cum 'til I wanna cum, cause that's my jelly-roll.  
Now they're ain't no woman, no match for me, I've had 'em try to wear me down.  
I've fucked them barmaids, and bankclerks, I even fucked a circus clown.  
Teachers and Lawyers doctors and more, them fat women sure are a drag,  
I tell you I'm the only motherfucker in the world that can make Linda Lovelace
gag.  
Well, old Harry Reams fall apart at the seams when he saw me fuck that whore.  
She sucked my dick and swallowed my nuts, and I still hollered for more.  
She sucked my asshole, she sucked my toes, she's the suckinest bitch alive.  
I made her call up two more cunts, and friend that at no jive.  
She don't give me no shit about being no big time lover.  
Some movie star with a jag.  
Cause you ain't shit...  
If you can't get Linda lovelace to gag.  
And don't talk about being no full-time lover, cause mister, that's my bag.  
I'm the only motherfucker in the damn world that can make Linda Lovelace gag.  
doot doot doot  
  

Play your fiddle, Little Orphan Annie  
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea  
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square  
If I'm not there, won't you play a song for me?  
  
We all called her Little Orphan Annie at the playground  
Merry go, merry go, merry go round  
Till she picked her fiddle up, we always put her down  
When she picked her fiddle up  
They come for miles around to hear her play  
  
Play your fiddle, Little Orphan Annie  
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea  
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square  
If I'm not there, won't you play a song for me?  
  
Aw, mad dog, diamond, Jim Richmond from the Tennessee Hot Band  
John Hartford on the banjo, oh diamond, my oldest son Dale  
John Hartford playin' the fiddle  
And the banjo, Diamond Jim

Little Susie Shallow Throat  
  
Little Susie Shallow Throat was lonely  
All the girls all made fun of her at school  
'Cause no matter how she tried  
She could not get a dick inside  
Her shallow throat  
Shallow throat  
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big  
Cucumbers and sausages  
They just would not fit  
She tried 'em all  
The football team all tried to give her lessons  
She practiced but she threw up on the coach  
Not one man on the squad  
Ever shot his wad in Susie's throat  
Shallow throat  
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big  
Cucumbers and sausages  
They just would not fit  
She tried 'em all  
The drum major was a boy named Slick  
Who had a very little bitty dick  
She licked it sucked and stroked it  
'til Slick thought she might choke  
He never knew  
She had a shallow throat  
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big  
Cucumbers and sausages  
They just would not fit  
She tried 'em all  
She finally learned to deep throat after all  
Since she met Slick she's really had a ball  
But Slick he's kind of lonesome  
With Susie and the kid  
'Cause though his dick just fits her throat  
Her pussy's much too big  
  

Seems like it's rainin' harder today  
The rain must of known I was comin' this way  
It ain't easy living on the run  
If I pick up my step and pull my belt down tight  
I can make it to the border by Saturday night  
And it's lonely living on the run  
I killed me a woman in Tennessee  
I just broke jail and they're gunnin' for me  
I'm on the run living on the run  
I'm on the run living on the run  
  
My woman wanted more than a man could steal  
From the bottom of the decks  
Where I learned to deal  
And it got me me living on the run  
Women love an outlaw I heard folks say  
And I'll be an outlaw till my dying day  
Cause it got me living on the run  
I killed me a woman in Tennessee  
I just broke jail and they're gunnin' for me  
I'm on the run living on the run  
I'm on the run living on the run

Well when you're down on your luck and you ain't got a buck in London you're a
goner  
Even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona  
Now I know why and I'll substantiate the rumor that the English sense of humor  
Is drier than the Texas sand  
You can put up your dukes or you can bet your boots but I'm leavin' as fast as
I can  
I want to go home with the armadillo good country music from Amarillo and
Abilene  
The friendliest people and the prettiest women you've ever seen  
Well it's cold over here Lord I swear I wish they'd turn the heat on  
And where in the world is that English girl I promised I would meet on the
third floor  
And of the whole damn lot the only friend I got is a smoke and a cheal guitar  
My mind keeps rollin' and my heart keeps yearnin' to be home in Texas bar  
I want to go home with the armadillo...  
Well I decided that I'd get my cowboy hat and go down to Marble Arch Station  
Cause when a Texas fancies he'll take his chances  
Chances will be taken that's for sure  
And them Limey eyes they were eyin' the prize some people call manly footwear  
And they said you're from down south and when you open your mouth  
Son you always seem to put yout foor there  
I want to go home with Armadilla...  
I want to go home with Armadilla...  
  

They say she came all the way from Dallas  
But I see more than Texas in the hard times on her face  
And every song she sings brings back a hundred thousand memories  
Of another girl another time another place  
She does not have the body of the woman I once loved  
But she's still the girl that I once idolized  
And I swear I see a little bit of every girl I've known  
In the loneliness of Ruby's eyes in the loneliness of Ruby's eyes  
  
Kin folks say she's had a lot of lovers  
But love don't leave a woman filled with shame  
And I've heard tell she had a child in Dallas  
And all the men in Houston know her name  
She does not have the body  
In the loneliness of Ruby's eyes in the loneliness of Ruby's eyes  
In the loneliness of Ruby's eyes

Looking in the mirror  
Must be harder than you thought  
Truth is not a pretty sight to see  
Cheatin' ain't worth cheatin' honey  
When you're gettin' caught  
Lovin' him while losin' you and me  
  
Maybe I was foolish  
Sometimes dreamers often are  
I believed that you believed in me  
Standing in love's quick sand honey  
Reaching for a star  
Looking for your love to set me free  
  
I've seen all the dreams  
I ever thought was coming true  
Shattered like a mirror in your hall  
Leaving your reflection like a four letter word  
Fading quickly from some bathroom wall  
  
Trying to understand love  
Is the hardest part of all  
Does it really matter whose to blame  
Once I called you honey  
Now I never call at all  
Knowing you could only call me names  
  
Seeing it was over  
Did not mean that you could go  
Leaving me the pleasure of the pain  
Trusting someone else will be  
A harder row to hoe  
Lovin' won't be easier again

Love Is A Never Ending War (D. Blackwell)  
Well I dozed off in the back of the bus  
To the groan of the Greyhounds throttle  
And I woke to crack of a paper sack  
And a cork poppin' from a bottle  
I tell you son the old man said  
It was hell in world war two  
As he rolled up his pant leg  
I saw the wood that filled his shoe  
The younger man who followed him in opened up his vest  
Showed the older soldier where he caught one in the chest  
Both of them had purple hearts for the hell that they've been through  
Well I don't have no purple heart mine's just black and blue  
Chorus:  
Oh love is a never ending war  
March me into action  
And we'll train for what's in store  
You win some and you lose some  
But I believe in what I'm fightin' for  
Oh love is a never ending war  
They where half-way through that bottle  
And they where gettin' high  
I never fought in those two wars  
But Lord my throat was dry  
So I showed them scars and stitches  
Inflicted by Maria  
But I didn't think that would give me a drink  
So I blamed it on Korea  
I parted my hair and I showed them where  
I got shrapnel from a grenade  
I just couldn't tell it was where Annabelle  
Put a glas of lemonade  
How that I've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet  
And I never forget that hot August night  
And the fingernails of Jeanet  
Chorus  
As I neared my destination I saw tears well in their eyes  
Partly from the drinkin' but mostly from my lies  
And they stood up to salute me  
As I stepped down from the bus  
And out of the open window they yelled  
Give her hell for us  
Chorus  
  
  

Everybody knows that  
I've had my share of fair weather lovers  
They always leave just ahead of the rain  
Searching for sunshine and looking for pleasure  
Two steps ahead of the last hurricane  
If this is a chance then I'm gonna take it  
Heaven knows I've taking chances before  
It's hard to live with your eyes on the sparrow  
Unless you first take your feet off the shore  
There's not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
We should set our sails for somewhere  
Other that the sunny side of nowhere  
Freedom's in the eagles wings, baby  
Listen to those seagulls sing, maybe  
Love is just a porpoise  
Playing in the tropical sun  
Let me tell you girl  
That ocean get big when your  
Halfway across it  
And this ship of love's seen a lot of bad days  
Sometimes it's harder to row with the current  
Most of my life I've just rocked on the waves  
If this is a game then I'm gonna play it  
I need your love like those sails need wind  
Just climb aboard, girl, and pull up the anchor  
Now is the time for our love to begin  
Woo, there's not a cloud up in the sky  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
It's a fairy tale morning  

Everybody knows that  
I've had my share of fair weather lovers  
They always leave just ahead of the rain  
Searching for sunshine and looking for pleasure  
  
Two steps ahead of the last hurricane  
If this is a chance then I'm gonna take it  
Heaven knows I've taking chances before  
It's hard to live with your eyes on the sparrow  
  
Unless you first take your feet off the shore  
There's not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
We should set our sails for somewhere  
  
Other that the sunny side of nowhere  
Freedom's in the eagles wings, baby  
Listen to those seagulls sing, maybe  
Love is just a porpoise  
  
Playing in the tropical sun  
Let me tell you girl  
That ocean get big when your  
Halfway across it  
  
And this ship of love's seen a lot of bad days  
Sometimes it's harder to row with the current  
Most of my life I've just rocked on the waves  
If this is a game then I'm gonna play it  
  
I need your love like those sails need wind  
Just climb aboard, girl, and pull up the anchor  
Now is the time for our love to begin  
Woo, there's not a cloud up in the sky  
  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Not a cloud up in the sky  
Give me one good reason why  
It's a fairy tale morning

By David Allan Coe  
SHE'S EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN THAT KIND OF WOMAN  
SHELL DRINK WHISKEY AND DANCE TILL THE CHAMPAGNES ALL GONE  
SHELL BE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE AIR FROM THE OCEAN IS CALLING  
TELLING YOU, SAILOR BEWARE! SOMETHING IS WRONG!  
  
BUT TOUCHING HER MIGHT MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR BLUES TONIGHT  
HOLDING HER MIGHT STOP THE PAIN IN TIME  
KISSING HER MIGHT TAKE AWAY THE LONELINESS YOU FELL  
BUT LOVING HER WILL MAKE YOU LOSE YOUR MIND  
  
JUST LIKE THE MOON AND THE STARS SHELL BE GONE IN THE MORNING  
LEAVING YOU EMPTY AND DRAINED, LIKE THE TIDE YOU'LL BE LOW  
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE THAT WILL MAKE IT ALL BETTER  
YOU'LL TRY TO BUY HER WITH PRESENTS , BUT SAILOR I KNOW.  
  
  

Maria has a music box she winds up most every day  
Once a week is all it takes to make the music play  
Melody is just some childhood lullaby her mother used to sing to her  
And the road down to the city goes right by Maria's door  
I often walk right by her house on my way to the store  
Up there where those Italian mothers dress their shivering bambinos for the
rain  
She tells me about Jesus and all his gallant men I tell her about fantasy  
Maria she's this lady on my way down to the river Maria she's a mystery  
Maria she's a mystery  
  
Yeah passing by this morning I drew a picture in my hand  
Our bodies in some candlelight that glowed upon our skin  
Maybe if I touched her she would disappear like angels in a dream  
She tells me about Jesus  
La la la la la la

Rollin' my home grown, Smokin' a big bong  
Look at that Ganja covered with oil  
Using my tweezers, Got pot in the freezer  
Made a new pipe out of aluminium foil  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Don't know the reason, Satyed here all season  
Maybe that Tye-stick was a way bit too strong  
But I got a real beauty, A columbian doobie  
And soon I'll be up on my way along  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
I blew out my bong pipe, Ran out of budlight  
But I found some stash I had hidden at home  
Put it into a blender, And soon it will render  
These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned  
  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
(On a rope On a rope On a rope)  
Some people Claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope  
Yes Some people Claim  
(sing it like bob dyllon) I sound like Dyllon when I'm stoned  
But I know, that it's all this damn dope

She's alone in the corner, with her panties to her knees, lookin in the
mirror,  
She gives her tits a squeeze. Slides her finger through the wetness, rubbing  
Gently on her clit. Breathing heavy with each stroke now. She's not worried  
Bout me watchin, its too late now to refuse, nightly fever you can't shake  
Down, masturbation blues.  
He picks up the dirty picture, with his dick hard in his hand, with a stroke  
You see hime moving, with the music of the band, against the wall you see him  
Jerking, as the cum spills on the floor, as he swells in the mirror, he won't  
Do this anymore, he's not worried bout me watchin, it's too late now to
refute,  
Nightly fever you can't refuse, masturbation blues.  
(Every line is sang twice)  
  

All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
That Memphis, girl  
Don't hold a thing for you  
Hypnotized by gypsy lies  
Like a moth drawn to the flame  
In the crowd  
You're just a faceless face  
Another nameless name  
Living on the handouts  
Of the Jesus of your own choosing  
The Christ you knew  
In Memphis, girl  
Could not win for losin'  
Love beeds for your rosary  
And your drugs to see you through  
You're telling me  
At seventeen  
You know more that I do  
Say farewell to L.A  
And your little coat of blue  
'Cause meanwhile  
Back in Memphis, girl  
Our mama prays for you  
All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
At seventeen  
You know more than I do  
  

Back in 1953, we stole a car old Merle and me  
Never thinking wed be put in jail  
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen  
When they put those bars between old Merle and me  
  
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall  
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds  
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last  
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me  
  
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend  
Acting like wed never been in reform school  
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high  
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me  
  
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done  
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know  
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell  
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me  
  
How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row  
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair  
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door  
Praying wasn't easy for old Merle and me

Those rhinestones turned to diamonds and those diamonds soon got old  
I had everything that you could buy to have but not to hold  
But all that glitters is not gold and when love's lost it's shine  
I had million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Honky tonks and whiskey Lord they'll do it every time  
The day she found another I almost lost my mind  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
(Play it pig)  
  
Those limousines and chauffeurs they soon fell by the way  
Like that mansion down in Dallas Lord I lost the other day  
Happiness is gone now there's nothing left but time  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories  
Yes my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
(Think about that honey)

Hey, California you don't know me, New York City you can't show me  
Anything I haven't seen at least a hundred times before  
I still love you, New Orleans, Mississippi River Queen  
?Cause when it comes to lovin' you beat all I've ever seen  
And I've seen a lot of ladies in my time  
I've had me a few women that were fine  
Ah, but I don't need no city woman messin' with my mind  
So goodbye San Francisco girl, I'm leavin' you behind  
And I've had some senoritas down in Mexico  
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho  
I've had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose  
If the good Lord made any better that you  
He's the only one who knows  

Chorus:  
Mona Lisa lost her smile  
The painter's hands are trembling now  
And if she's out there running wild  
It's just because I taught her how  
The masterpiece that we had planned  
Is laying shattered on the ground  
Mona Lisa lost her smile  
And the painter's hands are trembling now  
Verse I:  
And the eyes that used to burn for me  
Now they no longer look my way  
And the love that used to be  
Why, it just got lost in yesterday  
And if she seems cold to the touch  
Well there used to burn a flame  
I gave too little, took too much  
'Til I erased the painter's name  
Chorus  
Chorus instrumental  
Chorus  
  

Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know  
  
She's the best thing in this life  
Why she worships the ground that he walks on  
She waits up for him at night and worries  
Until he's safely home  
And she always believes his stories about working overtime  
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind  
  
Aw but it crossed his  
Early last summer  
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend  
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave
in  
And now he wishes he could stop himself  
But theres no easy way  
So he lays down with his lover  
And silently he prays  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know  
  
In his heart and soul  
He knew he was playing a game he could never win  
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet  
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again  
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way  
To fight the feeling  
So he prays this simple pray  
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know

THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE WATCHING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE  
NOTHING LIKE TURNING THOSE GREY SKIES BLUE  
NOTHING LIKE DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE  
  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE YOU KNOW  
THERE'S SO MANY PLACES FOR YOUR HEAD TO GO  
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY JUST TAKE IT SLOW  
NOW'S THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE  
  
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE LIVING ON A SAILBOAT  
NOTHING LIKE SETTING YOUR DREAMS AFLOAT  
NOTHING LIKE TAKING JUST ONE MORE TOKE  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE  
  
THERE AIN'T NOTHING AS PRETTY AS THE SUN GOING DOWN  
NOTHING AS FUNNY AS A CIRCUS CLOWN  
NOTHING LIKE RIDING ON A MERRY GO ROUND  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE  
  
  

I've seen the old man sittin' 'round  
The courthouse square back home in town  
Talking bout the big war back in 1943  
Sayin' how much good it's done  
  
Medals gleamin' in the sun  
Cussin' at my long hair  
And my talk of bein' free  
Their vision like their battle scars  
  
Of other wars has faded  
Like the colors on the ribbons  
From the battles that they've won  
If there's one thing I've learned it's this  
  
You just can't shake hands with a fist  
And I once did my talkin' with a gun  
And, old man, I know what you've seen  
But yours is not the only dream  
  
I have to believe in something more  
Than yesterday  
Let it die, just like the past  
I believe there's hope at last  
  
Old man, did you ever have to pray  
Old man, can you show me the way  
  
He shakes his head from time to time  
And rambles somewhere in his mind  
Mumbling 'bout the Civil War  
And how we should have won  
  
Settin' up his battle plans  
On checkerboards at his command  
Watchin' all his gallant kings  
Go falling one by one  
  
And son he'd say there's not much time  
For you to straighten out your mind  
But you never listen to  
The things I try to say  
  
And I just turn my head and cry  
Never understanding why  
He's set up that checkerboard  
When he knew I couldn't play

By David Allan Coe  
She's hard to get started  
She's always so cold  
In the mornings I find her -  
She's looking so old  
There's so many miles  
I've been down that road once or twice  
She's not much to look at  
When we ride through town  
But I know when the chips fall  
She won't let me down  
She knows how to run  
And she don't run around on her man  
She's a high flyin' lady  
She takes me where I want to be  
There's no other woman  
Standing between her and me  
I'll always be faithful  
And keep her 'til the end of time  
God knows I'll always love  
That old Panhead of mine  
I've seen fancy dressers  
And they've caught my eye  
I rode'em to ride'em  
Then I told them goodbye  
I flirted with Low Riders  
Sportsters and Shovelheads too  
I cussed her and beat her  
And kicked her to just get her started  
A couple of times  
God knows I'll always love  
That old Panhead of mine.  
  
  

I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  
I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  
You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real  
All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel  
  
In a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain  
Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again  
Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel  
All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel  
  
I was born my mother's only son she loves me all she can  
But there isn't much to say to her since I became a man  
And I often met the devil but I never made a deal  
I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel  
  
It's face is scarred and beaten like the ragged clothes I wear  
Like the body that God gave me I might give it better care  
But I play it for the ladies and I play it for a meal  
I play the strings just to hear 'em ring of this piece of wood and steel  
  
I'm growing tired of searching now there's nothing much I crave  
Give or take a little time and you can write it on my grave  
There's nothing more I care to own nothing left to feel  
All I ever wanted was this piece of wood and steel  
  
I can feel your arms around me like it was yesterday  
I can feel your breathing next to me and hear your laughter gay  
You tried to tell me what was right and I told you what was real  
All I ever live for now is this piece of wood and steel  
In a world that's full of trouble a world that's full of pain  
Lord many fall beside the road and they never rise again  
Many more are bending low or broken at the wheel  
All I need to carry on is this piece of wood and steel  
  
I was born my mother's only son she loves me all she can  
But there isn't much to say to her since I became a man  
And I often met the devil but I never made a deal  
I just thank the Lord for hands to play this piece of wood and steel  
(I'll be playing this guitar till the day I die)

Play me a sad song  
Tell me your woman's gone  
You know how misery loves company  
Sing it just one more time  
Before I lose my mind  
Tell me how misery loves company  
Loneliness surrounds me  
Emptiness you found me  
I don't think I can go on  
  
Sing me a drinking song  
Tell me you done her wrong  
You know how misery loves company  
I'll put in my last dime  
To hear it one more time  
Willie sing Misery Loves Company  
Loneliness surrounds me  
Emptiness you found me  
I don't think I can go on  
I don't think I can go on  
I don't think I can go on

You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend  
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain  
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall  
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall  
He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday  
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind  
Did you say you think he's blind?  
Someone should call his parents or a sister or a brother  
And they'll come and take him back home on a bus  
But he?ll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother  
And he?ll always be another one of us  
He said he wanted heaven but prayin? was too slow  
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow  
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low  
You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend  
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain  
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall  
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall  
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low  
Dyin? slow, blinded by snow  

The lady you see me with now and again in this dimly lit hideway place  
With eyes deep as midnight and smooth golden skin  
And that warm look of love on her face  
And you say ain't he lucky just look at those eyes  
She's worth any price you can name  
And you think that she's mine but you don't realize  
I'm just someplace to come when it rains  
Someplace to hide when she's tired of the ride just someone to soften my pain  
Lord knows where she plays on her warm sunny days  
I'm just someplace to come when she can't find the sun  
Just someplace to come when it rains  
The lady she dances so close in your arms you swear she can float you away  
And gives you the feeling you're safe from all harm  
Just as long as she holds you that way  
And I can't say it's wrong cause I've known all along  
That her lovin' is worth all the pain  
So whenever she leads I'll be there when she needs someplace to come when it
rains  
Someplace to hide when she's tired...  
  
  

I like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will go  
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd  
The Allman Brothers and David Allan Coe  
I like Willie, Waylon, George, and Merle  
And a lot of ZZ Top  
They play country, soul, rock and roll  
I really like Kid Rock  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I've got a 1965 Harley chopper  
It sure makes those women stare  
A dead flamingo wrapped around the cowboy hats I wear  
I can cuss I can fight I can spit I can belch I can raise all kinds of hell  
If you ride to live like I live to ride let me hear some rebel yells  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I like my whiskey straight up  
Daqueri just makes me ill  
If someone touches my cowboy hat I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck  
I'm a four wheelin' maniac  
And if you want to race name the place  
I'll show you where it's at mother fucker  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  

Southern man better cool your head  
Don't forget what your good book says

Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man

Tall white mansions and little shacks

I can't see nothing but spotlights spotlights see nothing but me  
All of my music is lonely yeah all of my heartaches were free  
Don't waste your time or your flash bulbs too many heroes are dead  
You like to live in the city yeah I like to live in my head  
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive  
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive  
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry  
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lie  
  
I spend my nighttime's in mourning I spend my morning's alone  
You spent your your money to see me tonight yeah I spent all mine gettin'
stoned  
Now that they're both kinda busted doesn't it seem kinda strange  
That I lay down knowing we're two of a kind you'll leave here knowing my name  
Somebody shoot out that spotlight spotlights ain't nothing but jive  
Roll me a smoke and give me some coke treat me like I am alive  
Tell all the ladies I'm single tell Lone Star beer that I'm dry  
Everyone's lying bout livin' everyone's livin' a lie

Sometimes it's hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man  
You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't
understand  
But if you love him you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand  
And if you love him be proud of him cause after all he's just a man  
Stand by your man give him two arms to cling to  
And something warm to come to when nights're cold and lonely  
Stand by your man and tell the world you love him  
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man  
  
Well honey that's the only way that daddy knows how to answer your question  
I knew when your mama passed away that someday I have to explain the things to
you  
That might make me and you both feel unconfortable  
So I thought that the best thing to do  
Is to sing you this song your mama used to sing  
I hope that you will understand cause she did stand by her man  
Stand by your man...  
Stand by your man...

Sweet Angeline I hope nobody ever hurts you Angeline  
You're still a child but I can see the woman fighting to bust out  
And take you far away from me sweet Angeline  
Sweet Angeline you're young and free  
Don't ever let nobody get inside your mind  
Until you get too blind to see sweet Angeline  
Angeline don't let nobody tell you that your dad don't love you  
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline Angeline  
Angeline don't let nobody tell you that your dad don't love you  
And your mother Angeline sweet Angeline  
Angeline

Ain't no sense in crying Lord I'd rather see you smile  
Come down from the city life and stay with me awhile  
There's so much that nature wants to share with you and me  
Put your hand in mine and let this old world set us free  
  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
  
Come out to the country find your peace of mind  
Leave that dirty city somewhere way behind  
We found something out here some folks search along  
Never been so happy never sang a happy song  
  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
  
(Oh Pete Drake)  
  
Bo came by to see us he's a friend of days gone by

Ol' friends from California called us on the telephone

Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love  
Up on the mountain down in the valley  
Living on sweet vibrations some folks call it love

Well, I saw my first rodeo in Amarillo, Texas  
Busting broncos is more than just a way to make a living  
Horses were like women, they were fast and fancy free  
  
I saw Shirley stoker up in pan head West Virginia  
Her and Connie Shovelhead was standing in the rain  
Both of them were dressers, Lord they sure were looking pretty  
Motorcycle fever has almost drove me insane  
  
Eighteen were rollin' when I climbed up in that Ken Worth  
Me oh my, that semi was the apple of my eye  
Horses, trucks and motorcycles sure makes life worth living  
Hope I never see the day, I kiss them all good bye

Why the day you were born, girl  
Your mom and I named you, Tanya Montana  
I just thought you should know  
  
Your eyes were  
As blue as the skies of Montana  
Your skin was  
As white as fresh falling snow  
  
Tanya Montana is some thing to see  
A dream that came true for your mother and me  
A small piece of Heaven on earth as they say  
But Tanya Montana is so far away  
  
Why some day you're gonna grow up  
And you're gonna leave us, sweet Tanya  
And some man will steal you  
Some man's gonna steal you away, I know  
  
But you know me and your momma  
Why we love you, Montana  
Lord, it's going to break our hearts  
When we see you go  
  
Tanya Montana has been on my mind  
Like the eagles that fly above reaching the light  
Searching for freedom, you'll find it some day  
And then Tanya Montana will be so far away

I used to spend my nights out  
In a bar room  
Liquor was the only love I'd known  
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom  
Brought me back from being too far gone  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I looked for love  
In all the same old places  
Found the bottom of the bottle's  
Always dry  
But when you poured out your heart  
I didn't waste it  
Cause there's nothing like your love  
To get me high  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I stay stoned on your love all the time

Go tell Aunt Rody go tell Aunt Rody  
Go tell Aunt Rody the old grey goose is dead  
  
Grandpa found her dying grandpa found her dying  
Grandpa found her dying in the millpond on her head  
The gander won't eat now gander won't eat now  
Gander won't eat now because his wife is dead  
Somebody go tell Aunt Rhody go tell Aunt Rody  
Go tell Aunt Rhody that the old grey goose is dead  
[ fiddle - banjo ]  
Let's pray for the babies pray for the babies  
Pray for the babies because their mama's dead  
Somebody go tell Aunt Rhody...  
[ fiddle ]  
Lord now go tell Aunt Rhody children go tell Aunt Rhody  
Want you to go tell Aunt Rhody tell her that the old grey goose is dead  
Everybody go tell Aunt Rhody now now go tell Aunt Rhody  
Now now go tell Aunt Rhody

He came from Kentucky least ways that's what I've been told  
Me and fate had left that state before his corpse got cold  
He'd been killed for gold hhen California could be sold  
To any fool who had been told bbout the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
Mama had the fever and my daddy sold his soul  
To someone called the devil that he'd met along life's road  
Dad would stop to drink a toast and mom was looking like a ghost  
Was gonna beat us to the coast and the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance that's where everyone would be  
Dancing to Virginia's reel and the waltz of Tennessee  
When the roll is called up yonder you can hear the angels sing  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance God is gold the grass is green  
  
Yeah I left California just before the Grateful Dead  
Told the truth about the gold I'd searched for in my head  
Like my Dad I'd roamed the land and Mom could never understand  
How Lucifer could bring a man to the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
Well times are changin' poets say since mom and dad both passed away  
But some things in this life will never change  
The poets write of things to come the earth will melt into the sun  
And you and I will be the ones at the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance...  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance...

I should get the purple heart for loving you after all the pain you put me
through  
When they start passing medals out to fools I will get the purple heart for
loving you  
  
There was nothing in the headlines to day you won the war  
The one and only casually was me  
You put me out of action so many times before  
And left me on this battlefield to bleed  
And I should get the purple heart...  
[ steel ]  
No one knows that I'm a hero there's no medals on my chest  
All my wounds are hidden deep inside  
I volunteered to love you hoping for the best  
But all you ever done was cheat and lie  
I should get the purple heart...  
I should get the purple heart...

Dedication: They told me George Jones was full of whiskey and he couldn't sing
anymore. They said he was skinny and sickly looking and he was through. I told
'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones
quit singing. George was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings like
he wishes he had a drink.  
  
Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
  
I know friday night he'll do it all again  
  
Oh he'll drink till he falls down  
  
Then he'll order one more round  
  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can  
  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told george that changing diapers  
  
Could sure become A drag  
  
And to clean the house and cook for him  
  
Was not her kind of bag  
  
She said she needed someone  
  
Who would love and understand  
  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can

Yes, the roof leaks and the bed she squeak  
And the rent is due in just two more weeks  
Now I just want to go back to sleep  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Oh, the palm trees sway to and fro  
I think I'll just sit and watch the coconuts grow  
It's hard to get high when your feeling so low  
And tomorrow is another day  
  
Well, the mainsail broke on my fishing boat  
And it's almost time for my rum and Coke  
I'll fix it as soon as I have a smoke  
Tomorrow is another day, yeah  
  
So you go at night with your lantern bright  
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight  
Ah, tonight you can't get the fish to bite  
But tomorrow's another day, yeah, yeah  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
You know what I mean, son?  
I want to go fishing and swimming  
Looking at the pretty girls on the beaches, son  
I don't want to do no work

Will you hurt me more than the pain of sharing her  
With other lovers believers or deceivers  
Well the answer can't be found when I'm alone  
So Rachel take me home and make me feel like a man  
  
I know I swore that I'd be faithful  
But Rachel made me realize that happiness is something you can't share  
With Tom Dick or Harry the reason we got married  
Was to know when you were needed you'd be there  
  
So now you know all about her  
Now you want to act like she's the reason you've been staying out at night  
But honey I've been drinking and lately I've been thinking  
The way that we've been lovin' just ain't right  
Will you hurt me more...  
  
And the man you feel I ain't half as real as the man I used to be  
They've took my pride and I had to fight to keep my sanity  
  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)  
Under Rachel's wings (under Rachel's wings)

I never made it back to Boston  
I've always been a rambling man  
But by the time I got to Phoenix  
She didn't quite fit in my plans  
I lost my heart in San Francisco  
And found it in the streets of Baltimore  
There must be someone wanting true love  
Could it be you?  
Hey vie got so much inside me to give  
What can I do?  
It seemed that Rachel's wings got colder  
She finally crossed loves cheating line  
She fell for some young Dallas cowboy  
Hey, I never saw the danger signs  
Whiskey and women was my weakness  
Jack Daniels let me down again  

Last night she made it plain she didn't want me today I woke later and alone  
Tomorrow I'll be turnin' to the bottle tonight I'll be cold and all alone  
She only broke my heart Lord not my spirit she only took my body not my soul  
My skin still burns in places where she touched me  
And when she touched me Lord I lost my self-control  
When she's got me where she wants me she don't want me  
I'm just another game she likes to play  
I don't think I can make it through tomorrow  
I almost never made it through today  
She sure knew how to love me when she loved me  
When I was weak she always came on strong  
She knew just what it took to drive me crazy  
And she knew how much I hate to be alone  
When she's got me where she wants me

We're gona do this song for useless  
Ohhhh I was in to whips'n'things she was into pain  
I would beat her black and blue when she called me names  
Chained her to the basement wall where she went insane  
And I was in to whips'n'things she was into pain  
ohh finger fuckin sally worked at kelly's bar  
She showed me her titties in ronney murphy's car  
She was the first lady to let me go that far  
Finger fuckin sally down at kelly's bar  
and pussy eatin pamela went to kelly's high  
Caught her in the bathroom, I thought she would die  
Eatin susan's pussy, licked that sucker dry  
Pussy eatin pamela went to kelly's high  
suck'm silly shirley came out after dark  
She would give us head jobs in centinnial park  
All the girls would snub her, said she was a nark  
Suck'm silly shirley from centinnial park  
yess, good ole bloody marys' on the rag again  
Pussy eatin pamelas' got blood on her chin  
Suckm silly shirley got caught after dark  
Finger fuckin sally in centinnial park  
noww pussy eatn pamelas' in the county jail  
Suckm silly shirley left town on a rail  
They sent bloody mary to the pen for life  
Aaaannnnndddd finger fuckn sally  
She became my wife  
I was into whips'n'things she was into pain  
And I would beat her black and blue when she called me names  
Chained her to the basement wall where she went insane  
I was into whips'n'things she was into pain  
  

By David Allan Coe  
  
I've got this weakness for women and whiskey  
  
Its something I just can't control  
  
I've tried hard to shake it with out any luck  
  
It keeps burning deep in my soul  
  
I thought you could change things and while you were with me  
  
I never loved no one but you  
  
But it's gonna take more that whisky and women  
  
To make me forget that were through  
  
Baby, sometimes at night when I reach out to touch you  
  
I wake up chilled to the bone  
  
There is so many things I can't get used to  
  
Specially being alone  
  
I built my whole world around you and now that your gone  
  
I don't know what to do  
  
But it's gonna take more that whisky and women  
  
To make me forget that were through  
  
I found me A woman to lay down beside me  
  
She offered her body and soul  
  
And I took them hoping for some silly reason  
  
Shed help me regain self control  
  
I left like A thief in the night when the first light of dawn  
  
Turned the grey skies to blue  
  
I sobered up knowing she'd never be able  
  
To make me forget that were through

[Chorus]  
Whiskey, whiskey take my mind  
Let me leave it all behind  
Take me somewhere I can find  
Someone to believe  
  
Whiskey, whiskey be my friend  
Don't you let me fall again  
You can help me to pretend  
She won't ever leave  
  
Whiskey, whiskey tell me lies  
You know she can hypnotize  
If I look into her eyes  
I'll be lost again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whiskey, whiskey keep your cool  
Don't you let me be no fool  
I'll be sitting on this stool  
'Til the very end  
  
[Chorus]

I heard The Burritos out in California could fly higher than The Byrds  
Roger Mcguinn had a 12 string guitar it was like nothing I'd ever heard  
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast like The Byrds they were trying to
be free  
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws like Willie and Waylon and me  
  
Hey well that they say Texas music is in the make  
And we've been making music that is free  
Doing one night stands and playing with our bands Willie Waylon and me  
(Oh Mad Dog)  
[ harmonica - steel ]  
They say The Beatles were just the beginning of everything music could be  
Just like The Stones I was rolling along like a ship lost out on the sea  
And Joplin would die for the future and Dylan would write poetry  
And in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws like Willie and Waylon and me  
  
Hey my name is David Allan Coe and I'm from Dallas Texas  
They say Texas music is in the make  
And we've been making music that is free  
Doing one night stands and playing with our bands Willie Waylon and me  
[ piano - guitar ]  
I heard The Burritos out in California...

Would you lay with me in a field of stone  
If my needs were strong would you lay with me  
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear  
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you  
  
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life  
When the moon is full will you bathe with me  
Will you still love me when I'm down and out  
In my time of trials will you stand by me  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you  
Would you lay with me in a field of stone  
If my needs were strong would you lay with me

You can count on me, girl  
You can count on me  
I won't ever let you down  
You can count on me  
  
You say you want a working man  
To bring the money home  
Someone to be good to you  
And never do you wrong  
  
A man that wants to settle down  
And put his feet on solid ground  
You want a love that's safe and sound  
You can count on me  
  
You say you're looking for a man  
To be there when you call  
Someone who will stand by you  
And never let you fall  
  
A man that you can call your own  
A man that you can trust alone  
To love when the children's grown  
You can count on me

You could sail across the water take the kids and set me free  
You could die and go to heaven but you'll always live inside of me  
You'll always live inside of me girl you'll always live inside of me  
No one else will ever take your place you'll always live inside of me  
  
They could take me back to prison they could throw away the key  
Just as long as I am breathin' you'll always live inside of me  
You'll always live inside of me girl...  
You'll always live inside of me girl...
