You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows  
Girl, I know you're hurt  
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile  
It really works  
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth  
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags  
And let's leave this earth  
  
Let's aim high, oh girl  
All you gotta do is close your eyes and - and visualize  
Let's aim high  
  
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work  
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean  
Damn, that's gotta hurt  
  
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl  
I know you're worth  
So allow me indulge your mind with these words  
Open your eyes, you're now a bird  
  
Let's aim high, girl  
All you gotta do is close your eyes and - and visualize  
  
You possess the power to do  
If you concentrate, mountains will move  
If you just believe that it's true  
Please make no mistake I'll be there too  
  
You possess the power to do  
If you concentrate, mountains will move

Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world  
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls  
So tempt me to jet set away in London  
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany  
Ooh (La la la la la la la la)  
I love the way we livin' boy  
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"  
So let's run away, let's run away (way, way)  
Momma say I'm too young for love  
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of  
My heart tells me that you're the one  
It's the feeling you give, it is  
  
Pure bliss  
Like you've got the key to my heart  
Simple as a touch and a kiss  
Never knew a feeling like this  
Pure bliss, pure bliss  
Nobody can tear us apart  
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)  
Loving you will never be hard  
This is pure bliss  
  
I remember, when the pilot closed the door  
Said it's time for lift off, you said, "What'd you choose me for?"  
Don't ever wonder  
'Cause you deserve the best  
Once you reach the top you'll never question why you left  
My world is yours  
What you waitin' for?  
Let's run away  
Let's run away  
Our friends, say we're crazy  
But we can't listen baby  
They've never had it like this  
They don't know what it is  
  
Pure bliss  
Like you've got the key to my heart  
Simple as a touch and a kiss  
Never knew a feeling like this  
Pure bliss, pure bliss  
Nobody can tear us apart  
Baby it's as good as it gets (Kiss kiss kiss kiss)  
Loving you will never be hard  
This is pure bliss

But I won't allow this girl to mess with my nerves  
Blessed figure, not to mention the curves

A father waits upon a son  
A mother prays for his return  
I just called to see  
If you still have a place for me  
We know that like took us apart  
But you're still within my heart  
I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me  
I'll make it home again  
I pray you'll fall in love again  
Just say you'll entertain the possibility  
I learned enough from my mistakes  
Learned from all I didn't say  
Won't you wait for me  
  
It may be long to get me there  
It feels like I've been everywhere  
But someday I'll be coming home  
Round and round the world will spin  
Oh, the circle never ends  
So you know that I'll be coming home  
  
We fight to stay alive  
But somebody's got to die  
It's so strange to me  
A new year, a new enemy  
Another soldier gone to war  
Another story told before  
Now it's told again  
It seems the wars will never end  
But we'll make it home again  
Back where we belong again  
We're holding on to when  
We used to dare to dream  
We pray we live to see  
Another day in history  
Yes we still believe  
  
It may be long to get me there  
It feels like I've been everywhere  
But someday I'll be coming home  
Round and round the world will spin  
Oh, the circle never ends  
So you know that I'll be coming home  
  
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming?  
You know that I'll be coming home  
  
It may be long to get me there  
It feels like I've been everywhere  
But someday I'll be coming home  
Round and round the world will spin  
Oh, the circle never ends  
So you know that I'll be coming home

It seems like every time I come around  
You say jay where have you been  
'Cause you can't get your mind off all  
The things you hear from your friends  
Well I don't give a damn, 'cause they don't understand  
The things that we do  
They don't even know me  
How the going to know what's best for you  
  
So I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get through to you  
I'm yours no doubt, I do what I gotta do  
I'm trying to get through to you, right here right now  
  
Living in the city, it can be so hard to stay on your feet  
A girl that why it's good to know that I'm there for you and you're there for

While were trying to get that paper it's a struggle just for us to get by  
But if we stick together we gon' make it baby we'll be alright  
  
I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get through to you I'm yours no doubt

Everybody's got to pay  
But some don't know how to handle it  
Always reaching out in vain  
Just taking the things not worth having  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
  
You say your style of life's a drag,  
And that you must go other places,  
But just don't you feel too bad,  
When you get fooled by smiling faces,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooout  
When you get oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooofffff your trip  
  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
  
Don't you worry bout it  
  
[scatting]  
  
Don't you worry bout a thing [x2]  
Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
When you get off your trip  
  
Everybody needs a change  
A chance to check out the new  
But you're the only one to see  
The changes you take yourself through  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing [x2]  
Pretty Mama  
Cause I'll be standing on the sides when you check it out  
  
Don't you worry bout a thaaaaaaang. [x4]  
  
Don't you worry bout it  
  
[scatting]  
  
Don'tcha worry bout a thang [repeat]  
Don't worry [x5]

Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her oh no  
  
I'll write a song I've thought about it for far too long  
But I've never had someone to sing about until I met her  
Each day gets better  
  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody understands me like she  
Now that I know what true love means, I just hope she stays with me  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her  
  
She wants to breathe,  
She wants to be where the grass is green  
She wants to know how love's supposed to be  
She wants it better,  
I want to let her know she belongs right here with me  
She's heard it all but I'll make her see  
I'll make her fall, make her believe  
I'll promise her that I'll never leave  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her  
  
I just had to write a song about her  
Tell her I don't wanna live without her  
Tell her I would build my world around her  
Deeper and deeper, sweeter and sweeter  
I'll never leave her alone  
  
Where do we go, who knows?  
But each day gets better, I just can't let her go  
Oh no Each kiss gets sweeter I just can't leave her, no

It gets harder every day, but I can't seem to shake the pain  
I'm trying to find the words to say, please say  
It's written all over my face, I can't  
Function the same when you're not here  
I'm calling your name and no one's there  
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy,  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
But I wish you the best, I guess.  
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
  
I don't care what the people say  
They brought it all in anyway  
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said  
It seems like you just don't know  
The radio's on, you tuning me out,  
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down  
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy,  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
But I wish you the best, I guess.  
'Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
  
Oh I wish you'd understand  
Oh, just an ordinary man  
Wish that we'd have known  
Everybody knows, but nobody really knows  
And I know one day you'll see, nobody has it easy  
I still can't believe you found somebody new  
I wish you the best, I guess.  
  
'Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows  
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt  
We've heard it all before, that everybody knows  
How to make it right, I wish we gave it one more try  
One more try  
One more try  
One more try  
'Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

Is that music in my ear  
It's like I heard nothing for a thousand years  
My eyes were closed, locking in my tears  
  
I was so surrounded but still all alone  
A great big house but so far from home  
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul  
  
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe  
It's like I can live, it's like I can love  
For the first time, for the first time  
For the first time, for the first time  
  
I'm electric, finally exposed  
You see through me, strip off all my clothes  
If this is falling, then let me go, oh  
  
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe  
It's like I can live, it's like I can love  
For the first time, for the first time  
For the first time, for the first time  
  
I'm finally awake and I can feel my heart  
It's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are  
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh  
Can you feel it  
  
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe  
It's like I can live, it's like I can love  
For the first time, for the first time  
For the first time, for the first time  
  
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe  
It's like I can live, it's like I can love  
For the first time, for the first time  
For the first time, for the first time

There ain't no time,  
No time for sorrow.  
And we ain't got time no time  
Ah time to be sad.  
  
And maybe the world ain't what it could be  
But to understand that is to know reality  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?  
Say oh child I never had it so good  
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start  
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could  
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know  
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow.  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
Ah now say tomorrow if you woke up a king  
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?  
You walk around complaining about how things are  
But what have you added to this world so far  
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is  
And tell me how much did you give  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on, hang on in there (hang on in there)  
  
There are plenty of things still left to live for  
A child, a friend, and a wife  
They all want to share your life.  
Ain't that enough to make you want hang on  
Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)  
  
The sign said  
"America, love it or leave"  
Well has it really come to that?  
And besides,  
I don't want to and you can't make me love  
  
I've got too many friends, that have she'd their blood,  
I've got too many relatives here born on this land  
So you can't make me leave  
I said this is my county and you can't make me leave  
Oh you can't make me love, the way you treat me, yeah  
You can't make me love yeah, the way you beat me.  
  
Hang on in there, I'm gonna hang on  
No matter you do or what you say

And so many lives we have lost

To tryin show you who I really am

[Verse 1]  
I should've known when the cop told me I'm goin' too fast  
He told me  
Speed like that and it's bound to be a hell of a crash  
He told me  
Better late than you don't get there, do the math  
Oh you oughta be grateful  
For what you have  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Well what if I refuse to learn?  
I see a flame, I wanna get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you  
For showin' up at the party?  
Lookin' through me in that way  
Saw somethin' inside of me break  
Saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why's it hard for a man to be satisfied?  
Oh, I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side  
'Cause it's all been comin' to this and goddamn I won't be denied  
Oh I'm gonna take one more chance tonight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, what if I refuse to learn?  
I see the flame grow, I gotta get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you  
For showin' up at the party?  
Lookin' through me in that way  
Saw somethin' inside of me break  
Saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
[Bridge]  
Did I know my weakness?  
Did I mount all my defenses?  
Did I tell you to leave me alone?  
How can I blame you?  
You saw somethin' inside of me break  
You saw me wanna make a mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
How can I blame you?  
You saw somethin' inside of me break  
You saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin' over my daydreams?  
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry  
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
I wanna blame it on you  
I wanna blame it on you, yeah

Hmm  
  
[Snoop talking ]  
Hey yo nephew check this out man  
Now I know you got that bad chick right there  
You ain't even tripping off of her  
But she doing all of that for you  
She got this, she got that  
She's off the hizzle  
I mean when you find one like that  
You got to make that change man  
'Cause they don't come too often  
And when they do come  
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change  
Like Sam Cooke say change gon' come nephew  
And you better believe that  
  
As I look back on all that I've done to you  
My biggest regrets  
The things that I never could do  
I see the light now baby it's shining through  
Gotta give up the game  
Yeah I got some changin' to do  
  
I won't get high if you want it  
Get that straight  
Nine to five if you want it  
Keep my ass home at night if you want it  
Whatever you need me to do  
  
When you talk I'ma listen  
Give you all that attention you missing  
Girl I swear I'ma handle my business  
Just like a real man should do  
  
I can change  
I can change (you know I can change baby)  
I can change  
For you (you know I can stop baby)  
I can change (you know I change baby)  
I can change  
I can change  
For you (you know I can stop baby)  
  
I'll give up all the places I used to go  
Stay out the club  
Stay home because I'm with you  
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know  
They don't compare  
Baby I swear it's the truth (you know it's the truth baby)  
  
So I'm through with the women  
Yeah that's right  
I give up on the pimpin'  
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'  
If that's what you want me to do  
  
I'll get right if you want it  
Go to church  
Get baptized if you want it  
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna  
Be much better for you  
  
Baby believe me  
Baby believe me  
  
I can change (you know I can change baby)  
I can change (know I can change baby)  
I can change  
For you  
I can change  
I can change  
I can change  
For you  
  
[Snoop's Rap ]  
Take me to the river  
And baptize my soul  
I'm so outta control  
Needing someone to hold  
Man it's cold  
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'  
I'm focused  
Bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'  
  
I'm trying to figure out a way  
But I just don't know how to say  
But I'm rearrangin'  
Hopefully I'm changin'  
And you can see that  
Baby 'cause it's hard for me  
Kinda sorta odd for me  
But ain't nothing to it  
If you need me to do it  
I guess'  
  
I can change  
I can change  
I can change  
For you (I'll give up on the pimpin' for you)  
I can change  
I can change  
I can change  
For you (sing it again y'all)  
  
I can change  
I can change  
I can change  
For you  
I can change  
I can change  
I can change  
For you  
  
You know I can stop baby  
  
Gotta believe me (you gotta believe me baby)  
Gotta believe me (mmm yeah)

You know I can stop baby

Get baptized if you want it  
This time I mean it  
  
Gotta believe me (this time I mean it)  
Gotta believe me  
I'm telling the truth

[Verse 1]  
They say sing what you know  
But I've sung what they want  
Some folks do what they're told  
But baby this time I won't  
When I look through that door  
I know the truth from lie  
Some things I've done before I can't justify  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
There are kings in my past  
Things no one can be proud of  
But I stand in the light I've cast  
And turn away from any lack of love  
Oh, when I walked through that door  
I say here I go  
You see me and nothing more  
I'm singing what I know  
  
[Chorus]  
I know better  
I know better  
  
[Verse 2]  
Legend is just a name  
I know better than to be so proud  
I won't drink in all this fame  
I'll take more love than I'm allowed  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I won't hide or cut it off from where it came  
My history has brought me to this place  
This power and the color of my face  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know better  
I know better  
  
[Bridge]  
I'll rise from the floor if I don't win  
I'll bust open that door so let me in  
And if music chooses me to sing I let her  
I'll sing what I know, yes  
  
[Chorus]  
I know better, oh  
I know better, yes  
I know better  
I know better

I wish I knew how, it would feel, to be free  
I wish I could break, all the chains, holding me  
And I wish I could say, all the things, that I should say  
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear, for the whole world to hear  
  
I wish I could share, all the love, that's in my heart  
Remove all the bars, that keep, us apart  
And I wish you could know, what it means, to be me  
Then you'd see, and agree, that every man, should be free  
  
I wish I could give, I'm longing to give  
And I wish I could live, like I'm longing to live  
And I wish I could do, all the things I can do  
Though I'm way overdue, I'd be starting to move  
  
Well I wish I could be, like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be, if I found I could fly  
Well I'd soar to the sun, then I'd look down at the sea  
Then I'd sing cause I'd know  
Yes I'd, sing cause I'd know  
Sing cause I know  
I know I'm free, yeah  
Yes I know I'm free

If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late  
  
We've been looking for a song to sing  
Searched for a melody  
Searched for someone to lead  
We've been looking for the world to change  
If you feel the same  
Then go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
No more broken promises  
No more call to war  
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for  
We can destroy hunger  
We can conquer hate  
Put down the arms and raise your voice  
We're joining hands today  
  
Oh I was looking for a song to sing  
I searched for a leader  
But the leader was me  
We were looking for the world to change  
We can be heroes  
Just go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
Oh now, now  
  
If you're ready we can shake the world  
Believe again  
It starts within  
We don't have to wait for destiny  
We should be the change that we want to see  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
And you're ready now  
Say it loud  
Scream it out  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
  
If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late

Oh do you remember (ooh)  
When the family was everything? (ooh)  
Oh do you remember? (ooh)  
It was so long ago and so much has changed (ooh)  
I want to go back (go back...ooh)  
want to go back to those simple days (ooh)  
I want to go back (go back...ooh)  
But now we've grown and gone our separate ways  
  
(aah)  
Times is hard (times is hard)  
And things are a changin'  
I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change  
No it don't have to change  
  
Do you remember (ooh)  
Back at Grannie's house on Christmas Day? (ooh)  
Help me sing...  
Do you remember (ooh)  
How we'd gather 'round and sing all day? (ooh)  
I want to go back (go back...ooh)  
To playing basketball and football games  
I want to go back (go back...ooh)  
To yesterday but it's not the same  
  
Times is hard (times is hard)  
And things are a changin'  
I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change  
No it don't have to change  
  
Times is hard (times is hard)  
And things are a changin'  
So I pray to God  
That we can remain the same  
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change  
No it don't have to change

I don't want to be, what you want me to be  
So when I call, you just yelling at me  
I'm sorry its my fault, its over  
  
[chorus: x2]  
Now what do you keep calling there for  
Its over, its over  
  
(its over)  
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling  
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled  
I don't wanna be what you want me to be  
So when I call you're just yelling at me  
(I'm sorry it's my fault)  
Oh and the clothes I brought you can still wear  
Did you store the cards and teddy bears  
See there I go again sticking my nose  
(I'm sorry it's my fault)  
  
[chorus: x2]  
  
(It's over)  
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough  
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful  
You know we used to talk about our future  
(It ain't just all my fault)(I know, I know we used to talk about it babe)  
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall  
The way we stand in the rain and we would ball (we would cry)  
Just say goodbye to the walks and talks and the dogs in the park  
(And it ain't just all my fault)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Kayne West]  
(It's over)  
We lost a four leaf clover  
Don't ask my shorty be over  
News flash shorty we over  
We like def jam and Hova  
We like Bobby and Whitney  
Except without the kiddies  
Just like Pamela Anderson's career  
Except without the tittes  
We had some good times didn't we  
I know I won't forget that  
But we had some bad times and  
That's time I wish I could get back  
But I love you I can't let go  
Now I just I just don't know  
You been around me long enough  
To know that now it's over.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(It's over) it's nothing we can do with it  
So you might as well forget it (it's over)  
Like we never ever did it (it's over) [Repeat: x4]

I've got something new for you

And I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating  
Even walking funny 'cuz your legs are shaking  
All night we'll be blazin'

Hold tight we'll be alright

You know we've been struggling for such a long time  
Working here and there just to get by

No more robbing Peter so we can pay Paul (oh no)  
Or going to Mama's house to make a phone call (no no)

'Cause Boo I got the money today  
Come on and go to the mall and let's play  
Let's go raise a toast to the days ahead  
You can't take it with you when you're dead  
You might as well enjoy it now instead  
  
Oh now, it's about to be a long evening (yeah yeah)  
We'll party through the rest of the weekend (come on)  
We're finally on our way  
Baby now it's time to celebrate

In the moonlit sky  
'Cause there's no more cloudy days

[Verse 1]  
Pulling me further, further than I've been before  
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core  
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars  
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours  
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, I want you to love me now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed  
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no  
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to
good  
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall
apart  
  
[Chorus]  
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?  
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
And I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now  
Love me now, love me now  
Love me now  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright  
Let's make the most of every moment tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now  
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone  
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have  
I know it'll kill me when it's over  
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Love me now, love me now  
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh  
Love me now, love me now  
Love you now  
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, yeah  
  
Time is gettin' harder and harder  
More and more each day, yeah  
Still I am determined that I. 'm never gonna change my way  
Thinking 'bout love the way it should be  
You gotta open your eyes and you will see  
About love the way it should be  
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity  
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa  
  
What happened to the love  
That they are all talking about?  
It's nothing but useless words  
Coming from out of their mouths  
Talking 'bout love the way it should be  
We gotta open our eyes and we will see  
About love the way it should be  
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity  
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa  
  
Whoa, yes, yeah!  
  
What happened to the love  
That they are all talking about?  
It's nothing but useless words  
That are coming from out of their mouth  
Talking 'bout love the way it should be  
Open our eyes and we will see  
About love the way it should be  
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity  
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa  
  
Listen, people listen

Listen what I'm saying to you  
You got the notion (I hope so)  
A little bit of justice and peace  
You got the notion (I hope so)  
Bring a little love for everyone  
You got the notion (our hope's on)  
You got the notion

[Verse 1]  
What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice  
If you don't believe in the afterlife?  
Oh I still grieve rememberin' what you were like  
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are better than good  
Greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
And they get told to wait by  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
  
[Verse 2]  
What if your like was just in the day to day  
And after you're gone the world stays the same?  
Why should you love what you're gonna lose anyway?  
Oh I've imagined one hundred ways  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
We'll just have to wait, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh Heaven knows where we are  
Chasing the fading stars  
Heaven knows where we are  
Motioning to the dark  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Some are better than good  
And greater than great  
Some are misunderstood  
They get told to wait  
Some are just no good  
Some will let it just fade  
Some are misunderstood  
We'll just have to wait, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Wanna know who  
Who'll be the latest  
The latest to fall?  
We're marching into the dark  
I wanna go marching into the dark  
All of the greatest  
The greatest of all  
Were chasing their fading star  
Were chasing their fading star  
Who'll be the latest  
Latest to fall?  
Marching into the dark

I happened to notice a girl, in a light shade of blue  
I happened to see her... the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
  
You should've seen the way she wore her dress  
And her white stiletto shoes  
You should've seen the way they looked on her,  
Just like the ones that I bought you  
I searched for days on end to no avail 'til I found them in Peru  
She must've been to Lima just as well  
Because she had them too  
  
You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face  
She looked as sweet as honeydew  
You should've seen the way she walked away  
Oh, she swayed her hips like you  
  
I was only several steps from her but she never noticed me  
I took another sip of fine liqueur  
It was quite a sight to see  
  
I happened to notice the girl in the light shade of blue  
I happened to see her... the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
  
Oh, you should've seen the way he stroked her hair,  
And the smile that lit her face  
You shoud've seen the way he kissed her lips  
Did it have the same sweet taste?  
  
Though my mind it might be running wild in constant search of you  
It's funny how my eyes keep seeing things, my heart would not believe are true  
  
I happened to notice a girl, in a light shade of blue  
I happened to see her... the sight of her leaves me confused  
  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
She may not be you... But she looks just like you  
  
I happened to notice a man, in a dark shade of blue  
Who happened to be with a woman who leaves me confused  
She may not be you... but she looks just like you  
  
Maxine, she looks just like you  
Maxine, she looks just like you  
Maxine... Maxine... Maxine..... Maxine  
Maxine... Maxine... Maxine... Maxine...

Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
I'm calling but I can't get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
I'm searching for the lover that I knew  
Have you see her  
Where did she go  
Feels like I just lost my only friend  
  
Plains subsided colors faded  
Love just got so complicated  
Wished that I could see her smile again  
  
So if you see her out there  
Tell her I'm still here  
Waiting for the date when she will reappear  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
I'm calling but I can't get through  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Maybe I was wrong and I  
Ignored her for too long and I  
Didn't even notice when she slipped away  
  
Oh, maybe while I lay fast asleep  
When out into the night she creeps  
I'll leave the light on  
So she will come back someday  
  
Oh, if you see her out there  
Tell her its not fair  
And the life just not the same when she's not here  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what I'm suppose to do  
  
Please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh woo, oh,  
Oh woo  
  
Where did my baby go  
I wonder where she ran off too  
I miss my baby so  
Just what I'm suppose to do  
  
Oh, please tell that girl if you meet her  
That someone's longing to see her  
Where did my baby go  
I wish that she would get back soon  
Get back soon  
Get back soon  
Oh get back soon

Don't let it fool you brother  
Beware of what you see  
You've been consumed by all your visions of luxury  
Betrayed your friends and burned the  
Bridges that carry you  
But when you need them later, they won't be there for you  
  
You're so high now  
You think you'll never fall  
But when you come down, who will you call?  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown  
Your friends are gone and you're all alone  
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to  
You should know it won't make you whole  
You gain the world but lose your soul  
Spend your life in the search for dough  
You'll find out it just won't save you  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
You think that having money brings joy and peace to you  
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you  
Chase the American Dream but can't face reality  
That what you're chasing only lasts temporarily  
  
You're so high now  
You think you'll never fall  
But when you come down, who will you call?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) oh  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) oh  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)  
Ooh you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) oh  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere to run to (Nowhere to run to)  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey, yeah
yeah  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) oh, yeah, yeah  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey,
there's nowhere  
  
Nowhere to run to  
Just won't save you  
Nowhere to run to  
Just won't save you

I see you in the lonely place  
How can you be so blind  
You still regretting the love you left, left behind  
Oh darling, I seen you go through the changes  
Sitting alone each night  
Are you expecting to find the love, love that's right  
  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you light  
Girl you never find a love that's right  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you the light  
Girl you think your so wise, your so wise  
  
There are times when you need someone  
I will be by your side  
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass me by  
Oh darling, there is a light that shines  
Special for you and me  
You need to look at the other side, you'll agree  
  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you the light  
You may never find a love that's right  
  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you the light  
You may never find a love that's right  
  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you the light  
You may never find a love that's right  
  
Darling open your eyes  
Let me show you light  
Girl you think your so right  
You may never find a love that's right

One man come in the name of love  
One man come and go  
One man come, he justify  
One man to overthrow  
  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
  
One man caught on a barbed wire fence  
One man he resist  
One man washed on an empty beach  
One man betrayed with a kiss  
  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
  
Late afternoon, April 4  
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky  
Free at last, they took your life  
They could not take your pride  
  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?  
In the name of love  
What more in the name of love?

Oh you said it  
Oh yea  
  
[Verse 1]  
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby, it wouldn't matter
anyway  
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly  
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby  
Did you know  
  
[Bridge]  
The news said the sky is falling, the globe is warming  
My country warring, leaders are lying, time is running  
No where to go  
  
[Chorus]  
I know we just met but baby could u love me quickly, quickly  
I, want you to love me like you know the world is about to end baby, quickly  
  
[Verse 2]  
You said you didn't even know my name, but  
Told me we mind as well make ours the same  
What do you think baby (no time)  
Think it mind as well be light years away, ohhh  
We just better land on the stars before they come crashing down cause I heard
the news say  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yea that's right baby kiss me like the world is quacking  
Do it like the earth is shaking  
You got it baby, that's right lovely  
Fill me like our time is sprinting faster running out of time  
  
[Chorus]

There's a fire starting in my heart,  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.  
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.  
See how I leave, with every piece of you  
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.  
There's a fire starting in my heart,  
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling...  
We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you, never had met me)...  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rollin in the
deep)  
Baby I have no story to be told,  
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.  
Think of me in the depths of your despair.  
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.  
The scars of your love, remind me of us.  
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all  
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless  
I can't help feeling...  
We could have had it all... (you're gonna wish you never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep  
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the
deep)  
Could have had it all  
Rolling in the deep.  
You had my heart inside of your hand,  
But you played it to the beat.  
Throw your soul through ever ope door (whoa)  
Count your blessings to dins what you look for (whoa -uh)  
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)  
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.  
(You're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
We could have had it all (tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you... Never had met me)  
It all. (tears are gonna fall)  
It all  
It all (rolling in the deep)  
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you, never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
And you played it... (tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (rolling in the
deep)  
We could have had it all (you're wish you never had met me)  
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)  
You had my heart inside... (you're gonna wish you)... Of your hand (never had
met me)  
But you played it  
You played it.  
You played it.  
You played it to the beat

I wonder, wonder wonder  
Why your eyes they wonder?  
I wonder, wonder wonder  
About the spell that you are under  
Tell me its some hocus pocus  
Made to lose your focus  
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice  
  
[Bridge]  
You don't love me like you say you do  
You don't want me the way that I want you  
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Can I get me some satisfaction [Repeat: x3]  
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you  
Give me the magic pass, that's all I ask of you  
  
I wonder if it's over, middle of October  
I don't know why in autumn, she keeps giving a cold shoulder  
She knows how much I love her don't know what I could have told her  
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Why don't you give me (give me give me give me give me your love)  
Give me your love (give me give me give me your love  
Is that too much to ask you can I  
Get some satisfaction from you  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Say that you'll stay a little  
Don't say 'bye bye' tonight  
Say you'll be mine  
Just a little bit of love is worth a moment of your time  
Knocking on your door just a little  
So cold outside tonight  
Let's get a fire burning  
Oh, I know I keep it burning right  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
This just might hurt a little  
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right  
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain  
Pleasure is on the other side  
  
Let down your guard just a little  
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine  
Hold on to me, pretty baby  
You will see I can be all you need  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(pa ya pa pa)  
(da da da)  
  
Oh, come on  
Make time to live a little  
Don't let this moment slip by tonight  
You'll never know what you're missing till you try  
I'll keep you satisfied  
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love, save a little  
Save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me, oh  
  
Save room for my love  
Save room for a moment to be with me  
Save room for my love  
Save a little, save a little for me  
Won't you save a little?  
Save a little for me

[Chorus:]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
Gotta admit to this little addiction  
To the ladies and they just can't fix him  
Conversation and the drinks start mixin'  
And I'm a champ like the Detroit Pistons  
  
I tried to contain myself  
But I can't restrain myself  
I can only blame myself  
Maybe I need to get some help  
  
So what can I do?  
It's so hard to chew  
This one's for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
The startin' five how do I pick them?  
I came up with this rating system  
I think about how it feels when I kiss them  
And when I'm gone do I truly miss them?  
Well baby, you made the team  
Now go cook my favorite things  
Some greens and some chicken wings  
Tastes so good that you make me wanna sing  
  
So what can I do?  
It's so hard to chew  
This one's for you  
Yeah all of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby  
  
I'm callin'  
Out to  
All my  
Y'all my ladies, and I can't  
Let you  
Be with, no one, but me, baby

Last night was the last night  
You'll ever spend alone  
Couldn't wait  
Did it in the living room  
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans  
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby  
Even if the world is crazy  
Pick some names, boy or girl  
Then we'll change, change the world  
  
So after you change your clothes  
Girl, if you change your mind  
I'm ready, whatever time  
  
It's the beginning of forever  
You don't have to go  
Sometimes you just know  
It's the beginning of forever  
It don't have to end  
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh  
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh  
  
Last time was the last time  
I was worn and done  
You the best, that's why I want another one  
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans  
Planned to take you to my elevator  
And cook a little breakfast later  
Pick a place and go there, girl  
Then we'll change, change the world  
  
So after you change your clothes  
Girl, if you change your mind  
I'm ready, whatever time  
  
It's the beginning of forever  
You don't have to go  
Sometimes you just know  
It's the beginning of forever  
It don't have to end  
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh  
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

Ran into you yesterday  
Memories rushed through my brain  
Its starting to hit me  
Now you're not with me  
I realize I made a mistake  
I thought that I needed some space  
But I just let love go to waste  
Its so crystal clear now  
That I need you here now  
I gotta get you back today  
  
This time I want it all  
This time I want it all  
Showing you all the cards  
Giving you all my heart  
This time I'll take the chance  
This time I'll be your man  
I can be all you need  
This time its all of me  
  
I hit the bar every night  
Looking to score a good time  
Its not like I planned it  
Left empty handed  
Cause Im still alone in my mind  
Now what will it take to feel right  
Can I come see you tonight  
Is there someone new now  
What can I do now  
Cause I need you back by my side  
  
This time I want it all  
This time I want it all  
Showing you all the cards  
Giving you all my heart  
This time Ill take the chance  
This time Ill be your man

Last time I wasnt sure.  
This time I will give you more

Last time I didn't know  
I messed up let her let you go  
I need you, don't say no  
  
Laying alone in this room  
All that is missing is you  
Pick up the phone  
Wont you come home

Giving you all my heart  
This time Ill take the chance

This time its all of me  
All of me

The best you ever had

Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed  
No more backward thinkin' time for thinkin' ahead  
The world has changed so very much  
From what it used to be  
There is so much hatred war and poverty  
Oh yeah  
  
Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way  
Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say  
Cause they're the ones who's coming up  
And the world is in their hands  
When you teach the children  
Teach 'em the very best you can  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
The world won't get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world won't get no better  
We gotta change it yeah,  
Just you and me.  
  
Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well  
They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell  
But they don't have so very long before the Judgment Day  
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away.  
  
Wake up all the builders time to build a new land  
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand  
The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds  
Surely things will work out cause they do every time.  
  
The world won't get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world won't get no better  
We gotta change it yeah,  
Just you and me.  
  
Yeah, yeah  
  
It's the God hour  
The morning I wake up  
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker  
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers  
My mom buidin' on skyscrapers and acres  
He said take us back to where we belong  
I try to write a song  
As sweet as the Psalms  
Though I'm the type to bare arms  
And wear my heart on my sleeve  
Even when I fell in God I believe  
Read the days that weave through the maze  
The seasons so amazing  
Feed them and raised them  
Seasons are aging  
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors  
I want us to get by but  
We're more than consumers  
We more than shooters, more than looters  
Created in this image so God live through us  
And even in this generation, living through computers  
Only love love love can reboot us  
  
Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed  
Wake up, everybody  
Need a little help,  
Can't do it alone  
Need a little help y'all  
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon  
Need a little help, y'all  
Can't do it alone  
Need a little help, y'all  
Can't do it alone  
Oh, wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody

Yea they wanna be loved  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on  
They wanna be loved  
  
Everywhere I go  
Everywhere I be  
I see lonely hearts and fallen leaves  
Where did those hearts go  
Do they find their match  
Or do they drift away  
It's time to bring them back  
  
They wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
Come on it's simple enough  
They wanna be loved  
They wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
A little kiss and a hug  
They wanna be loved  
  
Now everybody knows it don't always last  
But if I can't have it for long then I want it fast  
Better love for now then for never at all  
So baby if you down, then gimee a call  
  
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
Come on it's simple enough  
I wanna be loved  
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
A little kiss and a hug  
I wanna be loved  
  
I wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
Come on it's simple enough

I wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
A little kiss and a hug

You wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
Come on it's simple enough  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved, wanna be loved  
A little kiss and a hug

Come sweetly  
Stop me through the shadow of an open door  
Breathe quietly now  
Take us through the helplessness of it all  
  
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow  
Wonder if the only thing that's left is now  
Wonder if I ever, will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
Oh, lie to me  
Lie to me, tell me I'm not wasting time  
Oh, convince me you miss me  
Your heart still beats as fast as mine  
Tell me lies  
  
We loved it  
Loved it even more than we know  
We lost it  
And I don't even know what to do  
Tell me what to do  
  
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow  
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now  
I wonder if I'll ever be the same  
Will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
Oh, your eyes haunt me  
Taunt me, pierce straight through my heart again  
Will it ever end  
Cause I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow  
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now  
Wonder if I ever, will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
We loved it, we loved it  
We lost it, we lost it

[Verse 1]  
Go from zero to a hundred and up it crazy  
Don't believe it when you say that you fuckin' hate me, no  
Use your tongue to crucify me, you motivate me, oh I  
Throwing down when it ends up with your legs around me  
Your legs around me, oh  
We rise, we fall, we wreck it all  
My pride is at your beck and call  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
  
[Verse 2]  
I could stop, I could leave, but no, I don't wanna  
It's a mess I'm obsessed with your kind of torture  
It's my kind of torture  
Oh, we rise, we fall, we wreck it all  
You kill me with every kiss and don't you know...  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
  
[Bridge]  
I don't know how you take control of me baby  
I don't know how you got a hold  
  
[Chorus]  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
(Yeah, that's what you do to me)  
Make me love and hate you at....  
That's what you do to me, yeah  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
Oh, that's what you do, you always do me right  
Screaming through the night  
Make me love and hate you at the same time, at the same time, at the same time  
That's what you do to me  
What you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do to me  
That's what you do, you watch me lose my mind  
Make me feel like I...  
I would die if you were out of my life  
That's what you do to me
