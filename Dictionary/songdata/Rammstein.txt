Love is a wild animal  
It breathes you it looks for you  
It nests upon broken hearts  
And goes hunting when there are kisses and candles  
It sucks tightly on your lips  
And digs tunnels through your ribs  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts  
  
Amour Amour  
Everyone just wants to tame you  
Amour Amour in the end  
Caught between your teeth  
  
Love is a wild animal  
It bites and scratches and steps towards me  
It holds me tightly with a thousand arms  
And drags me into it's love nest  
It devours me completely  
And retches me back out after many years  
It drops softly like snow  
First it gets hot then cold in the end it hurts  
  
Amour Amour  
Everyone just wants to tame you  
Amour Amour in the end  
Caught between your teeth  
  
Love is a wild animal  
You fall into it's trap  
It stares into your eyes  
Spellbound when it's gaze hits you  
  
Please please give me poison  
  
[1] "Amour" is French for "love".

Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over  
  
A two-legged being on all fours  
I take him for a walk  
Ambling along the corridor  
I am disappointed  
  
Now he comes backwards towards me  
Honey stays stuck on the garter  
I am disappointed, totally disappointed  
  
Bend over  
Your face doesn't interest me  
  
The two-legged one has bent over  
And moved into a good light  
I show him what you can do  
And I start to cry  
  
The biped stammers a prayer  
Because he's scared I'm feeling even worse  
He tries to bend over even more  
Tears run up his back  
  
Bend over  
  
Bend over, I command you  
Turn your visage away from me  
I don't care about your face  
Bend over once more  
  
Bend over

Bend down I order you  
Turning your face back from me too  
I don't need to see it now  
Bend down  
A biped who is on all fours  
I'll lead him down on the floor  
In quick-step we move along  
I'm so displeased  
Now crawling backwards to meet me  
Honey stains his tights so badly  
I'm so displeased  
Sadly displeased  
Bend down  
I've no interest in the rest  
The biped stuttered a short prayer  
In fear of what I couldn't bear  
Tried to bend down more and more  
Tears we're running off to the floor  
Bend down  
Bend down I order you  
Turning your face back from me too  
I don't need to see it now  
Bend down, you know how  
Bend down

Put that collar on me  
then I'll go down on my knees  
and begin to bark  
the pain has never been better  
  
Open the cage  
bring me into the realm of stars  
  
Come hurt me slowly  
put chains on me  
and tie the knot tightly  
so that I can laugh  
  
Open the cage  
bring me into the realm of stars  
  
There where the stars have been  
wheels of fire turn  
we celebrate a passion  
the pain is beautiful like you

They stand with their arms tightly around each other  
A mixture of flesh, so rich in days  
Where the sea touches the land  
She wants to tell him the truth  
But the wind eats her words  
Where the sea ends  
She holds his hand, trembling  
And kissed him on the forehead  
She carries the evening in her chest  
And knows that she must wither away  
She lays her head in his lap  
And asks for a last kiss  
And then he kissed her  
Where the sea ends  
Her lips, delicate and pale  
And his eyes tear up  
The last kiss was so long ago  
The last kiss  
He does not remember it anymore

He lays the needle in the vein  
And he asks the music to come inside  
Between his throat and forearm  
The melody travels softly in the bones  
He has closed his eyes  
A battle rages in his blood  
An army marches through his bowel  
The intestines become warm slowly  
Nothing is for you  
Nothing was for you  
Nothing remains for you  
Forever  
He takes the needle from the vein  
The melody travels out of the skin  
Violins burn with shrieking  
Harps cut the flesh  
He has opened his eyes  
But he is not awake  
Nothing is for you  
Nothing was for you  
Nothing remains for you  
Forever

He is religious and very sensitive  
On his wall is a picture of the Lord  
He wipes the dust from the Bible  
And he happily distributes the Communion  
  
He loves the boys in the choir  
They keep their souls pure  
But the tenor worries him  
So he must be closest to him  
On his nightstand, quiet and wordless  
A picture of the Lord  
He slowly turns it around  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He folds his hands for prayer  
Hallelujah  
He has lived without a wife  
Hallelujah  
So he must love his neighbour  
Hallelujah  
  
The young man is allowed to live with him  
The sin nests above the leg  
So he gladly helps to exorcize it  
By music and candlelight  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He folds his hands for prayer  
Hallelujah  
He has lived without a wife  
Hallelujah  
So he must love his neighbour  
Hallelujah  
  
When the church clock strikes twice  
Hallelujah  
He takes the boy into his prayers  
Hallelujah  
He is a true Christian  
Hallelujah  
And he knows what charity is  
Hallelujah  
  
Turn around slowly  
Turn around

Er ist fromm und sehr sensibel  
An seiner Wand ein Bild des Herrn  
Er wischt die Flecken von der Bibel  
Das Abendmahl verteilt er gern  
  
Er liebt die Knaben aus dem Chor  
Sie halten ihre Seelen rein  
Doch Sorge macht ihm der Tenor  
So muss er ihm am nachsten sein  
Auf seinem Nachttisch still und stumm  
Ein Bild des Herrn  
Er dreht es langsam um  
  
Wenn die Turmuhr zweimal schlagt  
Hallelujah  
Faltet er die Hande zum Gebet  
Hallelujah  
Er ist ohne Weib geblieben  
Hallelujah  
So muss er seinen Nachsten lieben  
Hallelujah  
  
Der junge Mann darf bei ihm bleiben  
Die Sunde nistet uberm Bein  
So hilft er gern sie auszutreiben  
Bei Musik und Kerzenschein  
  
Wenn die Turmuhr zweimal schlagt  
Hallelujah  
Faltet er die Hande zum Gebet  
Hallelujah  
Er ist ohne Weib geblieben  
Hallelujah  
So muss er seinen Nachsten lieben  
Hallelujah  
  
Wenn die Turmuhr zweimal schlagt  
Hallelujah  
Nimmt er den Jungen ins Gebet  
Hallelujah  
Er ist der wahre Christ  
Hallelujah  
Und wei?, was Nachstenliebe ist  
Hallelujah  
  
Dreh dich langsam um  
Dreh dich um

I want to  
I want you to trust me  
I want you to believe me  
I want to feel your eyes  
I want to control every heartbeat  
I want to hear your voices  
I want to disturb the peace  
I want you to see me well  
I want you to understand me  
I want your fantasy  
I want your energy  
I want to see your hands  
I want to go down in applause  
Do you see me?  
Do you understand me?  
Do you feel me?  
Do you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
We hear you  
Can you see me?

I want to

I do not feel like it x 4  
  
I'm not in the mood not to hate me  
I don't want to touch myself  
I would like to jack off  
but I don't want to try it  
  
I would like to take my clothes off  
but I don't want to see myself naked  
  
Ref: I would like to do it with big animals  
I don't want to risk it  
I don't feel like going away of the snow  
I don't feel like freezing  
  
I don't feel like chewing something  
cause I don't want to digest it  
I don't want to weigh myself  
I hate to lie in fat  
  
Ref:  
  
I will simply lie here  
and i will count once again the flies  
I touch myself without any desire  
and I soon notice that I have been cold since long  
so cold  
I am cold, so cold

Let me ride out on a tear  
Past your chin to Africa  
Once more to the she-lion's den  
Where I was at home back then  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching snow from just last year  
Never does the snow appear  
Let me ride out on a tear  
In the clouds there is no bliss  
A big bird gently slides his head  
Back into a secret crevice  
Inbetween your tender long legs  
Searching sand from just last year  
Never does the sand appear  
Hunger connects  
Just like an insect  
Asleep you never sense  
Right as it bites  
Nowhere can it be good so  
The finger slips to Mexico  
Then down it sinks into the sea  
Hunger has no mercy

I will go into the firs,  
There where I her last seen,  
But the evening threw a cloth onto the country,  
And on the ways term edge of forest,  
And the forest rises so black and empty,  
Pain me oh pain,  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be,  
Without you,  
With you am I also alone,  
Without you,  
Without you count ' I the hours,  
Without you,  
With you the seconds stand,  
Are not worth  
  
On the branches in the ditches,  
It is now quiet and without lives,  
And breathing falls me oh so heavily,  
Pain me oh pain,  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be,  
Without you,  
With you am I also alone,  
Without you,  
Without you count ' I the hours,  
Without you,  
With you the seconds stand,  
Are not worth, without you  
  
And breathing falls me oh so heavily,  
Pain oh pain,  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be,  
Without you,  
With you am I also alone,  
Without you,  
Without you count ' I the hours,  
Without you,  
With you the seconds stand,  
Are not worth, without you  
  
Without you!  
Without you!  
Without you!

Under the arc of the weather stain boards  
Ancient goblins and warlords  
Come out of the ground, not making a sound  
The smell of death is all around  
And the nights come and the cold wind blows  
No one cares and nobody knows  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
I'll follow Victor to a sacred place  
There ain't no dream I can escape  
Molars and fangs and clicking of bones  
Spirits moaning among the tombstones  
When the night has come and the moon is bright  
Someone cries and something ain't right  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
Oh no  
The moon is full, the air is still  
All of a sudden I feel a chill  
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away  
Skeletons dance, I curse this day  
And on the night when the wolves cry out  
Listen close and you can hear me shout  
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery  
I don't want to live my life again  
Oh no  

Punish me  
Punish me  
Straw is gold  
And gold is stone  
You are so big, make me small  
You're the master, make me crawl ja  
The lord does give  
The lord does take  
Punish me  
Punish me  
You say yes  
And I say no  
Lock me in all you worship  
Before the wind's cold hand grips  
You are so big, make me small  
You're the master, make me crawl  
You're the master, make me crawl  
You are so big, make me small  
You're the master, make me crawl  
You're so big you make him small  
You will punish me for all  
The lord does give  
The lord does take  
Does he give love to  
Those he foresakes?  
Punish me

A small wish, oh if you were blind  
we are victims of a bad trick  
black glass is everywhere  
we are guilty because we are ugly  
  
Black glass, the light blinds me  
a small wish, oh if you were blind  
black glass, and I see my face again  
what can I do since we are ugly?  
  
In front of the middle of a deep fall  
and under masks, fades smooth  
black glass is everywhere  
how beautiful you were is forgotten  
  
Black glass, the light blinds me  
a small wish, oh if you were blind  
black glass, and I see my face again  
what can I do since we are ugly?

What does a man do?  
What does a man?  
That can't distinguish a person from an animal?  
What?  
  
He will go to his daughter so late  
She is young and she's such sweet bait  
Just as if he were a dog  
With his own flesh and blood he will mate  
  
What - do you do?  
What - do you feel?  
What - are you?  
Only an animal  
  
What does a woman do?  
What does a woman do?  
That can't tell the difference between a man and an animal?  
  
She dips the feather in his blood  
Writes herself so many lines  
A lifeless letter from her childhood  
As her father slept by her side  
  
What (animal) do you do?  
What (animal) do you feel?  
What (animal) are you?  
Only an animal

What does a man do  
What does a man do  
Who can't tell the difference  
Between human and animal  
What  
  
He will go to his daughter  
She is beautiful and young  
And then, like a dog, will  
Mate with his own flesh and blood  
  
What do you do  
What do you feel  
What are you  
But only a  
Animal  
  
What does a woman do  
What does a woman do  
Who can't tell the difference  
Between animal and man  
  
She dips the feather in his blood  
And write herself a letter  
Lifeless lines to childhood  
When her father slept by her  
  
What do you do  
What do you feel  
What are you  
But only a Animal

Wild wine - before your castle  
Wild wine - I am ready  
Arrival is announced - only for the king  
God, stand by me - and open your gates  
Wild wine - and totally slow  
Wild wine - so warm and moist  
Wild wine - before your lap  
Wild wine - it has been written  
Deep in the water - you don't cross  
But my desire - laughs at the wings  
Wild wine - like a dove  
Wild wine - so wet and hot  
Wild wine - before this darkness  
Wild wine - healed by the light  
It stays hidden - otherwise we could defend ourselves  
I wait for you - at the end of the night  
Wild wine - only a grape  
Wild wine - and bitter like snow  
I wait for you - at the end of the night

Tell me how far you want to go  
do you want to see him on the floor - "Yes"  
do you want him to kneel before you  
do you want him to beg for mercy  
  
Thoughts of vengeance whipped from humility  
you don't see or hear anything  
your sick feelings  
don't give him a chance  
your rage does not want to die  
and only that keeps you alive  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"  
  
You ram your hatred like a stone  
into him "Ramming stone" -  
you have pursued, hunted, and cursed him  
and he has taken his heels, crawling  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from

"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"

You have me  
You have asked me  
You have asked me  
You have asked me  
And I have said nothing  
  
Will you until death seperates you  
Be true to her for all days  
  
No  
No  
  
Will you until death seperates you  
Love her in bad days  
  
No  
No  
  
Will you until death seperates you  
Be true to her  
  
No  
No
