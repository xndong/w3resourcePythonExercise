After you've gone and left me cryin'  
After you've gone there's no denyin'  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you'll regret it  
Someday, when you grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
After you've gone, after you've gone away  
  
After you've gone and left me cryin'  
After you've gone there's no denyin'  
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad  
You're gonna feel bad  
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,  
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time when you'll regret it  
But baby, think what you're doin'  
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so  
It's gonna drive you to ruin  
After you've gone, after you've gone away.

Come on and hear (2x), Alexander's Ragtime Band,  
Come on and hear (2x), it's the best band in the land!  
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,  
So natural that you want to go to war--  
That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb!  
Come on along (2x), let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man (2x), who's the leader of the band,  
And if you want to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime  
Come on and hear (2x), Alexander's Ragtime Band!  
  
  

When April showers may come your way  
They bring the flowers that bloom in May  
So when it's raining have no regrets  
Because it isn't raining rain you know  
It's raining violets  
  
And when you see clouds up on a hill  
You know they'll bring crowds of daffodils  
So just keep looking for a bluebird  
And listening for his song  
Whenever April showers come along  
  
And when you see clouds up on the hill  
You know there'll be crowds of daffodils  
So just keep looking for a bluebird  
And listening for his song  
Whenever April showers come a-long...  

Oh, it really wasn't my intention  
To disregard convention  
It was just an impulse  
That had to be obeyed.  
Beacon Hill behavior we've been scorning  
But I'll still not go in mourning  
Though my reputation  
Is blemished, I'm afraid.  
What's done is done  
But wasn't, and isn't it, fun  
Honestly, I thought you wouldn't.  
Naturally, you thought you couldn't.  
And probably we shouldn't.  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Actually, it all was blameless.  
(of course it was)  
Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless  
(I suppose)  
So the lady shall be nameless  
(thank you)  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Socially, you'll be an outcast  
Obviously, we dined alone  
On your good name there will be doubt cast  
With never a sign of any chaperone.  
No matter how they may construe it  
(it'll be the wrong way)  
Whether or not, we have to rue it  
(we will)  
Whatever made us do it  
Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Honestly, I thought I couldn't.  
Naturally, I thought I wouldn't.  
And probably I shouldn't.  
But aren't you kind of glad we did?  
Dinner was quite above suspicion  
Milk in the glasses when they'd clink  
Listening to a tired musician  
But what is it Mrs. Grundy's going to think?  
That I'm a bounder, a rounder, a cad, a Boston blighter  
When speaking of me, she'll be no politer  
Oh let's turn to something brighter  
Whatever we did, we're glad we did  
  
  

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord  
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored  
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword  
His truth is marching on  
  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
  
He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat  
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat  
Oh, be swift, my soul to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet  
Our God is marching on  
  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
  
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea  
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me  
As He died to make men holy let us die to make men free  
While God is marching on  
  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
Glory, glory, Hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
  
Amen

I'll remember forever  
When I was but three  
Mama, who was clever  
Remarking to me  
If son when you're grown up  
You want everything nice  
I've got your future sewn up  
If you take this advice  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Act the fool, play the calf  
And you'll always have the last laugh  
  
Wear the cap and the bells  
And you'll rate with all the great swells  
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread  
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead  
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes  
And you'll only stop with top folks  
  
Be a crack Jackanapes  
And they'll imitate you like apes  
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears  
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years  
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
If you just make 'em roar  
Watch your Mounte bank account soar  
  
Wear a painted mustache  
And you're sure to make a big splash  
A college education I should never propose  
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes  
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun  
And they'll happy to say you're A-1  
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck  
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck  
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

For ev'ry rose that withers and dies  
Another blooms in it's stead.  
A new love waits to open its eyes  
After the old love is dead.  
  
That sounds alright in a careless rhyme  
But there's seldom a second time  
  
Better luck next time  
That could never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me, no sirree  
  
Made up my mind  
To make another start  
I've made my mind up but I can't make up  
My heart  
  
I'd like a new lucky day  
That would be nice  
But this comes just once in a lifetime  
Not twice  
  
So don't say better luck next time  
That can never be  
Because there ain't gonna be no next time  
For me.

Some fellers like to tip-toe through the tulips,  
Some fellers go on singin' in the rain,  
Some fellers keep on painting skies with rainbows,  
Some fellers go on singin' down the lane.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
'Cause that's the kind of guy I'm,  
While other folks grow dizzy, I'll keep busy,  
Bidin' my time.  
  
Next year, Next year,  
Something's bound to happen,  
This year, this year,  
I'll just keep on nappin'.  
  
Bidin' my time,  
That's the kind of guy I'm,  
There's no regrettin' when I'm settin',  
Bidin' my time.

My mama done tol' me, when I was in pigtails  
My mama done tol' me, " Hon, a man's gonna sweet talk"  
And give ya the big eye, but when the sweet talkin's done  
A man is a two-face, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in
the night  
  
Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train's a-callin, "Whooee!"  
(My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle,  
"Whooee!"  
(My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back  
The blues in the night  
  
The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'  
And the moon'll hide it's light  
When you get the blues in the night  
  
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind of song  
He knows things are wrong, and he's right  
  
From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow  
I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I
know  
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in
the night  
  
My mama was right, there's blues in the night

I was talking to the mockingbird  
He says you are the worst he's heard.  
Bob White! What ya gonna swing tonight?  
  
I was talking to the whipporwill  
He says you've got a corny trill.  
Bob White! What ya gonna swing tonight?  
  
Even the owl, threw in the towel  
After you sang the gato!  
And the flamingo Hollared by jingo!  
What a vibrato!  
  
There's a lotta talk about you, Bob!  
And they're saying you're "off the cob."  
Fake it, Mister B  
Take it, follow me!  
Bob White!  
We're gonna break it out tonight!

We walk on every city street  
We walk in lanes where branches meet  
And stars send down their blessings from the blue.  
We go through storms of doubt and fear  
And so we walk from year to year  
Believing in each other as we do.  
Bravely marching forward two by two...  
  
Boys and girls like you and me  
Walk beneath the skies  
They love just as we love  
With the same dream in their eyes.  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on.  
  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on.

Old man sunshine, listen you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it, and I'll start a riot  
  
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare  
Ever tell me he will care  
I'm certain, it's the final curtain  
  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas  
Who tells you fate supplies a mate  
It's all bananas  
  
They're writing songs of love, but not for me  
A lucky star's above, but not for me  
With love to lead the way I've found more skies of gray  
Than any Russian play, could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall, and get that way  
Hi ho alas and also lackaday  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me

I'll go, I'll go, I'll go my way by myself  
This is the end of romance  
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance  
  
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart how to sing  
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing  
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own  
No one knows better than I myself, I'm by myself alone  
  
I'm sure that love's an overrated past time  
It's the last time I'll ever be anything but fancy free  
For love is just a junior high version, one way excursion  
I'm sure that I am old enough to fly alone  
  
And I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own  
No one knows better than I myself  
I'm by myself alone, I'll go, I'll go by myself alone

"Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina"  
  
Wishing is good time wasted,  
Still it's a habit they say,  
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,  
That's all I do all day.  
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,  
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning.  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning.  
If I had Aladdin's lamp  
For only a day  
I'd make a wish  
And here's what I'd say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
Dreaming was meant for night time  
I live in dreams all the day,  
I know it's not the right time,  
But still I dream away  
What could be sweeter than dreaming,  
Just dreaming and drift away.  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.  
  
No one could be sweeter  
Than my sweetie when I meet her  
In the morning.  
  
When the morning glories  
Twine around the door  
Whispering pretty stories  
I long to hear once more  
Strolling with my girlie  
Where the dew is pearly early  
In the morning.  
  
Butterflies all flutter up  
And kiss each little buttercup  
At dawning.  
If I had Aladdin's lamp  
For only a day  
I'd make a wish  
And here's what I'd say  
  
Nothing could be finer  
Than to be in Carolina  
In the morning.

I got the surprise, the surprise of my life  
I had to stop and stare  
I saw a man dancing with his own wife  
And you will never guess where  
  
Chicago, Chicago  
That toddlin' town, the toddlin' town  
Chicago, Chicago  
I'll show you around, I love it  
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues  
In Chicago, Chicago  
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down  
  
On State Street, that great street  
I just want to stay, I just want to stay  
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say  
They have the time, the time of their life  
I saw a man who danced with his wife  
In Chicago, Chicago  
  
Chicago, Chica-are-are-are-are-ago  
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town  
Chicago, Chica-are-are-go  
Let me cool my heels ri-ight down at Marshall Field  
Come and walk with me along the lake  
To the great hollar and hoot, all through the loop  
Shout how-now to Mrs O'Leary's cow  
No she-she, life is peachy  
  
Chicago, we'll meat at the pump room, Ambassador East  
To say the least, on shish kabab  
And best of squad we will see, and yet please  
Don't tell me sin is rampant and rife  
Think of that man who danced with his wife  
  
In Chicago, Chi-ca-go-o  
I'm in this city  
What a wonderful windy, time

From the dark cafes of Paris  
To the streets of Amsterdam  
From the homes of old Vienna  
To the shores of Uncle Sam  
Wherever freedom's hope is true  
Each heart cries out to you:  
  
Don't give up, Tommy Atkins,  
Be a stout fella,  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!  
Keep a stiff upper lip  
When you're in doubt, fella,  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!  
  
Oh the sun's sure to smile  
On your tight little isle,  
So hang on to your wits  
And you'll turn the blitz on Fritz,  
There's a whole world behind you  
Shoutin' "stout fella!"  
Chin up! Cheerio! Carry on!

I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you,  
Come rain or come shine.  
High as a mountain and deep as a river,  
Come rain or come shine.  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things,  
But don't ever bet me,  
"Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me.  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me,  
Come rain or come shine.  
Happy together, unhappy together  
And won't it be fine.  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny,  
We're in or we're out of the money,  
But I'm with you always,  
I'm with you rain or shine.

Every day, just go along dawn till sundown  
Here's a rundown  
Every day that comes, comes once in a lifetime  
  
Take each day and gather the rosebuds in it  
Fill each minute  
Every day that comes, comes once in a lifetime  
  
Think of now, tomorrow is waiting in the wings  
Who knows what it brings  
While the future waits, the present swings  
  
Day to day, in Brooklyn or China 'cross the bay  
Only once comes this particular sky  
Only once these precious hours go by  
Only once in a lifetime the day comes by  
So live, live, live, live today  
  
Think of now, tomorrow is waiting in the wings  
Who knows what it brings  
While the future waits, the present swings  
  
From day to day, in Brooklyn or China 'cross the bay  
Only once comes this particular sky  
Only once these precious hours go by  
Only once in a lifetime a day comes by  
So live, live, live, come on and live today

Have some pittie on an easterner,  
Show a little sympathy  
No one could possible could be steerner  
Than you have been with me,  
  
A.. there's a job that I'm applying for  
Let me put it to ya thus  
There's a partner ship I'm dien' for  
Mr. and Mrs. us  
  
So before you file it on the shelf,  
Let me tell you of myself  
  
Oh I'm the chapie to make ya happy  
I'll tie your shoesies, and chase you bluesies  
Oh lady would ya, could ya use me  
  
Now I'd shake the mat out  
And let the cat out  
I'll clean the garret  
And feed the parrot  
Oh lady would ya, oh tell me could ya use me?  
  
Do ya realize what a good man your getting in me?  
I'm no elker mason or woodman who gets home at three  
The girls that see me grow soft and dreamy  
But I'm a gander that wont falander  
Oh could ya use me, cause I certainly could use you  
  
There's a chap I know in Mexico  
Who's as strong as he can be  
Eating nails and drinking Texaco  
He is the type for me  
  
There is one I California  
More romantic far than you  
When he sings ha cha cha chornia  
I often think he'll do  
  
But as for you sir, I'm afraid  
You will never make the grade  
  
For your no cowboy, your soft, and how, boy  
I feel no mussel that's fit for tussle  
I must refuse you, I cannot use you  
  
'scuse me  
  
No night life for the  
Birds would bore youthe cows wont know you,  
A horse would throw you,  
You silly man you  
To ask me, can you use me?  
  
Ha  
  
Though at love you may be a wizard, I'm wanting to know  
Could you warm me up in a blizzard  
Say, forty below  
Your ties are freakish  
Your knees are weakish  
Your not a zender, you elbow bender  
Though you can use me  
I most certainly cant use you

Day in, day out  
The same old hoodoo follows me about  
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you  
And, darling, I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out, day in  
I needn't tell you how my days begin  
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain, come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips  
And the pounding becomes  
The ocean's roar  
A thousand drums  
Can't you see it's love  
Can there be any doubt  
When there it is  
Day in, day out

After that sweet Summer afternoon  
When for the first time I saw you appear,  
Dreaming of you I composed a tune,  
So will you listen to it, dear?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Doesn't one and one make two?  
Do I love you, do I?  
Does July need a sky of blue?  
Would I miss you, would I?  
If you ever should go away?  
If the sun should desert the day,  
What would life be?  
Will I leave you, never?  
Could the ocean leave the shore?  
Will I worship you for ever?  
Isn't heaven forever more?  
  
Do I love you, do I?  
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,  
Don't you know I do?  
Don't I show you I do,  
Just as you love me?

You really shouldn't have done it,  
You hadn't any right.  
I really shouldn't have let you kiss me.  
And although it was wrong,  
  
I never was strong.  
So as long as you've begun it,  
And you know you shouldn't have done it,  
Oh, do it again.  
  
I may cry no, no, no, no, no, but do it again.  
My lips just ache to have you take  
The kiss that's waiting for you.  
You know if you do you won't regret it.  
  
Come and get it.  
Oh, no one is near,  
I may cry oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, but no one can hear.  
Mama may scold me 'cause she told me  
  
It was naughty but then, please, do it again.  
Yes do it again, and again and again and again and again.  
Turn out the light.  
And hold me close in your arms  
  
All through the night.  
I know tomorrow morning  
You will say goodbye and amen.  
But until then, please do it again.

I'm tired of the noise and hurly-burly  
That fills the city late and early.  
I long to hear the music of the used-to-be  
That mother nature made for me.  
I want to wander where the skies are blue,  
Where birds are singing all the long day through,  
The music that I love to listen to  
Down on melody farm.  
The cowbells tinkle in the early morn.  
The bees are buzzin' 'round a field of corn,  
To tell me that another song is born  
Down on melody farm.  
The lazy river is drifting along  
While daffodils dance on a hill  
And while it's drifting it composes a song  
To a water lily.  
The morning sings the golden melody,  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony,  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm.  
I'm gonna pack my bag,  
I'm gonna clear my brain,  
And then I'm gonna buy a one-way ticket  
On the fastest choo-choo train.  
I'm gonna try to find  
A little peace of mind.  
I wanna leave the sound of rivets  
And the horns of taxis way behind.  
I want to run through the fields of the new-mown hay  
And at the close of day  
Let me stray  
Where I hear the organ playing.  
Just a song at twighlight  
When the lights are low.  
I wanna go,  
I wanna go  
I wanna be a little country girl in calico.  
The morning sings the golden melody,  
The evening brings the moonlight symphony,  
For all the world is wrapped in harmony  
Down on melody farm.  
  

Never saw you look quite so pretty before  
Never saw you dress quite so handsome - what's more  
  
I could hardly wait to keep our date  
This lovely Easter morning  
And my heart beat fast as I came through the door  
For...  
  
In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it  
You'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade.  
I'll be all in clover, and when they look us over  
We'll be the proudest couple in the Easter parade.  
  
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue,  
The photographers will snap us  
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.  
Oh, I could write a sonnet, about your Easter bonnet  
And of the guy I'm taking to the Easter Parade.  
  
On the avenue, Fifth Avenue,  
The photographers will snap us  
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.  
  
Oh, I could write a sonnet  
About your Easter bonnet  
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.

You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
  
And we would be so grand at the game  
Carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
You'd be so easy to love  
  
Easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep all the home fires burning for  
  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
Easy to love  
Easy to love

When the whole world seems wrong  
Just learn the words of a simple song,  
Of blue skies above,  
Be a troubadour and all is love.  
When April showers stray  
The silver lining will come they say,  
And singin' in the rain's the thing  
That those happy days again will bring.  
  
So, everybody sing, everybody sing!  
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.  
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!  
Oh, say can't you hear the orchestra play?  
Everybody sing, everybody start!  
You can't go wrong with a song in your heart.  
Everybody sing, get into the swing,  
Get happy, everybody sing.  
  
Yeah, everybody sing, come on now, everybody sing!  
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.  
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!  
Oh, say can't you hear la-da-de-oo-de-lay-de-lay-o?  
Everybody sing, everybody start.  
You can't go wrong with a song in your heart.  
Everybody sing, come on now get into that swing  
Go Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do  
Do Re Mi Fa So La Si Do  
  
Everybody sing, everybody sing!  
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.  
Sing before breakfast, help the birdies along.  
Before you have your buttered toast, have a song.  
Sing before breakfast, never quiet a thing.  
Before you eat your shredded wheat, sing, sing, sing!  
  
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye  
Four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie.  
When the pie was opened and set before the king,  
Four and twenty blackbirds started into sing.  
Sing a melody of love, a song will win your lady fair.  
Sing a song that mentions love and you will yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.  
  
Sing a song of cheer again,  
The skies above will be clear again,  
Those happy days are here again,  
Sing a song of cheer again.  
If you worry, if you fret, if you're getting deep in debt,  
Let your frown turn summerset, get yourself a good quartet.  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You can hear those darkies singin'.  
Sing good, sing bad,  
Sing loud, sing soft,  
Sing sweet, sing hot,  
Sing!  
  
Everybody sing, everybody sing!  
Let the sound of your voice turn winter to spring.  
Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!  
Oh, say can't you hear la-da-de-oo-de-lay-de-lay-o?  
Everybody sing, everybody start.  
You can't go wrong with a song in your heart  
Everybody sing, get into the swing,  
Go Do Re Me Fa So La Si Do  
Get Happy, get happy  
And everybody sing!

I hear tell there's a stranger in the Jones household  
(Yes siree, yes siree)  
That's what I'm told  
I hear tell there's a new arrival six days old  
(Yes siree, yes siree)  
Worth his weight in gold  
Come right in and meet the son  
Christening's done, time to have some fun  
(Yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)  
Yes siree, yes siree, it's a big holiday everywhere  
For the Jones family has a brand new heir  
He's the joy heaven sent and they proudly present  
Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones  
When he grows up he never will stray  
With a name like the one that he's got today  
As he walks down the street folks will say  
"Pleased to meet, Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones"  
What a smile and how he shows it  
He'll keep happy all day long  
What a name, I bet he knows it  
With that handle how can he go wrong?  
And the folks in the town all agree  
He'll be famous, as famous as he can be  
How can he be a dud or a stick in the mud  
When he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones?  
(Yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)  
'Cause he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones  

Paradise can not refuse us  
Never such a happy pair  
  
Everybody must excuse us  
If we walk on air  
  
All the shadows now will lose us  
Lucky stars are everywhere  
  
As a happy being  
Here's what I'm foreseeing  
  
For you, for me, forever more  
It's bound to be forever more  
  
It's plain to see  
We found, by finding each other  
The love we waited for  
  
I'm yours, you're mine  
And in our hearts  
The happy ending starts  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you, for me, forever more.  
  
What a lovely world  
This world will be  
With a world of love in store  
For you, for me, forever more.

There's a star for everyone  
Brightly shining in the sky  
It seems to be a part of our destiny  
Every night I eagerly,  
  
Watch them all go twinkling by  
But I can't seem to find the one the heavens  
Assigned to me...  
Friendly star, where could you be hiding  
  
Smile for me from out of the lonely night  
Friendly star, my fate needs deciding  
How I need the glow of your guiding light  
I know that you are near, for I am strangely dreamy  
  
And so if you can see me from afar  
Won't you kindly, light my way  
Lead me to my lover, Just point him out, And whisper,  
"There you are, there you are"  
  
Then my love, you will be  
Standing here, close to me  
In your eyes, I will see my friendly star.

From this moment on,  
You for me dear,  
Only two for tea dear,  
From this moment on,  
  
From this happy day,  
No more blue songs,  
Only hoop-de-doo songs,  
From this moment on  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on.  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment,  
From this moment,  
This very moment,  
This moment on.

Hear that bluebird, up in a tree  
Hear him, what a song  
Joy he's bringing, singing to me  
Singing, all day long  
Goodbye to skies of gray  
For I'm back home today...  
All day long I jump and run about  
You can always hear me shoutin' out  
"Hello bluebird!"  
Got no time for blues or anything  
I'm so happy, I just want to sing  
"Hello bluebird!"  
Blue skies, sun shine  
Friends that are real  
Old folks, sweetheart  
Oh, how I feel!  
I'll not go roaming like I did again  
I'll stay home and be a kid again  
"Hello bluebird, hello!"  
All day long  
I keep singing  
"Hello, I'm glad I found you, bluebird"  
Make yourself at home...  
No more blues  
Just because I'm happy  
When I'm around you, bluebird  
No more need to roam  
Up above the sun is shining  
The World is ideal  
I just can't describe the marvelous way  
That I feel...  
With nothing but the bluest skies above  
What a rosy future lies ahead  
Thank you, bluebird!  
Happy, happy, bluebird!  
Mister Bluebird, hello!

When our Grandmas and our Grandpas where just girls and boys  
The seemed to have a lot more fun than we  
Their party clothes were calicos and homemade courturoys  
And the big event was called a husking bee  
A banjo and a fiddle and a big old fashioned barn  
Was all the preparation that they made  
And if they tell you otherwise, dismiss it as a yarn  
Refreshments were confined to lemonade  
Now you may say it' corny.  
And I guess I must agree  
But it was good enough for Grandma, it was good enough for Grandpa  
And it' good enough for me  
Hoe down! The country' gone Hoe Down  
It' puttin it'' toe down and kickin it' heels  
Hoe Down. It' really a rare dance. A pioneer square dance  
But with a new deal  
One, two, swing your partner lightly. While you hold her ever so tightly  
And bring your best beau down  
We havin a show down and gotta make hast  
'cause hoe down' on it' way  
Stand in line and do the Turkey, like a Yankee Doodle Dandy  
When you turkey do it jerky, that' the trick, now your hoein on down  
Sashay, sashay, sashay around while your hoein on down  
Form a circle in the middle, everybody Allemande  
Boys keep tempo with the fiddle and your gal in the calico gown  
Whoa ho, whoa ho, whoa ho around in your calico gown  
Do-si-do around, it very romantic  
Do-si-do  
Do-si-do some more and maybe she'll fall  
Now it time to do your honors  
Then when your done your honors, promenade the hall!  
(repeat)

It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me?  
  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But what about me?  
  
You'll find somebody new  
But what am I to do  
I'll still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
  
It's over  
But how about me?

When a girl meets boy,  
Life can be a joy,  
But the note they end on,  
Will depend on little pleasures they will share,  
So let us compare.  
  
I like New York in June, how about you?  
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?  
I love a fireside when a storm is due.  
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,  
How about you?  
  
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,  
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.  
Holding hands at the movie show,  
When all the lights are low  
May not be new, but I like it,  
How about you?  
  
I like Jack Benny's jokes,  
To a degree.  
I love the common folks,  
That includes me.  
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue,  
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,  
How about you?  
  
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine,  
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.  
I can see we're in harmony,  
Looks like we both agree  
On what to do,  
And I like it, how about you?  
  
I'm so delighted I've ignited the spark within you.  
Let me continue to make it burn.  
With you I will be like a Trilby, so let's not dally.  
Come on Svengali, I've lots to learn.  
When you're arisin', start exercisin' daily.  
For example, just a sample?  
Bend and touch the floor fifty times or more.  
Ha! A fine start to be a Bernhardt!  
  
A dictionary's necessary but not for talking,  
It's used for walking the Ziegfeld way.  
Is this okay?  
That's the trick, you're catching on quickly.  
Should I take a bow?  
A-ho! Let me show you how!  
Just like partners on the stage.  
If you can use a partner,  
I'm the right age.

I can't give you anything but love, baby  
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby  
Dream a while, scheme a while  
You're sure to find  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for  
  
Now, gee I love to see you looking' swell, baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby  
Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby  
I can't give you anything but love  
  
Gee, I love to see you looking' swell, baby.  
Look like you just came up out of the wishing well, baby.  
Dream awhile, scheme awhile and you're sure happiness and  
ALL those things you been looking' for baby.  
Gee, I love to see you looking' swell, baby  
Diamond rings, bracelets, gold watches 'n' everything, baby.  
Until that lucky day, honey, you know good 'n' doggone well, honey,  
I can't give you a DADGUM thing but love.  
  
Now, I can't give you anything but love, baby  
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby  
Dream a while, scheme a while  
You're sure to find  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for  
Now, gee I love to see you looking' swell, baby  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby  
Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby  
I can't give you anything but love

When a dove is in love with a doll of a dove  
He is out all night, coo, cooing  
When the owl's on a prowl or a feminine fowl  
He goes out all night, woo, wooing  
Every bird and bee has it's lunacy  
In the way he works his dream off  
But when I feel high, here's the way  
That I like to get my kind of steam off  
Owls hoo, hoo, others sigh  
Doves coo, coo, ah, how I  
I could go on singing till the cows come home  
And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow  
When I see your eyes, I go all out  
I must vocalize till you shout, "Enough already"  
I could go on singing till the moon turns pink  
Anything from Faust to Ink-a-dink-a-dink  
Love does funny things  
When it hits you this way  
I could go on singing till the cows come home  
And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow  
When I see your eyes, I go all out  
I must vocalize till you shout, "Enough already"  
I could go on singing till the moon turns pink  
Anything from Faust to Ink-a-dink-a-dink  
Love does funny things  
When it hits you this way  
I must keep on singing, like a lark, going strong  
With my heart on the wings of a song, singing day  

I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me  
Every road has a turning  
That's one thing you're learning.  
I cried for you  
What a fool I used to be  
But I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,  
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me.  
  
I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby - like her.  
But maybe someday you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this
world.  
If your show's a flop you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast.  
Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself when I grow out of this ugly-
duckling stage.  
And you're no Clark Gable yourself.  
But that's all right.  
Don't worry about me, I'll recover.  
Time is a great healer.  
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball, and  
I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps,  
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes, you'll probably be sorry.  
And you'll probably realize that life is just an idiot's delight.  
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion,  
I can only say thanks - thanks for the memory.  
  
I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,  
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.  
I cried for you  
Now it's your turn to cry over me.

I left my heart  
In San Francisco  
High on the hill  
It calls to me  
  
To be where little cables cars  
Climb halfway to the stars  
The morning fog may chill the air  
I don't care  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me

The sleepless nights - the daily fights  
The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses - and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates - the endless waits  
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates  
The conversation - with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain - no more strain  
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punch - drunk  
  
The pulled out fur - of cat and cur  
The fine mismatching - of a him and her  
I've learned my lesson - but I wish I were  
In love again  
  
The furtive sigh - the blackened eye  
The words: "I love you - 'til the day I die"  
The self deception - that believes the lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals - it soon reveals  
The faint aroma - of performing seals  
The double-crossing - of a pair of heels  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No, no more care - no, no despair  
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
Believe me sir - I much prefer  
The classic battle - of a him and her  
I don't like quiet - and I wish I were  
In love again - in love again - in love again

I could show the world how to smile  
I could be glad all of the while  
I could change the gray skies to blue  
If I had you  
  
I could leave the old days behind  
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind  
I could start my life anew  
If I had you  
  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burning desert  
If I had you by my side  
  
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
  
  
  
  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burnin' desert  
If I had you by my side  
  
I could be a king uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
  
Baby, if I had you

I often wonder why he came to me  
Brought such a flame to me  
  
And let it die  
And if another love should find my heart  
It will remind my heart of your goodbye  
  
With every new love you  
Will come back to me  
In others eyes, its you I see  
If I love again  
Though its someone new  
  
If I love again  
It'll still be you  
In someone else's firm embrace  
I'll close my eyes but see your face  
  
If I love again  
I'll find other charms  
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms  
And though my lips whisper  
  
"I love you"  
My heart will not be true  
I'll be loving  
Every time I love again

I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
Hey ho, if love were all  
  
I should be lonely.  
I believe the more you love a man,  
The more you give your trust,  
The more you're bound to lose.  
  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
  
Cares would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near.  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse.  
Hey ho, if love were all.

When white clouds go sailin'  
To make my wedding gown,  
Then we'll go trailin'  
To the valley where the evening sun goes down.  
  
And hidden away in the gloamin'  
When leaves are turning brown,  
We'll end our roaming  
In the valley where the evening sun goes down.  
  
We'll build a home in our valley there,  
And watch it grow into a town  
And you can sit in your rockin' chair  
And watch the evening sun go down,  
The evening sun go down.

I've been searching through rains  
And the wind that follows after  
For one certain face  
And an unforgotten laughter  
I've been following signs  
I've been searching through the lands  
For a certain pair of arms  
And a certain pair of hands  
Yes, I tried a kiss here  
And I tried a kiss there  
For when you're out in company  
The boys and girls will pair  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
An occasional sunset reminded me  
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree  
Or one red star hung low in the west  
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest  
Made me think for a moment  
Maybe its true  
I found him in the star  
In the call  
In the blue  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
Anywhere, anywhere you

I bought a bonnet to suit my face  
I had my petticoat trimmed with lace  
I looked at the mirror, around I twirled  
And then I went out in the wide, wide world  
  
I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet  
I saw them all kneeling at my feet  
I can't understand it, my hair is all curled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it's a cold, cold, cold and we'll soon be old  
Alas and a lack, it's a great big world.  
  
I learned to sew and I learned to bake  
I even frosted an angel cake  
On Saturday evening, when folks dropped in  
My house was as neat as a brand new pin  
  
I thought by learning each social grace  
A chap might learn to forget my face  
I can't understand it, I've knitted and pearled  
But my goodness me it's a great big world!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had no petticoat trimmed with lace  
My angel cake was a sure disgrace  
My face was my fortune, my mother said  
And my dancing slippers of bright, bright red.  
  
A million miles I've danced or more  
In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor  
I can't understand it, I've Waltzed and I've whirled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world.  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
But I'll keep on knitting and doing it well  
My slippers are one thing I never will sell  
My petticoat's waiting, because who can tell?  
It's a great big world, it's a great big world.

It's love I'm after  
North, South, East and West  
I have gone in my quest,  
Far, wide  
  
High and low  
This one thing I know  
It's love I'm after  
I don't want to be a millionaire,  
The only thing on earth  
For which I care is love  
  
Ba da da da da do  
For love and laughter,  
For love and laughter  
I give all that I posses  
Don't you know the only  
  
Name for happiness  
Is love, love, love  
Rich man, poor man,  
Beggar man, thief,  
Feel the way I do  
Because each one of them believes  
He'll find somebody like you  
  
It's love I'm after,  
Love, I'm after,  
Love, it's love I'm after,  
It may make me rise or make me fall,  
But it's love I'm after,  
After all.

Days can be sunny  
With never a sigh  
Don't need what money can buy  
Birds in the trees sing  
Their day full of song  
Why shouldn't we sing along?  
  
I'm chipper all the day  
Happy with my lot  
How do I get that way?  
Look at what I've got  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
I've got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I don't mine him  
You won't find him  
Round my door  
  
I got starlight  
I got sweet dreams  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
I got rhythm  
I got music  
I got my man  
Who could ak for anything more?  
I got daisies  
In green pastures  
I got my man  
Who could ask for anything more?  
  
Old Man Trouble  
I don't mind him  
You won't find him  
Hangin' round my front or back door  
  
Who could ask for anything more?  
Who could ask for anything more?

Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy,  
They're laughing just like hungry dogs in the street,  
Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls,  
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat.  
  
No, no no no, no no no no no no no no,  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
  
Catholic schoolgirls have thrown away their mascara,  
They chain themselves to the axles of big Mack trucks,  
The sky is filled with hurt and shivering angels,  
The fat lady lives! Children, start your trucks!  
  
No, no no no, no no no no no no no no,  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave.  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen...

As I wash my dishes, I'll be following a plan  
Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan  
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind  
So I'll keep repeating in my mind  
Look for the silver lining  
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue  
Remember somewhere the sun is shining  
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you  
A heart full of joy and gladness  
Will always banish sadness and strife  
So always look for the silver lining  
And try to find the sunny side of life  
So always look for the silver lining  
And try to find the sunny side of life

Love can be a moment's madness  
Love can be insane  
Love can be a life of sadness and pain  
  
Love can be a summer shower  
Love can be the sun  
Love can be two hearts that flower as one  
  
It can be, fine and free  
But that kind  
Is not so very easy to find  
  
Love can be a dying ember  
Love can be a flame  
Love pledged in September  
May be dead in December  
You may not even remember it came  
  
Love can be a joy forever  
Or an empty name  
Love is almost never ever the same  
  
Love can be an evil-doer  
Love can be a fog  
Love can make you feel like you were a dog  
  
Love can be a snow-capped mountain  
Love can be the truth  
Love can be an endless fountain of youth  
  
It can be ecstasy  
But it's true  
It doesn't always happen to you  
  
Love can be a four-score failure  
Love can bring you fame  
Love fresh as the morning  
May be wild when it's 'borning  
And then without any warning, it's tame  
  
Oh love can be a sweet endeavor  
Or a dirty shame  
Love is almost never ever, the same!

I lived in a dream my sweet  
In a dream of you  
My dream was a joy complete  
'Cause you loved me too...  
  
And I was no longer afraid of  
What the future might reveal  
For the stuff that dreams are made of  
Was suddenly real  
  
Love of my life  
Life of my love  
I used to pray  
And pray you'd hear me  
Love of my life  
Angels above  
Sent you at last  
To stay always near me  
  
Now we are one  
Never to part  
And evermore  
Need I implore you to miss me  
Come to my arms  
Come to my heart  
Kiss me  
Kiss me  
  
Come to me  
Come... to me  
My... life  
My-why love...  
Love of my life  
My life  
My-why love...

I'm sitting on top of this great big wonderful world  
'Cause this is my lucky day, lucky day  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day  
  
I'm all in clover  
I'm glad all over  
I want to shout "hooray"  
  
I find a horseshoe  
Couldn't go wrong  
And then of course  
You happened along  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day  
  
Oh boy, I'm lucky  
I'll say I'm lucky  
This is my lucky day

There's a pirate, known to fame  
Black Macocco was the Pirate's name  
In his day, the tops was he  
Round the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea  
When he sites a clipper ship  
Mack would board her and begin to clip  
First he'd grab, the ladies fair  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare  
Especially those with jewels  
Especially those with jewels  
Those with jewels to spare!  
With his ladies and his loot  
Next Macocco from the ship would scoot  
Then he'd set the ship afire...what a pretty funeral  
Funeral pyre!  
Mack the Black, what a pretty funeral  
Mack the Black, marvelous funeral pyre!  
Though the years this black Macocco  
Lead his pirate reign  
His claim to fame was as black as his name  
All around the Spanish Maine  
When he'd a make his daily rounds  
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds  
Ev'ry night he'd have a date Ladies go to pieces  
Over pieces of eight.  
Hey!  
Sleep my baby, baby sleep  
Time for babe to be in slumber deep  
If you wake or cry or laugh  
Mack the Black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya in half!  
Mack the black will really whack  
Mack the black will whack ya!  
Mack the black would really have to  
Whack ya in half!  
Mack the Black will really whack ya,  
Mack the Black will whack ya!  
Mack the black will whack ya  
And he'll whack ya!  
Aaaaaah! Mack was ruthless  
Mack was feared  
Perhaps it's better that he disappeared  
Yet I know, that he was bad  
I could fall in love with,  
Fall in love with the lad!  
Evening star, if you see Mack  
Stop his wanderings and guide him back  
I'll be waiting, patiently  
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea.  
Is that the Caribbean Sea?  
And if I met this famous pirate  
Met him face to face  
You think I'd run and hide my head  
And scream around the place  
Why no I'd just sashay around  
Displaying all my charms  
And soon I'd have him walk the plank  
Right into my arms  
That's what I think of Mack the Black Macocco!

Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Under the silv'ry moon.  
Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Where love's sweet roses bloom.  
Come with the love light gleaming  
In your dear eyes of blue.  
Meet me in dreamland,  
Sweet, dreamy dreamland,  
There let my dreams come true.  
Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Under the silv'ry moon.

Where love's sweet roses bloom.  
Come with the love light gleaming  
In you dear eyes of blue.  
Meet me in dreamland,  
Sweet, dreamy dreamland,  
There let my dreams come true.  
  

Aye, aye, aye  
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la)  
Aye, aye, aye  
(La-la-la, la-la-la , la-la-la)  
Aye, aye, aye  
(Aye, aye, aye)  
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
And there's no moral to be made  
But don't forget when your dancing  
That somehow the piper must be paid  
  
Down on the Nile in the southern sea's  
There lives a lassy named Minne Breeze  
And all the natives agree that she's  
The hottest thing in Trinidad  
  
When Minne dances I guarantee  
With every move of her vertebrae  
The temperature jump up ten degree  
In Trinidad that isn't bad  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives would be so sad  
If Minne ever left Trinidad  
  
Although the natives loved Minne so  
Minne had herself a steady bow  
A fellow known as Calypso Joe  
And Minnie swore they'd never part  
  
But they stepped in only as they could  
Min won a contest for dancing good  
So she went away to Hollywood  
When Joe heard that, it broke his heart  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, she wasn't good but she wasn't bad  
Aye, aye, aye, Calypso Joe was so very sad  
When Minne up and left Trinidad  
  
In Hollywood Minne traveled far  
They changed her name to Minne Lamar  
And pretty soon she became a star  
The siren of the picture show  
  
But one day Minne got awful mad  
A guy got fresh and she said "You cad"  
My heart belongs to my Trinidad  
My Trinidad Calypso Joe  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, in Hollywood Minne met her cad  
Aye, aye, aye, but there is only one native lad  
Gets chinny with Minne from Trinidad  
  
So Minnie gave up her dough and fame  
And she went back to from where she came  
But when she got there she heard with shame  
That her Calypso Joe was dead  
  
When Minne heard that, she almost died  
She took a gun to try suicide  
But as she started to shoot  
She cried, "I think I'd rather live instead"  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, she went away and they were so sad  
Aye, aye, aye, but now the natives are mighty glad  
'Cause Minne came back to Trinidad  
  
Aye, aye, aye, they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye, aye, aye, and all the natives will be so sad  
If Minne, Minne came back to Trinidad  
  
Aye, aye, aye  
(Aye, aye, aye)  
Aye, aye, aye  
(Aye, aye, aye)  
Aye, aye, aye  
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)  
  
For Minne  
(Minne, for Minne, for Minne)  
Minne  
(Come home you Minne, poor Minne)  
Minne, came back to Trinidad

I've read your pretty speaches  
And I must admit they touched my heart  
I don't know where you borrow them  
But most of them are works of art  
  
No school boy with his Valentines  
Was ever more sincere  
I've tried to read between the lines  
To make the meaning clear  
  
But there's a little voice that whispers  
Softly, as I fall asleep:  
"You better look before you leap."  
  
My intuition says to me,  
Don't ever give your heart away  
And so I simply must obey my intuition  
  
My intuition says to me  
Those pretty words may not be true  
So what am I supposed to do in my position?  
  
I'd like to trust my heart  
Believe in just my heart  
But it is much too young to know  
  
So though it may be bad advice  
I guess I'll have to string along  
Until you prove my intuition  
Can be wrong.  
  
My intuition goes like this:  
I'm playing poker with a bunch  
And all at once I get a hunch  
That's intuition  
  
I'm playing aces back to back  
And I can see a pair of kings  
But if there's one more of those things  
What's my position?  
  
Well, if you get the cards  
Then you should bet the cards  
At least, that's what I've always heard  
  
You have your hunch, I'll have mine  
Suppose we both we both just string along  
Until we prove our intuition can be wrong.

It's not the pale moon that excites me  
That thrills and delights me, oh no  
It's just the nearness of you  
  
It isn't your sweet conversation  
That brings this sensation, oh no  
It's just the nearness of you  
  
When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me  
All my wildest dreams come true  
  
I need no soft lights to enchant me  
If you'll only grant me the right  
To hold you ever so tight  
And to feel in the night the nearness of you

[Chorus:]  
  
It's the same old song they sing,  
I love you!  
The boys are all mad about Nellie,  
Daughter of officer Kelly.  
And it's all day long they bring  
Flowers all dripping with dew.  
And they join in the chorus of Nellie Kelly,  
I love you!  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Dance with me!  
You know I'd adore it with...  
Dance with me!  
I'm thrilled to death o'are it...  
Dance with me!  
I've been waiting for it with you!  
  
It's a lovely night when we are dancing together.  
It's a lovely night but the forecast says stormy weather.  
  
All of you,  
I'd like to be dancing with  
All of you,  
Perhaps be romancing with  
All of you,  
It would be entrancing,  
That's true!  
But it isn't quite fair to the rest,  
So if you will all line up abreast,  
I will dance with the one I like best.  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

Oceans apart and with only the blue between  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I tell my heart  
We must wait for another dawn  
When he may be returning  
How I regret the night he sailed for another shore  
Will he come into sight to leave my arms no more?  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart  
Oceans apart and with only the blue between us  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart.  
  

I look at you and suddenly  
Something in your eyes I see  
Soon begins bewitching me  
It's that old devil moon  
That you stole from the skies  
It's that old devil moon in your eyes  
  
You and you glance make this romance  
Too hot to handle  
Stars in the night  
Blazing their light  
Can't hold a candle  
To your razzle-dazzle  
  
You've got me flyin' high and wide  
On a magic carpet ride  
Full of butterflies inside  
Wanna cry, wanna croon  
Wanna laugh like a loon  
It's that old devil moon in your eyes  
  
Just when I think  
I'm free as a dove  
Old devil moon  
Deep in your eyes  
Blinds me with love

Old man river that,  
Old man river he must know something  
But don't say nothing,  
He just keeps rolling,  
He keeps on rolling along.  
You and me,  
We sweat and slave bodies all aching  
And racked with pain,  
Tow that barge, lift that bail,  
Get a little drunk and you land in jail.  
I get weary,  
And sick of trying I'm tired of living,  
But scared of dying,  
That old man river,  
He just keeps rolling along.

Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep  
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid 'cause this rover, crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent I'll be as rich as Rockfeller  
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street  
  
With those blues on parade  
Because this rover, it crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent I'll be as loaded as old Rockfeller  
With that gold dust 'round my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
On the side, at that side of the street that is sunny

Here we are, two very bewildered people  
Here we are, two babes that are lost in the wood  
We're not quite certain what has happened to us  
This lovely thing that's so marvelous  
But right from here, the future looks awfully good.  
  
Our love affair was meant to be  
It's me for you dear, and you for me  
We'll fuss and quarrel  
And tears start to brew  
But after the tears, our love will smile through  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when you're by my side  
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare  
"Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when you're by my side  
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare  
"Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?"

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
High above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?

I played the state,  
The capital,  
And people said  
Don't stop,  
Until you play the Palace,  
You haven't played the top.  
For years I had it preached to me,  
And drummed into my head,  
Until you play the Palace,  
You might as well be dead.  
A team of hoofers was the headline,  
At the Majestic, down in Dallas.  
But they canceled the day,  
Their agent called to say,  
You can open the bill at the palace.  
So, it became the Hall of Fame,  
The Mecca of the trade.  
When you had played the Palace,  
You knew that you were made.  
So, I hope you understand my wondrous thrill,  
'cause Vaudevilles back as the Palace,  
And I'm on the bill.  
  
Shine on  
Shine on  
Harvest moon  
Up in the sky  
I aint had no lovin  
Since January  
Febuary  
June or July  
  
Some of these days  
Your gonna miss me honey  
Some of these days  
Your gonna feel so lonely  
You miss my hugging  
You miss my kissing  
You'll miss me honey  
When I'm far away  
  
Oh my man  
I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despaire  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright alright  
  
I don't care  
I don't care  
If people frown  
On me  
I'm happy go lucky  
They say that I'm plucky  
Contented and carefree,  
I don't care  
I don't care  
If he's a clerk or just a millionare,  
If I'm not successful  
It wont be degressful  
'cause I don't care.  
  
And all around me  
I hear voices that I can't ignore.  
The voices of the stars  
Who played the Palace long before.  
The stars who entertained you,  
Until the rafters rang.  
You don't need there names  
For the whole world acclaims them  
For the wonderful songs they sang.  
There's Eddie Canter,  
Georgie Jessle,  
Louie Holts,  
Johnson and olson.  
Cowerson boys,  
Howerdson boys  
Aand that singing fool Al Jolson.  
And so with deep humility,  
I stand in front of you  
I'm proud to play the palace,  
It's like a dream come true,  
Which is why I'd like to shout it up and down.  
Just to tell Broadway  
That the two a day is back in town.

The glamour's gone,  
The shades are down,  
And Paris is only a lonely town.  
Lonely  
  
When love's a laugh  
And you're the clown  
Then paris is only another town  
Dreary  
  
For the lovers clown  
This town's a weary merry go round  
And round and round  
The chestnut, the willow, the colors of Utrillo  
  
Turn to grey, grey hues  
The band playing vyse  
Along the Champs Elysees  
Sounds like wake up blues  
  
Paris is a lonely, dreary, oh so lonely town  
Where's that shining flower  
'Neath the Eiffel tower?  
Where's that fairy land of gold?  
  
Isn't it a pity that this magic city  
Turned suddenly cold?  
The chimneys moan  
The river cries  
  
Each glamorous bridge is a bridge of sighs  
River, river, won't you be my lover?  
Don't turn me down  
For Paris is such a lonely, lonely town

Twas on a bright morning in Summer  
When I first heard his voice spakin' low  
As he said to a colleen beside him  
"Who's that pretty girl milking her cow?"  
  
Och many times often ye met me  
And told me that I should be  
You darling, Acushla,  
A Lana Mavourneen, Asuilish machree  
  
Purty girl, purty girl,  
With no on there to show her how  
The purt, purt, purty girl is now  
Milking her cow  
  
I have not the manners or graces  
Of the girls in the world where ye move  
And I have not their beautiful faces  
But oh, I've a heart that can love  
  
And if it please ye, I'll dress me in satin  
With jewels, jewels in me brow  
But och, don't be after forgettin'  
Your purty girl milking her cow  
  
Purty girl, purty cow,  
I'm sure this song would have never been wrote  
If the pretty girl hadda been milking her goat  
But the goat wasn't feeling well anyhow  
So the pretty girl was milking her cow.  
  
Her cow, her cow  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la la, la, la, la La, la, la, la  
A purty girl milking her cow!

If you just stop to think, here's a lesson for you  
What a word or a smile can convey  
With a word you can make someone happy or blue  
With a smile you can make them sad or gay  
  
So be careful what you say  
And be careful how you smile  
It's so easy for us to make  
Someone's life worthwhile  
  
There are smiles, that make us happy  
There are smiles, that make us blue  
There are smiles, that steal away the teardrops  
Like the Sunbeams steal away the dew  
  
There are smiles, that have a tender meaning  
That the eyes of love alone can see  
But the smiles, that fill my life with sunshine  
Are the smiles that you gave to...  
  
But the smiles, that fill my life with sunshine  
Are the smiles that you gave to me!

All night long he calls her snookey ookum, snookey ookums.  
All they do is talk like babies.  
She's his jelly elly roll.  
He's her sugey ugar bowl.  
Hear the way they bill and coo, poogywoo,poogywoo, poogywoo?  
All night long he calls her snookey ookums, snookey ookums.  
All nigh long the neighbors shout "Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out!"  
They cry, "For goodness sake don't keep us all awake with your snookey, ookey,
ookey , baby talk!"

Savoy, the home of sweet romance  
Savoy, it wins you at a glance  
Savoy, give happy feet a chance  
To dance  
  
Your form, just like a clingy vine  
Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine  
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine  
Devine  
  
How my heart is singin'  
While the band is swingin'  
Never tired of rompin'  
Stompin' with you, at the Savoy  
What joy  
  
A perfect holiday  
Savoy, where we can glide and sway  
Savoy, they'll let me stomp away  
With you

While the band is swingin'  
Never tired of rompin'  
Stompin' with you, at the Savoy  
What joy

I've been away from you a long time  
I never thought I'd miss you so  
Somehow I feel, your love is real,  
Near you I long to be!  
  
The birds are singing, it is song time  
The banjos strummin' soft and low  
I know that you  
Yearn for me too,  
Swanee, you're calling me!  
  
Swanee!  
How I love you, how I love you  
My dear old Swanee!  
I'd give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
D-I-X-I-E ven now my Mammy's waiting for me,  
Praying for me  
Down by the Swanee  
  
The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore!  
  
Swanee!  
How I love you, how I love you  
My dear old Swanee!  
I'd give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
D-I-X-I-E ven now my Mammy's waiting for me,  
Praying for me

The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore!  
Swanee, Swanee, I'm coming back to Swanee!  
Mammy, Mammy, I love the old folks at home!  
  
Swanee, Swanee, I am coming back to Swanee!  
Mammy, Mammy, I love the old folks at home!

Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.  
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.  
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.  
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.  
I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.  
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is  
High.  
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.  
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.  
Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.  
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.  
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.  
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.  
I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.  
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your... Foot  
Good-bye.  
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.  
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.

Did you ever wonder why in thunder  
Thunder comes in spring?  
Once upon a time it seems  
All the world was wrapped in dreams  
Playful little fellas, so they tell us  
Said Let's have our fling!  
Spring is in the air, you know!  
It's time to wake 'em up below!  
So, when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky  
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly  
While rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky  
The world will wear a new bonnet  
Daffodils on it  
Thanks to the skies above  
Thunder and showers  
Wake up the flowers  
Where there are flowers  
There must be love  
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder  
Clouds will soon roll by  
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!

Old black magic has me in its spell  
Old black magic that you weave so well  
Those icy fingers up and down my spine  
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine  
Same old tingle that I feel inside  
Then the elevator starts it ride  
  
Down and down I go  
Round and round I go  
Like a leaf caught in a tide  
I should stay away but what can I do  
I hear your name and I'm a flame  
  
Flame, flame of desire  
Only your kiss can put out the fire  
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for  
Your the mate that fate had me created for  
And every time your lips meet mine  
  
Down and down I go  
Round and round I go  
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in  
Under the old black magic called love  
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in  
Under the old black magic called love  
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in  
Under the old black magic called love  
I should stay away but what can I do  
I hear your name and I'm a flame  
  
Flame, flame of desire  
Only your kiss can put out the fire  
Oh you are the lover I have waited for  
Your the mate that fate had me created for  
And every time your lips meet mine  
  
Down and down I go  
Round and round I go  
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in  
Under the old black magic called love

Don't fly away, come along quick,  
South where the breezes blow.  
Leave this storm land,  
Come away to a warm land.  
  
Pack up, fly away, learn an old trick  
All of the wise guys know.  
Headin' to the south you can't miss it,  
Let me be explicit.  
  
When you see blue skies and fields of white  
And the sun is shinin' bright,  
Yes, sir! That's the good old sunny south.  
When you hear that same old robin sing  
That you heard up north in spring,  
Yes, sir! That's the good old sunny south.  
  
Where your heart wants to play  
And your feet want to dance,  
Where the close of each day  
Brings a night of romance.  
Where you meet those gals that sweetly drawl,  
"Mighty glad to meet you all."  
Yes, sir! That's the good old sunny south.  
  
(musical interlude, punctuated by Baby's "Yes, sir!")  
  
Where you meet those gals that sweetly drawl,  
"Mighty glad to meet you all."  
Yes, sir! That's the good old sunny south.

The moment I saw him smile  
I knew he was just my style  
My only regret is we've never met  
Though I dream of him all the while  
  
But he doesn't know I exist  
No matter how I may persist  
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me  
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue  
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three  
  
How can I ignore the boy next door  
I love him more than I can say  
Doesn't try to please me  
Doesn't even tease me  
And he never sees me glance his way  
  
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door  
Affection for me won't display  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him  
The boy next door  
  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him  
The boy next door

Perhaps it was something that hit me, perhaps it was something I ate,  
But out of the blue I dreamed I met you and you said to me, "Hi, ya Gate!"  
Millions have heard you play Chopin, the critics applaud and approve,  
But millions more would simply adore to hear you get in the groove.  
  
You won't believe it, you'll think it's a dream  
To hear them riffing it, right on the beam,  
But when you hear trumpets give out a call, you'll know  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
Instead of Strauss they play Irving Berlin,  
Instead of Brahms it's "Begin the Begin"  
Those classic ackies are due for a fall since  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
They're playing  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, with Shostakovich,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, Mozart and Bach,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, and they don't know which,  
'Cause anything can happen when they start to rock.  
  
The philharmonic was so dignified  
But now they're groovy and starting to ride,  
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall  
'cause The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down in Carnegie Hall.  
  
They-hey swing ev'rything with a ding dong  
And when the Maestro gives them a beat, it's a  
Reet Beat that starts 'em to toot with a  
Root Toot that's a bit of alright,  
And even Jose Iturbi getting hep, he's hep, he's hep.  
Boy!  
  
Tschai-Tschai-Tschai-kovsky would really be hurt  
To hear 'em jivin' his Piano Concert,  
Beethoven's lucky, he can't hear at all  
Because the Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall.

I know you're around when the sky and the ground start in ringing  
I know you're around by the thunder I hear in advance  
Your words and your words alone are the words that start my heart singing  
And yours is the only music that makes me dance  
  
You'll sleep and you'll rise in the light of two eyes that adore you  
Bore you it might, but you won't leave my sight or glance  
In every way, every day, I need less of myself and need more you, more you  
Yours is the only music that makes me dance  
  
In every way, every day I need less of myself, and need more you, more you  
Yours is the only music that makes me dance

We're going east, our work has ceased  
We're all set for Yale to say the least  
We're out to win, so lets begin now  
We're from the west, we'll never rest  
Till we show our world our team's the best  
We'll sweep the land, we'll show 'em and how  
The Texas tornado is coming your way so everybody step aside  
The Texas tornado is funny that way, so everybody better hide  
This devastatin' gale is headed straight for Yale  
Won't it be great to sail into town?  
We'll devour the foe, we'll knock 'em for a goal  
And then we'll score a touchdown  
There's no one in Texas who really suspects us  
Coming home without that game  
The whole state of Texas sincerely expects us  
Getting in the hall of fame  
Yale's pigskin sack is the crackerjack  
But we'll bring it home without fail  
The Texas tornado is coming your way  
So everybody step aside, better hide, Yale!

With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes  
And my hair piled high upon my head,  
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley  
And lost my heart instead.  
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie,  
He was quite the handsomest of men.  
I started to yen so I counted to ten  
Then I counted to ten again.  
  
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley,  
Ding, ding, ding went the bell,  
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings,  
From the moment I saw him I fell.  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Bump, bump, bump went the brake,  
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings,  
When he smiled I could feel the car shake.  
He tipped his hat, and took a seat.  
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet.  
He asked my name, I held my breath.  
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death.  
  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Pop, pop, pop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels,  
When the universe reels.  
  
The day was bright, the air was sweet,  
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet.  
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak,  
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak.  
  
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer,  
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to leave,  
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand,  
And as if it were planned,  
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand  
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line.

If you never had to count  
A million cheap,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
If youve never had to cry  
Yourself to sleep,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
I know I could go on laughing at trouble,  
Plain trouble,  
But when it concerns my heart  
The pain seems double.  
Oh, no one ever knows what I go through,  
While someone at home is babying you.  
If you never had to miss a good night kiss,  
Then youve never, no, youve never been blue.

There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything that traffic will allow  
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling  
When you are stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold  
Let's go on with the show  
  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men becau-ause  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer and the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause  
  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye  
For anything theatrical and why, why-y?  
  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
You get word before the show has started  
That your father died inside of dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted  
You're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they are low  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far  
That night you open and there you are  
Next day on your dressing room  
They've hung a star  
Let's go, on with the show

Oh, paddy dear and did you hear  
The news that's going 'round  
The shamrock is forbid by law  
To grow on Irish ground  
  
Saint Patrick's name no more you'll hear  
His colors can't be seen  
They've gone and passed a law against  
The wearing of the green  
  
Sure I looked to neighbor Tandy  
And he took me by the hand  
And he said how's dear old Ireland  
And how does she stand?  
  
It's a most distressful country  
That ever you have seen  
They're hanging men and woman  
For the wearing of the green  
  
Repeat first two verses  
Men and women,  
For the wearing of the green.

What now my love  
Now that you left me  
How can I live through another day  
Watching my dreams turn into ashes  
And all my hopes into bits of clay  
Once I could see, once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
I've become unreal  
  
I walk the night, oh, without a goal  
Stripped of my heart, my soul  
What now my love  
Now that it's over  
I feel the world closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And there's the sky where the sea should be  
  
What now my love  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool to go on and on  
No one would care, no one would cry  
If I should live or die  
  
What now my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last goodbye

[Chorus]  
Who, stole my heart away  
Who, makes me dream all day  
Dreams I know can never come true  
Seems as though I'll ever be blue  
Who, means my happiness  
Who, would I answer yes to  
No one, but you!  
  
A woman's intentions, her famine inventions  
A seldom if ever defined  
And I am no different, why should I be different?  
I simply can't make up my mind  
How can I solve this situation  
Except by the process of elimination  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can it be, can it be, who can it be?  
You'll never guess who has stolen my heart away Dreamin' dreams I know  
Can never come true  
  
Seems as though  
I'll never be blue!  
Oh who, means my happiness  
Who, would I answer yes to  
Well you oughta guess who, who...  
No one but you!

I was mighty blue  
Thought my life was through  
'Til the heavens opened  
And I gazed at you  
  
Won't you tell me, dear  
Why, when you appear,  
Something happens to me  
And the strangest feeling goes through me?  
  
You do something to me  
Something that simply mystifies me  
Tell me, why should it be,  
You have the power to hypnotize me?  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
Do do that voodoo that you do so well  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do

You go to my head  
And you linger like a haunting refrain  
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain  
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.  
  
You go to my head  
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew  
And I find the very mention of you  
Like the kicker in a julep or two.  
  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might give a thought to my plea  
Casts a spell over me  
Till I say to myself  
  
Get ahold of yourself!  
Can't you see that it never can be?  
You go to my head  
With a smile that makes my temperature rise  
  
Like a summer with a thousand Julys.  
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes.  
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost of a chance  
  
In this crazy romance,  
You go to my head.

You made me love you  
I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it.  
You made me happy sometimes, you made me glad  
But there were times, Dear, you made me feel so bad  
  
You made me sigh for, I didn't want to tell you  
I didn't want to tell you  
I want some love that's true, yes I do, deed I do, you know I do  
  
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for  
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for  
You know you made me love you

Dear Mr Gable  
I am writing this to you  
And I hope that you  
Will read it so you'll know  
  
My heart beats like a hammer  
And I stutter and I stammer  
Every time I see you at the picture show  
I guess I'm just another fan of yours  
And I thought I'd write and tell you so  
  
You made me love you  
I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it  
You made me love you  
And all the time you knew it  
I guess you always knew it  
  
You made me happy  
Sometimes you made me glad  
But there were times, sir  
You made me feel so sad  
  
You made me sigh 'cause  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I didn't wanna tell you  
I think you're grand, that's true  
Yes I do, 'deed I do, you know I do  
  
I must tell you what I'm feeling  
The very mention of your name  
Sends my heart reeling  
You know you made me love you  
  
Aw, gee, Mr Gable  
I don't wanna bother you  
Guess, guess you got a lotta girls  
That tell you the same thing  
  
And if you don't wanna read this  
Well, you don't have to  
But I just had to tell you about the time  
I saw you in, "It Happened One Night"  
  
That was the first time I ever saw you  
And I knew right then  
You were the nicest fella in the movies  
I guess it was 'cause you acted so  
Well, so natural like  
  
Not like a real actor at all  
But just like any fella you'd meet  
At school or at a party  
Then one time I saw you in a picture  
With Joan Crawford  
  
And I had to cry a little  
'Cause you loved her so much  
And you couldn't have her  
Not 'til the end of the picture, anyway  
  
And then one time I saw you in person  
You going to the Coconut Grove  
One night and I was standing there  
When you got out of your car  
  
And you almost knocked me down  
Oh, but it wasn't your fault  
I was in the way  
But you looked at me and you smiled  
  
Yeah, you smiled right at me  
As if you meant it  
And I cried all the way home  
Just 'cause you smiled at me  
For being in your way  
Aw, I'll never forget it, Mr Gable  
Honest angel, you're my favorite actor  
  
I don't care what happens  
Let the whole world stop  
As far as I'm concerned  
You'll always be the top  
'Cause you know  
You made me love you

Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start  
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Your eyes made skies seem blue again  
What else could I do again  
But keep repeating through and through  
"I love you, love you"  
  
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will  
I hope 'twill never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still recall the thrill, I guess I always will  
I hope 'twill never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine  
Zing! Oh, Oh, Oh went the strings of my heart
