Watching the painter painting  
And all the time, the light is changing  
And he keeps painting  
That bit there, it was an accident  
But he's so pleased  
It's the best mistake, he could make  
And it's my favorite piece  
It's just great  
  
The flick of a wrist  
Twisting down to the hips  
So the lovers begin, with a kiss  
In a tryst  
It's just a smudge  
But what it becomes  
In his hands  
Curving and sweeping  
Rising and reaching  
I could feel what he was feeling  
Lines like these have got to be  
An architect's dream  
  
It's always the same  
Whenever he works on a pavement  
It starts to rain  
And all the time  
The light is changing

[Verse 1]  
Little light shining  
Little light will guide them to me  
My face is all lit up  
My face is all lit up  
  
[Chorus 1]  
If they find me racing white horses  
They'll not take me for a buoy  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ooh, I'll wake up to any sound of engines  
Every gull a seeking craft  
I can't keep my eyes open  
Wish I had my radio  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I'd tune into some friendly voices  
Talking 'bout stupid things  
I can't be left to my imagination  
Let me be weak, let me sleep  
And dream of sheep  
  
[Outro]  
Ooh, their breath is warm  
And they smell like sleep  
And they say they take me home  
Like poppies, heavy with seed  
They take me deeper and deeper

And you ah? You do ah?  
  
We let it in, we give it out.  
And in the end, what's it all about?  
It must be love.  
  
I give you my, I give you my  
You give me your, you give me your joy.  
  
We used to say "Ah Hell, we're young"  
But now we see that life is sad. And so is love.  
(Ooh baby live your life for love)  
(Ooh baby live your life for love)  
  
We used to say "Ah Hell, we're young"  
But now we see that life is sad. And so is love.  
(Ooh baby for the sake of love)  
(Ooh baby for the sake of love)  
  
And whatever happens, what really matters?  
It's all we've got, isn't that enough?  
(Life is sad and so is love).  
  
You let it slip, you let it slip.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
I love you more, I love you more for it.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
Oh yeah, oh you too.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
All for love.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
Just for the sake of love.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
You set me free, I set you free.  
(Life is sad and so is love)

Bbc2 Christmas Special, December 28, 1979  
  
The kettle's on, the sun has gone  
Another day  
She offers me tibetan tea on a flower tray  
She's at the door, she wants to score  
She dearly needs to to say  
I loved you a long time ago  
Where the winds own forget me nots blow  
But I just couldn't let myself go  
Not knowing what on earth there was to know  
But I wish that I had  
Cause I'm feeling so sad  
That I never had one of your children  
And across the room inside a tomb  
A change is waxed and wanes  
The night is young why are we so hung up  
In each others chains  
I must make her, I must take her  
While the dove domains  
And feel the juice run as she flies  
Run my winds under her sighs  
As the flames of eternity rise  
To lick us with the first-born lash of dawn  
Oh really my dear  
I can't see what we fear  
Sat here with ourselves in between us  
And at the door we can't say more  
Than just another day  
And without a sound I turn around  
And I walk away

"B.F.P.O."  
Army dreamers  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
"Mammy's hero"  
  
Our little army boy  
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.  
I've a bunch of purple flowers  
To decorate a mammy's hero  
  
Mourning in the aerodrome  
The weather warmer, he is colder  
Four men in uniform  
To carry home my little soldier  
  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a rock star"  
But he didn't have the money for a guitar  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a politician"  
But he never had a proper education  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a father"  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
  
Tears o'er a tin box  
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know  
Like a chicken with a fox  
He couldn't win the war with ego  
  
Give the kid the pick of pips  
And give him all your stripes and ribbons  
Now he's sitting in his hole  
He might as well have buttons and bows  
  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a rock star"  
But he didn't have the money for a guitar  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a politician"  
But he never had a proper education  
"What could he do?  
Should have been a father"  
But he never even made it to his twenties  
What a waste  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of  
Army dreamers  
Ooh, what a waste of all that  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers  
Army dreamers, oh  
  
"B.F.P.O."  
Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum  
Army dreamers  
Did-n-did-n-did-n-dum  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
Army Dreamers  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
No harm heroes  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
Army dreamers.  
"Mammy's hero"  
"B.F.P.O."  
No harm heroes

In that ocean.  
Wide eyed and deeper in your gaze,  
And bluer than the bright that's in the cave.  
There is a city,  
Came out from you, Atlantis  
In ruins, sunken below the waves  
But in the city,  
Where there is no one.  
What's the point of being free, eh?  
When there is nothing there to tie me down,  
Oh, no more here.  
The bluest city,  
Covered in coral and coral,  
On sea chests,  
And sealed Jamaician tales.  
There is nobody  
To count the soldiering meandering whales,  
With a shoal of herring amongst the sails.  
But in the city,  
Where there is no one.  
What's the point of being free, eh?  
When there is nothing there to tie me down,  
Oh, no more here.  
There is the city Atlantis.

She wanted to test her husband  
She knew exactly what to do  
A pseudonym to fool him  
She couldn't have made a worse move  
  
She sent him scented letters,  
And he received them with a strange delight.  
Just like his wife  
But how she was before the tears,  
And how she was before the years flew by,  
And how she was when she was beautiful.  
She signed the letter  
  
"All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!  
All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!"  
  
She wanted to take it further,  
So she arranged a place to go,  
To see if he  
Would fall for her incognito.  
And when he laid eyes on her,  
He got the feeling they had met before.  
Uncanny how she  
Reminds him of his little lady,  
Capacity to give him all he needs,  
Just like his wife before she freezed on him,  
Just like his wife when she was beautiful.  
He shouted out, "I'm  
  
All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!  
All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!  
All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!"

(It is this that brings us together.)  
It's all right, darling,  
We can do this together.  
It's all right, darling,  
I can think of nothing better.  
I don't know you,  
And you don't know me:  
It is this that brings us together.  
(It is this that brings us together.)  
I don't know what you are  
Looking for in me.  
I don't know what I want,  
But my heart is needing.  
Am I yours? Are you mine?  
We'll find all we're meant to find.  
In your life, in my life,  
There are secrets too dark  
To let out, to let go of,  
To get over.  
But that's all right, baby.  
That's all right by me.  
It's all right now.  
Just let me say  
Please...  
Please...  
Please...  
Please be kind,  
Be kind to my mistakes.  
Be kind,  
Be kind  
To me.

With her hand in his hand  
They were both happy again.  
You started to take sides  
They started arguing  
He said it was her fault  
She said it wasn't at all  
But the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  
  
Where angels fear to tread you go rushing in  
Well I had to tell you then  
And now I'm telling you again  
Stay out of this  
You must not interfere  
Don't you see this is  
Between a man and a woman?  
  
Every day and night I pray.  
Pray that you will stay away forever.  
It's so hard for love to stay together  
With the modern Western pressures  
I don't want to say it  
But I had to tell you then  
And now I'm telling you again  
  
Stay out of this.  
Oh, I know you mean to help me,  
And I know you've good intentions  
But stay out of this.  
This isn't your problem.  
Do not interfere - you are not needed here  
Let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman  
Don't you see you're in the way - between a man and a woman.  
Every day and night I pray, let the pendulum swing  
Between a man and a woman.  
Between a man and a woman.

Oh big stripey lie moving  
Like a wavy line  
Coming up behind  
  
All young gentle dreams drowning  
In life's grief  
Can you hang onto me?  
  
Don't want to hurt you baby  
I only want to help you  
I could be good for you  
  
Your name is being called by sacred things  
That are not addressed nor listened to  
Sometimes they blow trumpets  
  
Only want to help you  
Never want to hurt you  
I know I could be good for you  
  
Oh my God it's a jungle in here  
You've got wild animals loose in here  
  
Want to help you  
Never hurt you  
Good for you  
  
Hey all you little waves run away  
Run away

One of the band told me last night  
That music is all that he's got in his life  
So where does it go?  
Surely not with his soul  
Will all of his licks and his r'n'b  
Blow away?  
  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away, blow away  
Blow away  
  
Our engineer had a different idea  
From people who nearly died but survived  
Feeling no fear of leaving their bodies here  
And went to a room that was soon full of visitors  
  
Hello minnie, moony, vicious, vicious, buddy holly, sandy denny  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
I want to stay here  
  
Put out the light, then, put out the light  
Vibes in the sky invite you to dine  
Dust to dust  
Blow to blow  
Bolan and moony are heading the show tonight  
  
Hello minnie, moony, vicious, vicious, buddy holly, sandy denny  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
Don't dump me back there  
Please don't thump me  
Don't bump me  
I want to stay here

Brazil  
When hearts were entertained in June  
We stood beneath an amber moon  
And softly whispered 'some day soon'  
  
We kissed and clung together  
Then  
Tomorrow was another day  
The morning found me miles away  
With still a million things to say  
  
Now  
When twilight beams the skies above  
Recalling thrills of our love  
There's one thing I'm certain of  
  
Return I will  
To old Brazil

I still dream of Orgonon  
I wake up crying  
You're making rain  
And you're just in reach  
When you and sleep escape me  
  
You're like my yo-yo  
That glowed in the dark  
What made it special  
Made it dangerous  
So I bury it  
And forget  
  
But every time it rains  
You're here in my head  
Like the sun coming out  
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen  
And I don't know when  
But just saying it could even make it happen  
  
On top of the world  
Looking over the edge  
You could see them coming  
You looked too small  
In their big, black car  
To be a threat to the men in power  
  
I hid my yo-yo  
In the garden  
I can't hide you  
From the government  
Oh, God, Daddy  
I won't forget  
  
'Cause every time it rains  
You're here in my head  
Like the sun coming out  
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen  
And I don't know when  
But just saying it could even make it happen  
  
The sun's coming out.  
Your son's coming out  

Come closer to me, babe,  
And the night will come much closer, too.  
Can't you see the light  
Drawing pictures nearer in the skies?  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes?  
Come closer to me, babe.  
Is it me it's all about?  
And who is it that you're always  
Calling in your sleep?  
Who is Sylvia?  
  
Goodnight, baby. Please  
Come on home,  
Come on home,  
Come on home soon.  
Goodnight, baby, X4  
  
Come closer to me now,  
For I know there's something you must tell me.  
When slumber slips between your lips  
Will the secrets ooze out easily?  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes?  
Come closer to me, babe.  
Is it me it's all about?  
And who is it that you're always  
Calling in your sleep?  
Who is Sylvia?  
  
Goodnight, baby. Please  
Come on home, X2  
Come on home soon.  
Goodnight, baby, X4

Constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
Steer your life by these stars  
On the unconditional chance  
'Tis here where Hell and Heaven dance  
This is the constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
We take all the telescopes  
And we turn them inside out  
And we point them away from the big sky  
Put your eye right up to the glass, now  
And here we'll find the constellation of the heart  
  
The constellation of the heart  
The constellation of the heart  
  
Well we think you'd better wake up capt'n  
There's something happen'n up ahead  
We've never seen anything like it  
We've never seen anything like it before  
  
I want a full report  
That's it  
What do you mean, "That's it?"  
That's all you get  
You'd better do something 'bout it  
What am I supposed to do about it?  
We don't know, but you can't run away from it  
Maybe you'd better face it  
I can't do that  
C'mon face it!  
I can't do that  
C'mon, c'mon face it  
What am I gonna do?  
It is gonna hurt, it is gonna hurt me bad?  
  
Ooh here's the constellation of the heart  
  
Who said anything about it hurting?  
It's gonna be beautiful  
It's gonna be wonderful  
It's gonna be paradise  
  
(Just being alive, it can really hurt...)  
Ooh find me the man with the ladder  
And he might lift me up to the stars  
  
(Without the pain there'd be no learning  
Without the hurting we'd never change.)  
  
Oooh and if you see the woman with the key  
I hear she's opening up the doors to Heaven  
Oh and here comes the man with the stick  
He said he'd fish me out of the moon  
  
Ohoh here's the constellation of the heart  
It is the constellation of the heart  
  
Oh yes it is the constellation of the heart

Please  
Don't be-e afraid of this  
Coz' we don't move the way they do.  
Surely you don't love them?  
So why hide it away from me?  
Please be easy you got it I haven't,  
Somewhere in your "harmineenou, home-arneenou"  
There's a room in a long form  
Where you just play a tune  
It gets us really stoned,  
Really amazingly,  
Cussi, Cussi, Cussi,  
Cussi, Cussi, Cussi. Ah.  
Don't let them in  
When you see that secret smile.  
Baby, don't let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye.  
You get the wrong idea,  
You'll get broken,  
And you never let yourself go again with me.  
And I've notice in your eyes  
A sadness I don't like.  
To recognise  
You are feeling a heavy side of your ecstacy.  
Now you're getting to me,  
So that I can I hardly bear it.  
So that I can I hardly bear it.  
No no,  
Don't get too deep.  
Don't let them in  
When you see that secret smile.  
Baby, don't let them in  
When you feel the ribbons eye.  
You get the wrong idea,  
You'll get broken,  
And you never let yourself go again with me,  
Properly.

High, in Castille,  
Lives senora Dali alone.  
And higher still  
She keeps her gallery.  
Distance means nothing to me.  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...  
Debris everywhere,  
Gazing. It's amazing.  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over  
The music, Dali.  
Deeper here lies hidden answers and treasures for him.  
"Oh, I prefer absence," said she,  
"My heart grows fonder alone."  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo,  
A-ee-aha-ee-aha-oo...  
Debris everywhere,  
Gazing. It's amazing.  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over,  
Ferry me over  
The music, Dali.

Rowan Atkinson:  
For years I thought  
I'd have to live alone  
I never got a letter  
Had to disconnect the phone  
The only girls I ever saw  
Were on tv  
But now I've got a Venus  
Who's sitting next to me  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Would I give my life  
To you if I could?  
Do birds fly?  
Do fish swim?  
And do bears sha-la-la-la-la  
In the woods?  
Rowan:  
I met her in the first class lounge  
Of a jumbo jet  
It was love at first sight  
Romeo and Juliet  
Kate:  
He looked pretty rich  
And I was down on m' luck  
So I charged him a fortune  
For a flying f...  
Rowan:  
... For crying out loud!  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Would I sacrifice my life  
To you if I could?  
Is the Pope Catholic?  
Is Luxembourg small?  
And do those hairy bears shhh...  
In the woods?  
Rowan:  
I introduced her round my friends  
She was ace  
I was no longer on Earth  
But in better place  
Kate:  
He's an utter creep and he  
Drives me round the bend  
And so to alleviate the boredom  
I sleep with his friends  
Rowan:  
Ho ha ho  
Both:  
Do I love you?  
Do I want you?  
Kate:  
Would I tear out both my eyes  
And fry them if I could?  
Both:  
Is the Bible fiction?  
Is True Love a contradiction?  
And do bears sha-la-la-la-la  
In the woods?  
Do I desire you?  
Do I adore you?  
Rowan:  
Would I cut off all my toenails  
And put them in an envelope with my feet?  
Both:  
Is Reagan Godhead?  
Is Chairman Mao dead?  
And do those bears sha-la-la-la-la?  
Rowan [really Tim Brooke-Taylor]:  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-ah  
Kate:  
Mmmmm...  
Rowan [Tim]:  
And do those bears sha-la-la-la-la?  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-ah  
Kate:  
Ahoo Ahoo  
Yeah-ye-yeah Yeah-ye-yeah  
Both:  
Do those bears sha-la-la-la-ah?  
Rowan:  
On Main Street  
Kate:  
Oh Yeah Yeah-ye-yeah

"Don't Give Up" by Peter Gabriel with Kate Bush  
  
In this proud land we grew up strong  
We were wanted all along  
I was taught to fight, taught to win  
I never thought I could fail  
  
No fight left or so it seems  
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted  
I've changed my face, I've changed my name  
But no-one wants you when you lose  
  
Don't give up  
Cause you have friends  
Don't give up  
You're not beaten yet  
Don't give up  
I know you can make it good  
  
Though I saw it all around  
Never thought that I could be affected  
Thought that we'd be last to go  
It is so strange the way things turn  
  
Drove the night toward my home  
The place that I was born, on the lakeside  
As daylight broke, I saw the earth  
The trees had burned down to the ground  
  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up  
We don't need much of anything  
Don't give up  
'cause somewhere there's a place  
Where we belong  
Rest your head  
You worry too much  
It's going to be alright  
When times get rough  
You can fall back on us  
Don't give up  
Please don't give up  
  
Got to walk out of here  
I can't take any more  
Going to stand on that bridge  
Keep my eyes down below  
Whatever may come  
And whatever may go  
That river's flowing  
That river's flowing  
  
Moved on to another town  
Tried hard to settle down  
For every job, so many men  
So many men no-one needs  
Don't give up  
'cause you have friends  
Don't give up  
You're not the only one  
Don't give up  
No reason to be ashamed  
Don't give up  
You still have us  
Don't give up now  
We're proud of who you are  
Don't give up  
You know its never been easy  
Don't give up  
'cause I believe there's a place  
There's a place where we belong

Emma's come down.  
She's stopped the light  
Shining out of her eyes.  
  
Emma's been run out on.  
She's breaking down  
In so many places,  
Stuck in low gear  
Because of her fears  
  
Of the skidding wheels,  
(The skid of her wheels she feels.)  
Skidding wheels,  
(The skid of her wheels she feels.)  
Spinning wheels.  
(Wheel-skidding feeling.)  
  
Her heart is there,  
But they've greased the road.  
Her heart is out there,  
But she's no control.  
  
Oh, come on, you've got to use your flow.  
You know what it's like, and you know you want to go.  
Don't drive too slowly.  
Don't put your blues where your shoes should be.  
Don't put your foot on the heartbrake.  
  
(She's losing, she's losing, she's losing, she's losing)  
She's losing that inner flame.  
It was burning bright,  
But she's losing the light fast.  
  
She's only herself to blame.  
Well, take care of yourself,  
And remember Georgie.  
But she's so O.D.'d on weeping  
She can hardly see  
  
That she's dropping beads.  
(Red, red glass is bleeding.)  
Dropping beads.  
(Red, red glass is bleeding.)  
Dropping beads.  
(Red, red on the parquet.)  
  
Her heart is there,  
But they've greased the road.  
Her heart is out there,  
But she's no control.  
  
Oh, come on, you've got to use your flow.  
You know what it's like, and you know you want to go.  
Don't drive too slowly.  
Don't put your blues where your shoes should be.  
Don't put your foot on the heartbrake.

We were working secretly for the military  
Our experiment in sound was nearly ready to begin  
We only know in theory what we are doing  
Music made for pleasure, music made to thrill  
It was music we were making here until  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
From the painful cries of mothers to a terrifying scream  
We recorded it and put it into our machine  
  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
It could feel like falling in love  
It could feel so bad  
It could feel so good  
It could sing you to sleep  
But that dream is your enemy!!  
  
We won't be there to be blamed  
We won't be there to snitch  
I just pray that someone there can hit the switch  
  
They told us all they wanted  
Was a sound that could kill someone from a distance  
So we go ahead and the meters are over in the red  
It's a mistake in the making  
  
And the public are warned to stay off

I read the colors this mornin'  
I read the colors today  
About a man who left from nowhere to be someone  
And every day he has to pay in every way  
  
I met a man from new york city  
He spoke of things I've yet to find  
A good man driven from his homeland  
Tryin' to find some piece of mind  
  
It's a fast train

After the party, you took me back to your parlour  
A little nervous laughter, locking the door  
My stockings fall onto the floor, desperate for more  
Nobody else can share this  
Here comes one and one makes one  
The glorious union, well, it could be love  
Or it could be just lust but it will be fun  
It will be wonderful  
  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Feel it! See what you're doing to me  
  
God, but you're beautiful, aren't you?  
Feel your warm hand walking around  
I won't pull away, my passion always wins  
So keep on a-moving in, keep on a-tuning in  
Synchronize rhythm now  
  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love  
Feel it! See what you're doing to me

Yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth  
And it was leap year like now yes  
Sixteen years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath  
Yes he said I was a flower of the mountain  
Yes so we are flowers all a woman's body yes  
  
Stepping out of the page  
Into the sensual world  
Stepping out, off the page,  
Into the sensual world  
  
And Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain  
Yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used  
Or shall I wear a red yes  
And how he kissed me under the Moorish wall  
And I thought well as well him as another  
  
Stepping out of the page  
Into the sensual world  
Stepping out, off the page,  
Into the sensual world  
  
And then I asked him with my eyes to ask again  
Yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower  
And first I put my arms around him yes  
And drew him down to me so he could feel my breath  
All perfume yes and his heart was going like mad  
And yes I said yes I will yes.  
Ooo yes

Driving back in her car.  
Watching the wipers  
Squashing the leaves away.  
Suddenly there in the road  
Is your old self,  
Trying to get out of the rain.  
  
I am my enemy  
Mowing me over,  
And towing the light away.  
Somehow it just seems to fit  
With that old me,  
Trying to get back again.  
Imagination sets in.  
Then all the voices begin.  
  
Telling you things that aren't happening.  
(But they nig and they nag, 'til they're under your skin.)  
(You've really got to)  
Remember yourself.  
You've got a Full House in your head tonight  
(You've got to, you've got to)  
Remember yourself.  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight.  
My silly pride  
Digging the knife in.  
She loves to come for her ride.  
  
Surely by now I should know  
I can control  
My highs and my lows  
By questioning all that I do,  
Examining every move,  
Trying to get back to the rudiments.  
  
(If they nig and they nag, I'll just put in the boot.)  
(You've really got to)  
Remember yourself.  
You've got a Full House in your head tonight  
(You've got to, you've got to)  
Remember yourself.  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight.  
Remember yourself.  
You've got a Full House in your head tonight  
(You've got to, you've got to)  
Remember yourself.  
Stand back and see emotion getting you uptight.

When you left, the door was  
(slamming)  
You paused in the doorway  
(slamming)  
As though a thought stole you away  
(slamming)  
I watched the world pull you away  
(Lock it)  
  
So I run into the hall  
(Lock it)  
Into the corridor  
(Lock it)  
There's a door in the house  
(slamming)  
I hear the lift descending  
(slamming)  
I hear it hit the landing  
(slamming)  
See the hackles on the cat  
(standing)  
  
With my key I  
(lock it)  
With my key I  
(lock it up)  
With my key I

With my key I

Won't let ya in for love, nor money  
("Let me in!")  
My home, my joy  
I'm barred and bolted and I

No stranger's feet  
Will enter me

I wash the panes  
(Get out of my house!)  
I clean the stains away  
(Get out of my house!)  
  
This house is as old as I am

This house knows all I have done

They come with their weather hanging 'round them

But can't knock my door down

With my key I

My home, my joy  
I'm barred and bolted and I

(Get out of my house!)  
(Get out of my house!)  
"Let me in!"  
  
"Woman let me in!  
Let me bring in the memories!  
Woman let me in!  
Let me bring in the Devil Dreams!"  
  
I will not let you in!  
Don't you bring back the reveries  
I turn into a bird  
Carry further than the word is heard  
  
"Woman let me in!  
I turn into the wind.  
I blow you a cold kiss,  
Stronger than the song's hit."  
  
I will not let you in  
I face towards the wind  
I change into the Mule  
"I change into the Mule."

You stood in the belltower,  
But now you're gone.  
So who knows all the sights  
Of Notre Dame?  
  
They've got the stars for the gallant hearts.  
I'm the replacement for your part.  
But all I want to do is forget  
You, friend.  
  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave me alone.  
The first time in my life,  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul.  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave it alone.  
I don't know,  
Is this the right thing to do?  
  
Rehearsing in your things,  
I feel guilty.  
And retracing all the scenes,  
Of your big hit,  
Oh, God, you needed the leading role.  
It wasn't me who made you go, though.  
Now all I want to do is forget  
You, friend.  
  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave me alone.  
The first time in my life,  
I leave the lights on  
To ease my soul.  
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror,  
Won't leave it alone.  
I don't know,  
Is this the right thing to do?  
  
Who calls me from the other side  
Of the street?  
And who taps me on the shoulder?  
I turn around, but you're gone.

"Hello Earth"  
  
"Columbia now nine times the speed of sound."  
"Roger that, Dan, I've got a solid TACAN  
locked on, uh, TACAN twenty-three."  
"The, uh, tracking data, map data and pre-planned  
trajectory are all one line on the block"  
"Roger your block decoded recorded"  
  
Hello, Earth.  
Hello, Earth.  
With just one hand held up high  
I can blot you out,  
Out of sight.  
  
Peek-a-boo,  
Peek-a-boo, little Earth.  
With just my heart and my mind  
I can be driving,  
Driving home,  
And you asleep  
On the seat.  
  
I get out of my car,  
Step into the night  
And look up at the sky.  
And there's something bright,  
Traveling fast.  
Look at it go!  
Look at it go!  
  
("Listen!")  
  
Watching storms  
Start to form  
Over America.  
Can't do anything.  
Just watch them swing  
With the wind  
Out to sea.  
  
All you sailors,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All life-savers,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All you cruisers,  
("Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!")  
All you fishermen,  
Head for home.  
  
Go to sleep, little Earth.  
I was there at the birth,  
Out of the cloudburst,  
The head of the tempest.  
Murderer!  
Murder of calm.  
Why did I go?  
Why did I go?  
  
"Tiefer, tiefer.  
Irgendwo in der Tiefe  
Gibt es ein licht."  
  
Go to sleep little Earth.

You know that I'll be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That you'll be coming home for Christmas.  
  
Please say you won't forget me  
That every moment's empty  
But only 'til you're coming home for Christmas.  
  
If I only had wings  
Then I would fly to you  
Through all the snowy weather  
We'd be together  
No one makes me feel the way you do.  
  
You know that I'll be waiting  
To hear your footsteps saying  
That you'll be coming home  
  
Home for Christmas.

I wait at the table,  
And hold hands with weeping strangers  
Wait for you to join the group  
  
The tambourine jingle-jangles  
The medium roams and rambles  
Not taken in, I break the circle  
  
I want this man  
To go away now  
  
With a kiss  
I'd pass the key  
And feel your tongue  
Teasing and receiving.  
With your spit  
Still on my lip  
You hit the water  
Him and I in the room  
To prove you are with us too  
  
He's using code that only you and I know  
This is no trick of his  
This is your magic  
  
I'd catch the cues  
Watching you  
Hoping you'd do something wrong  
  
Everybody thinks you'll never make it  
But every time you escape  
  
'Rosabel believe,  
Not even eternity  
Can hold Houdini!'  
  
"Rosabel, believe!"  
  
Through the glass  
I'd watch you breathe  
("Not even eternity")  
Bound and drowned  
And paler than you've ever been  
("will hold Houdini!")  
  
With your life  
The only thing in my mind  
We pull you from the water  
  
(Houdini!)  
  
You ("Hou-di-ni")  
And I and Rosabel believe

"It's in the trees!  
It's coming!"  
  
When I was a child:  
Running in the night,  
Afraid of what might be  
  
Hiding in the dark,  
Hiding in the street,  
And of what was following me...  
  
Now hounds of love are hunting.  
I've always been a coward,  
And I don't know what's good for me.  
  
Here I go!  
It's coming for me through the trees.  
Help me, someone!  
Help me, please!  
  
Take my shoes off,  
And throw them in the lake,  
And I'll be  
Two steps on the water.  
  
I found a fox  
Caught by dogs.  
He let me take him in my hands.  
  
His little heart,  
It beats so fast,  
And I'm ashamed of running away  
  
From nothing real--  
I just can't deal with this,  
But I'm still afraid to be there,  
  
Among your hounds of love,  
And feel your arms surround me.  
I've always been a coward,  
And never know what's good for me.  
  
Oh, here I go!  
Don't let me go!  
Hold me down!  
It's coming for me through the trees.  
Help me, darling,  
Help me, please!  
  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake,  
And I'll be  
Two steps on the water.  
  
I don't know what's good for me.  
I don't know what's good for me.  
I need your love love love love love, yeah!  
Your love!  
  
Take your shoes off  
And throw them in the lake!  
  
Do you know what I really need?  
Do you know what I really need?  
I need love love love love love, yeah!

"It's in the trees  
It's coming"  
  
[Verse 1: Kate Bush]  
When I was a child, running in the night  
Afraid of what might be  
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street  
And of what was following me  
Now hounds of love are hunting  
I've always been a coward  
And I don't know what's good for me  
  
[Chorus 1: Kate Bush]  
Here I go  
It's coming for me through the trees  
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And I'll be two steps on the water  
  
[Verse 2: Kate Bush]  
I found a fox, caught by dogs  
He let me take him in my hands  
His little heart, it beats so fast  
And I'm ashamed of running away  
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this  
But I'm afraid to be there  
Among your hounds of love  
And feel your arms surrounding me  
I've always been a coward  
And never know what's good for me  
  
[Chorus 2: Kate Bush]  
Here I go , don't let me go  
Never let me go, tie me to the mast  
It's coming for me through the trees  
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And I'll be two steps on the water  
  
[Bridge: Kate Bush]  
I don't know what's good for me  
I don't know what's good for me  
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah  
Your love  
  
[Chorus 3: Kate Bush]  
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake  
Do you know what I really need?  
Do you know what I really need?  
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah

Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many thoughts for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming  
  
Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many songs for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming  
  
Oh Davy, you may have many words  
And many songs for you're near  
You're so like a star upon me  
So like a star upon me  
To be one in your garden  
Humming, humming, humming

Somewhere a door is opening  
Somewhere a door is closing  
Somewhere somebody dies  
Somewhere a newborn baby cries  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
The storm is coming back  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
'Cause I'm still waiting  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmnamm  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
Somewhere a door is opening  
  
Maybe the love has gone  
But there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
'Cause there's still a heart that's beating  
Though the clouds have come  
Maybe the sun will come out  
  
Maybe you'll be coming back  
There's still a heart that's beating  
Maybe the sun will come out  
They say the storm will be coming back  
Maybe you'll be coming back 'Cause I'm still waiting  
  
Mmmna mmmna mmmna mmmna  
Baby, well I'm still waiting  
Ooh, I'm waiting  
Mmmmmmmmoooh  
YAYAYAYAYAYA!  
Oh, I'm waiting  
Oh

In the warm room  
Her perfume reaches you.  
Eventually you'll fall for her.  
Down you'll go  
To where the mellow wallows.  
  
In the warm room  
She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand.  
You'll long to kiss those red lips,  
But when you do  
It'll feel like kicking a habit.  
  
[Chorus]  
She'll tell you that she'll stay,  
So you'd better barricade the way out.  
She'll tell you she's true.  
She'll tell you she loves you.  
She's waiting in that warm room.  
  
In the warm room  
She prepares to go to bed.  
She'll let you watch her undress,  
Go places where  
Your fingers long to linger.  
  
In the warm room  
You'll fall into her like a pillow.  
Her thighs are soft as marshmallows.  
Say hello  
To the soft musk of her hollows.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the warm room.  
  
She's waiting in that warm room.

Slipping past the chimney-pots,  
Down among the ashes, away from old times--  
Why must I self-indulge in memories?  
I should be celebrating to a moving melody,  
But it hurts me, it hurts me,  
Honey, honey, it hurts me.  
And I'm feeling like a waltz,  
Growing old, - old, old, old, old.  
I was fiery but you put me out.  
I was always one for loving and leaving.  
I like to think I was immune to romance.  
I should be laughing at some good old comedy.  
Oh, but it hurts me, it hurts me.  
Honey, honey, it hurts me.  
And I'm feeling like a waltz -  
If you laughed at me, I'd laugh too.  
Waltz, don't you know that I'd be really breakin-ing.  
L'amour--marche avec un etranger.  
I shouldn't care, you're not my darling anymore,  
But it hurts me, it hurts me,  
Honey, honey, honey, honey.  
And I'm feeling like a waltz,  
Growing old, old, old, old, old

James, come on home  
You've been gone too long baby  
We can't let our hero die alone  
We miss you day and night  
You left town to live by the rifle  
You left us to fight  
But it just ain't right to take away the light  
  
Remember Genie, from the casino  
She's still a-waiting in her big brass bed  
The boys from your gang are knocking whisky back  
Till they get out of hand  
And wish they were dead  
They're only lonely for the life they led  
With their old friend  
Oh  
James, are you selling your soul to a cold gun?  
  
Where lies your heart?  
It's not there in the buckskin baby  
It's not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud  
  
You're a coward James  
You're running away from humanity  
You're running out on reality  
It won't be funny when they  
Rat-a-tat you down  
  
Remember Genie, from the casino  
She's still a-waiting in her big brass bed  
The boys from your gang are knocking whisky back  
Till they get out of hand  
And wish they were dead  
They're only lonely for the life they led  
With their old friend  
Oh  
James, are you selling your soul to a cold gun?

Hello, old lady.  
I know your face well.  
I know it well.  
  
She says,  
"Oh!  
I'll be sitting in your mirror.  
Now is the place where the crossroads meet.  
Will you look into the future?  
  
"Never, never say goodbye  
To my part of your life.  
No, no, no, no, no!  
Oh, oh, oh,  
  
"Let me live!"  
She said.  
"C'mon and let me live, girl!"  
She said,  
"C'mon and let me live, girl!"  
("C'mon and let me live!")  
  
"This moment in time,"  
(She said.)  
It doesn't belong to you,"  
(She said,)  
It belongs to me,  
  
"And to your little boy and to your little girl,  
And the one hand clapping:  
Where on your palm is my little line,  
When you're written in mine  
As an old memory?  
Oh  
  
"Never, never say goodbye  
To my part of your life.  
Oh no, no, no, no, no!  
Never, never, never!  
Never, never let me go!"  
  
She said,  
"C'mon and let me live, girl!'  
("C'mon and let me live!")  
She said,  
"C'mon and let me live, girl!"  
("C'mon and let me live!")  
  
I put this  
Moment here.  
I put this moment here.  
I put this moment  
  
"Over here!  
"Over here!  
  
Can't you see where memories are kept bright?  
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl.  
Time in her eyes is spawning past life,  
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled,  
Holding all the love that waits for you here.  
Catch us now for I am your future.  
  
A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land.  
Come over here to where When lingers,  
Waiting in this empty world,  
Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools.  
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave,  
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools.  
  
We are of the going water and the gone.  
We are of water in the holy land of water  
And all that's to come runs in  
With the thrust on the strand."

All the banners stop waving  
And the flags stop flying  
And the silence comes over  
Thousands of soldiers  
Thousands of soldiers  
  
Who is that girl? Do I know her face?  
Who is that girl?  
  
Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross  
And she looks so beautiful in her armour  
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she never wears a ring on her finger  
  
All the cannon are firing  
And the swords are clashing  
And the horses are charging  
And the flags are flying  
And the battle is raging  
And the bells, the bells are ringing  
  
Who is that girl? Do I know her face?  
Who is that girl?  
  
Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross  
And she looks so beautiful in her armor  
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she never wears a ring on her finger  
Joanni, Joanni, Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she just looks beautiful in her armor  
Beautiful in her armor

YOWWW! Ha!  
We look to the left and to the right.  
We need help but nobody's in sight.  
Where is the man that we all need?  
Well tell him he's to come, and rescue me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC.  
  
Now head 'em up,  
Rope 'em in,  
Move 'em out.  
Now can't you see  
That we need the leader of the GLC?  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC.  
  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the funky sex machine?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the leader of the GLC?  
(KEN!)  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
  
Now head 'em up,  
Rope 'em in,  
Move 'em out.  
(KEN!)  
Can't you see  
That we need ah-ah-ah-ah-ah?  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need.  
Ken is the WAHWHAYEAYEAYEAYEA!  
  
Who is the man we all need?  
(KEN!)  
(KEN!)  
  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow,  
Do do 'n do do 'n do dow.  
Ken is the man that we all need,  
Ken is the leader of the GLC!

Could you see the aisles of women?  
Could you see them screaming and weeping?  
Could you see the storm rising?  
Could you see the guy who was driving?  
Could you climb higher and higher?  
Could you climb right over the top?  
Why does a multi-millionaire  
Fill up his home with priceless junk?  
  
The wind is whistling,  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house.  
  
Elvis, are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain.  
  
Another Hollywood waitress  
Is telling us she's having your baby.  
And there's a rumor that you're on ice  
And you will rise again someday,  
And that there's a photograph  
Where you're dancing on your grave.  
  
The wind is whistling,  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house.  
  
Elvis, are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain.  
  
The wind, it blows,  
The wind, it blows the door closed.

[Verse 1]  
Could you see the aisles of women?  
Could you see them screaming and weeping?  
Could you see the storm rising?

Could you climb right over the top?  
Why does a multi-millionaire  
Fill up his home with priceless junk?  
  
[Refrain]  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling

And that there's a photograph  
Where you're dancing on your grave  
  
[Refrain]  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house

Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain  
  
Elvis are you out there somewhere  
Looking like a happy man?  
In the snow with Rosebud  
And king of the mountain now  
  
[Vocalisations]  
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  
Ooooooh!  
  
[Bridge 1: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows the door closed  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
  
The wind is whistling  
The wind is whistling  
Through the house  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
  
[Instrumental Interlude]  
  
[Bridge 2]  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
  
The wind it blows  
The wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
  
Can't you see it?  
Can't you see it?  
There's a storm rising!  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, the wind it blows  
Oh, the wind it blows  
A-ha! A-ha!  
Oh, there's a storm rising  
Yes, there's a storm rising  
  
Can't you feel it?  
Can't you feel it rising?  
  
Oh, the wind  
Oh, the wind it blows

Lake Tahoe.  
Cold mountain water. Don't ever swim there.  
Just stand on the edge and look in there.  
And you might see a woman down there.  
  
They say some days, up she comes, up she rises, as if out of nowhere.  
Wearing Victorian dress.  
She was calling her pet, "Snowflake! Snowflake!"  
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake.  
  
Just like a poor, porcelain doll...  
Her eyes are open but no-one's home.  
The clock has stopped.  
So long she's gone.  
  
No-one's home.  
Her old dog is sleeping.  
His legs are frail now.  
But when he dreams,  
  
He runs...  
Along long beaches and sticky fields.  
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her.  
The beds are made. The table is laid.  
  
The door is open - someone is calling: It's a woman.  
"Here boy, here boy! You've come home!  
I've got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love.  
Miss me? Did you miss me?  
  
Here's the kitchen - There's your basket.  
Here's the hall - That's where you wait for me.  
Here's the bedroom - You're not allowed in there.  
Here's my lap - That's where you lay your head.  
  
Here boy, oh you're a good boy.  
You've come home.  
You've come home."

You came out of the night  
Wearing a mask in white colour  
My eyes were shining on the wine  
And your aura  
All in order, we move into the boudoir  
But too soon, the morning has resumed  
(Chorus)  
I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon  
You look like an angel  
Sleeping it off at a station  
Were you only passing through?  
I'm dying for you just to touch me  
And feel all the energy rushing right up-a-me  
L'amour looks something like you  
The thoughts of you sends me shivery  
I'm dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie  
My heart is thrown to the pebbles  
And the boatmen  
All the time I find I'm living in that evening  
With that feeling of sticky love inside  
(Chorus)

With my ego in my gut  
My babbling mouth would wash it up  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep it shut  
  
My door was never locked  
Until one day a trigger come, cocking  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep it shut  
  
Wide eyes would clean and dust  
Things that decay, things that rust  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep 'em shut  
I keep 'em shut  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm is in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm is in us, but power to arm  
  
Narrow mind would persecute it  
Die a little to get to it  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I leave it open  
  
I kept it in a cage  
Watched it weeping, but I made it stay  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I leave it open  
I leave it open  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Har in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us [Repeat: x6]  
Harm in you and in me!  
  
What you letting in?  
Tell me what you're letting in.  
Say what we're gonna let in!  
  
"We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in."

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right it front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
For though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Yeah, there will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the night is cloudy  
There is still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow  
Let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be

Oh thou, who givest sustenance to the universe  
From whom all things proceed  
To whom all things return  
Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun  
Hidden by a disk of golden light  
That we may know the truth  
And do our whole duty  
As we journey to thy sacred feet  
  
Well I said  
"Lily, Oh Lily I don't feel safe  
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me"  
And she said  
"Child, you must protect yourself  
I'll show you how with fire"  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire  
  
I said  
"Lily, Oh Lily I'm so afraid  
I fear I am walking in the Veil of Darkness"  
And she said  
"Child, take what I say  
With a pinch of salt  
And protect yourself with fire"  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire

It lay buried here. It lay deep inside me.  
It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it.  
It could take me all of my life,  
But it would only take a moment to  
  
Tell you what I'm feeling,  
But I don't know if I'm ready yet.  
You come walking into this room  
Like you're walking into my arms.  
What would I do without you?  
  
Take away the love and the anger,  
And a little piece of hope holding us together.  
Looking for a moment that'll never happen,  
Living in the gap between past and future.  
Take away the stone and the timber,  
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.  
  
If you can't tell your sister,  
If you can't tell a priest,  
'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it  
To anyone,  
Can you tell it to your heart?  
Can you find it in your heart  
  
To let go of these feelings  
Like a bell to a Southerly wind?  
We could be like two strings beating,  
Speaking in sympathy...  
What would we do without you?  
Two strings speak in sympathy.  
  
Take away the love and the anger,  
And a little piece of hope holding us together.  
Looking for a moment that'll never happen,  
Living in the gap between past and future.  
Take away the stone and the timber,  
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.  
  
We're building a house of the future together.  
(What would we do without you?)  
  
Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it,  
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future.  
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it,  
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future.  
You might not, not think so now,  
But just you wait and see--someone will come to help you.  

Where are our lives?  
If there is no dream  
Where is our home?  
  
We don't know how  
There will be a way  
Out of the storm  
We will find home  
  
And her soul  
Walks beside her  
An army stands  
Behind her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her face  
Full of grace  
Two worlds collide  
Around her  
The truth lies  
Deep inside her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And the stars  
Look down upon her  
As darkness  
Settles on her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
Who's to know  
What's in the future  
But we hope  
We will be with her  
We have all our love  
To give her  
Oh  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her soul  
Walks beside her  
An army stands  
Behind her  
Lyra, Lyra  
  
And her face  
Full of grace  
Two worlds collide  
Around her  
The truth lies  
Deep inside her  
Lyra, Lyra

Roll his body.  
Give him eyes.  
Make him smile for me,  
Give him life.  
  
My hand is bleeding, I run back inside.  
I turn off the light,  
Switch on a starry night.  
My window flies open.  
  
My bedroom fills with falling snow,  
Should be a dream but I'm not sleepy.  
I see his snowy white face but I'm not afraid.  
He lies down beside me.  
  
So cold next to me.  
I can feel him melting in my hand.  
Melting, in my hand.  
He won't speak to me.  
  
His crooked mouth is full of dead leaves.  
Full of dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden,  
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn.  
He is dissolving, dissolving before me and dawn will come soon.  
  
What kind of spirit is this?  
Our one and only tryst.  
His breath all misty,  
And when I kiss his ice-cream lips  
  
And his creamy skin,  
His snowy white arms surround me.  
So cold next to me.  
I can feel him melting in my hand.  
  
Melting, melting, in my hand.  
Sunday morning.  
I can't find him.  
The sheets are soaking  
  
And on my pillow:  
Dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden,  
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn.  
I can't find him - Misty  
  
Oh please can you help me?  
He must be somewhere.  
Open window closing,  
Oh but wait, it's still snowing.  
  
If you're out there,  
I'm coming out on the ledge.  
I'm going out on the ledge.

Some moments that I've had  
Some moments of pleasure  
  
I think about us lying  
Lying on a beach somewhere  
I think about us diving  
Diving off a rock, into another moment  
  
The case of George the Wipe  
Oh God I can't stop laughing  
This sense of humor of mine  
It isn't funny at all  
Oh but we sit up all night  
Talking about it  
  
Just being alive  
It can really hurt  
And these moments given  
Are a gift from time  
  
On a balcony in New York  
It's just started to snow  
He meets us at the lift  
Like Douglas Fairbanks  
Waving his walking stick  
But he isn't well at all  
The buildings of New York  
Look just like mountains through the snow  
  
Just being alive  
It can really hurt  
And these moments given  
Are a gift from time  
Just let us try  
To give these moments back  
To those we love  
To those who will survive  
  
And I can hear my mother saying  
"Every old sock meets an old shoe"  
Isn't that a great saying?  
"Every old sock meets an old shoe"  
Here come the Hills of Time  
  
Hey there Maureen,  
  
Hey there Bubba,  
Dancing down the aisle of a plane,  
  
'S Murph, playing his guitar refrain,  
  
Hey there Teddy,  
Spinning in the chair at Abbey Road,  
  
Hey there Michael,  
Do you really love me?  
  
Hey there Bill,  
Could you turn the lights up?

Moving stranger does it really matter?  
As long as you're not afraid to feel  
Touch me, hold me, how my open arms ache  
Try to fall for me  
  
How I'm moved, how you move me  
With your beauty's potency  
You give me life, please don't let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
  
Moving liquid, yes, you are just as water  
You flow around all that comes in your way  
Don't think it over, it always takes you over  
And sets your spirit dancing  
  
How I'm moved, how you move me  
With your beauty's potency  
You give me life, please don't let me go (please don't let me go)  
You give me life, please don't let me go (please don't let me go)  
Oh, you give me life, please don't let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
Soul

I remember it was that Wednesday  
Oh when it rained and it rained  
They traipsed mud all over the house  
It took hours and hours to scrub it out  
All over the hall carpet  
I took my mop and bucket  
And I cleaned and I cleaned  
  
The kitchen floor  
Until it sparkled  
Then I took my laundry basket  
And put the linen all in it  
And everything I could fit in it  
And all our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash  
And all your shirts and jeans and things  
And put them in the new washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
  
I watched them go 'round and 'round  
My blouse wrapping itself in your trousers  
Oh the waves are going out  
My skirt floating up around my waist  
As I wade out into the surf  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Oh and the waves are going out  
Oh and you're standing right behind me  
Little fish swim between my legs  
  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Oh and the waves are going out  
Oh and the waves are coming in  
Out of the corner of my eye  
I think I see you standing outside  
But it's just your shirt  
Hanging on the washing line  
Waving its arm as the wind blows by  
And it looks so alive  
Nice and white  
Just like its climbed right out  
Of my washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
  
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy  
Get that dirty shirty clean  
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy  
Make those cuffs and collars gleam  
Everything clean and shiny  
  
Washing machine  
Washing machine  
Washing machine

Written by Kate Bush  
  
Je viens  
Comme un chat  
Par la nuit si noire.  
Tu attends,  
Et je tombe  
Dans tes ailes blanches, la-la-la...  
Et je vole,  
Et je coule  
Comme une plume.  
  
Si les grands yeux de mon Dieu  
Ne me gardaient pas,  
Je te volerais  
  
Ne t'enfuis pas!  
Tu as des ailes,  
Le pouvoir de me quitter.  
Tu es tombe - You fell  
Du ciel comme un ange, la-la-la  
Et j'ai peur  
Que le ciel  
Te reprenne.  
  
Si les grands yeux de mon Dieu  
Ne me gardaient pas,  
Je te volerais.  
  
Je viens  
Comme un chat  
Par la nuit si noire.  
  
Je t'en prie,  
Je t'en prie,  
Je t'en prie,  
Je t'en prie,  
Je t'en prie,  
Je t'en prie--  
Ne t'enfuis  
Pas!  
  
  
English Translation:  
Don't Fly Away  
  
I am coming  
Like a cat  
Through the night so black.  
You are waiting,  
And I fall  
Into your white wings, la-la-la...  
And I fly,  
And I sink  
Like a feather.  
  
If the great eyes of my God  
Were not watching (over) me,  
I would steal you away.  
  
Don't fly away!  
You have wings,  
The power to leave me.  
You fell  
From the sky like an angel, la-la-la  
And I'm afraid  
That the sky  
Will take you back.  
  
If the great eyes of my God  
Weren't watching (over) me,  
I would steal you away.  
  
I am coming  
Like a cat  
Through the night so black.  
  
I beg you,  
I beg you,  
I beg you,  
I beg you,  
I beg you,  
I beg you--  
Don't fly

I look at you and see  
My life that might have been  
Your face just ghostly in the smoke.  
They're setting fire to the cornfields  
As you're taking me home.  
The smell of burning fields  
Will now mean you and here.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
The thrill and the hurting  
I know that this will never be mine.  
  
I want you as the dream  
Not the reality  
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me  
But I'm looking back over my shoulder  
At you, happy without me.  
  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
This is what I need  
This is where I want to be  
But I know that this will never be mine.  
  
Ooh, the thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.  
The thrill and the hurting  
It will never be mine.  
It can never be  
The thrill and the hurting  
Will never be mine.

Got to get some food  
I'm so hungry all the time  
I don't know how to stop  
I don't know how to stop  
  
Got to get some sleep  
I'm so nervous in the night  
I don't know how to stop  
No, I don't know how to stop  
I don't know how to stop  
I don't know how to stop  
  
Got to pick up the phone  
I will call any number  
I will talk to anyone  
I know I'm gone too far  
Much too far I gone this time  
And I don't want to think what I've done  
I don't know how to stop  
No, I don't know how to stop  
  
There are always hidden silences  
Waiting behind the chair  
They come out when the coast is clear  
They eat anything that moves  
I go shaky at the knees  
Lights go out, stars come down  
Like a swarm of bees  
  
No self-control  
  
You know I hate to hurt you  
I hate to see your pain  
But I don't know how to stop  
No, I don't know how to stop  
  
Street after street  
Night after night  
I walk on through the rain  
I walk on through the rain  
I don't know how to stop

[Chorus:]  
Sweet dreams  
  
On this Midsummer might  
Everyone is sleeping  
We go driving into the moonlight  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one, no one is here  
No one, no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
We tire of the city  
We tire of it all  
We long for just that something more  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one, no one is here  
No one, no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
The stars are caught in our hair  
The stars are on our fingers  
A veil of diamond dust  
Just reach up and touch it  
The sky's above our heads  
The sea's around our legs  
In milky, silky water  
We swim further and further  
We dive down  
We dive down  
  
A diamond night, a diamond sea  
And a diamond sky  
  
We dive deeper and deeper  
We dive deeper and deeper  
Could be we are here  
Could be we are in a dream  
It came up on the horizon  
Rising and rising  
In a sea of honey, a sky of honey  
A sea of honey, a sky of honey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at the light, all the time it's a changing  
Look at the light, climbing up the aerial  
Bright, white coming alive jumping off of the aerial  
All the time it's a changing, like now  
All the time it's a changing, like then again  
All the time it's a changing  
And all the dreamers are waking.

Oh, with a mind that renders everything sensitive,  
What chance do I have here?  
Put an end, put an end,  
Put an end to every dream.  
When you're near, I fear you,  
And I forget myself.  
  
But not this time.  
Not this time.  
Not this time, baby,  
Not this time.  
  
I don't know why I give in, but I do every time.  
And here I am wondering why I did it again.  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay's what I say  
To keep me going,  
To keep the shit away.  
  
I don't know what it is,  
But every time you're near, I fear you,  
And I forget myself.  
  
No, not this time, baby.  
Not this time, you won't.  
Not this time, darling.  
c'mon, we all sing:  
  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
Too-ree-ay, too-ree-o, too-ree-ay, too-ree-o,  
  
Not this time.  

Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I'm in your garden, fading fast in your arms  
The soldiers soften, the war is over  
The air raid shelters are blooming clover  
Flapping umbrellas fill the lanes  
My London Bridge in rain again  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart!  
Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington Park  
You read me Shakespeare on the rolling Thames  
That old river poet that never, ever ends  
Our thumping hearts hold the ravens in  
And keep the tower from tumbling  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart!  
Dropped from my black Spitfire to my funeral barge  
Give me one kiss in apple-blossom  
Give me one wish, and I'd be wassailing  
In the orchard, my English rose  
Or with my shepherd, who'll bring me home  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go

As the light hits you, as you shift along the floor  
I find it hard to place my face  
Ow did I come to be here anyway?  
It's terribly vague, what's gone before  
  
I could have been anyone  
You could have been anyone's dream  
Why did you have to choose our moment?  
Why did you have to make me feel that?  
Why did you make it so unreal?  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
  
All the colors look brighter now  
Everything they say seems to sound new  
Slipping into tomorrow too quick  
Yesterday always too good to forget  
Stop the swing of the pendulum  
Let us through!  
  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again  
Oh to be in love  
And never get out again

Whenever I look out french windows  
It's always snowing outside.  
And feel your body relax on mine,  
Giving me all the good lines,  
(Uh-huh)  
All the good lines,  
All the good lines...  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
A crystal layer of ice on our skin:  
Very numb outside but warm within.  
I bend to join our lips, but it's too cold  
To kiss and hit. Is it you I'm feeling?  
Is it you I'm feeling?  
(Yeah)  
Is it you I'm feeling?  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Hot in the ice,  
On fire inside,  
A snowball.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.  
Ah, but she's wonderful,  
Set in the snow.

Earth for all creatures  
A thought for all (wo)men  
Right for the speechless  
Wrong until then?  
  
Eyes for the laughter  
Thirst for the tongue  
Hands for together  
Ears for the song  
  
The song of love  
We sing in silence  
Every moment long  
  
Once  
Here to be done as we do  
With only one chance  
Here for the wonder of under the stars  
For the one and only  
Once  
  
Joy for the children  
Hope for the chance  
Men for the women  
Now for the dance  
  
The dance of love  
We dance just once  
In unique circumstance  
  
Once  
Here to be done as we do  
With only one chance  
Here for the wonder of under the stars  
For the one and only once

He got her drunk very quickly  
Holding hands, they found the broom-cupboard  
Where he had control as far as the fall  
When his hand covered wet hair  
She took over among furniture wax  
Dust, and the cloying yellow of polishing-cloth  
When he was sick, she comforted him  
  
Oh hush, my friend, and sleep  
And cuddle to the wind  
Sleep on through the waves  
That may wet your lover's dream  
  
We have been far through this night long hours  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
He couldn't do it properly  
The disco, the office, the pub,  
Had left out those details of delight.  
Satisfied, he would collapse out,  
Puzzled at why she still squirmed,  
Held onto him, tears curling into her mouth  
This was something their stories always omitted  
That her joy would seem like pain  
When he focused after his release.  
  
Do sand and shells and stones  
Peep in through your night?  
But you should not be hurt  
For all will pass with time.  
  
We have been far through this night long hours  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
In the third week of the relationship  
She was tripping on organic acid  
Would stop to pick up a rained-out leaf  
Would give it tenderly into his hand  
Full of dead things before they reached the car  
  
When they drove she sat with mouth open  
As though photographed on the impact of a stomach punch  
Her right fist gripping the skin of his left leg  
  
Hooking the steering-wheel closer to his heart  
He feared her, and slapped out sideways into her face  
She entered the cut with her tongue  
Gurgling gratitude for the strange taste  
  
Do you fear the dark?  
Then hush, and realise  
That though the angels never come  
Prayers can soothe your mind  
  
We have been far through this night long hour  
We will go far, tomorrow, out of sight, ooh...  
  
There was no premonition of the wet Hog's Back  
The sportscar slumped, snout into a beech  
Their corpses giving the vehicle arms  
Petrol and blood at last dripping together  
But quick flashes of a planned lunch  
Cold red beef, white cloth by a cherrywood fire  
Game pie, and for him two pints of colder beer  
The winter air tucking under their eyelids  
As they spun on the gravel at Clandon  
Their hands steaming from quick moisture  
The aromatic finger drawn up to his nostril  
Dazed after mutual masturbation  
They zigzagged into a conservative end  
  
Oh hush, my friend, asleep

Passing through air.  
You mix the stars with your arms.  
Walking through there.  
The doom of eternity balms.  
Skies of gray are not today.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh! Don't you throw my love away,  
I need your loving, I need your loving.  
Oh! Don't you pour down rain today,  
I need your love, I need your care  
So much, so much, so much!  
  
Laughing through smiles.  
You lick my love with the years.  
Walking for miles.  
You cool my brow with your tears.  
Skies of gray are not today.  
  
Oh! Don't you throw my love away,  
I need your loving, I need your loving.  
Oh! Don't you pour down rain today,  
I need your love, I need your care  
So much, so much, so much!  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I fell in love with Rinfy the gypsy.  
He said when I grew up he'd marry me,  
Carry me away on his steed.  
  
"Don't worry, my baby!  
Don't die, my funny little darling!  
I'm going away for a little while,  
And shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
  
Ooh, then I really fell for Geoffrey, our gardener.  
He said he'd marry me, too.  
Oh, and I believed him, just like a fool.  
  
"Don't worry, my honey!  
Don't die, my funny little doll!  
I'm going away for a little while.  
Shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
(Ooh, long, long, long...)  
  
Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,  
Playing canasta in cold rooms,  
Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,  
And in my lover's... Ooh...  
  
I met a boy who took me upstairs,  
Then took me in his arms  
And told me I comforted him, uh-huh.  
  
"Don't worry, my dear,  
Don't cry, you weird little stranger.  
I'm going away.  
You probably won't ever see me again. "  
  
Oh, yes, I know, I'm always falling,  
Gazing at hazy goldfish in your swimming eyes.  
How could I not lie there with you?  
  
"Don't worry, my darling!  
Don't die, my silly little baby!  
I'm going away for a little while,  
And shouldn't be gone for very long. "  
(Ooh, long, long, long!)  
  
Playing canasta in c-cold rooms,  
Playing canasta in cold rooms,  
Playing canasta upstairs, downstairs,  
And in my lover's... Ooh...

Just as we hit the green,  
I've never been so happy to be alive.  
Only seven miles behind  
You could smell the child,  
The smell of the front line's survival.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet,  
(I pull the pin.)  
  
You learn to ride the Earth,  
When you're living on your belly and the enemy are city-births.  
Who need radar? We use scent.  
They stink of the west, stink of sweat.  
Stink of cologne and baccy, and all their Yankee hash.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet,  
(I'm pulling on the pin,)  
Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin.  
(pulling on the pin, oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
And I love life!  
Just one thing in it  
Me or him.  
And I love life!  
I love life!  
I love life!  
  
I've seen the coat for me.  
I'll track him 'til he drops,  
Then I'll pop him one he won't see.  
He's big and pink, and not like me.  
He sees no light.  
He sees no reason for the fighting  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet.  
(I'm pulling on the pin,)  
Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin.  
(pulling on the pin, oh)  
  
I had not seen his face,  
'til I'm only feet away  
Unbeknown to my prey.  
I look in American eyes.  
I see little life,  
See little wife.  
He's striking violence up in me.  
  
With my silver Buddha  
And my silver bullet.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Where is she  
When the little thing cries?  
She lies in a bed  
With a friend of mine.  
But some nights  
She'll run back in fright  
If she picks on a dick  
That's too big for her pride.  
  
Oh! Oh!  
Why did I ever go marry her?  
I was a child!  
I'm holding the baby,  
She's ran-tanning constantly.  
She saw me coming for miles.  
She saw me open wide.  
  
Four o'clock  
And the key's in the lock.  
And she's been on the wing  
And she's stinking of drink.  
Wakes the kid,  
So I put him to sleep,  
And she's in there all night,  
Doubled over the sink.  
  
Oh! Oh!  
Why did I ever go marry her?  
I was a child!  
I'm holding the baby,  
She's ran-tanning constantly.  
She saw me coming for miles.  
She saw me open wide.  
Open wide.  
Open wide.

See how the child reaches out instinctively  
To feel how the fire will feel.  
  
See how the man reaches out instinctively  
For what he cannot have.  
  
The pull and the push of it all.  
  
Reaching out for the hand  
Reaching out for the hand that smacked  
Reaching out for that hand to hold  
Reaching out for the Star  
Reaching out for the Star that explodes  
Reaching out for Mama.  
  
See how the flower leans instinctively toward the light  
See how the heart reaches out instinctively  
For no reason but to touch.  
  
The pull and the push of it all.  
  
Reaching out for the hand  
Reaching out for the hand that smacked  
Reaching out for that hand to hold  
Reaching out for the Star  
Reaching out for the Star that explodes  
Reaching out for Mama.  
(Can't we see)  
Reaching out for Mama.

She packed my bags last night pre-flight  
Zero hour nine a.m.  
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then  
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife  
It's lonely out in space  
On such a timeless flight  
  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
Till touch down brings me round again to find  
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man  
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone  
  
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids  
In fact it's cold as hell  
And there's no one there to raise them if you did  
And all this science I don't understand  
It's just my job five days a week  
A rocket man, a rocket man  
  
And I think it's gonna be a long long time...

That Novenber night, looking up into the sky.  
You said "Hey wish that was me up there  
It's the biggest rocket I could find  
And it's holding the night in its arms  
If for only a moment.  
I can't see the look in its eyes  
But I'm sure it must be laughing."  
But it seemed to me the saddest thing I'd ever seen  
And I thought you were crazy wishing such a thing.  
  
I saw only a stick on fire  
Alone on its journey  
Home to the quickening ground  
With no one there to catch it.  
  
I put on my pointed hat  
And my black and silver suit  
And I check my gunpowder pack  
And I strap the stick on my back  
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge  
Nobody seemed to see me  
Then with the fuse in my hand  
And now shooting into the night  
And still as a rocket  
I land in the river.  
  
Was it me said you were crazy?  
I put on my cloudiest suit  
Size 5 lightening boots too  
'Coz I am a rocket  
On fire  
Look at me go with my tail on fire  
With my tail on fire  
On fire  
Hey, look at me go, look at me

Hey there you lady in tears  
Do you think that they care if they're real, woman?  
They just take it as part of the deal  
Lost in your men and the games you play  
Trying to prove that you're better, woman  
But you needn't get heavy with them  
Like it or not, we were built tough  
Because we're woman  
  
No, we never die for long  
While we've got that little life  
To live for, where it's hid inside  
No, we never die for long  
Oh! Woman, two in one  
  
There's room for a life in your womb, woman  
Inside of you can be two, woman  
There's room for a life in your womb, woman  
Mama woman, aha!  
  
Night after night in the quiet house  
Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman  
With no lover to free her desire  
How long do you think she can stick it out?  
How long do you think before she'll go out, woman?  
Hey! Get up on your feet and go get it, now  
Like it or not, we keep bouncing back,  
Because we're woman  
  
No, we never die for long,  
While we've got that little life  
To live for, where it's hid inside.  
Oh! Woman, two in one,  
  
There's room for a life in your womb, woman,  
Inside of you can be two, woman,  
There's room for a life in your womb, woman,  
Mama woman, aha!  
  
A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha!  
A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha!  
Oh, mama-woman, two-in-a-one, aha!  
Oh, two in one, aha!  
Oh, woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!  
There's room for a life in your womb!  
There's room for a life in your womb!  
Two in one, aha!  
Two in one! Two in one! Two in one!  
Room for a life in your womb

See those trees  
Bend in the wind  
I feel they've got a lot more sense than me  
You see I try to resist  
  
A rubberband bouncing back to life  
A rubberband bend the beat  
If I could learn to give like a rubberband  
  
I'd be back on my feet  
A rubberband hold me trousers up  
A rubberband ponytails  
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband  
  
I'd be a rubberband girl  
A rubberband girl me  
A rubberband girl me  
Oh I want to be a rubberband girl  
  
When I slip out  
Of my catapult  
I gotta land with my feet on the ground  
And let my body catch up  
  
A rubberband bouncing back to life  
A rubberband bend the beat  
If I could learn to give like a rubberband  
  
I'd be back on my feet  
A rubberband hold me trousers up  
A rubberband ponytails  
If I could learn to twang like a rubberband  
  
I'd be a rubberband girl  
A rubberband girl me  
A rubberband girl me  
Oh I want to be a rubberband girl  
  
Give like a rubberband  
Twang like a rubberband  
Snap like a rubberband  
Rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub  
Rub-a-dub-a-dub  
Rub-a-dub  
One rubberband won't keep you up  
Two rubberbands won't keep you up  
Three rubberbands won't keep you up  
  
Here I go  
Yeah!  
  
One rubberband won't keep you up  
Two rubberbands won't keep you up  
Three rubberbands won't keep you up

"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.  
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill."  
  
It doesn't hurt me.  
Do you want to feel how it feels?  
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?  
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?  
You, it's you and me.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building.  
If I only could, oh  
  
You don't want to hurt me,  
But see how deep the bullet lies.  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.  
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.  
  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?  
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?  
You, it's you and me.  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building,  
Say, if I only could, oh...  
  
You,  
It's you and me,  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
  
"C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,  
Let me steal this moment from you now.  
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,  
Let's exchange the experience, oh"  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
  
If I only could  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.  
If I only could, I'd be running up that hill."

I see the people working,  
And see it working for them.  
And so I want to join in,  
But then I find it hurts me.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have.  
  
I see the people happy,  
So can it happen for me?  
'Cause when I am unhappy,  
There's nothing that can move me.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have.  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.

I must admit, just when I think I'm king,

Just when I think I'm king, I must admit,  
(I just begin.)  
Just when I think I'm king,  
(I just begin.)  
  
I've been doing it for years.  
My goal is moving near.  
It says, "Look! I'm over here."  
Then it up and disappears.  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap.  
Some say that knowledge is ho-ho-ho-ho.  
  
I want to be a lawyer.  
I want to be a scholar.  
But I really can't be bothered.  
Ooh, just gimme it quick, gimme it, gimme gimme gimme gimme!

(I just begin.)  
When I'm king--  
(-- just begin.)  
  
In my dome of ivory,  
A home of activity,  
I want the answers quickly,  
But I don't have no energy.  
  
I hold a cup of wisdom,  
But there is nothing within.  
My cup, she never overfloweth,  
And 'tis I that moan- and groaneth.  
  
Some grey and white matter,  
"Give me the karma, mama!"  
I'm coming up the ladder,  
"A jet to Mecca,"  
I'm coming up the ladder,  
"Tibet or Jeddah,  
Up the ladder...  
"To Salisbury,  
A monastery,  
The longest journey,  
Across the desert,  
Across the weather,  
Across the elements,  
Across the water!"

Here in the studio,  
As they're turning down the lights,  
I lick my lips to start the first line -  
How can this girl be me?  
"Oh, little thing, are you looking lost?"  
The vertigo, the need to lose. "  
Ooh, ooh...  
They try to put me on the tapes begin to spin,  
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in,  
I try to put it all in, do it for you,  
Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.  
They try to put me on the tape begin to spin,  
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in,  
I try to put it all in, do it for you,  
Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going.  
Swimming amid the cans  
I wonder can I goad myself into another take,  
And keep the mood?  
It's like a film - such balance.  
I close my eyes to the cello solo and ache,  
The music will never let me blow away you-oo.  
You know the feeling when you're on the right track.  
You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.  
It's a part of you, they're so sensitive,  
Oozing without me, filling over with secrets.  
You know the feeling when you're on the right track.  
You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.  
It's a part of you, they're so sensitive,  
Oozing without me, filling over with secrets.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going.

Uuh, baby, I'm hot just like an oven  
I need some lovin'  
And baby, I can't hold it much longer  
It's getting stronger and stronger  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve my mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me  
Whenever blue tear drops are falling  
And my emotional stability is leaving me  
There is something I can do  
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby  
And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me  
The love you give to me will free me  
If you don't know the things you're dealing  
Ooh, I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing  
Sexual healing  
Let's make love tonight  
'Cause you do it right  
Baby, I got sick this morning  
A sea was storming inside of me  
And baby, I think I'm capsizing  
The waves are rising and rising  
And when I get that feeling  
I want sexual healing  
Sexual healing makes me feel so fine  
Helps to relieve your mind  
Sexual healing, baby  
Sexual healing is something  
That's good for me and it's good for me  
And it's so good to me, my baby  
Ooh, come take control  
Just grab a hold  
Of my body and mind  
Soon we'll be making it, we will doin' it fine  
You're my medicine  
Open up and let me in  
Darling, you're so great  
I can't wait for you to operate  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing  
When I get that feeling  
Heal me, baby

I was born in a cloud  
Now I am falling.  
I want you to catch me.  
Look up and you'll see me.  
  
You know you can hear me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
We're over a forest.  
There's millions of snowflakes.  
  
We're dancing.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling and I'll find you.  
I am ice and dust. I am sky.  
I can see horses wading through snowdrifts.  
  
My broken hearts, my fabulous dances.  
My fleeting song, fleeting.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
My broken hearts, my fabulous dance.  
  
My fleeting song.  
My twist and shout.  
I am ice and dust and light. I am sky and here.  
I can hear people.  
  
I think you are near me now.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
We're over a forest.  
It's midnight at Christmas.  
  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
I think I can see you.  
There's your long, white neck.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
  
Now I am falling.  
Look up and you'll see me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
In a moment or two.  
  
I'll be with you.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.  
Be ready to catch me.  
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.

Held in your arms in the back seat,  
Cruising down the main street,  
How can anyone have such little defense?  
You're soft.  
In between the sheets, left in limbo,  
Covered me like the pillow  
I can hardly tell the difference.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd leave everything.  
But I don't know how to deal with you.  
I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.  
Love would melt me like hot butter.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd do anything.  
Walking down the street, brushing arms,  
You're moonlight dancing.  
I try hard to keep my feelings in.  
You're soft.  
Dancing to the music, so low.  
I knead you like dough.  
How can anyone be so loving  
And soft,  
So soft?  
To be, to be with you  
I'd leave everything.  
But I don't know how to deal with you.  
I swear you'd fall like a feather if I was cruel.  
You melt me like hot butter.  
You're soft,  
So soft.  
To be, to be with you  
I'd do anything.

There's something that sounds like a song  
In my garden, by the willow  
A piper:  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"  
I see him when I turn the lights down low,  
In my garden, wading through the pond.  
Dressed in sailing wear.  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"  
I've called him by every name I know,  
By every name I know,  
But he won't answer me.  
He keeps coming forward, but never moving.  
Is there no destiny here?  
It sounds like a song  
In my garden, by the willow  
A piper:  
"Oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, oohoo, ahoo, hoooo"

'Bang!' goes another kanga  
On the bonnet of the van.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree  
'Til you near him on the motorway  
And the tree begin to breathe.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
  
("Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha")  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is the New Man.  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is my dented van.  
  
Woomera.  
  
"Dree-ee-ee-ee-ee-

A-a-a-a-a-  
M-m-m-m-m-  
Ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-"  
  
The civilized keep alive  
The territorial war.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
Erase the race that claim the place  
And say we dig for ore,  
Or dangle devils in a bottle  
And push them from the Pull of the Bush.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
You find them in the road.  
"See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand."  
In the road.  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
With no warning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
We bring in the rigging.  
Dig, dig, dig, dig away.  
  
"Dree-ee-ee-ee-ee-

Ma-ma-many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree  
("La, la, oo-ooh!")  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
You near him on the motorway  
And the tree begin to breathe.  
Erase the race that claim the place  
And say we dig for ore.

Dangle devils in a bottle  
And push them from the Pull of the Bush.

On the bonnet of the van.

("Oh, re mikayina!")  

You see, I'm all grown-up now  
He said  
"Just put your feet down child  
'Cause you're all grown-up now."  
Just like a photograph I pick you up  
Just like a station on the radio  
I pick you up  
Just like a face in the crowd  
I pick you up  
Just like a feeling that you're sending out  
I pick it up  
But I can't let you go  
If I let you go  
You slip into the fog  
  
This love was big enough for the both of us.  
This love of yours,  
Was big enough to be frightened of  
It's deep and dark like the water was  
The day I learned to swim.  
He said "Just put your feet down child  
Just put your feet down child  
The water is only waist high  
I'll let go of you gently  
Then you can swim to me."  
  
Is this love big enough to watch over me  
Big enough to let go of me?  
Without hurting me  
Like the day I learned to swim.  
"'Cause you're all grown-up now  
Just put your feet down child  
The water is only waist high.  
I'll let go of you gently  
Then you can swim to me."

Say good night-night  
I tuck him in tight.  
But things are not right.  
What is this? An infant kiss  
That sends my body tingling?  
I've never fallen for  
A little boy before.  
No control.  
  
Just a kid and just at school.  
Back home they'd call me dirty.  
His little hand is on my heart.  
He's got me where it hurts me.  
Knock, knock. Who's there in this baby?  
  
You know how to work me.  
All my barriers are going.  
It's starting to show.  
Let go. Let go. Let go.  
I cannot sit and let  
Something happen I'll regret.  
Ooh, he scares me!  
  
There's a man behind those eyes.  
I catch him when I'm bending.  
Ooh, how he frightens me  
When they whisper privately.  
("Don't Let Go!")  
  
Windy-wailey blows me.  
Words of caress on their lips  
That speak of adult love.  
I want to smack but I hold back.  
I only want to touch.  
  
But I must stay and find a way  
To stop before it gets too much!  
All my barriers are going.  
It's starting to show.  
Let go. Let go. Let go.  
(Don't let go!)

I've pulled down my lace and the chintz.  
Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius?  
I'll send your love to Zeus.  
Oh, by the time you read this,  
I'll be well in touch.  
  
I'm giving it all in a moment or two.  
I'm giving it all in a moment, for you.  
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it.  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind.  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm.  
Your sister I was born.  
You must lose me like an arrow,  
Shot into the killer storm.  
  
You and me on the bobbing knee.  
Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read!  
I will come home again, but not until  
The sun and the moon meet on yon hill.  
  
I'm giving it all in a moment or two.  
I'm giving it all in a moment, for you.  
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it.  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind.  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm.  
Your sister I was born.  
You must lose me like an arrow,  
Shot into the killer storm.

The king is dead  
No doubt about it  
We came a long way  
Just to say goodbye  
And in the end  
It was some old swansong  
The king is dead  
You'd never know it  
But we got pictures  
Of a different man  
He's flesh and blood  
No-one knows all the answers  
Some days we just do the best we can  
  
You changed my mind in a minute  
It breaks my heart to admit it  
Don't make me say...  
  
The king is dead  
The show is over  
We came a long way  
Just to turn around  
Lesson learned  
No-one knows all the answers  
Some days we just do the best we can  
  
You changed my mind in a minute  
It breaks my heart to admit it  
Don't make me say...  
  
You let me in behind the lies  
But you're no use to me lifesize  
No-one's to blame  
  
Some days we just do the best we can

The long and winding road  
That leads to your door  
Will never disappear  
I've seen that road before  
It always leads me her  
Lead me to you door  
The wild and windy night  
That the rain washed away  
Has left a pool of tears  
Crying for the day  
Why leave me standing here  
Let me know the way  
Many times I've been alone  
And many times I've cried  
Any way you'll never know  
The many ways I've tried  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you reach for a star  
Only angels are there  
And it's not very far  
Just to step on a stair  
Take a look at those clowns  
And the tricks that they play  
In the circus of life  
Life is bitter and gay  
  
There are clowns in the night  
Clowns everywhere  
See how they run  
Run from despair  
You can be thrilled  
And you can be free  
  
"How?"  
  
But only my friend  
If you'll listen to me  
  
When the fantasy bells  
Of the universe ring  
You can fly through the sky  
On a dragonfly's wing  
There is magic within  
There is magic without  
Follow me and you'll learn  
Just what life's all about  
Just what life's all about

I hear him,  
Before I go to sleep,  
And focus on the day that's been,  
I realize he's there,  
When I turn the light off,  
And turn over,  
Nobody knows about my man,  
They think he's lost on some horizon,  
And suddenly I find myself listening,  
To a man I've never known before,  
Telling me about the sea,  
Oh his love is to eternity.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes  
  
He's very understanding and he's so,  
Aware of all my situations,  
When I stay up late,  
He's always with me,  
What I feel when I hesitate,  
Oh I'm so worried about my love,  
They say "No, No it won't last forever",  
And here I am again my girl,  
Wondering what on earth I am doing here,  
Maybe he doesn't love me,  
I just took a trip on my love for him.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes

Oh she move like the Diva do  
I said "I'd love to dance like you"  
She said "just take off my red shoes  
Put them on and your dream'll come true  
With no words, with no song  
You can dance the dream with your body on  
And this curve, is your smile  
And this cross, is your heart  
And this line, is your path  
  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But it's gonna be no illusion  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But it's gonna be really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya"  
  
Oh the minute I put them on  
I knew I had done something wrong  
All her gifts for the dance had gone  
It's the red shoes, they can't stop dancing  
And this curve, is your smile  
And this cross, is your heart  
And this line, is your path  
  
"Oh it's gonna be the way you always thought it would be  
But it's gonna be no illusion  
Oh it's gonna be the way you always dreamt about it  
But it's gonna be really happening to ya"  
  
She gotta dance, she gotta dance  
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off  
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo  
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off  
  
Feel your hair come tumbling down  
Feel your feet start kissing the ground  
Feel your arms are opening out  
And see your eyes are lifted to God  
With no words, with no song  
I'm gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
I'm gonna dance the dream  
And make the dream come true  
  
She gotta dance, she gotta dance  
And she can't stop 'till them shoes come off  
These shoes do, a kind of voodoo  
They're gonna make her dance 'till her legs fall off  
Call a doctor, call a priest  
They're gonna whip her up like a helicopter  
  
Really happening to ya  
Really happening to ya  
  
You gotta dance

Mmh, yes,  
  
Then I'd taken the kiss of seedcake back from his mouth  
Going deep South, go down, mmh, yes,  
Took six big wheels and rolled our bodies  
Off of Howth Head and into the flesh, mmh, yes,  
  
He said I was a flower of the mountain, yes,  
But now I've powers o'er a woman's body, yes.  
  
Stepping out of the page into the sensual world.  
Stepping out...  
  
To where the water and the earth caress  
And the down of a peach says mmh, yes,  
Do I look for those millionaires  
Like a Machiavellian girl would  
When I could wear a sunset? mmh, yes,  
  
And how we'd wished to live in the sensual world  
You don't need words--just one kiss, then another.  
  
Stepping out of the page into the sensual world  
Stepping out, off the page, into the sensual world.  
  
And then our arrows of desire rewrite the speech, mmh, yes,  
And then he whispered would I, mmh, yes,  
Be safe, mmh, yes, from mountain flowers?  
And at first with the charm around him, mmh, yes,  
He loosened it so if it slipped between my breasts  
He'd rescue it, mmh, yes,  
And his spark took life in my hand and, mmh, yes,  
I said, mmh, yes,  
But not yet, mmh, yes,  
Mmh, yes.  

The song of Solomon  
The song of everyone  
Who walks the path  
Of the solitary heart  
The soul cries out  
Hear a woman singing  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't want your bullshit, yeah  
Just want your sexuality  
Don't want excuses, yeah  
Write me your poetry in motion  
Write it just for me, yeah  
And sign it with a kiss  
  
Just take any line  
"Comfort me with apples  
For I am sick of love  
His left hand is under my head  
And his right hand  
Doth embrace me"  
This is the Song of Solomon  
Here's a woman singing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll do it for you  
I'll be the Rose of Sharon for you  
I'll do it for you  
I'll be the Lily of the Valley for you  
I'll do it for you  
I'll be Isolde or Marion for you  
I'll do it for you  
Ooh I'll come in a hurricane for you  
I'll do it for you  
  
Don't want your bullshit  
Just want your sexuality

Okay, remember  
Okay, remember  
That we have just allowed  
Half an hour  
To get in, do it, and get out  
  
The sense of adventure  
Is changing to danger  
The signal has been given  
I go in  
The crime begins  
My excitement  
Turns into fright  
  
All my words fade  
What am I gonna say?  
Mustn't give the game away  
  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
  
We got the job sussed  
This shop's shut for business  
The lookout has parked the car  
But kept the engine running  
Three beeps means trouble's coming  
  
I hope you remember  
To treat the gelignite tenderly for me  
I'm having dreams about things  
Not going right  
Let's leave in plenty of time tonight  
  
Both my partners  
Act like actors  
You are Bogart  
He is George Raft  
That leaves Cagney and me  
(What about Edward G.?)  
  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
We're waiting  
  
You blow the safe up  
Then all I know is I wake up  
Covered in rubble  
One of the rabble needs mummy  
(What's all this then?)  
The government will never find the money  
(What's all this then?)  
  
I've been here all day  
A star in strange ways  
Apart from a photograph  
They'll get nothing from me  
Not until they let me see my solicitor  
  
Oh, I remember  
That rich, windy weather  
When you would carry me  
Pockets floating  
In the breeze  
  
Oh, there goes a tenner  
Hey look! There's a fiver  
There's a ten-shilling note  
Remember them?  
That's when we used to vote for him

Pray God you can cope.  
I stand outside this woman's work,  
This woman's world.  
Ooh, it's hard on the man,  
Now his part is over.  
Now starts the craft of the father.  
  
I know you have a little life in you yet.  
I know you have a lot of strength left.  
I know you have a little life in you yet.  
I know you have a lot of strength left.  
  
I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.  
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking  
  
Of all the things I should've said,  
That I never said.  
All the things we should've done,  
That we never did.  
All the things I should've given,  
But I didn't.  
  
Oh, darling, make it go,  
Make it go away.  
  
Give me these moments back.  
Give them back to me.  
Give me that little kiss.  
Give me your hand.  
  
(I know you have a little life in you yet.  
I know you have a lot of strength left.  
I know you have a little life in you yet.  
I know you have a lot of strength left.)  
  
I should be crying, but I just can't let it show.  
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking  
  
Of all the things we should've said,  
That we never said.  
All the things we should've done,  
That we never did.  
All the things that you needed from me.  
All the things that you wanted for me.  
All the things that I should've given,  
But I didn't.  
  
Oh, darling, make it go away.  
Just make it go away now.

One more step to the top of the city  
Where just a couple of pigeons are living  
Up on the angel's shoulders  
  
I don't know if I'm closer to Heaven but  
It looks like Hell down there  
These streets have never been paved with gold  
Welcome to the loneliest city in the world  
It's no good for you baby  
It's no good for you now  
Keep looking up for the ladder  
  
I don't know if you'll love me for it  
But I don't think we should suffer this  
There's just one thing we can do about it  
  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
See how that building there is nearly built  
There's a big fire over on the north of the city  
I see you walking down the street with her  
I see your lights going on and off  
She's no good for you baby  
She's no good for you now  
Look I'm here with the ladder  
  
I don't know if you love me or not  
But I don't think we should ever suffer  
There's just one thing we can do about this  
  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Up to the highest point of the city  
One more step to the top of the city  
Put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
And I don't mind if it's dangerous  
I don't mind if it's raining  
Take me to the top of the city  
  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
Take me to the top of the city  
Mmm yes, one more step to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders

[Chorus 1]  
One more step to the top of the city  
Where just a couple of pigeons are living  
Up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 1]  
I don't know if I'm closer to Heaven but  
It looks like Hell down there  
These streets have never been paved with gold  
Welcome to the loneliest city in the world  
  
[Bridge 1]  
It's no good for you baby  
It's no good for you now  
Keep looking up for the ladder  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't know if you'll love me for it  
But I don't think we should suffer this  
There's just one thing we can do about it  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 3]  
See how that building there is nearly built  
There's a big fire over on the north of the city  
I see you walking down the street with her  
I see your lights going on and off  
  
[Bridge 2]  
She's no good for you baby  
She's no good for you now  
Look I'm here with the ladder  
  
[Verse 4]  
I don't know if you love me or not  
But I don't think we should ever suffer  
There's just one thing we can do about this  
  
[Chorus 4]  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Up to the highest point of the city  
One more step to the top of the city  
Put me up on the angel's shoulders  
  
[Verse 5]  
And I don't mind if it's dangerous  
I don't mind if it's raining  
Take me up to the top of the city  
  
[Chorus 5]  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders  
Take me up to the top of the city  
Mmm yes, one more step to the top of the city  
And put me up on the angel's shoulders

It's wonderful  
Everywhere, so white  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me skating fast  
I'm speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice,  
Cotting out, little lines in the ice  
Splitting, splitting sound,  
Silver heels spitting, spitting snow.  
  
("Sonar says ? deep ?")  
  
There's something moving under  
Under the ice moving  
Under ice through water  
Trying to  
"It's me."  
Get out of the cold water  
"It's me."  
Something,  
"It's me."  
Someone, help them  
  
Wake up

[Verse 1: All]  
It's wonderful  
Everywhere, so white  
  
[Verse 2: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me  
Skating fast  
  
[Verse 3: Chorus]  
I'm speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice  
Cutting out  
Little lines  
In the ice  
  
[Verse 4: Chorus]  
Splitting, splitting sound  
Silver heels  
Spitting, spitting snow  
  
[Verse 5: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
There's something moving under  
Under the ice  
Moving under ice  
Through water  
Trying to ("It's me") get out of the cold water  
("It's me.")  
Something ("It's me!")  
Someone - help them!  
  
[Outro: Kate Bush]  
Oh..!  
No..!

Four strings across the bridge,  
Ready to carry me over,  
Over the quavers, drunk in the bars,  
Out of the realm of the orchestra,  
Out of the realm of the orchestra.  
  
Filling me up with the shivers.  
Filling me up with the shivers and quivers.  
Filling me up with the shivers.  
  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!  
  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!  
  
Paganini up on the chimney,  
Lord of the dance,  
With Nero and old Nicky.  
Whack that devil  
Into my fiddlestick!  
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s,  
Give me the Banshees for B.V.s.  
  
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny.  
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-dee.  
Jigging along with the fiddle, oh, Johnny.  
Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Get the bow going!  
Let it scream to me:  
Violin! Violin! Violin!

Can't move my arms,  
Can't move my legs.  
Can't say no,  
I can't say yes.  
Can't help myself.  
I need your help.  
  
(We go)  
"Oh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We're calling out for Middle Street.  
  
"Oh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We hang on to every line,  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
  
He thought he was gonna die,  
But he didn't.  
She thought she just couldn't cope,  
But she did.  
We thought it would be so hard,  
But it wasn't  
It wasn't easy, though!  
  
Can't say yes,  
I can't say no.  
Can't begin,  
Can't let go  
Help me now.  
  
(We go)  
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We're calling out for Middle Street.  
  
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We hang on to every line,  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
  
He thought he was gonna die,  
But he didn't.  
She thought she could never cope,  
But she did.  
We thought it was all over,  
But it wasn't...  
It hadn't started yet.  
  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
Calling out for Middle Street.  
Calling out for Middle Street,  
Walking straight down the middle of it.

Be-side to "December Will Be Magic Again" single  
Written by Kate Bush  
Warm and soothing,  
That's how I remember home.  
Walking into arms  
Through the back door.  
Hearing voices I know well,  
And long for.  
Cold and boozy,  
Our holiday in the Alps.  
Sitting in the lobby,  
Mostly smoking.  
Choking on the woozy afternoon.  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,  
My darling.  
Abrupt, too moody,  
You making our party list.  
I remember sulking  
On the sofa.  
For most of the winter  
We were strangers.  
Just one more  
To ease the ache,  
Before the night takes me.  
When you stay asleep  
On your side of the bed,  
Don't look at me,  
Don't look at you...  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,  
  
  

("What's that?")  
("It's four, five, six, seven")  
  
You can't hear me.  
You can't hear me.  
You can't hear what I'm saying.  
You can't hear what I'm saying to you.  
  
You watch the clock  
Move the slow hand.  
I should have been home  
Hours ago,  
But I'm not here.  
But I'm not here.  
  
You can't hear me.  
You can't hear me.  
You can't feel me  
Here in the room with you now.  
You can't hear what I'm saying.  
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?  
  
Can't let you know  
What's been happening.  
There's a ghost in our home,  
Just watching you without me.  
I'm not here.  
("You don't hear me.") [backwards]  
But I'm not here.  
(You can't hear me.)  
But I'm not here.  
(You don't hear what I'm saying.)  
  
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,  
Let me ?"  
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,  
Let me ?"  
"Don't ignore, don't ignore me,  
Let me ?"  
  
"We see you here." [Repeat: x8]  
  
You don't hear me come in.  
"Help me, baby! Help me, baby! Talk to me! Listen to me,  
Listen to me! Talk to me! Help"  
("You can't hear me.")  
"Listen, baby! Listen to me, baby! Help me, help me, baby!  
Talk to me! Talk to me! Please, baby, talk to me!"  
("You can't hear me.")  
You won't hear me leaving.

Destiny took me in her arms and told me:  
"You're a little lost on the fall.  
You fall for all the men  
You shouldn't fall for all at all. "  
Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on,  
Well, I'm a fool.  
  
Climbing up the ladders  
To slide down the adders  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks...  
  
Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,  
A burning sword.  
I'd like to cry.  
I look into her eyes.  
I see she's seen the long days and night.  
"Ooh," she says,  
"The games are still the same, I see,  
But they've changed the names now.  
Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart? "  
  
Lionhearts in the asylums,  
Lionhearts tossed at sea,  
Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.  
Lionhearts in cathedrals,  
Lionhearts at mournings,  
Lionhearts in every seed  
But they're sown  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks,  
On the rocks...  
  
Somebody I couldn't see  
Tied me up and put me away,  
Here on the rocks,  
Here on the rocks,  
Here on the rocks...

I stayed the night in your arms.  
Over half an hour I stayed awake,  
Looking at you.  
Your face seemed radiant,  
The walls to Steve  
With a crack emerged  
As I held you.  
Oo-ooh...  
While na-na ne-ne-na ne-na-na Davy dozed.  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go.  
Hold me, oh hold me.  
Davy, Davy,  
Bending like a willow-branch.  
He rocks me like a baby.  
Oo-ooh...  
I know he loves another lady,  
But I still see him in the hallway  
Calling me.  
Oh, when we danced so closely,  
I really felt as though I was melting  
In a pool.  
Oo-ooh...  
Oh while na-na na-na na-na-na Davy dozed.  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go.  
Hold me, please hold me.  
Davy, Davy,  
Bending like a willow-branch.  
He rocks me like a baby.  
Oo-ooh...

This chapter says  
"Put it out of your mind"  
Give it time  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The "L" of the lips are open  
To the "O" of the host  
The "V" of the velvet  
  
Of all of the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
There's just something 'bout you  
There's just something 'bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
  
Have you ever seen a picture  
Of Jesus laughing?  
Mmm, do you think  
He had a beautiful smile?  
A smile that healed  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
There's just something 'bout you  
There's just something 'bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The "L" of the lips are open  
The "O" of the host  
The "V" of the velvet  
The "E" of my eye  
The eye in wonder  
The eye that sees  
The "I" that loves you  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you?

Emily  
  
We're all alone on the stage tonight.  
We've been told we're not afraid of you.  
We know all our lines so well, uh-huh.  
We've said them so many times:  
Time and time again,  
Line and line again.  
  
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!  
We think you're incredible.  
You say we're fantastic,  
But still we don't head the bill.  
  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
  
When the actor reaches his death,  
You know it's not for real. He just holds his breath.  
But he always dives too soon, too fast to save himself.  
  
He'll never make the screen.  
He'll never make the 'Sweeney',  
Be that movie queen.  
He's too busy hitting the Vaseline.  
  
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!  
We think you are really cool.  
We'd give you a part, my love,  
But you'd have to play the fool.  
  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
  
We're all alone on the stage tonight.  
We're all alone,  
On the stage,  
Tonight.

Out on the wiley, windy moors  
We'd roll and fall in green.  
You had a temper like my jealousy:  
Too hot, too greedy.  
How could you leave me,  
When I needed to possess you?  
I hated you. I loved you, too.  
  
Bad dreams in the night.  
They told me I was going to lose the fight,  
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering  
Wuthering Heights.  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,  
On the other side from you.  
I pine a lot. I find the lot  
Falls through without you.  
I'm coming back, love.  
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream,  
My only master.  
  
Too long I roam in the night.  
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.  
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,  
Wuthering Heights,  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Ooh! Let me have it.  
Let me grab your soul away.  
Ooh! Let me have it.  
Let me grab your soul away.  
You know it's me Cathy!  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!  
Let me in-a-your window.  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, your Cathy.  
I've come home. I'm so cold!

Were the star  
When there was no one,  
You were in the sky  
And I was nowhere to be seen.  
  
You have fallen, oh my star  
And you have lost your faith,  
And tomorrow means the same to me,  
To all.  
  
Nevermind  
For tomorrow  
Will be  
Half a genius shining  
  
You were the star  
When there was no one,  
You were in the sky  
And I was nowhere to be seen.  
  
Now you have fallen, oh my star  
And you have lost your faith  
And tomorrow means the same to me,  
To you,  
To all.  
  
Nevermind  
For tomorrow  
Will be  
Half a genius shining  
Half a genius shining

It's alright I'll come 'round when you're not in  
And I'll pick up all my things  
Everything I have bought with you  
But that's alright too  
It's just everything I do  
We did together  
And there's a little piece of you  
In whatever  
I've got everything I need  
I've got petrol in the car  
I've got some money with me  
There's just one problem  
  
You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]  
  
It's alright I know where I'm going  
I'm going to stay with my friend  
Yes, he's very good looking  
The only trouble is  
He's not you  
He can't do what you do  
He can't make me laugh and cry  
At the same time  
Let's change things  
Let's danger it up  
We're crazy enough  
I just can't take it  
  
You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]  
  
I know where I'm going  
But I don't want to leave  
I just have one problem  
We're best friends, yeah?  
We tied ourselves in knots  
Doing cartwheels 'cross the floor  
Just forget it alright  
  
Sugar?  
Honey?  
Sugar?
