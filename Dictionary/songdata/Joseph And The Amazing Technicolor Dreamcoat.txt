Joseph:  
Close every door to me  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
Do what you want with me  
Hate me and laugh at me  
Darken my daytime  
And torture my night  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers  
Lie far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel are never alone  
For I know I shall find  
My own peace of mind  
For I have been promised  
A land of my own  
  
Choir:

Joseph:  
Just give me a number  
Instead of my name  
Forget all about me  
And let me decay  
  
I do not matter  
I'm only one person  
Destroy me completely  
Then throw me away  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers  
Lie far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
For we know we shall find  
Our own piece of mind  
For we have been promised  
A land of our own

Pharaoh he was a powerful man.  
With the ancient world in the palm of his hands.  
To all intents and purposes he,  
Was Egypt with a capital E.  
Whatever he did, he was showered with praise.  
If he cracked a joke, than you chortled for days.  
No one had rights or a vote but the king,  
Infact you might say he was fairly right wing.  
When pharoh's around, than you got down, on the ground.  
If you ever find yourself near ramases, get down on your knees.  
  
A pharoh story, a pharoh story.  
A pharoh story, a pharoh story.  
  
Down at the other end of the scale,  
Joseph is still spending time in jail.  
For even though he's in with the guards,  
A lifetime in prison seems quite in the cards.  
If my analysis of the position is right,  
At the end of the tunnel is a glimmer of light.  
Because of all sudden there's been visions and things.  
Disturbing the peace of both peasants and kings.  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.  
And a man who can interpret could go far,  
Could become a star.  
  
Could be famous, could be a big success,  
Could be famous, could be a big success.  
  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.

[During the Could be famous...]A Star....  
  
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams.  
And a man who can interpret could go far,  
Could become a star.  
  
Could be famous, could be a big success,  
Could be famous, could be a big success.

Narrator:  
Potiphar had very few cares.  
He was one of Egypts millionaires.  
Having made a fortune buying shares  
In  
  
Potiphar:  
pyramids.  
  
Narrator:  
Potiphar had made a huge pile.  
Owned a large percentage of the Nile.  
Meant that he could really live in style  
And he did.  
  
Joseph was an uniportant  
Slave who found he liked his master,  
Consequently worked much harder,  
Even with devotion.  
Potiphar could see that Joseph  
Was a cut above the average  
Made him leader of the household,  
Maximum promotion.  
  
Potiphar was cool and so fine,  
  
Potiphar:  
But my wife would never tow the line.  
  
Narrator:  
It's all there in chapter thirty-nine of  
Genesis.  
She was beautiful but  
  
Potiphar's wife:  
evil.  
  
Narrator:  
Saw a lot of men against his will.  
He would have to tell her  
That she still was his.  
  
Joseph's looks and handsome figure  
Had attracted her attention  
Ev'ry morning she would beckon  
  
Potiphar's wife:  
"Come and lie with me, love."  
  
Narrator:  
Joseph wanted to resist her  
'Till one day she proved too eager.  
Joseph cried in vain,  
  
Joseph:  
"Please stop! I don't believe in free love!"  
  
Narrator:  
Potiphar was counting shekels  
In his den below the bedroom  
When he heard a mighty rumpus  
Clattering above him.  
Suddenly he knew his riches  
Couldn't buy him what he wanted  
Gold would never make him happy  
If she didn't love him.  
  
Letting out a mighty roar,  
Potiphar burst through the door  
  
Potiphar:  
Joseph, I'll see you rot in jail.  
The thing you have done are beyond the pale.  
  
Narrator:  
Poor, poor Joseph, locked up in a cell.  
Things aren't going well, hey,  
Locked up in a cell.  
  
Poor poor joseph  
Locked up in a cell  
Things aren't going well, hey,  
Locked up in a cell  
  
Locked up  
In a cell

Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do,  
Before their time on this planet is through.  
Some just don't have anything planned,  
They hide their hopes and theirs heads in the sand.  
  
Now I don't say who is wrong who is right,  
But if by chance you are here for the night.  
Then all I need is an hour or two to tell the tale of a dreamer like you.  
  
We all dream alot.  
Some are lucky, some are not.  
But if you think it, want it, dream it,  
Then it's real.  
You are what you feel.  
  
But all that I say,  
Can be told another way.  
In the story of a boy who's dreams came true.  
And he could be you.

Sluit alle deuren maar  
Doof alle sterren maar  
Demp elk geluid  
En verduister het licht  
  
En ik lijd zonder bitterheid  
Een dag of een eeuwigheid  
Ik vraag niet om antwoord  
Niet hier niet vandaag  
  
Geef mij dan een nummer  
In plaats van mijn naam  
Ontken mij, vergeet mij  
Ik heb niet bestaan  
  
En ik lijd zonder bitterheid  
Een dag of een eeuwigheid  
Ik vraag niet om antwoord  
Niet hier niet vandaag  
  
Sloop al mijn dromen maar  
Steel mijn geliefden maar  
Kinderen van Israel  
Zijn nooit alleen  
  
En de wanhoop nabij,  
Zal ik sterk zijn en vrij  
Want mij is een land beloofd  
En daar ga ik heen

Narrator  
  
So back in Canaan the future looked rough  
Jacob's family were finding it tough  
Brothers  
  
For the famine has caught us unprepared  
We are thin  
We are ill  
We are getting scared  
It's enough to make anyone weep  
We are down to our very last sheep  
Reuben  
  
We will starve if we hang around here  
Zebulun  
  
But in Egypt there's food going spare  
Asher  
  
They've got corn  
They've got meat  
They've got fruit and drinks  
Dan  
  
And if we have the time  
We could see the Sphinx  
Narrator  
  
So they finally decided to go  
Off to Egypt to see brother Jo  
So they all lay before  
Joseph's feet  
  
Brothers  
  
Mighty prince, give us something to eat  
Narrator  
  
Joseph found it a strain  
Not to laugh because  
Not a brother among them  
Knew who he was  
Joseph  
  
I shall now take them all for a ride  
After all they have tried fratricide

Simeon  
  
Do you remember the good years in Canaan?  
The summers were endlessly gold  
The fields were a patchwork of clover  
The winters were never too cold  
We'd stroll down the boulevards together  
And averything round us was fine  
Jacob  
  
Now the fileds are dead and bare  
No joie de vivre anywhere  
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days  
Simeon  
  
Do you remember those wonderful parties?  
The splendour of Canaan's cuisine  
Our extravagant, elegant soirees  
The gayest the Bible has seen  
It's funny but since we lost Joseph  
We've gone to the other extreme  
No-one comes to dinner now  
We only eat them anyhow  
I even find I'm missing Joseph's dreams  
  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days  
Simeon  
  
It's funny but since we lost Joseph  
We've gone to the other extreme  
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad  
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad  
And how we miss his entertaining dreams  
Brothers  
  
Those Canaan days we used to know  
Where have they gone, where did they go?  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
Simeon  
  
To those Canaan days  
Brothers  
  
Eh bien, raise your berets  
To those Canaan days
