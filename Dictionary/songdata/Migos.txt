She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me  
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping (Huh?)  
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double  
Told that bitch, "Pour your own muddy trouble"  
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)  
Shawty broke down and start telling her business  
I said to lil' mama, "You tripping

She moaning and making them sounds  
She came while she sucking me now  
I'm looking at her like damn  
Hannah making them go bananas  
She fucking and sucking on camera  
Pop a handle, she got stamina  
My Jag ceiling panorama  
I'm beating the pussy like Michael  
I call her Dirty Diana  
  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
I got molly, I got white  
I got molly, I got white  
I been trapping, trapping, trapping  
Trapping all damn night  
  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana  
I got molly, I got white  
I got molly, I got white  
I been trapping, trapping, trapping  
Trapping all damn night  
Hannah Montana

You see the light?  
Yeah, we in the pit(cra, cra)  
That's why young niggas  
Still kicking dough  
And some of my niggas convicted  
Money,(money, money)  
Power, respect  
Guess I'm addicted,  
Money, power and munition,  
Guess I'm addicted  
  
A date that took the moneyman  
Cause I don't know plus fo' hundred babes  
Making a flip like it's gymnastics  
Hot wheelin', hands stacking  
Callin' my spatula acrobat  
Turnin' a brick to a platinum plat  
You pussy, I double that fish scale  
My pockets are deeper than waterware  
Pluck on the border, I got shizz on the water  
Definite prison, blew the whale  
All nigga checking somethin'  
While hustle my Emi, I ain't kickin' shit  
With it, you hot on the webcam, I'm Peter Parker  
Twelve crest smoking Linkin Park babe  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Money on the table  
You seeing the label?  
Not tellin' no fables  
In time here like a nigga  
In school doing time tables  
Shopping got flavors  
Bend on no cable  
Traveling country to country  
Skipping, unstable  
I'm whipping miss Mable  
Whip, whip, eat, look out,  
The spider, skeet well, velvet Sneider  
Hit my brother Duke  
That's my la ridda(pah, cra)  
Boy, you impostor  
Check your pocket!  
We don't rock with coppers  
Street west side talkin'  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Can see the label?  
Money we making  
Without a major  
If I ain't no cut  
I ain't selling my soul  
Cause everything glitter  
Ain't gold  
Double D tell me don't fall  
The water so cold,  
Your butler gon'get you your phone  
Jump in the black, you do not belong  
Dozen my gibble, they talkin' gibble  
Drop the cocaine-o, no trap the trail  
Adversaries call me the Advocator  
Come in the truck like the Terminator  
They tumple the mac in the elevator  
Money passing ammunition  
Me flip a Rover in a kitchen  
Another thing made us ridiculous  
Can't you see we in the business?  
  
[Hook:]  
  
Solid foundation(solid foundation?)  
Could see the label  
Under rotation, keep guarding your pray  
That's a milli hot  
In that space Coupe that you lookin' at  
Got shit on in Aspen, stopping traffic  
I'm a space cadet  
Time for nothing, took a lot of shit  
Jab bout my reserve  
Ammunition  
We got penny, F in this, we can't retain it  
Baby chopper, baby chopper  
Feel it longer than a towel  
I ain't never been a lame nigga  
Bitch never called me Roger

(Hook: Takeoff)  
Two cups filled up with easter pink  
Take a minute, rest in peace, to pimp C  
Double G, Louis V all over me  
Take a minute, rest in peace, og Dee  
Two cups filled up with easter pink  
Take a minute, R.I.P, to pimp C  
Double G, Louis V all over me

(Verse 1: Takeoff)  
Two cups filled up with actavis  
Damn! Rest in peace, to pimp C  
Louis V all over me I'm living luxury  
Take a minute, rest in peace, og Dee  
I remember the last time when double talked to me  
Told me y'all the hottest niggas in the street  
He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry  
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency  
So I go buy a pint of lean  
I'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me  
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me  
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!

[Verse 2: Quavo)  
Lost my daddy, young nigga I was only four  
Damn! Now I gotta pour a four  
Got my momma on my back, she really love me though  
Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door  
I understand I have committed a sin  
Double Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win  
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible  
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle  
Never know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some
disciples, gone!

I'm a dog, she a dog too  
If he a shooter, I'm a shooter too  
I'm a trap nigga, who are you?  
Is you mad, cause I'm flexing all on you?  
Who the hell? [x3]  
Got me fucked up

[Verse 1: Quavo]  
Bitch

Man the whole crew  
I'm a fucking fool if I put cuffs on you  
Who the hell?  
Bet he got trap spots  
No bandos, and I can't tell...  
Who the hell say I ain't whipping a bale?

And running from 12  
Fish scales  
Pockets deep like water wells

[Verse 2: Offset]  
I got bombs no Osama  
President rollie, Obama  
Forty pornos  
You can see my diamonds  
From cross the corner  
Death before dishonor  
Middle finger, fuck the your honor  
Concrete jungle  
If you fumble  
Eat you up like piranhas  
Who the hell?  
Said I won't pull out that chopper  
And aim it at your turtle shell  
I know that you snitching  
You a informant for 12  
My niggas they trained to kill  
We got bananas  
You know they gone peel
