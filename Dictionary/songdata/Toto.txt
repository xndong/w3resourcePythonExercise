99  
I've been waiting so long  
Oh, 99  
Where did we go wrong  
Oh, 99  
I love you  
  
99  
I keep breaking your heart  
Oh, 99  
How can we be apart  
Oh, 99  
I love you  
  
I never thought it would happen  
I feel quite the same  
I don't want to hurt you anymore  
I never knew it would work out  
No one to blame  
You know I love you 99  
  
99  
You keep holding my hand  
Oh, 99  
They don't know who I am  
  
99  
I can't take it no more  
Oh, 99  
Oh we were so sure  
Oh, 99  
I love you

I don't want to know the reason why you don't love me  
I don't want to know the reason why you don't care  
I don't want to know the reason why you're leaving me  
I'm not the only one that lost my love way down there - way down there  
  
I don't want to hear the reason why you don't need me  
I don't want to hear the reason why you don't stay  
I don't want to hear the reason why you're seeing him  
All I know is that I want you back, but you're  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A million miles away and it's killing me inside  
There's a stranger in a carriage and he's taking her out tonight  
The devil's riding on a full moon and he sends his love  
When I'm a million miles away  
  
I don't want to be the reason why you don't love me  
And I don't want to be the reason why you don't care  
I don't want to be the reason why you're leaving me  
I'm not the only one that lost my love  
  
He sends his love and I'm a hundred million miles away

You stole my heart the moment you came to town  
I said hello but you were gone when I turned around  
You can't get away, can't get away, even if you try now  
I want to tell you but the words just can't be found  
  
I like the way you move and just the way you are  
I can't take anymore, 'cause girl, you're pushin' too hard  
You can't get away, can't let you go, what's a boy to do now  
You got me askin' myself how I survived this far  
  
[Chorus:]  
I gotta get away from you, girl  
'Cause I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you  
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do  
Never been afraid of, never been afraid of love 'til I met you  
Ooh, yes you say  
  
Can't be something that you never ever had  
When I stop and think about you, it makes me laugh  
You took me by surprise, I saw it in your eyes, I never had a chance, girl  
Now that I see what you are, it doesn't hurt so bad  
  
[Chorus]

I hear the drums echoing tonight  
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation  
She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight  
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation  
I stopped an old man along the way  
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies  
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"  
  
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  
  
The wild dogs cry out in the night  
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company  
I know that I must do what's right  
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti  
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become  
  
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  
  
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you  
  
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
(I bless the rain)  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
(I bless the rain)  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
(Ah, gonna take the time)  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

All us boys like to drink and smoke  
Pull off a joke  
Blow your minds and leave  
Hot tires behind  
  
All us boys like to fight and kick  
Carry a stick  
We're getting older  
And acting bolder  
  
[Chorus]  
Mothers tell your daughters  
To stay away from rock and roll  
'Cause it may entice them  
And mesmerize them  
Even satisfy their soul  
  
I'm sure mama told you 'bout making love  
And the skies above  
With its fallen angels  
Diet pills  
Female thrills  
But mama never told you 'bout  
All us boys  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All us boys just want to play  
All us boys won't run away

Uncanny woman  
You weaved your spell on me  
I was taken by the look in your eyes  
For all the wrong reasons  
You must have been a spiteful child  
Full of anger  
Raised by the hand of a duchess, a mother and a heathen  
  
You laid your tender trap of crystals and wine  
Your neck was sweetly laced with a scent I did not mind  
  
I can't lie  
I can't lie  
I can't lie  
Angel don't cry  
Angel don't cry  
  
Queen of darkness  
You got your way with me  
You caressed ev'ry part of me soul  
You got what you were after  
A savage and an angel  
You innocently hunger for love  
Still shivering from the coldness of you laughter  
  
You laid your tender trap of crystals and wine  
Your neck was sweetly laced with a scent I did not mind  
  
I can't lie  
I can't lie  
I can't lie  
Angel don't cry  
Angel don't cry  
No, angel don't cry  
Angel don't cry  
No, no, no

I never felt like this with someone, I never knew I could feel this way at all  
Predestination by appointment, storybook realities are coming true  
I was scared, you look so helpless, the lust was dressed in good disguise  
  
I took you on to meet my mother  
Just like me, she fell straight in love with you  
You took me to your own apartment, was it me or does the night do things to
you  
You read from Venus and Adonis, so honey how could I resist  
  
C'mon baby we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fights  
I lift you up, never let you down  
I'll be the jester, babe, and you'll be the crown  
We're instinctively impulsive, we're animals  
  
A body like yours should be arrested, honey I should be locked up in a cage  
We are flesh, we are carnal cut, oh we are human  
Oh babe got these eyes we can't contend  
Smoke alarm is going off again, I guess I'm gonna have to cool you down  
  
Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight  
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Instinctively impulsive, we're animals  
  
Some girls may turn me up, but only you, baby, turn me on  
When we touch it's so explosive, it seems my life's been leading to this  
  
Say come on baby, we've got tonight, no one loses when two tigers fight  
You'll be fire, I'll be the ice, so come on baby melt me ooh so nice  
Is it rhythm, is it magic, we're animals  
Ooh baby, we're animals.

Where are the children we lost not long ago  
Feel for the Mothers who weep for them  
I pray for the Fathers who are standing by their side  
In their world of pain and suffering  
  
Have you ever seen the look in a hungry child's eyes  
They can't eat money or promises  
Give them your smile and try holding out your hand  
Let them know you're there, let them know you're there  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Why is it always the ones that we love  
Are the ones that will never come home  
Why must all of the bridges we cross take their toll  
Always remember the voice in your head  
Speaks to you when you're alone  
And it comforts you  
From the top of your heart to the bottom of your soul  
  
You can swim in a river of tears they cry  
For they sleep on the winds of uncertainty  
Show us a sign and make us believe again  
There's no other way, oh, there's no other way

You tell me there's an angel in your tree  
Did he say he'd come to call on me  
For things are getting desperate in our home  
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know  
  
Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside  
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If we're gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky  
  
Burn down the mission  
Burn it down to stay alive  
It's our only chance of living  
Take all you need to live inside  
  
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today  
My wife cried when they came to take me away  
But what more could I do just to keep her warm  
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls  
  
Bring your family down to the riverside  
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If we're gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky  
  
Burn down the mission  
Burn it down to stay alive  
It's our only chance of living  
Take all you need to live inside

Standin' on thin ice  
Walkin' on a fine line  
Never seem to buy, enough for you  
If you're lookin' for a way out  
Then you're headed for the right place  
Givin' up is something I can't do  
  
Ooh you got sharp claws  
Always got your back up  
Venom in your eyes, and blood so blue  
Hangin' on a black tie  
Sippin' on a half shell  
Holdin' all the cards, and a joker too  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now you're driving me crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stand it any longer  
When you pay the price for freedom  
It ain't wrong girl  
I can't stand it any longer  
  
Dancin' on hot coals  
Playin' with a live wire  
Sneakin' out the back door, you're so cool  
If you really want to move on  
Then there's nothing left to say  
Here's a ticket for the bus stop  
I'm no fool  
  
You should have told me sooner  
I would have let you go  
Now you're driving me crazy  
  
[Chorus]

Last night she ran away  
Left a letter by the telephone  
She didn't take the time to say goodbye  
He knows he has to find her  
Find a way to make her come back home  
She stretched her wings and learned to fly  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He calls but there's no answer  
Operator, ring it one more time  
He thinks of her and shuts his eyes  
She wears the ring he gave her  
Something magic, and it once was mine  
Will she be thinking of him tonight?  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
  
He has to find her  
I really miss that girl  
He steals into the night  
He'll go mad without her  
I'm so mad about her  
  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care for me  
Carmen  
Carmen, don't you care  
Carmen, don't you care for me

What happened to me  
Oh it seems so long ago  
The cuts run deep  
But the scars still show  
  
I live in the shadows  
Where it's been so hard to grow  
I'm still a servant in a nobleman's robes  
  
You know my weakness girl you know my kind  
You helped me see when I was blind  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
Afraid of the hurricane  
I hide in my domain  
I need release from all this pain  
Please don't forsake me  
In these ruins of your home  
I can't wait forever  
Don't leave me alone  
  
I have a secret if you want to learn  
I will surrender in return  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
You know my weakness girl you know my kind  
You helped me see when I was blind  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance  
  
It's a crime to live my life without you  
Serve out my years in darkness  
Inside these walls I die without you  
And when I close my eyes  
I'm caught in the balance

There was a young girl  
Ridin' on the wind  
She had all of the answers  
Didn't need to pretend  
I remember she was the only friend I ever needed  
  
Now I wonder  
How to work it all out  
My hands are tremblin'  
I've got this feelin' now  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
Could this be love  
That I hear calling  
  
Got a fast education  
Holding you in tears  
Someone finally hurt you  
After all these years  
Got to get my message to you somehow  
  
Now you're lookin' in my eyes for courage  
Too late to think this through  
Baby  
There must be somethinbg we can do  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a bit of thunder  
Pounding in my heart  
A little uncertainty  
That's been there from the start  
Don't tell me all the look you gave  
Were the ones that I misread  
'Cause all I hear now  
Is a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus]

Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
Don't let them fool you, or even try to school you, oh! no  
We've got a mind of our own, so go to hell if what you're thinking is not
right  
Love would never leave us alone  
I say the darkness there must come out to light  
  
Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved  
  
Don't let them change you, or even rearrange you, oh! no  
We've got a life to live, they say only, only  
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive  
Stay alive  
  
Could you be loved and be loved, could you be loved and be loved  
  
You ain't gonna miss your water, until your well runs dry  
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved  
  
Say something, say something, say something  
Say something, say something, say something  
  
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved  
Could you be, could you be loved

You better wrap yourself around me  
It's a miracle that you've found me  
I can't fool myself any longer  
We're both willing, young and able  
Let's put our cards on the table  
This feelin's gettin' stronger  
I see the sunlit tears in your eyes again  
Now I realize  
Maybe it's the right time  
Oh, maybe you're the right one  
Ooh, and now I understand  
You could've slipped through my hands  
Well, I just can't wait anymore  
There's a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
You're the reason tonight our love is endless  
  
We better get ourselves together  
Before we hit bad weather  
And we can't go any further  
Won't you give me some affection  
Point me in the right direction  
This storm is blowin' harder  
Here comes that voice deep inside again  
And it says to me  
That maybe it's the right thing  
Oh, maybe you're the right one  
Ooh, and now I understand  
You could've slipped through my hands  
Well, I just can't wait anymore  
There's a chance we can make it  
We just gotta take it  
  
Endless are the nights  
I stay with you  
Endless are the dreams  
You made come true  
Forever in my arms  
You're the reason tonight our love is endless

What you're sayin' it never really crossed my mind  
I hear playin' and everybody's keepin' time  
I'm recallin' that girl I met in London town  
She was strange, young and tender and narrowed all my choices down  
  
[Chorus]  
We ran away into the night hypnotized  
You carved your name right next to mine, English Eyes  
  
I was tryin' to read her lips and knew the time was drawing near  
I forgot what she said but I remember how she whispered in my ear  
I can hear laughter coming from the places we once knew  
There were stories from a stranger out of nowhere but they seemed so true  
  
[Chorus]  
English eyes,  
English eyes  
  
Where are you  
When I call out your name?  
English eyes  
  
Red sky warning, girl you really put a spell on me  
Never told me 'bout the daddy you refused to please  
You took the bishop when the king was standing right in front of you  
There's nothing in it if I can't have a girl with eyes like you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
English Eyes, yeah,  
English Eyes,  
English Eyes

Feel the heat, in the street  
Find out what your people are sayin'  
  
Feel the heat, in the street  
Find out what the people are sayin'  
'Bout you! Yeh you  
  
Friends you keep, lie and cheat  
Makin' rules for games that they're playin'  
  
When you meet, on the street  
You find out all along they're playin'  
Me against you  
  
I don't care what they say about me  
I've heard that all before  
Just make this one exception  
Give me your affection  
Listen to your heart for what you need  
  
Feel the heat, in the street  
You're the one that keeps the boys dreamin'  
  
If you feel the need, come to me  
Or you may find what's on your mind  
May come true

It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you  
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Just think how long I've known you, it's long for me to own you, lock and key  
It's really not confusing, I'm just the young illusion, can't you see  
  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry  
  
It's not your situation, I just need contemplation over you  
I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love  
  
Not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only girl  
I'm not the only one that holds you, I never ever should have told you  
You're my only world  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry  
  
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie, kissed the girls and made them cry  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them high  
  
Georgy Porgy  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them high  
Georgy Porgy  
Kissed the girls and made them cry, kissed the girls and made them cry

It's a twelve o'clock depression, my mind is in recession  
And I can't answer you  
It's the day I can't remember, I think it's late September  
Or is it April blue  
  
I can't find peace of mind in a world so unkind  
It's just a little heart breaker, just a little heart breaker, yeah  
  
It's a sticky situation when I'm near hallucination, and I refuse to bow  
They used to think me funny when I promised them their money  
But they're not laughing now  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't find peace of mind, then she calls me just in time  
She's a gift with a golden gun, and she's got them on the run  
She's a gift with a golden gun, 'cause she knows what they've done  
  
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done  
What they've done, done, done, done, done  
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done

Well I'm out on the road, and the devil's got my soul  
And I'm looking for the Lord in New York City  
  
Yeah I'm out on the run, got some heat, got a gun  
If they don't find me soon, it'll be a damn pity  
  
So it's  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye  
It's so hard to see the truth with the sun in your eyes  
Goodbye girl, goodbye girl, girl goodbye  
Must be in the way that she cries, must be in the way that she cries  
Must be in the way that she cries  
  
Oh there's smoke in the air and there's blood everywhere  
But I'm hoping that the white man don't recognize me  
  
I'm so sorry what I've done, and I say it not in fun  
When I tell you that there's no one left inside me  
  
And it's  
  
So it's

I want to give her something she'll remember  
And she say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
I want to squeeze her tight and not offend her, yeah  
She said, "No, no, no, no, no"  
(And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter)  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
[Chorus]  
Seems as though you've got your way before  
You left me standing helpless just when I need more  
You broke my heart for the last time, you broke my heart for the last time  
You broke my heart for the last time, goodbye Elenore  
  
I tried to tell the boys all about her, yeah  
And they say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
They told me she was loose, no doubt about her  
Well I say, "No, no, no, no, no"  
(And he thought that she was coming back, but she wrote him a letter)  
Sealed it with a kiss and placed it in front of my door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Chorus You broke my heart for the last time, broke my heart, it's the last
time  
You stole my heart and now you're gone forevermore

Downtown Jimmy, say you're feeling kinda blue  
It's no problem, this is what you gotta do  
Telephone your baby, tell her that you're working late  
Come and pay a visit, please don't hesitate  
  
Come join the party, come along and be our guest  
Sit back and let us do the rest, we're the best, yeah  
  
Come on an' meet me at the station, don't pack your bags, just fix your hair  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta get out, just look for me, I'm always there  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train  
All aboard, now don't you be afraid  
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train  
Feed the fire, let's go one mo' time again  
  
Medication, little love and sympathy, cool libation, it's complimentary  
Play a little poker, love when the stakes are high  
Lotta nasty women, giving everyone the eye  
  
Say downtown Jimmy, tell me what you need, satisfaction guaranteed  
Guaranteed, yeah  
  
It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta pull out, happy shiny people everywhere  
  
It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta put out, happy shiny people everywhere

Got the eyes of a vulture  
As you gaze from your meaningless throne  
And the pain that you've been selling  
I'd rather die before I'd own  
  
I'll call you a doctor  
Or find you a priest  
'Cause no one can save you  
And you won't get no peace  
  
I've felt your displeasure  
And girl I used to relate  
So don't hand me no anger  
I'll be crushed by the weight  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Lord what's the cost of my fate  
  
She'll lay out wide open  
Like a surgical knife  
I've watched it take over  
What's left of your miserable life  
  
She'll live on deception  
Your pleasures long dead  
Your soul is left bleeding  
From the lies that you spread  
  
Don't pull on my collar  
I won't rise to debate  
Don't ask me for comfort  
You're a lifetime too late  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Lord what's the cost of my fate  
  
Oh, there's a storm overhead  
Will it ever end baby  
It's all inside your head  
Is it gonna end  
  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate  
Yeah, I hope I ain't asking too late  
That's the high price of hate  
That's the high price of hate

Morning's here  
I feel so far away  
It seems like I felt this before  
All alone  
Sun burns my skin  
I can't live with pain anymore  
And with you on my mind  
Thinking of all that we've said  
Were they just words  
We'll live to regret  
Why won't you stay?  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again  
  
Times have changed  
Is love at an end?  
What makes us wonder why?  
Rearranged  
Just pretend  
I can't stand the thought of goodbyes  
And with you on my mind  
Thinking of all that we've said  
Were they just words  
We'll live to regret  
Why won't you stay?  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again  
  
How does it feel  
To make me fall apart  
Could this be love  
Or just a broken heart  
How do you feel  
When you see me cryin' again

There was a man  
He walked around  
Searching for the girl who had just caught his eye  
"I was a fool!" he cried  
His mind had wandered  
He blinked and the sky moved e'er so slightly  
He searched the city and she was nowhere to be found  
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you want your freedom  
Do you want my love  
Do you want your freedom  
From the one you're thinking of  
  
There lies a lady  
Naked and yet not knowing  
A spell, it gains her heart forever  
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square  
Fell into an abyss of dead air  
Innocence caged in sanctuary  
There sat the Dragon Lord  
Playing solitary  
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly a voice was heard  
Ina a flash the brave young man appeared  
The Dragon will cut him with his tail  
Chased him to the stairway  
Caught him halfway to the top  
Sent him whirling down  
Fireball, summer solstice  
Dragon Lord descended down on him  
She turned to look but saw only darkness, silence  
  
[Chorus]

I was born in the land of the sun  
And the tall green grass  
And I don't understand  
How all this has come to pass  
  
How we've come to surround ourselves  
In a sea of thieves  
In a land without learning  
Only the fools believe  
  
I went driving last night  
On a dark canyon road  
Had the sky to myself  
But I wasn't alone  
  
Had the pain of my lifetime  
For my company  
How did it end up like this  
For you and me  
  
When love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
I will remember you  
  
As I open my eyes to one more day  
The wind burns my face  
As it whispers your name  
As it's pulling me forward  
  
It tears me free  
And the only thing left  
Is the tears for you and me  
  
'Cause when love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
I will remember you

I don't know if you'll understand  
But I'm hoping that you'll follow me down to the waterway  
I'll be there if you change your mind  
Listening to the ticking of the hands on a clock working overtime  
  
[Chorus]  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl I've seen your face
on every girl that I've held since you went away  
It's getting late and I have to know  
I'm mending the wings of a heart that was broken not so long ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If it's the last night it oughta be left for lovin', girl

I left you crying on that angry morning  
You know I lied  
I'll always run from anything that loves me to my safe side  
My world circles 'round a different sun  
That's all burned away  
I know that you're the only one  
Now I'm walking down some distant street  
And I know your touch is out of reach.  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
Everybody has a lonely moment  
They can't explain  
And everybody wants to feed their hunger  
Without the pain.  
  
There's no shadows in my hiding place  
I'm so locked away  
Now I wish that I could see your face  
I know I hurt you when you say we're through  
I never really will get over you 'cause  
  
Girl you belong to me I know  
And it was wrong for me to ever let you go  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
Girl you belong to me I know.  
  
And it was wrong of me to ever let you go.

It's a feeling, I don't belong here  
But a man's on the outside looking in, wondering who's in his old armchair  
  
It's a feeling, you never belonged to me  
First you're on the up 'n up, I only look down and see  
Only look down and see  
  
You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me  
  
You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me  
  
It's a feeling

Took the long way to the shortcut, and the walls were made of stone  
Took the low road to the high ground, had to feel it in my bones  
Everybody wants some heaven, but nobody wants to die  
It's been brought to my attention  
You'll be dead a long time, now ain't that a crime  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building, help me bust out of this cage  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building, must be time for a change  
  
I went driving in the moonlight, there was no place left to go  
I went digging in my coal mine, when I hit the mother load  
If this world could work together, like a big old human clock  
It would run on till forever, it would never have to stop, never have to stop  
  
You can't buy no protection, don't care who you are  
Spreading out in all directions, now it's no hold barred  
Everybody runs for cover, from the sun and sex and sin  
If you think you got the answers, buddy just you come on in, step right in  
  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building  
Kick down the walls, shake down the building

Smoke and mirrors  
It's a house of cards  
Everybody has windows  
And big cigars  
  
The law of the jungle  
Is very new to some  
The animals are vicious and arrogant  
And they eat their young  
  
I used to work my job from 9 to 5  
I just survived  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had every thing thrown at me,  
That the judge and jury could hurl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way up,  
To the very top of the tower  
  
Helter skelter  
It's a den of thieves  
Sea of errors  
That a greedy man weaves  
  
A few really bad apples  
Always spoil the lot  
Rolling blackouts  
On everyone's block  
  
I go to work and try to make ends meet  
My life is over  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had everything I needed,  
I owned every type of girl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way,  
Up to the very top of the tower  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had everything I needed,  
I owned every type of girl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way,  
Up to the very top of the tower

Well, there's a light in your eyes  
That's guiding my way to your doorstep  
And your voice called my name  
With a sound that I've never known  
I was a kid in a comic book-world looking for answers  
When out of the darkness she came  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't care if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
Last night  
You turned a frightened little boy into a man without shame  
Last night  
We tore the hands off a clock and it read just the same  
Last night  
I had a crazy little dream and you turned it all around  
Last Night  
We took a chance, we shook it up, and now the world's upside down  
  
All the fire in your heart  
And the heat of your touch I'll remember  
And you're dancing like a flame  
Perfection in motion  
It was the masterpiece from the start  
Only you and I could have rendered  
And I'll never be the same  
  
I'm a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't care if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
And I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a cat on a crown  
In the middle of the night  
Doesn't matter if it's late  
Doesn't matter if it's right  
'Cause I laugh when I think  
I may never have knocked on your door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night

Here's to the few. Who fared, my love  
Only for you, I cared, my love  
I've given it hope, and I know it's only you  
Encased in silence  
  
Here's to the you, who saved, my love  
Only to you, I gave, my love  
I've given it thought, and it's not all that appears  
  
[Chorus]  
Lea, how long will you still want me to want you  
In and around you  
Lea, my concertina  
Will you still want me to want you  
  
Here's to the you, who dared, my love  
Only with you, I shared, my love  
I've given it though, and it's not all that appears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who cares, what the cynics say  
I care, if only you're on your way  
Lea, don't let the same be true  
Lea, do you still want me to want you

I got my feet back on the ground  
We were headed for disaster  
Woke up, I got ready for work  
You weren't around  
I was fast, but you were faster  
Such a night, feeling right  
Nothing I could say  
(Then you went away)  
Have to know, why'd you go?  
Couldn't even beg you to stay  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
  
Huntress, you compell me with your eyes  
It's my heart that you're enslaving  
Serpent dance  
You really hypnotize  
To the lion's den is the road for me you're paving  
In a trance, saw you dance  
And you made romance to me  
(Don't take it away)  
Took a chance, circumstance  
And it wasn't hard to see  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
  
You're the one that made me feel this way  
So alone without your smile  
You took my heart  
Left my soul to pay  
Just to watch me crawl on another smile  
  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl  
Lyin' in a sweat, tryin' to forget  
All of my lovin' for you girl

There is too much hatred, there is too much starvation, too much inhumanity  
  
Some people get the kicks out of throwing bricks at me  
No real reason, just jealousy  
Angry words and bad attitudes is gonna get you nowhere  
  
Watching you watching me, it's alright, 'cause I will make it right  
  
Chorus:  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love is a fire, a burning desire, it's so warm (oh)  
  
Some believe in the almighty dollar, some don't believe in nothing at all  
There's a power that's within you, it will never never ever let you down  
  
I'm the way, I'm the key to liberty and unity, are you listening  
  
Chorus  
  
One hundred million voices singing (can you hear the voices singing)  
No weak, no strong, no right, no wrong - imagine (you gotta keep imagining)  
Impossible, the sceptics say,wait and see there's gonna come a day  
  
Chorus  
  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
  
There's no difference between black or white, the light of life  
I can hear the children laughing  
Men at war, stop your worries, give peace a chance, there's a new day dawning  
Come together, come together, come together  
(Wisdom is the mouth of peace, of innocence)

It's just the soul that matters, and I don't know why  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb  
You know she's gonna make you try, you know she's gonna make you try  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night  
  
It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know she's gonna make you try, ooh, you know she's gonna make you high  
  
It's just the soul that matters, and keeps her satisfied  
You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry  
She'll have you wishing that you had her come your way to shine  
You know she's  
  
Ooh, you know we're lovers in the night

There's something I must say  
Something I must do  
I planned it all this way  
Designed it just for you  
Do you want to be with me  
Be with me at all  
Do you have to be so cool?  
Your gentle touch maneuvered me  
But all the time I always knew  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough  
  
Can we go on this way  
There's nothing left to prove  
It's not another game  
Or another simple move  
Do you believe in me  
Believe in me at all  
Are you telling me the truth?  
Is it just imagination  
Or the perfect dream  
That I'm here with you  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I'm giving you the only heart I have  
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough  
  
I'm really mad about you  
There's nothing bad about our love  
I've never had a broken heart before  
But I know you'll never tear mine apart

[Chorus]  
Why don't we make believe we're in love again  
Who said the crimson moon doesn't shine  
Where do people go when they're lookin' for that one of a kind  
  
Why don't we make believe that we're sorry  
Why must we hold it all inside  
Where do lovers go when they're runnin' and there's no place to hide  
  
Always remember, the day we met in the foreign rain  
You were content and, we went our separate ways  
No matter which way the wind blows now, hang on to it anyhow  
Don't ever say it could never be the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Always remember, holding hands on a summer day  
You were content ob das stimmt?? and you took it all away  
I didn't come here to change your mind, lead you on and waste your time  
All alone in the evening, gettin' blue  
  
Why don't we make believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why don't we make believe, why don't we make believe

Don't look now, you better watch that sword that's hanging over you  
It's a long hard road and they will spit you out  
When they get through with you  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
[Chorus]  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run  
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run  
  
There's no more time for living out your life, your sky is falling down  
Don't close your eyes or make a wish on three  
'Cause they will still be 'round  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela-uela run  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run  
(Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela run  
You better run, run Manuela run  
(Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)  
You better run, run Manuela run

Watching, driving through the night, I'm all alone  
Empty endless road, a thousand miles to go  
Midnight five million thoughts are passing in a row  
Will you still be waiting there God only knows  
  
I can still see your face in my mind, with every turn I take  
The wind through my heart feels so cold, as it calls out your name  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you can set me free  
  
Morning, sun's in my eyes, I'm tied to your soul  
One chance, one solitary life, how could I let you go  
Got a phone call, or was it a dream, a voice spoke to me  
I could swear it was you that I heard crying desperately  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free  
  
I can still see your face in my mind, with every turn I take  
The wind through my heart feels so cold, as it calls out your name  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free  
  
Melanie, nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me  
Oh, Melanie, reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free

Been thinking 'bout you all night  
Guess you got me in a spell  
But I think that I'l be all right  
Even if I don't get well  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
I can still remember  
What you told me with your eyes  
One kiss, now it's down to this  
Guess it's time you realized  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms  
  
Hey Miss Sun  
What could I say  
I tried to hold you  
But the moon got in the way  
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms

She know you bad  
You don't sing songs of love  
She treats you right, she treats you like a web of love  
You know who's of the heart, her notions of societies  
You belong to know and just like our sophiaties  
(Chorus:)  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes, to see what you want to see  
Modern eyes  
Modern eyes, she'll paint you with the modern eyes  
What you look for in people is not hard to recognize  
Black man, white man, short man  
They're all the same in size  
You breath the air, you feel the sea and the sand and the skies  
When nighttime comes you blind men with modern eyes  
(Repeat chorus)  
She'll paint you with the hupskin on  
She'll paint you with the fire in your eyes  
She'll paint you with the modern eyes  
(Repeat chorus)  
  

Know these words are wrong to say  
Need you more and more each day  
(Chorus:)  
Hey Mrs. Johnson  
Give me your answer as fast as you can  
Hey Mrs. Johnson  
Don't you know I really love you  
Here's my life, it's yours today  
Help me chase the blues away  
(Repeat chorus)  
(Instrumental break)  
Know these words are wrong to say  
Need you more and more each day  
(Repeat chorus two times)  
  

I can't forget you, my little Mushanga, I keep a place in my heart for you  
The days of waiting, they keep getting longer, and not a thing I can do  
I was a poet, a magazine writer, sent to report on political views  
It was by chance, through a lens that I met you, a Kingston girl with no shoes  
  
[Chorus]  
You were runnin' down the road, I was going your way  
You stopped and turned around, and lent you my hand  
You smiled though you were suffering, I didn't understand, then  
  
You broke into my heart, I saw your eyes and then I knew  
You broke into my heart, like the wind and rain that followed you  
You broke into my heart, had the Lord above forgotten you?  
You broke in from the start, and all my tears belong to you  
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh  
  
I sat and watched as she danced by the fires  
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold  
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains  
And loss of lives mining white man's gold  
  
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan  
Where all my stories are bought and sold  
I know the city would surely be saddened, if what I knew could be told  
  
It's been so long since I last heard your laughter  
So many letters and still no news  
I hope you find all the things that you're after  
You know my heart is with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh  
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh  
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh

The curse of blood  
Falls upon this nation  
I was my hands  
And hang my head in shame  
I pray for peace  
And forge the crooked valley  
This dreader fear  
Held prisoner inside me  
  
Chorus  
I search the stars, still I find  
No rhyme or reason  
I can't see a thing  
That's gonna make it right, oh make it right  
You're still walking at midnight  
Alone with voices in your mind  
You see the world in black and white  
You know until you see the light  
There ain't no end, no end in sight  
  
I can't justify  
The cleansing of society  
The human race  
It ain't no race at all  
I breach the flood  
Of political insanity  
Where hope once stood  
Is filled with lies and shame  
  
Chorus

At the end of my life, when it's time to depart  
Will the last face I see be yours  
When I take my last breath, and I drift through the dark  
Will I look 'round and still feel secure  
  
(It's) no sacrifice to stay by your side  
Till hell freezes clear to the core  
Whatever the price, no matter how high  
Over your shoulder,  
When you turn around I'll be tellin' you  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all  
  
I'll put my change on the dresser... next to your scarf  
Cook my heart in the skillet next to yours  
Ten thousand tears lead up to now  
You are the treasure for sure  
  
Lines on my face get deeper each day  
But the feelings are ageless and smooth  
One single trace of doubt still remains  
Over my shoulder, when I turn around,  
Will you be tellin' me  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all

Time, is the enemy of a young man's dreams  
I'm stranded, in the heartland, or so it seems  
  
I'm hitching a ride for a chance at the good life  
I'll have my own place, out on fifth avenue  
I'm leavin' this time gonna walk on that fine line  
I'll be the first one who finally breaks through  
  
One road to the promised land  
I have to get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Gonna find out just who I am  
  
Freedom, do you know what I mean  
Flatlands, are all I've ever seen  
  
Stuck in a small town where you live, then you die  
Ain't nothin' but fool's workin' nine until five  
I'll sleep in the subways till I get what I need  
I'm not gonna stay here, just lie here and bleed  
  
One road to the promised land  
I'm gonna get there any way I can  
One road to the promised land  
Show the world just who I am  
  
One road to the promised land  
I thought by now I'd be a different man  
One road to the promised land  
Guess I found out, just who I am

We keep hurting each other when words can't be easily said  
No understanding or reason, just fear and confusion instead  
We need hope for the future, and the young need a chance to survive  
No one knows the pain that's felt by the innocent, they're  
Fighting to stay alive, can no one see the tears in their eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Only the children, only the children cry, only the children  
  
Why do those who have plenty ignore those with nothing at all  
Why must the ones just beginning, stand with their backs to the wall  
They keep asking for answers and we keep on telling them lies  
They only want to understand what they feel inside  
The hunger that tears them apart  
It's the one thing they've known from the start

Waiting for you again, seems like this never ends  
I close my eyes and I see your face, and I see it all fading away  
  
Woke up before you again, you're still asleep I can't pretend  
I feel like I'm losing you, and I am trying to make everything right  
  
[Chorus]  
Only you, only me, say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you, holding my heart in your hands  
Only me, still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh  
  
If I could have a second chance, maybe change the circumstance  
Imagine if the dream came true, we could start it all over tonight  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Only me, say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you, holding my heart in your hands  
Only me, still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh

Side by side, I'll be yours forever  
Rain or shine, any kind of weather  
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you  
Let's take what's getting old and make it new  
  
Oh, eye to eye, it's a blinding confrontation  
You and I, we're a deadly combination  
So don't start mixing truth with jealousy  
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
Black and white always go together  
Day and night you're the precious jewel I treasure  
Wanting every part of you is not a crime  
Or could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind  
  
All that I love (all that I love)  
Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart  
  
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine  
Just remember, it may not heal this time  
Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind

Hello, girl  
You're good to see  
Love your face shinin' down on me  
How's it feel with the warm winds blowin'  
  
Hello, girl  
You're good to know.  
Love your smile, I love your glow  
How's it feel with the warm winds blowin'  
  
CHORUS:  
Must have touched the right part of me  
The sun in your eyes  
You came running in from the start  
Connected all the right numbers  
In the picture you were painting of me  
  
Listen girl  
I can't let go  
The time is right, I have to know  
What's it like, when the fire is burning  
  
CHORUS  
  
SOLO  
  
CHORUS (2 times)

All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me, Rosanna  
All I want to do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
  
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be  
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna  
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
  
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad  
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
Not quite a year since she went away,  
Who is it? Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna

Ashes to ashes  
That's how it ends  
(You go from) heartache to heartache  
As you make amends  
(Just) bigger and bigger  
But two steps back  
You want something from nothing  
And you're so exact  
  
You think you're a rich man  
Now you misbehave  
You're not a free man running  
Just a comfortable slave  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room  
  
Deeper and deeper  
As you forge ahead  
Higher and higher  
But you've been mislead  
Harder and harder  
You grind the stone  
Faster faster faster  
Till you're skin and bones  
  
Too much ambition  
Without relief  
That ain't heaven  
But it's what you teach  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room  
  
The world was made in seven days  
Your heads are bowed to Gods in praise  
Civilized man can only be saved  
When courage and wisdom are finally raised  
  
Who's got the answer  
Give me the cure  
Don't rush to judgment  
Until you're sure  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room

You're a soul with no religion  
There's ice in your embrace  
In your dance of indecision  
I see the anger in yor face  
A little drink to help my vision  
A little something for the pain  
There's no drug for my condition  
There's no sweetness in the taste.  
  
Tell me where the ride's gonna lead you  
Do I have to pay to be your friend?  
There's nothing left to say  
When you slipped away.  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I won't let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothing's gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
  
You're a world of blind ambition  
Staring through the looking glass  
You will meet your own collision  
When your conscience comes to ask.  
  
Steal the love from those around you  
Help yourself to everything  
Take the shelter that surrounds you  
It leaves you standing in the rain.  
  
Tell me if the money can heal you  
Do I have to pray to make it end?  
There's nothing left to say when you slipped away.  
  
I can see you fading fast  
I won't let you take me  
When you slipped away  
I can see your burning stare  
Nothing's gonna shake me  
As you slip away  
As you slip away

When you meet a special person  
And it feels good passing time  
You tell yourself it's casual  
But they have something else in mind  
  
You try to make some reason  
A voice calls out from across the room  
She runs away without an answer  
She runs away too soon  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
  
We all belong to someone  
Sometimes they're so far away  
You write down words in letters  
Not quite sure what they say  
  
You know that she needs you  
And you miss her in your heart  
But a certain feeling lingers  
That keeps us miles apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Oh Lord)  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
(You'd better believe)  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying

I heard about a man, walking on the water  
He had hope in his eyes  
He didn't wear a crown or have any money  
He didn't have any lies  
  
He had holes in his pockets  
He had holes in his hands  
He looked like an outlaw talking to his lover  
  
He was a spiritual man  
  
I wanna be a prince, not a king or a warrior  
I wanna have a special light in my eyes  
Wanna climb up a mountain, find a tree of wisdom  
I wanna feel good when I cry  
  
And maybe someday I could be a teacher  
I want that karma when you touch my hand  
I'll walk through the streets,  
Talking to the homeless in winter  
  
I wanna be a spiritual man, yeah  
  
I heard about a man who was born in the desert  
He rode for days and nights across the sand  
And one day, he came upon an angel  
The angel said, "Hey you, you're gonna be a spiritual man!"  
  
Last night I saw a man walking toward a club in Harlem  
He had a black case in his hands  
Went through the back door and pulled out his gold companion  
He closed his eyes and played all night like a self-taught spiritual man

Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra?  
Is he wearing a familiar face?  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
With the princess dipped in lace?  
Does he know that I'm a soldier of fortune  
And not a victim of circumstance?  
We drew lots for his soft underbelly  
Now his fate is sealed with my lance  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
Is it true that he's a mighty warrior  
And a viper of the first degree?  
I've been sentenced here to slay the giant  
Geld this fear I cannot see  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra?  
Is he wearing a familiar face?  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
In the slums of Satan's grace?  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the look in your eye  

Reflections in my mind, thoughts I can't define  
My heart is racing and the night goes on  
I can almost hear a laugh, coming from your photograph  
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings  
Well intended lies, contemplating alibis  
Is it really you, or is it me I'm blaming  
A distant memory flashes over me  
Even though you're gone, I feel you deep inside  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few  
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl  
  
There's a window in a heart, I've tried to look through from the start  
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking  
Someone's broken something new, another altered point of view  
Just a certain someone's conscience playing  
  
I held it in my hand, I did not understand  
What lives inside the wind that cries her name  
Tried to catch a shooting star, what seems so close can't be that far  
I'm living in a dream that's never ending  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dancing with that look that's in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few  
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, loving you...

I remember it was late one night  
In the middle of a dream  
Woke up in a pool of sweat  
Thought I heard a scream  
Ran over to the window sill  
Stuck my head out for a peek  
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognise  
Running down my back street  
My heart skipped a beat  
  
[Chorus x2]  
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town  
You better watch out when he comes around  
Don't make a sound  
  
The morning paper and the head-lines read:Danger to the queen  
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up  
The son of a bitch is mean.  
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job  
Acting like nothing's new  
Scotland Yard's still looking for him  
But he doesn't leave  
A single clue  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
You better watch out  
  
Who's this man who fell out of the sky?  
What's he done and where's he live?  
How can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?  
The old couple swear that the Riper's back  
They say it's him all right.  
The young girl says it's Jesus and he won't be back again  
Tonight  
I wonder who's right ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You better watch out

It's getting near dawn.  
The lights close their tired eyes.  
I'll soon be with you, my love,  
To give you my dawn surprise.  
I'll be with you, darling, soon,  
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
I'm with you, my love.  
The light shining through on you.  
Yes, I'm with you, my love,  
It's the morning and just we two.  
I'll stay with you, darling, now,  
I'll stay with you till my seeds are dried up.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
It's getting near dawn.  
The lights close their tired eyes.  
I'll soon be with you, my love,  
To give you my dawn surprise.  
I'll be with you, darling, soon,  
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.  
  
I've been waiting so long

Screaming at the sun I t have spilled a little moonshine on my head  
Didn't have to run, but there was no one left behind accept for the dead  
  
I didn't see it coming, but that rummy-stilted crackpot knew my game  
Left my head a humming, like a ball peen hammer drives a nail to shame  
  
I suggest you listen up to what I have to say  
Witnessed many crooked things, I smell your DNA  
Stab me, take me down, you know you'll never get your way  
  
Taint your world  
You're so far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Cause you don't want to fuck with me  
  
Didn't anybody get the cipher from the flying rat machine  
Gnarly, little, scrunched up, tiny fingers, and its disposition mean  
  
Anybody out of line will soon be on the list  
My back's against the wall and yet I know I must resist  
Time to tell the truth, I think somebody's getting pissed  
  
Taint your world  
You're not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
You got another guess coming if you think you're fooling me  
  
Taint your world  
So far away from where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Where I belong just like an oyster and a pearl  
Taint your world  
You're not even close to where you think you need to be  
Taint your world  
Taint your world

I went down to the highway  
That runs between love and pride  
And I tried to get sideways  
Across the great divide  
But my mind's eye's on the key ring  
Crying in misery  
'Cause it won't spend one more evening  
Staring back at me.  
  
It may be by choice or a small inner voice I can't say  
When you add up the cost we all have a cross  
How do you write off the loss?  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.  
  
The rules are unwritten  
And nobody knows the deal  
Where have I been driven  
Are deamons behind the wheel?  
Yeah, I know my days are numbered  
We're only flesh and bone  
And I've been left to wonder  
How it went so wrong.  
  
Is it all tailor made, can the sinner be saved, I can't say  
So don't hang your hat on the knife I'm my back  
'Cause nobody treats me like that.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
How do I find my way?  
When is it loud and clear  
That there's no turning back? No looking back  
Where do I go from here?  
Nobody gets away  
It''s a new kind of fix  
For the poor and the rich  
You never know what's coming next, at the turning point.

Everybody keeps talkin' about you, I can't lie anymore  
Been too long, what went wrong? It's a mystery  
Why you ever walked out that door  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it gonna get easier than tryin' to break these chains around my heart  
Oh oh  
Does it ever get easier, without you I can't pull these chains apart  
Oh oh  
  
I see your face when I look in the mirror  
I feel your touch but you're not there  
Wakin' up, had enough of this dream of mine, girl this just isn't fair  
What direction should I go? Girl what's next for me, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Day by day, until they break, oh oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Nice girls not one with a defect, cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct.  
Red dogs under illegal legs, she looks so good that he gets down and begs.  
  
She is watching the detectives, "oh, he's so cute!"  
She is watching the detectives, when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.  
They beat him up until the teardrops start,  
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.  
  
Long shot of that jumping sign, visible shivers running down my spine.  
Cut the baby taking off her clothes.  
Close-up of the sign that says,"We never close"  
You snatch a tune, you a match a cigarette,  
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet.  
I don't know how much more of this I can take.  
She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake.  
  
She is watching the detectives  
  
You think you're alone until you realize you're in it.  
Now fear is here to stay. Love is here for a visit.  
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.  
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder who is it?  
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents  
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.  
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay,  
It only took my little fingers to blow you away.  
  
Just like watching the detectives, don't get cute!"  
It's just like watching the detectives.  
I get so angry when the teardrops start,  
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart.  
Just like watching the detectives

I'm counting on you  
Gotta know, the time has come to follow through  
Drive straight through the night  
Just hold on, we can make it home before daylight  
  
There's a voice inside you  
And you know it can't be wrong  
So break away from this pain, girl  
We've held out much too long  
  
[Chorus]  
We can make it tonight  
If you give me the sign  
And I'll be by your side  
I've got the feeling it's right  
We can make it in time  
We can make it tonight  
  
Fear nothing at all  
Ya gotta know that nothing is impossible  
The things I've seen with these eyes  
Precious dreams  
That somehow you don't realize  
  
Well there's a thirst inside you  
I know I can't be wrong  
So let's get out of the storm girl  
We've waited much too long

Bad time for love - you caught me on your birthday  
I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces  
We were too torn apart, now it seems so senseless  
And if we're clever, we'll put it together, it may be forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again  
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again  
  
Down on my luck, you arrived just in time, my angel  
Thought you'd given me up, like a rhyme that needs no reason  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cause it may be forever  
  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cause it may be forever  
  
If ever we'll make it, we're gonna make it girl  
And I know we can take it, we got to take it, girl  
  
If ever we can make it, we gotta make it  
And I know we can take it...

How can you say you love me  
When you don't even love yourself  
You live your life like a jagged knife  
Just waiting on the shelf  
  
How can you live for tomorrow  
When you curse the night and day  
The minutes pass through the hour glass  
As you let them slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me  
White sister  
Do you love me when I play your game  
Do you love me  
White sister  
Do you love me  
When I call your name  
  
How can you touch the sorrow  
With a leather gloved hand  
When you summon the winds of anger  
Just as fast as you can  
  
You crucify an orphan  
With the rainbow in your eyes  
Then you send out invitations  
And address them with his cries  
  
I don't even know what's right  
I can say  
That you put up some kind of fight  
I've been branded  
I've been stranded  
I'm so thankful for what I've been handed  
I wish I could say that you're mine  
Such a card game  
  
[Chorus]
