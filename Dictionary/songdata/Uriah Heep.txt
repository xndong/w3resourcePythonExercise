When I'm all alone on a distant path  
And my ticket home  
Has been torn in half  
Oh, I can hear your voice girl  
I can feel your touch  
Across the miles tonight  
  
On the road again will it always be  
That the dream has changed  
On its way to reality  
Oh but the thought of you  
Strange how it pulls me through  
Across the miles tonight  
  
And I am sending you this message  
Through the wires tonight  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
And here I am concentrating girl  
With all my might  
Now the sound of your laughter  
Trails off through the midnight sky  
  
As the miles go by cities come and go  
When you close your eyes  
And listen to the radio  
Girl can you hear my song  
The signal is clear and strong  
Across the miles tonight  
  
And I am sending you this message  
Through the wires tonight  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
And here I am concentrating girl  
With all my might  
Now the sound of your laughter  
Trails off across the miles

(the way of life that must change)  
In the court of kings I look around  
My blood runs cold, I close my eyes  
Out of my head a vision flows  
I'll make the rules I need  
For my survival, for my survival  
I pull the strings, you take the glory  
I load the gun, you shoot me down  
I'm on the edge about to fall  
Destructive power will make you  
Lose your mind, use your mind  
Trapped inside my nightmare  
You are there  
As I turn I feel your evil stare  
We give our life, invest in time  
To only fools who take control  
I spend another cold day in hell  
Against the odds I fight  
For my survival, for my survival  
Your useless life gets crushed  
Into the ground  
The time has come  
To turn it all around  

You think I'm crazy for wanting you  
But you just hide away  
Behind your untold truths  
And so I sit and  
Listen to your lonely words  
Another reason for you  
To be yourself  
I can't be wrong for believing in you  
'cause this ice is melting  
And the waves are breaking through  
I see a fire, it's burning  
In your heart tonight  
There's only one way  
For me to forget  
All for one, one for all  
Strong in heart, body and soul  
We were all for one, one for all  
All for one, one for all  
Nothing could stop us, we had it all  
We were all for one, one for all  
I always knew  
You had dreams of your own  
But I can't understand you  
So many words, too much to say  
And nothing to hold on to  
And so another day must end  
In this loneliness  
Another season  
Another time, I guess  
All for one, we were all for one  
All for one, strong in body and soul  
All for one, and  
Nothing's gonna stop us  
All for one, one for all ...  

Crazy little whirlwind child  
Pretty babies drive ya wild  
Look like one, act like another  
Every night a different lover  
Get affection where you can  
Try a boy then try a man  
First time love is in the past  
Make it young and make it fast  
All god's children will have their say  
All god's children  
Must have their way  
It's a game where you can cheat  
Lovers falling at your feet  
High on sensuality  
A photograph for all to see  
First time love is in the past  
Make it young and make it fast  
They can never get enough  
Strong as death and sweet as love  
They walk and talk like angels  
They walk and talk like angels ...  

Can't go to sleep without you  
Starring in my dreams  
I can't get you out of my head  
I close my eyes, you're always there  
I lock the door  
But you're comin' up the stairs  
  
Can't stay awake  
I know I have to try  
What will it take to stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
How can I break  
The hold you have on me  
Angel will you never  
Ever set me free  
  
Oh angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
How come you're givin' me  
These technicolor dreams  
How can I get you out of my head  
I close my eyes, you're always there  
How can I get you out of my bed  
  
I lie awake, all I see is you  
I'm going crazy, what can I do  
Switch off the light  
Then you start to call  
I lock the door  
Now you're coming through the wall  
  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Sweet angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
I can't stay awake much longer  
This feeling's getting stronger  
  
You must be an angel  
'Cause I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Walking in my sleep  
You're an angel and I can't  
Stop you starring in my dreams  
  
Sweet angel, I can't stop you  
Dancing on my bed  
You're an angel and  
I can't get you out of my head  
Angel, I can't stop you  
Wa

Hey girl, you're the one  
That got me started  
And I bet you'll be  
The one to get us parted  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Now everybody's had their fun  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
Ooh, but the answer  
In your eyes is never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody's had their fun  
Well, you and me  
And we know what we're saying  
To the rest of them  
It's a game we're playing  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
We were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody else will come  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
Ooh, but the answer  
In your eyes is never, never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Or the mother of my son  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
How I'm wishing  
We could live together  
But the answer in your eyes is never  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
You and me  
And we know what we're saying  
To the rest of them  
It's a game we're playing  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
We were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Or the mother of my son  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
You were the only one  
In the beginning, in the beginning  
Everybody had their fun  
Like astranaza  
Astranaza ...  

In this supermarket city  
Among the native smiles  
You have to pay for attention  
And do the best you can  
There's a raging silence  
And it's charged with action  
Got no time for weakness  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
Down the streets of darkness  
Where they know my name  
Lies a force of evil  
And a destructive plan  
There's no time for questions  
When you run into danger  
Don't get too close to me  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
I'm working for the l.a. division  
To stop the inner city collision  
I'm bringing law and order  
To the twenty-first century  
  
I don't care for politics  
You can keep your point of view  
You'd be better off without it  
I got my own bad plan  
  
A tough cop has a lonely existence  
A reputation of  
The highest resistance  
A mean runner bringing order  
To the twenty-first century  
  
I don't believe in passion  
Don't believe in feelings  
I take peace from the wicked  
Run and hide while you can  
I got no time for small talk  
Got no time for off-the-wall talk  
Don't care who I tread on  
'cause I'm a bad bad man  
  
Bad bad man, I'm a bad bad man

I'm coming home  
I've been away far too long  
I'm leaving it up to you  
To understand  
  
You may wonder why  
When it was me who said  
The last goodbye  
But cannot change my mind  
One more time  
  
It's high time  
I can't wait any longer  
It's my time to find out  
Who I belong to  
It's breaking my heart  
Waitin' for another day  
  
When the time comes  
You won't see me around  
I've been patient  
Standing my ground  
Gotta see ya and hold ya  
Hear what you have to say  
  
Do you wake up in the morning  
Wantin' me  
The way I wake up wantin' you  
And in the same breath  
You keep hauntin' me  
Does it ever occur to you  
I've been in love too long  
To stop now, oh  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
  
If you've ever cried  
Then you'll know the pain  
You felt inside  
And just like me you pray  
It's all untrue  
  
But time alone will tell  
If you have learned  
Life's lessons well  
And maybe then you'll know  
What I should do  
  
Been away, I've been away  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
I've been away too long  
Too long, much too long  
Much too long

At the age of eighteen  
I had had enough  
And by twenty one  
I decided to get tough  
And then I found the guard  
Was still too rough  
And I've been hurt  
Ever since that day  
I've been hurt and I've lost my way  
I still think I have a chance  
To find your love  
Well, I tried to love you  
One day at a time  
Each day waiting  
Hoping for the sign  
It was clear I needed luck  
More than this time  
And I've been hurt  
Ever since that day  
I've been hurt, well, I've lost my way  
I still think I have a chance  
To make you mine  
My empty heart is  
Counting all the ways  
Fire and desire  
Sat and count days  
Will you, won't you  
When and where  
Do you, don't you, do I care  
That same eternal question  
Is always there  
It's always there  

You're not the only one  
Amongst the saints and sinners  
There are those that we can see  
And those no longer with us  
To take that walk again  
With someone you were close to  
On stage in the other world tonight  
And there are many  
Who will say it's speculation  
We need to focus on  
The sleeping generation  
The healing vision  
That extends beyond the pain  
Will take you there and back again  
I can remember  
You were no stranger  
As you came to me  
Dreamers walking  
And in that moment  
Between two worlds  
I saw the furthest star  
Exploding all around you  
And through the journey  
You spoke in silence  
And you made it clear  
Walk in peace now  
Then you touched me  
Revealing all upon your way  
Inside the burning fountain of timeOf time ...  
A time so real as the one  
We share each day  
The same dimension  
Just a heartbeat away  
In every part of you  
There's so much exploration  
Out on the edge of space and time  

I can see that look that says beware  
Try to move in closer if you dare  
So I must sit and play  
My waiting game  
And for a while I know  
She'll do the same  
Fly away  
  
Watches like an eagle from its eyrie  
And like a bird of prey  
She captures me  
But I am older and  
More wise than you  
Bird of prey  
Straight into me you flew  
Fly away  
  
Now every time I tried to set her free  
I'm glad to say she comes  
Right back to me  
But if I knew she didn't want to stay  
I wouldn't try to keep that  
Lovely bird of prey

His blood's on stone  
It's running down the frozen wall  
His hand's so cold  
He's trying not to fall  
Oh, will he make it now  
One slip and he's lost  
It's his last chance for freedom  
It's all that he's got  
He feels good, so right  
Hot sweat on a cold night  
Breaking free into the wind  
He's got nothing to lose, just win  
He's just a runaway  
He's free now and on his way  
He's almost home  
Just one push and  
He'll take this wall  
It's blood on stone  
From trying not to fall  
He's made it now  
Where others have not  
Just one last jump to freedom  
Is all that he's got  

I can't stop singing  
I can't see the end  
Just a new beginning  
As long as I keep on trying  
I'll survive just fine  
Free to take my time  
  
Ridin' the moon in the midnight sky  
I can see through  
The man who lies with eyes  
And the real thing that's wrong is  
He has no song to lean on  
So I'll take my time  
Just to give you my rhyme  
To try to be sure and open the door  
'Cause there's much more to life  
Than a day and a night to dream on  
  
Now I ain't confessin'  
To same kind of blessin'  
I'm trying to say  
Why I'm happy today  
I'm not preachin', teachin',  
Makin' some speech in dedication  
'Cause it's no good me sayin'  
Where the blame should be layin'  
For with that kind of reason  
It comes out the same  
With an ear to the ground  
Each day I found inspiration

Carry on  
  
So what can I do, what can I say  
Do I have to stand and  
Watch you walk away  
I know there's got to be  
A better way  
I just can't go on living for today  
  
I thought I heard a voice  
Out on the wind  
And I'm sure I heard it say  
I'd find a friend  
And it said I'd find  
The answers in the end  
All I gotta do is carry on  
  
Carry on, carry on, the time is flyin'  
You need another love  
Maybe another town  
Carry on, carry on  
Don't wait until your hope is gone  
When your last chance  
Comes round  
  
I'm gonna keep on looking  
I won't quit  
Aggravation  
It ain't gonna hurt a bit  
And I believe that  
I have seen the last of it  
There's nothing left to do  
But carry on

Once there was a man of power  
Had no care for human life  
Then one day he saw his living lie  
Growing all around him  
The wheel of change had taken over  
Found a love he never knew  
Now he teaches children what is true  
Gather all around him  
What made him choose to turn away  
What makes us change our mind  
The will to see turns you around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and you're alive  
Running around in your confusion  
From the cradle to the grave  
Ain't got time to see the world go by  
Where are you going  
Always moving round in circles  
Talking words that never end  
Standing in the grip of madness  
Why oh why  
What are you saying  
How can we choose to run away  
How do we change our mind  
See the perception turn around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and you're alive  
Realise this understanding  
Move before it gets too late  
Take this chance  
Or life will pass you by  
This is the only way  
We must pull ourselves together  
There's so much we must explain  
Got to teach the children what is true  
There is no other way  
Why did we choose to turn away  
Why did we change our mind  
The will to see turns you around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and you're alive  
The incredible gift of life  
Where the fire within burns bright  
Every moment we live is true  
And the spirit is all in you  

Safe in the shadows  
Deep in the night  
I know you're near  
But you're nowhere in sight  
Safe from the darkness  
Down in the streets  
I hear your footsteps  
I hear your heartbeat  
Oh, I can hear your heartbeat  
On the street corner  
Away from the light  
I know you're near  
But you're nowhere in sight  
Over my shoulder  
I feel you're near  
I feel you moving  
But you never appear  
Chasing shadows  
Chasing something I can't see  
Chasing shadows  
Will I ever be free  
Chasing shadows  
Into the darkness from the light  
Chasing shadows  
I'm just a victim of the night  
The night  
Cloaked in darkness  
You play at your game  
I hear you breathing  
Call out your name  
Closer, closer, I feel you so near  
You're just a shadow  
But you never appear  
Chasing shadows  
Chasing something I can't see  
Chasing shadows  
Will I ever be free  
Chasing shadows  
Into the darkness from the light  
Chasing shadows  
Another victim of the night  
The night  
Shadows in the night  
Safe from the darkness  
Deep in the night  
I know you're here  
You're nowhere in sight  
Over my shoulder  
I know you are near  
I feel you moving  
Will you ever appear  
I'm chasing something I can't see  
Will I ever be free  
Shadows in the night  

Walkin' around this concrete garden  
Viewing all in vain  
Thinking why a dream  
Is driving everyone insane  
  
Then something will come  
And make you feel  
The master in control  
Still you're picking up  
And screwing anyone  
Who's got a soul  
  
I've been here  
Far too long to remember  
Sights and sounds  
From this town of clowns  
Makin' up, dressin' up  
Walkin' around  
Thinkin' that you're Greta Garbos  
  
I'm sorry my dears  
But we only sat down  
And laughed and laughed in sorrow  
But it was you  
That opened the door  
And it's that we thank you for  
  
Everyone insane  
Everyone's insane

Daddy, daddy, come and look  
See what I have found  
A little ways away from here  
While digging in the ground  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
It's nothing, just a picture-book  
They had before the war  
  
Daddy, daddy, come and see  
Daddy, come and look  
Why, there's four or five  
Little Melinda girls  
Inside my picture book  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
There were lots of little girls like you  
Before they had the war  
  
Oh Daddy, daddy, come and see  
Daddy, hurry do  
Why, there's someone  
In a pretty dress  
She's all grown up like you  
Won't you tell me why  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
That someone is your Mummy  
You had before the war  
  
Daddy, daddy, tell me if you can  
Why can't things be  
The way they were  
Before the war began  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
The answer lies in yesterday  
Before they had the war

All you seem to do want to do  
Is break my heart  
Seems to me  
We're a lot better off apart  
Time was when you took  
A pride in puttin' me down  
We'll I've some news for you  
That's gonna turn ya around  
  
I got no time for no crazy lady  
And the games you want to play  
'Cause a love like mine's  
Gonna take some time  
You can't save it for a rainy day  
  
Well, l do you know  
Do you know  
Do you know what  
I'm trying to say  
Love's not a game  
It's never the same  
You gotta live your love  
From day to day  
  
Lonely days are long and  
Sad nights are so black  
Then I get right down thinkin'  
Maybe I could take you back  
Till at mornin' light  
A new face appears at my door  
As a kinda reminder that  
I ain't seein' you no more

(being, in love)  
Been travelling this road for so long  
My eyes are tired but I carry on  
The sun lays down it's golden threads  
I need a place to rest my head  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
It's hard to be out here on my own  
So far away, so far from home  
I need to touch and feel your skin  
To live this dream in sleep again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
Dream on, dream on  
This hotel room's a lonely place  
It's a one night cell I must escape  
So I drink away my loneliness  
So I can sleep and dream again  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
And as I fall into  
The darkness of the night  
You come to rescue me to  
Shield me in your light  
I feel your touch  
The softness of your skin  
You hold me close before  
The day breaks in  
This dream's so true  
My heart it beats, it beats  
It beats for you, for you  
Although I am far from home now  
My soul's with you  
So dream on, dream on  
Freedom comes with timeless sleep  
Dream on, dream on  
In the arms of night  
Your silent shadow gently speaks  
So dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
So dream on, dream on  
Dream on  

I've got a dollar deal hidden  
Down in my shoe  
So listen friends  
I tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna run up  
The road of mystery  
Hangin' by a thread to a fantasy  
A background black  
Showing my face  
Buried in the image  
Of an empty space  
  
I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
Waitin' for the sunshine  
  
Husslin' my will  
In a bar downtown  
And f it don't work out now  
'll keep movin' around and around  
  
Tll I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
I'm waitin' for the sunshine, yeah  
  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Hangin' around  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Trying to hitch a ride  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Hangin' around  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
When I turn my back  
You're by my side  
  
Well I fought my way  
Through the back-stage door  
Staring at my goal  
Till my eyes get sore  
And working my way  
Through the little I say  
Caring no less just  
The light of the day  
A background black  
Showing my face  
Buried in the image  
Of an empty space  
  
I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
I'm waitin' for the sunshine, yeah  
  
Just a dreamer  
When I turn by back  
You're by my side  
  
Dreamer

Grinning demons, smiling sideways  
Laughing in my face  
Here within my troubled sleep  
There's such a lonely place  
Running fast but never moving  
I can't get away  
Strange but realistic objects  
Making me their prey  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Evil dream  
Changing like the sun turn to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Dining with the gods of beauty  
On a distant shore  
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness  
Never seen before  
Dancing stars with crystal voices  
Beckon with their eyes  
Unicorn of many colours  
Rides to paradise  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Sleepless nights that last a lifetime  
Crucify my head  
Dreams of peace and then disaster  
Wish that I were dead  
Looking for the end of darkness  
Seeking out the day  
For escape with speed unthought of  
Bearing me away  
  
Then it's gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Come into my dream

This is a thing I've never known before  
It's called easy livin'  
This is a place I've never seen before  
And I've been forgiven  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find ya  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked behind ya  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
  
Waiting, watching  
Wishing my whole life away  
Dreaming, thinking  
Ready for my happy day  
And some easy livin'  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find you  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked, walked behind you  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart

Fallen angel  
  
Everyone I see reminds me of you  
I keep turnin' round  
Expectin' you to be there  
I keep seein' our past  
Through my looking glass  
But fallen angel  
Where are you now  
  
After all these years  
I remember the tears  
When we parted you said  
Don't forget me  
You were ridin' so high  
Now they're passin' you by  
Girl I've never forgot you  
Please come and get me  
  
Livin' without you is  
Hard enough anyway  
But knowin' you're hurtin'  
Makes it so much worse every day  
  
I just wanna love you  
Any way that I can  
And watching you cry wasn't  
Part of my plan  
  
Tell me how did it feel  
In your promised land  
That you chose as  
Your pain and your pleasure  
A temporary sanctuary  
Oh fallen angel  
I'm your real treasure

Falling keep on falling  
Keep on falling love  
  
Now I don't mind  
All this running around  
Seems I've been doing it  
Most of my life  
My music's been kind  
But some days I find  
It brings me two kinds of trouble  
And three kinds of strife  
  
So don't try to compare it  
'cause I just want to  
Share it with some people  
I like to call friends  
There ain't nothing bad and  
No need to feel sad  
And there's certainly no need  
To make amends  
  
It won't do you no harm and  
There's no cause for alarm  
I won't be praying for  
Help from above  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling in love  
  
If the only thing  
Wrong with rock and roll  
Is that I keep on falling  
Keep on falling  
Keep on falling in love

Feelings, empty feelings  
Prayin', hopin', needin'  
Just when I wanted to hold you  
You're leavin', you're leavin'  
leavin', you're leavin'  
  
I remember those magic nights  
Those nights when it  
All seemed right  
But I knew that by mornin'  
You'd be gone  
And though you tell me  
That it's not for long  
It ain't easy here holdin' on  
You gotta tell me where I stand  
  
'cause either you don't give a damn  
Or you don't even care to pretend  
Or you won't spare a thought  
Though you know  
It must come to an end  
  
You'd better know that  
I've made up my mind  
I gotta high of a different kind  
And it's gonna take me  
Where I wanna be  
Sure I'll miss ya but I gotta choose  
You can't believe that  
I came here to lose  
And you ain't a winner  
That's easy to see  
  
So I'll see you around or I'll write  
And I'll send you some love  
'cause where I wanna go  
There ain't nothing to do but move

My love lives at  
The end of a rainbow  
One day I'm gonna  
Fly there on a firefly  
High above white angry water  
With a love song in my heart  
  
Someday, somehow  
I know I'm gonna get there  
I've been patient for so long  
All my daydreams  
Seem so much nearer now  
And I beg you hear my song  
  
Firefly  
On your glowing wings I'll ride  
Till I sit beside  
This dream of mine  
Firefly, high on a risin' tide  
Only want to touch  
The things I've seen  
  
Steppin' lightly from star to star  
Cross a wilderness of blue  
Wonderin' how much  
In love with me you are  
'Cause I'm so much in love with you  
  
Firefly, can you take me  
I ain't had no lovin' lately  
Firefly bring me love  
  
To my new horizon  
The one that I've still  
Got my eyes on, my my firefly  
Firefly, firefly, firefly  
  
In my dreams you come to me  
The answer to my prayer  
As I begin to feel  
You warm my heart  
I awake and you're not there  
  
Now and then I see your eye  
As the stars begin to shine  
No rain to cool my passion  
No! Not now!  
No, now you're mine!

I dreamed of all  
The wonders in the world  
And lovers that I knew  
I saw so many good things  
At one time  
Mountains of emotion  
Coming right into view  
When I arose from my bed  
I got that warm glow  
At the back of my head  
First touch, feel the power  
Hear the thunder over me  
First touch, out of nowhere  
See the future over me  
Then I dreamed about  
The tenderness we shared  
And how it makes us feel  
Like every first encounter  
That we have  
When I think I must be dreamin'  
You tell me that it's real  
And here you are in my bed  
I get that warm glow  
At the back of my head  

I'm flyin' high  
And I know the reason why  
'Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey, as I love you  
  
I used to think  
That love was all so strange  
There was something  
That I used to ease the pain  
Though at times  
It seems it hurts to touch  
It's never gonna hurt  
As much as no love at all  
Honey, as no love at all  
  
Flyin' high, it's a crazy feeling  
Flyin' high, 'cause  
I've learnt the meaning of love  
Flyin' high it's a crazy feeling  
Flyin' high 'cause I believe in love  
  
I'm flyin' high  
And I guess I know the reason why  
'Cause the wind of change  
Has blown my way  
And you love me  
As much today as I love you  
Honey, as I love you  
  
I'm flyin high  
I'm flyin', flyin', flyin'  
I'm flyin high  
And I know the reason

I know this feeling inside  
Has just made up my mind  
I'm gonna take this chance  
And do what's in my heart  
You always said that  
You'd stand by me  
And help me get along  
So understand  
I must do what's in my heart  
  
I know this feeling inside  
Has helped me to carry on  
So as the days go by  
And the nights that never end  
You play the clubs  
And you play the game  
The next day you will find  
You'll have to try and  
Please that fool again  
Don't you know that  
  
Fools play at games  
Don't you know that  
Fools play at games  
And I know that  
I'm not afraid of you  
  
Day after day I feel this way  
That I need to be moving on  
You know I depend on you  
Don't get me wrong  
I'll throw the dice and  
I play the game  
And hope we get along  
Even then I won't be fooled again  
  
So I've read your words and  
I've signed my name  
But I can't make up my mind  
If you really care or you're  
Playing your games

Free me  
Free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Come on and free me  
Free me from your spell.  
  
Why should I worry that you might not love  
you're not  
The only love that I've ever had.  
Your sweet memory will always comfort me  
So why should I be feeling sad  
As far as I can tell  
You knew so well  
I was always at the end of the line  
I've loved you as much  
As any man can  
But not enough to make you mine  
So long easy rider  
I know I'll miss you for a while  
But sooner or later  
I know that I'll forget you  
  
And I tell your baby  
  
Free me  
Come on and free me  
  
We let a good love die.  
We let it pass us by  
Through you tried to keep me hanging on  
  
But with all this doubt  
It'll never work out  
So tomorrow I'll be traveling on  
And saying so long easy rider  
I know I'll miss you for a while  
But sooner or later  
I know that I'll forget you  
  
Free me  
oh yeah  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
Oh yeah  
Come on and free me  
Why don't you free me  
Free me from your spell  
  
Free me  
Oh bab' come on and free me  
Free me

Ain't it strange  
That when you're lonely  
And your friends they're not around  
So you make your big decision  
Get your feet back on the ground  
  
When you're down  
And no one wants you  
And you wonder who you are  
When your friends  
They don't desert you  
When you make it you're a star  
  
But I'm gonna stay  
Free and easy  
I know just what I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
  
Well, I've been through  
All the heartaches  
And I've been through all the pain  
But when you're up and riding high  
Everybody stakes their claim  
  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
I know just what I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
  
I'm gonna be free and easy  
I know just who I am  
I'm gonna be free and easy

was only seventeen  
I fell in love with a gypsy queen  
She told me: "Hold on"  
Her father was the leading man  
Said: "You're not welcome on our land"  
And then as a foe, he told me to go  
  
He took me to a little shack  
And put a whip across my back  
Then told her: "Leave me"  
I was out for quite a time  
Came back with her on my mind  
Sweet little girl  
She means all the world  
  
Oh, I want my gypsy queen  
Will she still be torn between  
Her father and lover  
One day I will go to him  
Strong enough to fight and win  
The kind of a man  
That he'll understand

Hit the city, hit the night  
Hit the club, sip the wine  
Just remember to leave on time  
  
Hit the red lights, check the girls  
You're steppin' into another world  
See the man, he'll spin you alive  
But just remember to leave on time  
  
Heartache, city of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
Crazy people in heartache city  
City of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city, it's a city of sin  
  
Check the star club, see the stars  
See the action  
In the back street bars  
Lookin' for love  
You're in the wrong place  
Tricks for kicks  
Can you stand the pace  
  
Heartache, city of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
Crazy people in heartache city  
City of heartache city  
City of heartbreak pity  
Heartache city  
  
Hit the city, hit the night  
Crazy people, neon light  
You pay your money  
It's no real crime  
But just remember to leave on time

And if it's bad  
Don't let it get you down  
You can take it  
And if it hurts  
Don't let them see you cry  
You can make it  
  
Just hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
And if they stare, just let them  
Burn their eyes on you moving  
And if they shout, don't let it change  
A thing that you're doing  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
Hold your head up  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
And if they stare, just let them  
Burn their eyes on you moving  
And if they shout, don't let it change  
A thing that you're doing  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head high  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman

Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up, woman  
Hold your head up

Lost, lost like a precious flame  
The ashes burn on  
The ghost of a love we had  
Tries to hold on, tries to hold on  
  
No communication  
All systems are down  
No new conversation  
Never a sound, never a sound  
  
What's the point in holdin' on  
When the spirit is gone, holdin' on  
What's the point in holdin' on  
When the spirit is gone  
  
Cold, cold as the empty night  
Deep in your eyes  
I know there's no truth, no light  
Only your lies, only your lies  
  
The circle's broken  
The damage is done  
The crystal lies  
Smashed on the floor  
  
Your presence has left me now  
Your spirit has gone  
The ghost of a love we had  
Tries to hold on, tries to hold on  
  
The circle's broken  
The damage is done  
So what's the point in holdin' on

I was born an only boy  
Away from palm of water  
Never heard of right or wrong  
I was given words to use  
But I knew I was different  
They wanted me to play along  
  
How much fear can I keep  
Locked away inside me  
Will all these words  
Disguise my pain  
When all your scriptures fell  
And leave us in the open  
I will survive and try again  
  
Here comes the holy roller  
Here comes the book of life  
Don't come knockin' round here  
'Cause you ain't no friend of mine  
Here comes the ghost of holy  
He comes to twist your mind  
Don't come knockin' round here  
'Cause you ain't no friend  
Ain't no friend of mine  
  
What is the price that you've put  
On your own salvation  
Count the costs for savin' souls  
Where is the sense in all this  
Door-to-door damantion  
When you're just left out in the cold

Don't throw it all away  
Hear what I've gotta say  
Because you're always on my mind  
I've got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I don't want to waste my time  
So won't you hear my out  
Because it's all about when  
I come home again to you  
You're such a little child  
You're gonna drive me wild  
As I just don't know what to say  
I got an eye on you  
And only you will do  
And I don't want to get in your play  
Hesitate, because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
You make me feel so old  
Just like I have been told  
Because it's always up to you  
Oh baby, hear me out  
I've done all my time  
And I don't want to be misused  
So please don't hesitate  
Because I cannot wait  
Till I come home again to you  
Can't waste all my time  
Give me all today  
Well it's on my mind  
You can't own me  
When all I want to be  
But I don't want to waste all my time  
Hear me out  
Because I'll scream and out  
When I come home again to you  
Home to you ...

Sonny's out strolling, ambling slowly, washed in  
Amber street lights, a Mexican wind blows in  
Takin' a hold of Angelina's hair and her halo  
Motors running, muffling the sound of the street talk  
  
A big deal's goin' down in another hot night  
In a cold town, got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Johnny's got spare change in his pocket, a ring and a watch  
To hock for a sweet ride, a one way ticket hidden in his shoe  
These last few hours he says, he'll spend with you  
He's leavin' home without a trace, no forwarding address  
  
He'll never have to face another hot night in a cold town  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold town  
  
Well, the losers and the groovers  
And the corner boys are hangin' around  
Runnin' in and out of doorways, up and down  
The stairways, stray dogs headed for the pound  
  
In another hot night in a cold town, got you  
Got yourself a hot night in a cold, cold town, cold town  
It's just another hot night in a cold town  
Such a cold town

You know you light my candle  
You knew you load my gun  
You're way too hot to handle  
There's nothing we ain't done  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Give it to me  
  
Mouth full of hot persuasion  
You face me upside down  
A love for all occasions  
You won't catch me foolin' around  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
I can't, can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Oh, I need to know you're near me  
I need you by my side  
You keep my tank on empty  
You keep me up all night  
  
Give me your love  
Give me that hot persuasion  
Oh no, can't get enough  
Give me that hot persuasion  
  
Give me your hot persuasion  
I can't get enough, get enough  
I've done hot persuasion

I want to be free  
  
As I wake up everyday  
With no new songs to play  
Feeling like I ought to  
Pack my bag and run  
My imagination flies  
To some other sunny skies  
Where I felt so good  
And everything was done  
  
And my time was my own  
And my heart felt so free  
  
I don't mind a little rain  
But it doesn't seem the same  
When the clouds shut out  
Your beauty from my eyes  
There's a storm inside my head  
And I know it doesn't lead  
To a clearer day  
When nobody will cry  
  
I can't stand here alone  
And I need to be free  
  
So bring fire and bring steel  
For you know the way I feel  
Bring a silver horse  
To carry me away  
I'm no stranger, I'm a friend  
And my pain will never end  
Till the world will let us  
Live our lives as one  
  
And our time is our own  
And our hearts can be free  
  
I want to be free

I don't mind  
If you steal my last dime  
Just leave me anytime  
And I'll get, get along fine  
I don't really know why  
But I know I'll get by  
If I don't I'll die tryin'  
  
If it rains again  
I'm gonna fly to the sun  
'Cause nothing gets done  
Just sitting, sitting around  
Look at the way it's been  
Just waitin' and wonderin'  
I've just got to keep trying  
  
Looking for gold in the sky  
Gets kinda rough  
Maybe I'm to blame  
'Cause I didin't look hard enough  
But I still get the feeling  
That it shouldn't be so tough  
  
So I won't mind, I, I won't mind  
I won't mind, I, I won't mind  
  
So I won't mind  
I, No, I won't mind  
I won't mind, I, said I won't mind

You came to me  
With all of your lies  
And I was taken in so well  
It took me quite a time  
To see the disguise  
You made it very hard to tell  
Now here you are again  
But you're begging in vain  
'Cause I really don't want to know  
  
You came to me  
With a little bit of charm  
You had me down on my knees  
I didn't really think  
There was any harm  
But all you ever did was tease  
You took all the love  
That I ever had to give  
There was nothing left to show  
  
Well, I remember everything  
Everything around me  
The long dark of winter  
Till the breath of spring  
Came close enough to drown me  
  
So I'm gonna keep on trying  
Till I feel like dying  
And I lay down and pass away  
But that won't happen till tomorrow  
And by then I can  
Borrow another day  
So I'm gonna keep on trying

In a forest known as heartbreak  
In a clearing in the wood  
'Cross a pathway called confusion  
Toward the garden of delight  
  
You'll reach the river of desire  
And meekly try and cross it  
While the valley of love  
Keeps avoiding you  
Because it's only an illusion  
Only an illusion  
  
Upon the hill of high ideals  
You begin to wonder if it's real  
You are reaching sleep's oasis  
You begin to wonder how you feel  
  
But it happens so quickly  
It doesn't fit into your scenes  
Tossin' and turnin'  
The star of so many scenes  
It's only an illusion  
It's only an illusion

How strange when  
You know the feeling  
That something ain't right  
You're fooled by the need of being  
You're blind to the light  
Don't ask where  
The stranger leads you  
He'll show you the way  
Just go out and make your conquest  
You've something to say  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive and I'm me  
I've just got to be free  
I'm alive to the world  
  
There's been so much  
Bad time wasted  
Just look and you'll see  
We've got so much going for us  
It's not just a dream  
Let's look and we'll find the answers  
To questions I've made  
We'll reach out for new beginnings  
Let love show the way  
  
Let's leave our past behind  
The love can make us blind  
But now we know  
That we're alive

Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
The troopers are coming,  
They want me dead not alive,  
Gonna run in the danger,  
When they open fire.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home.  
Don't cry,  
Little sister  
  
In the cold hearted winter,  
Dogs are running at my back,  
The nightmare is coming in,  
And I'm on this frozen track.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
If you think I'm guilty  
And I'm just a gambling man  
Well no one is above the law,  
I'm gonna have to make a stand.  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home.  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Across the land,  
They're getting closer.  
I keep my ear to the ground  
They ride me down,  
Got no mercy  
But I never will be found  
Oh little sister,  
Don't you cry,  
You know I cannot stay  
I gotta find a place,  
A place to hide  
'Cos the blood hounds know my way  
  
It's the same old lies,  
Don't believe what you hear about me  
I'm gonna fight 'till it's over,  
And face that hanging tree  
  
Don't cry,  
Little sister I won't be coming home  
Don't cry  
Little sister I'll fight this one alone  
  
Red blood on the white snow  
Red blood on the white snow  
  
Into the wild

There I was on a July morning  
Looking for love  
With the strength  
Of a new day dawning  
And the beautiful sun  
  
At the sound  
Of the first bird singing  
I was leaving for home  
With the storm  
And the night behind me  
And a road of my own  
  
With the day came the resolution  
I'll be looking for you  
La la la la  
  
I was looking for love  
In the strangest places  
Wasn't a stone  
That I left unturned  
Must have tried more  
Than a thousand faces  
But not one was aware  
Of the fire that burned  
  
In my heart, in my mind, in my soul  
La la la la  
  
There I was on a July morning  
I was looking for love  
With the strength  
Of a new day dawning  
And the beautiful sun  
  
And at the sound  
Of the first bird singing  
I was leaving for home  
With the storm  
And the night behind me  
Yeah, and a road of my own

By tomorrow morning  
At the early dawn  
I gotta hit the road  
So long lady  
Till another day, right now  
I gotta be movin' on  
There's another town and  
The singer needs a song  
I know you're on your own  
I'll be back before too long  
I gotta do what I gotta do  
And you know how  
My heart loves to run, I gotta ride  
  
Keep on ridin'  
Keep on ridin' now  
  
There's a city waiting  
And a railroad station  
Where my face is known  
And an old hotel  
That I know so well  
It's a little bit like home  
It's a situation  
Not of my own choosing  
And though a gamblin' man  
Would say that I was losing  
I started out to win  
And I'll do it again  
I'm never givin' in  
'Cause if it comes down  
To my heart, or to my pride  
I'm gonna ride  
  
Keep on ridin', keep on ridin'  
Keep on ridin', yeah  
Keep on ridin', keep on ridin'  
  
And I know you say  
I'm driftin', driftin' on a dream  
You'd better watch your step boy  
It may not be what it seems  
I just can't shake  
This feeling here inside  
This heart of mine  
Keeps tellin' me to ride, ride, ride

Looking out at the open space,  
There's a new war beginning,  
God my head is spinning  
I had to live cause I thought it was too late,  
To far arised,  
Now I am breathing,  
Now I am seeing,  
All the love that is flowing,  
Confidence is growing,  
Riding high on the magic carpet,  
Way ahead of time.  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
Who cares about right or wrong,  
When it's down to the feeling,  
Sets my head on wheeling,  
You know it takes no warning signs,  
To know what's going on,  
And the hands,  
Are touching hands,  
When we turn to eachother,  
From the sky to the cudder,  
And untill our lifetime is coming down,  
I'm living on,  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
Looking out at the open space,  
There's a new war beginning,  
God your head is spinning,  
Flying over the wide horizon,  
Far away from time,  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
  
We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,  
It calls our name.  
And everyone will shine,  
Truth is yours and mine,

(new perceptions)  
You say her love has gone forever  
And something has  
Gone from your soul  
It's left you so cold  
Though you wish  
You had the answer  
The question is always untold  
Always on hold  
What's in the mirror  
What do you see  
It's a logical progression  
When you think that  
You lost all that time  
It's all in your mind  
What's in the mirror  
What do you see  
Lay down now and close your eyes  
It's only just begun  
'cause mind and body  
Flow in perpetual motion  
Set free all your memories  
They're tearing you apart  
'cause you know that  
Love is the only direction  
That reputation that you live by  
Says something about what's inside  
Nowhere to hide  
There is no amount of heartache  
That could ever  
Wash over this burning  
Forever learning  
Look in the mirror  
Will you do it all again  
You got time on your side  
You know you'll find  
The truth within you  
You got time on your side  
As the seconds tick away  
Love is waiting for you  
You got time on your side  
You say her love has gone forever  
And the image has left you so cold  
Still in your soul  
There's no way  
You're gonna turn back  
You'll never wash over this burning  
Forever learning  
Look in the mirror  
Will you do it all again  
Lay down now and close your eyes  
It's only just begun  
'cause mind and body  
Flow in perpetual motion  
You got time on your side  
As the seconds tick away  
Love is waiting for you  

Will you risk your reputation  
I don't know  
You just don't know  
What you're saying  
Anymore  
You know beggars  
Can't be choosers  
And it's fair  
We may win, we may be losers  
I don't care, no no no  
  
Oh baby, I just can't stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
  
I hear every word you're saying  
They're all lies  
But with every breath you're taking  
You're thinking of  
Ways to say goodnight  
  
Baby, I just can't stand  
Another lonely night  
So come on over and save me  
Save me from another lonely night  
Come on over  
Come and save me

She's lost in the night  
She's out of my sight  
Gotta find her again  
She's out of my life  
Gotta find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Will I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow she's gone  
She's lost in the night  
Out of my sight  
Will I find her again  
Taken my life  
Have to find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the dawn  
How can I ever find her  
She's just a shadow  
Missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night, she's gone  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Can I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow, missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night  
She's lost in the night  
And I don't the reason  
Will I find her again  
She's out of my sight  
But I can't lose this feeling  
Will I find her again  

(know yourself)  
This is our world, our future  
These are our times  
I believe we have to see  
In silence there's no mystery  
The world is so busy talking  
What do they know  
They're missing out on being alive  
Words are turning into lies  
We're looking for love to guide us  
What do we know  
The truth is never to be told  
It's waiting there inside your soul  
The innocent join  
In fighting so easily  
In a world of pain and war  
Who knows what they're fighting for  
What they're fighting for  
Oh, what they're fighting for  
What they're fighting for  
Many rivers running out to sea  
One heart with a cry for love  
Many dreamers in a moonlit sky  
One sigh and they are gone  
Love is the only direction  
That leads to truth  
Knowing in your heart what's right  
You'll walk upon the sea of light  
There's something  
In love and silence  
That you can find  
Know yourself and all around  
Listen to the only sound  

I tried to give you love  
That was ever flowing  
I tried to give a love  
That could be so true  
But you wanted less  
Than I had to offer  
What was I to do  
I tried to bare a soul  
That would swear devotion ?  
I tried to promise dreams  
I would make come true  
But you said that love was  
A game for children  
Here I stand, a fool  
  
Love is blind  
Blinded by love  
You're all I can see in my eyes  
My mind says, stop  
But my heart says, go  
And oh, how it hurts to find  
It's true when they say that  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
  
I told myself if there  
Was a chance to show you  
Just how good a love affair could be  
But love was something that  
You had never given  
I just couldn't see  
I closed my eyes to all that  
You never gave me  
? my heart didn't wanna see  
How you played around  
And how well you showed me  
How wounded love can be  
  
Love is blind  
Blinded by love  
You're all I can see in my eyes  
My mind says, stop  
But my heart says, go  
Oh, how it hurts to find  
It's true when they say that  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
So blind

It's gotta be love  
(La la la la)  
  
It's gotta be love or nothing  
You gotta make up your mind  
'cause you're running out of time  
You know it's your game  
And the winner takes all  
It's time for you to realize  
There's gonna be no compromise  
It's gonna be love  
It's gonna be love or nothing at all  
It's gonna be love or nothing  
  
La

La

It's gotta be love

Or nothing at all.  
  
I've thought about a new beginning  
But you know your heart's not in  
There's something inside  
That ain't hearing my call.  
  
And each new misty morning  
Brings a constant warning  
It's gotta be love  
It's gotta be love or nothing at all.

You gimme your love.  
  
It's no good coming in the back seat  
In the name of love  
Or tryin' to be somebody  
That you know you're not  
Sneaking out the back door  
At the dead of night  
'cause you're never gonna find out  
What it's really like.

And I'm losin' con'

She's got an eye on you  
There's nowhere to hide  
She keeps her motives still  
Deep down inside  
  
She shows no mercy, no  
She plays it rough  
She don't want no money  
She just wants to love  
  
Love stealer, raw dealer  
Heart breaker, love taker  
Yeah yeah...  
She walks in the shadows  
  
As she waits for the night  
She gets what she's looking for  
She knows how to fight  
If you see her coming  
  
Then you'd better know  
If your love's for the taking  
She'll steal the show  
She just can't go round there first  
  
Facing the joint  
Then she'll move in  
And get right to the point  
So keep your love locked away  
  
Don't let it show  
Or the love stealer will rock you  
For more than you'll know

Well, the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
Yes, the very first time  
I saw you darling  
Not one single word  
Would come to my lips  
  
You see, I was so afraid  
You wouldn't love me  
I want to tell you right now  
I was frightened right down  
To my fingertips  
  
So baby, when you went away  
That unlucky day last September  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
Baby baby baby  
When you went away  
I was like a little lost boy  
In the wilderness  
  
And I've just been sitting here  
Thinking of everybody  
I've ever known  
Well, you know  
I still love you the best  
Yeah, the best

When you look inside  
My magic lantern  
All the world is yet unseen  
Try to gaze into  
The yellow glowing  
To get a reflection of me  
In a land of make believe and magic  
You can be just anything you feel  
You think that what you're in is a dream  
But know that the lantern is viewing  
View the magic lantern  
Take a trip around the world  
View the magic lantern  
There's a thousand  
Mysteries unfurled  
And I know one of them  
I remember your face  
Can't remember the place  
Here on our own  
Living alone  
You can dream that  
You're a man of power  
Ready to be happy with your gold  
Without love your mind is going sour  
Money's no good when you're old  
View the magic lantern  
You can have the sky above  
Yeah, the magic lantern  
You'll buy everything but love  
Everything but love  

I walked you to your doorstep  
Believin' we could make a little love  
And I let you have my heart  
I was as certain as the stars above  
  
Looked here and there  
Every everywhere  
I even searched beyond the dawn  
But you were nowhere to be found  
And I was going round and round  
Lost like I'd never been born  
  
Time after time  
I've lost my love for a rhyme  
A reason seemed good enough  
You always put me down  
While you made me run around  
I can't take anymore of that stuff  
  
Time after time  
I've lost my love for a rhyme  
And my reason  
Seemed good enough  
You always put me down  
And you make me run around  
I can't take anymore of that stuff

Mister majestic fires a gun  
Mister majestic  
He got a lie on his tongue  
You can't help but listen  
He got a way with words  
Don't ask useless questions  
Unless you want to  
Leave this world  
Madam odessa carries a knife  
Across to the jailhouse  
In her pretty style  
She ain't looking out for business  
She got a way with words  
She is gonna take that man  
For what he done to her  
This was how the west was won  
Lawless and unruly  
Now I guess what's done, is done  
She took her old man in cold blood  
He hit the deck  
With that si-si-si-sickening thud  
Life was cheap, that's what we  
Always heard about  
It was over something stupid  
They could have talked it out  
This was how the west was won  
Lawless and unruly  
Now I guess what's done, is done  
Billy thought that billy was right  
Where is the killer, nobody knows  
He's waiting in the dark saloon  
For night to close  
He tried to cheat  
At the gambling table  
A stranger pulls and fires  
As he falls he sees the stranger is  
Madam in disguise  
This was how the west was won ...  

(enlightened woman)  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
Her sun pours down like liquid gold  
To chase away the sorrows  
Her clothes are like a million stars  
Made of tears and rainbows  
And all the while  
Her senses smile into my life  
She moves just like an angel  
She's a mistress of all time  
Just like the restless  
To a mission bell  
I must run to her  
Meet her everywhere  
As her music fills the universe  
She leaves the dancing visions  
Of her image on the water  
And precious stones upon the shore  
From every distant corner  
Like diamonds in the light  
They shine beyond the stars  
She moves just like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves me like an angel  
She's the mistress of all time  
She moves me like an angel  
A voice of pure emotion  
Her tears are like a rainbow  

I was missing my  
Little Miss Misty Eyes  
She made my life complete  
I'd been waiting on  
True love's sweet surprise  
And it tasted so sweet  
Oh it tasted so sweet  
  
I could hear  
The sound of the love bell  
Told me all it could tell  
And the sight of  
The blue moon rising  
Told me all was well  
Told me all was well  
  
I was just driftin'  
As a wind blown wave  
Like a stricken ship  
I thought I'd never be saved  
So far below me  
There seemed so much more  
Yet a man has to know  
What he's looking for  
  
Something unknown  
Kept my life turning around  
But I couldn't get near to  
Putting my feet on the ground  
With all that I had  
Any man would be glad  
But my everything was nothing  
So what made me sad  
  
I was missing my  
Little Miss Misty Eyes  
She made my life complete  
I was waiting on  
True love's sweet surprise  
And it tasted so sweet  
It tasted so sweet  
  
Farewell to that same lonely road  
I've seen the last of  
That heavy load  
No more blues about paying dues  
It's time for reaping  
All the seeds I sowed

I'm at the point of no return  
I'm watching the candle burn  
Both ends  
There's a lesson we  
Both can learn, this time  
So if you wanna make my day  
There's something  
You've gotta say  
Now please don't laugh  
And turn away, this time  
I don't wanna make a fuss  
But this is the time for us  
And I ain't gonna miss the buss  
This time  
  
No return  
So there'll be no turning back  
Once I know that  
You'll be by my side  
No return  
Maybe you'll give me all the love  
That you always felt  
You had to hide  
No return  
I've come a thousand miles  
Across the ocean  
But that ain't half  
As far as my emotion  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
While on my way down the avenue  
I had to stop for a drink or two  
Or three  
Now not that I was stalling you  
For time  
It's just I wanted to feel my best  
And I almost passed the test  
I need your lovin' to do the rest  
This time  
  
No return, so please don't ever do  
What you've done  
So many times before  
No return  
Because I've made up my mind  
That this time I'll make it  
Through' your door  
No return, I rode above the clouds  
So far below me  
But didn't get as high as  
When you hold me  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
I'm at the point of no return  
I'm watching the candle burn  
Both ends  
There's a lesson we  
Both can learn, this time  
I don't wanna make a fuss  
But this is the time for us  
And I ain't gonna miss the buss  
This time  
  
No return  
So there'll be no turning back  
Once I know that  
You'll be by my side  
No return  
Maybe you'll give me all the love  
You always felt you had to hide  
No return, I rode above the clouds  
So far below me  
But didn't get as high as  
When you hold me  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return  
  
No return, so please don't ever do  
What you've done  
So many times before  
No return  
Because I've made up my mind  
That this time I'll make it  
Through' your door  
No return  
I've come a thousand miles  
Across the ocean  
But that ain't half  
As far as my emotion  
Now I've reached  
The point of no return

On the rebound, on the rebound  
That's how you fell for me  
That's how you changed my life  
You cut me like a knife  
  
On the rebound, on the rebound  
You came, you saw, you took  
It only took one look  
And lady, I was hooked  
  
On the rebound, it's a replay  
Your love was on the rebound  
On the rebound  
You came and took my soul  
You came and left a hole  
Where your love used to be  
  
On the rebound, on the rebound  
You like to drown in your tears  
And after all these years  
You give your pain to me  
  
On the rebound, you came to me, babe  
On the rebound, to set you free  
On the rebound, too bad for me  
Your love was on the rebound  
  
You came to me  
To set you free  
To pray for me  
It's a replay  
You came to repay  
It's a replay  
To set you free  
Just a replay  
Your love was  
Just a replay

One day  
  
Didn't I tell ya  
Everything was gonna be alright  
I never doubted  
It was just a matter of time  
And though I've traveled  
Across the desert of despair  
I know I'll get there one day  
  
How times have changed  
I better re-arrange it everything  
But it can't change the love I bring  
When I get back home to you  
I am the same  
It's just a game that I chose to play  
But remember I can lose  
As fast as I won one day  
  
I still remember the hole in the wall  
Where we all sat though  
You said we'd fall  
The dusty yard and  
The broken down barn  
Where you and me  
Used to share a yarn  
But it's gone now  
  
But didn't I tell ya  
That everything was  
Gonna be alright  
I never doubted  
It was just a matter of time  
Though I've traveled  
Across the desert of despair  
I know I'll get there one day  
One day  
I'll get there one day

One more night  
  
City lights are  
Burning in the distance  
Seems they're tellin' me  
To hurry home  
But I can't push these  
Wheels of mine no harder  
So hold on baby for  
One more night alone  
  
There's time for me to take just  
One look over my shoulder  
One last glance at  
What's been going on  
'Cause I'll be there at  
First light in the morning  
We'll pick up the pieces  
And baby, then we'll be long gone  
  
Pick up the pieces and run with me  
As fast as you can  
You know you always said  
I was the man  
Pick up the pieces, let's do it now  
Let's say our last farewell  
Tomorrow may be too late  
As far as I can tell

People say I run too fast  
But they don't understand  
I'm livin' out the best of times  
The way I always planned  
Oh, little girl you got a dirty smile  
Come along, walk with me  
Down the golden mile  
On my tongue the taste of love  
Never felt so good  
Easy come, no more leaving  
By the back door  
One on one  
I could live like this forever  
One on one  
Take me all the way to heaven  
One on one  
Stone by stone, frame by frame  
We got this love together  
No more headache in my heart  
No more under pressure  
Baby with you I can do anything  
Just a touch is not enough  
With you it's everything  
On my tongue the taste of love  
Never felt so good  
Easy come  
No more waitin' at the back door  
One on one  
I could live like this forever  
One on one  
Take me all the way to heaven  
One on one  
Love runs in so easily  
One on one  
All you give is what I need  

There's been some  
Changes in my time  
But this one's playing  
Games with my mind  
Stopped in my tracks  
No thought of looking back  
The lady's got me tied up  
But I've already made my mind up  
One way or another  
She'll be mine  
  
It wasn't anything I could define  
None of those ringing bells  
Giving me a sign  
I just took a look  
But I was on the hook  
The lady's got me tied up  
Don't know how it's gonna wind up  
One way or another  
Gonna be all right  
  
I'm beginning to think  
That a forever kind of love  
Is the kind of love  
I'll look for forever  
But still I'll love and love again  
One way or another  
I will find my friend  
  
I knew some day my heart  
Would lead my head  
Beyond the path  
My chosen life had led  
I'd been so sure  
But where is the cure  
The lady's got me real good  
But you can't say  
What I should do  
One way or another  
It's all over now  
  
One way or another

I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
I've been wandering inside my head  
Don't care what you think of me  
You only see what you want to see  
So here I am in my paradise  
In my heaven everything is alright  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
I've been around for a long time  
Losing my way but not my mind  
So I drink and play you along  
But who cares when the fire burns on  
So I'm out here in my paradise  
It's my heaven and it feels so right  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young at heart  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
Live your life - in this time  
We've only today - drink life's wine  
Don't be fooled  
Don't believe what they say  
Don't believe what they say  
I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
Say what you like  
You're not in my head  
Time goes with each breath we take  
It rules the world the day we awake  
So here I sit here in my paradise  
Don't give a damn everything is alright  

Out on the street, dead on my feet  
At the mercy of the stone-cold night  
It's hard to compete  
In a dead-end street  
With frustration in your line of sight  
Do you ever stop to think  
Do you ever stop at all  
Do you have the time to feel  
And if you do  
Do you know the feeling's real  
  
Followed a sign that  
Pointed the way  
And I found myself  
Right back at that start  
I like to feel good  
I've tried feeling sad  
But I can't stand a broken heart  
Don't wanna wait till my dyin' day  
To realize  
I guess I'm lucky in  
A strange kinda way  
'cause it's clear before my eyes  
  
A gray cloud they say  
Hides a surprise  
But it rained until I lost my belief  
Just close your eyes  
We'll show you the way  
But I believe I've lost my faith  
One man speaks and one man does  
While another soul wields the sword  
I hear you all, but I still can't see  
Just who it is  
Who speaks the chosen word

Tryin' to make it back  
To my old home town  
I've been driving since  
The break of dawn  
Got a feeling like a fever  
Burning in my brain  
When I see her  
It'll be all gone  
  
Pacific highway  
Getting nearer now  
And I feel like  
The dream is coming true  
Pacific highway  
Getting closer now  
I don't need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
Take another turning  
On the old creek road  
Making sure I don't get lost  
I'm hoping to hell  
My taco's reading right  
Get ahead no matter  
What the cost  
  
Tryin' to take it easy  
On the old home stretch  
But city limits come into sight  
I'm getting ready for my Betty  
God how I missed that girl  
We're rock-n-rollin'  
Through the night  
  
I don't need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
I only got five more miles, yeah  
Only four more miles, yeah  
I only got three miles, two miles  
One mile to go  
  

I feel you trying  
Though in my heart  
I know you're lying  
And though your love  
For me is dying  
I see you crying  
  
It's the pain of your secret heart  
Bringing you to tears  
Filling you with fears  
For your mind and for your soul  
  
I touch you softly now  
Borne on by hope  
Until the end somehow  
I am a man and I must keep my vow  
I must go on  
  
But the wall of your secret heart  
Keeps my distance clear  
Helps my footsteps fall  
Back in line inside my mind  
  
What's the use you turned me loose  
And left me here to cry  
Where's the love we talked about  
Where's my sunny sky  
  
Secret hearts and sorry tales  
Will never help love grow  
Spread your wings my daunted soul  
The time has come to go  
  
I will not be hurried down  
Or blackened by your lies  
I must go and find my dream  
And live in paradise

Party, party, party, it's party time

So you better watch out  
I'm lookin' for some fun  
I'm lookin' for a party  
Some physical attraction  
Should get me started

Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo in my mind  
I've played with fire  
Burned my fingers  
Now I'm gonna take my time  
You don't have to shout about it  
Can't you see it obvious  
Feel ? it's getting close to comfort  
Why you makin' such a fuss?  
  
Take your time with  
What you're doin'  
And you'll see the skies appear  
Seen and heard it all before her  
Now you understand my fear  
Can't you see the time will tell us  
How it's gonna always be  
You can wrap me  
Around your finger  
And I ain't no mystery  
  
Playing for time  
That's all I can do  
I'm playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
  
You can push me every which way  
Hey I got no place to fall  
Guess you're gonna rue your bullshit  
When your back's against the wall  
Louder now that's what the games go ?  
And I bought the devil now ?  
You can get to dream about it  
I won't need one anyhow  
  
Playing for time  
That's all I can do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
Playing for time  
That's all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love  
  
Oh, you don't have to shout about it  
Can't you see it obvious  
Feel it's getting close for comfort  
Why you making such a fuss?  
Travel down the road of heartache  
Hear an echo my mind  
Played with fire, burned my fingers  
Now I'm gonna take my time  
  
Playing for time  
Before I fall in love with you  
Playing for time  
That's all I want to do  
Playing for time  
Before I fall  
Playing for time  
All I want to do  
Playing for time

Cold winds and cloudy skies  
Turned to sweetness in her eyes  
Fantasies I realized  
Came to life to my surprise  
  
Rain came and took her away  
Just when I thought  
She was here to stay  
Sun gone I was left high and dry  
Love came by and touched me  
And kissed me so long  
  
Shine hard October moon  
Eagle take me to her soon  
Run swiftly silver stream  
Find my love or let me dream  
  
Half of me is all of her  
I'd be much happier if I were whole  
All my words and wisdom fall  
The poet's justice  
Leads me to my goal  
Leads me to my goal

You say you're gonna testify  
Lie away, lie away  
So you're gonna gun me down  
Go ahead, fire away  
You say you'll bring the curtain down  
Turn around, walk away  
You're gonna close this theater down  
Go ahead, stop the play  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
Someone waits, in the wings  
You flick the switch, the dancer falls  
You deal the cards, the dealer calls in your game  
  
[Chorus]  
Poor little rich girl  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
Your money burns, we all have wings  
You say you're gonna leave this town  
Fly away, fly away  
So you gonna shoot me down  
  
Go ahead  
Your money burns  
Your money stings  
Another script, left on the floor  
Another face is shown the door in your game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Poor little rich girl  
Your money talks, you pull the strings  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
Your money burns, we all have wings  
In the game, poor little rich girl  
It's easy come, it's easy go  
It's a shame, poor little rich girl  
You lock the door, close the show

I'll go down fightin'  
But rather be delightin'  
All the people that come to see  
The Devil's from Chicago  
Now where the hell do they go  
When we get in our limousines  
  
'Cause we just want to be  
Where it's all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When it's over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
They're gone  
I said they're gone  
  
You're our kind of people  
You're the church  
And we're the steeple  
But we're all inside the hall  
If we've got what you need  
Then we'll give you the speed  
To get up and have a ball  
  
'Cause we just want to be  
Where it's all going on  
But tell me what do you do  
When it's over  
And everyone who  
Loved you is gone  
  
You're just another  
Prima Donna of rock 'n' roll  
So please let me know  
When you want me to go

Time has come to say goodbye  
To the broken memories  
They're locked inside like prisoners  
In a place that no-one sees  
  
Stayed up late with a friend of mine  
Southern comfort till dawn  
We talked about the pains of love  
Should've known from  
The start you were wrong  
  
I'm just a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
Tired blood runs through my veins  
But I can't get no sleep  
You lock my heart  
In these prison walls  
This place I've got to leave  
  
I'm a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
The sky is gray, it's raining  
Like the storm in my heart  
There ain't no use explaining  
'cause I'm leaving, leaving  
  
Won't somebody set me free  
Take me away from this misery  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely  
Won't somebody set me free  
Please, please, set me free

Lady oh lady you're  
Driving me crazy  
You brought out the devil in me  
You turned on my fire  
With words of desire  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
  
You're sending me reeling  
With love that you're giving  
Spinning my poor heart around  
The feelings that should be  
Have finally saved me  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
  
Ain't no use in trying  
I never would deny that  
I love you love you  
Ain't no doubt about it  
I just can't live without it  
I love you love you  
Yes I love you, I really love you  
  
Don't know what it is  
That you're putting down  
I only know it ain't no game  
I only know what you're doing to me  
And baby you're the one to blame  
  
Lady oh lady you're  
Driving me crazy  
You're flying me high  
With your eyes  
There's no use in trying  
Ain't no use denying  
You sure put the lovin'  
Sure put the lovin' on me  
Yes, you did  
Sure put your lovin'  
Sure put your lovin' on me  
  
Put your lovin', put your lovin' on me

It's raining outside  
But that's not unusual  
But the way that I'm feeling  
Is becoming usual  
I guess you could say  
The clouds are moving away  
Away from your days  
And into mine  
  
Now it's raining inside  
It's kind of a shame  
And it's getting to me  
A happy man  
Why should you want to  
Waste all my time  
The world is yours  
But I am mine  
  
Rain, rain, rain in my tears  
Measuring carefully my years  
Shame, shame, shame in my mind  
See what you've done to my life  
  
See what you've done to my life

Girl, before you go now  
There's one thing I wanted to do  
That's get you to come back  
Because I want to make love to you  
  
Got me real turned on  
Yes, you have  
  
But there's something in your eyes  
Telling me you have to go  
Something in your eyes  
But you're trying not to let it show  
  
Got me real turned on  
  
Next time you come over  
I'll buy you a bottle of wine  
Just take a little drink  
And everything will turn out fine  
Yes, it will  
  
Whoa baby, do you know  
What I've got in mind  
Can you guess what it is  
Or do you want it on the line  
  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned on

Red lights, on the highway  
Headlights, blinding my eye  
Red lights, keep me waiting  
White lights, drive me insane  
Red lights, in the city  
Streetlights, high in the night  
Searchlights, I'm looking for someone  
Red lights, young blood's alright  
  
Try as I can but ?  
I can't keep away  
No no no no way  
  
Red lights, she knows what I'm here for  
Headlights, look me in the eye  
Red lights, are you looking for danger  
White lights, drives me insane  
  
Try as I can but ?  
I can't keep away  
No no no, not for one day  
  
Red lights, no questions  
Streetlights 'c youth's desire?  
Red lights, burning desire  
White lights 'c put you to bed ?  
Red lights in the city  
Streetlights, shadow the night  
Sunshine, if you need some one  
Headlights, that young blood's alright  
  
Try as I can but ?  
I can't keep away  
Not today  
She brings me to my knees  
Try as I can but ?  
I can't keep away  
I want you babe?  
  
Red lights, oh, I want you  
Red lights, I need it  
Red lights, you get too heavy  
Red lights

Searching every day  
Looking every way  
Trying to make a connection  
To find a piece of the action  
Like a hungry poet  
Who doesn't know  
He is close to perfection  
Choice is the question  
  
Moonlight night  
After moonlight night  
Side by side  
They will see us ride  
But if they cared to look  
Then they would see  
It's our return to fantasy  
Fantasy, fantasy  
  
Can you understand  
That in every man  
There's a need to unwind  
That's never been defined  
Somewhere deep within  
There's another being  
You are somehow abusing  
By the person you're using  
  
Moonlight night  
After moonlight night  
Side by side  
They will see us ride  
But if they cared to look  
Then they would see  
It's just our return to fantasy  
Fantasy, fantasy  
  
Traveling faster than lightening  
Closer than ever before  
We can go on for you  
And take you nearer to  
The legend of mystery  
From the beginning of time  
Dreaming time dreaming  
We can return to  
The land of the good and the kind  
Time dreaming time dreaming  
Why don't you come to our party  
And open your minds  
  
In another place  
There's a newer face  
Like an unfinished painting  
Your creator is waiting  
The brush and pen describe  
What it is inside  
That will set your mind thinking  
While the others are sinking

She's a rich kid  
She wears diamond rings  
Knows how to walk  
Knows everything  
About love, she's not too sure  
  
What she's looking for  
Fresh from the woods  
Out on the street  
She's looking good  
Looking so neat  
She don't know if she should  
  
'Cause she don't know  
If she's bad or good  
She don't care if it  
Hurts her father  
She don't care if it  
  
Breaks her mother  
She don't care anymore  
She just wants what  
She's never had before  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, someone to love  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
Gotta have love, she'll get it  
All she needs is love  
  
She's never had it, someone to love  
She was a school boy's dream  
High school queen  
She had it all when she was sixteen  
Stayed away from boys  
'Cause she thought she'd get hurt  
  
Why did she listen to  
Her mother's words  
Couldn't go out  
Had to stay home  
And how she hated  
Being on her own  
She needs love like everybody else  
Now she's gonna  
Get some for herself  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, she needs love  
All she wants is love, she's ready  
She wants love  
And she's gonna get it  
All she needs is love  
She's gotta have it, someone

Wind it up, here comes the video  
It's that song again  
Turn it up, it's on the radio  
  
Charge me up, I got electric eyes  
I won't fall down  
Light me up  
Just like a christmas tree  
Or am I seeing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, never stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
And give me rock'n'roll  
Give me rock'n'roll  
  
Strap me in to the rocket ship  
I'm headin' for the sun  
Tune me in to the mother ship  
I must be seeing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, please don't stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
And give me rock'n'roll  
  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll ...  
  
Plug me in jack to jack  
Pin me to the wall  
Hey leave that on, I'm on MTV  
Now I'm seein' things  
  
Wind it up, here comes that video  
It's that song again  
Turn me up, I'm on the radio  
Or am I hearing things  
  
Wind it up, turn it up  
Charge me up, don't you stop  
Wind me up, plug me in, turn me on  
Give me rock'n'roll  
  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on the stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll  
Give me rock'n'roll  
Rockarama, it's on the video  
Rockarama on my radio  
Rockarama on my stereo  
Give me rock'n'roll ...

It came as the daybreak  
Must surely arrive  
Opened my eyes just  
To be sure I was alive  
Another day  
They're much the same  
Twentyfour hours for me  
To try again  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
  
It came as a judgement  
We all have to face  
Fickle hour you bring me joy  
You bring me disgrace  
I'll take your challenge  
Man against emotion  
I'll wager my beliefs  
Against my sin  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
Well, I'm rollin' on  
  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Yes, I am  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on  
  
Yes, I'm rollin' on  
To where I don't care  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
Rollin' down a road  
I've never seen  
Meeting people  
Seeing places I've never been  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Yes, I am  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
Rollin' on and on and on forever  
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on together  
  
I'm rollin' on. I'm rollin' on  
I'm rollin' on, I'm rollin' on  
Crystal ball  
You let me down again  
I'm rollin' on  
Well, I'm rollin'

Feels so cold, so alone  
An empty stage, no one home  
Feels so strange, susky  
No point in screaming, I won't be hurt  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Time has come so soon  
And time takes no prisoners, except in the womb  
There's no way out, no escape  
This silence is deafening, I have to cry out  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Set me free from this grief  
Am I forgiven, can I be saved?  
You've been so cold for so long  
This silence is deafening, was I so wrong?  
  
You're so cold, you're so cool  
It's so dark in this tomb  
  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Roll away the rock  
Take that rock rollin'  
  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
  
Roll away the rock  
You gotta roll the rock away  
Roll away the rock  
Roll the rock away  
  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
Roll the rock, rock away  
  
This silence is deafening  
This silence is deafening

The gates have opened  
Now I'm a free man  
My time is over  
I need a new plan  
But I've had no loving  
For a year and a day  
My lady's waiting  
Got a taste for her wine  
She's wearing money  
But none of it's mine  
She's been surviving  
While I've been wasting away  
  
[Chorus]  
Back in my room  
It ain't quite the same  
You can't hide it  
I'm onto your game  
  
Rough justice, there's no disguise  
And I can tell by  
The look in your eyes  
Rough justice, I've had my share  
I've done my time  
But I'm still running scared  
Rough justice  
Coming down on me  
Long arm of the law  
Never setting me free  
Rough justice, I bide my time  
  
Back in action, I'm riding the crest  
And putting all that  
I've learned to the test  
No complications  
Taking it day by day  
Freedom of movement  
Freedom of choice  
Free to be right back here  
With the boys  
Ready to listen  
But you've got nothing to say  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Rough justice

Somewhere in your eyes  
That very special glow  
Something drawing me  
To where I do not know  
I never really thought  
That I would lose myself  
Now I'm going faster  
Than anybody else  
  
You move without a sound  
And touch me with your hand  
Just like the rain that fondles  
Every grain of sand  
This thing we're gonna do  
It's just for you and me  
I'm gonna make it good  
Good as it can be  
  
Your kiss is sweeter now  
Your breath is getting warm  
We must take our time  
And last it through til dawn  
I wonder will it be  
Oh, I expect it to  
There have been other girls  
No-one else like you  
  
I feel a power here  
I never felt before  
And I begin to see  
What drives us to want more  
Oh, girl of all my dreams  
Please tell me if I'm wrong  
Because I've been blue  
But we belong  
  
As time passed and all too fast  
I just knew we couldn't last  
And I guessed that the end  
Was near at hand  
Though we tried our love inside  
It just crumpled up and died  
What went wrong  
I will never understand  
  
You tell me why  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
I don't want to be  
Alone again  
  
There's a line in a rhyme  
I was going to send to you  
It says, "All that is to be  
Will surely be"  
So oh, though you had to go  
'Cause you needed someone new  
Is there still a chance  
That you'll come back to me  
I want you back you see  
  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
How could you leave me  
Alone again  
I don't want to be alone again  
  
Somewhere in your eyes  
That very special glow  
Something drawing me  
To where I do not know  
I never really thought  
That I would lose myself  
But now I'm going faster  
Than anybody else  
  
You move without a sound  
And touch me with your hand  
Just like the waves that fondle  
Every little grain of sand  
This thing we're gonna do  
It's just for you and me  
And I'm gonna make it good  
Just you wait and see

Save it, save it,  
Save it all for me  
  
Save it, save it  
You've gotta save it all for me  
  
Gonna take my heart and my soul  
And lay it onto someone's daughter  
Gonna give out all that I got  
To the woman who sits by the water  
  
Gonna spend the rest of my time  
With the woman by the winding river  
Gonna let her know  
That I'll give her all  
That I got forever and ever  
  
She knows what I like  
She knows what I need  
And babe let me tell you  
She'll give it all to me

Everyone said that you'd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
You said on my lap that  
I wasn't the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you can't have ...  
You said on my lap that  
I wasn't the right kind of person  
What I wanna know is that  
Who in the show I am worse than  
But who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
And nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl  
Looking for something  
That you can't have ...  
Listen!  
Everyone said that you'd always  
Been left but you got there  
Here we are now when  
The rest of the show are not there  
Nobody knows by the look of  
Your clothes you're a schoolgirl  
Who would've guessed  
By the way that you're dressed  
You're a schoolgirl  
Oh, schoolgirl  

I got a solid silver reason  
I got something you'll never buy  
I've spent my life playing rock 'n' roll  
I wouldn't tell a lie  
  
Well, if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
There's a thunder, see it and wonder  
How to play the game, it's easy  
  
You know, we're gonna live forever  
You know we're never gonna die  
You see it's written across the sky tonight  
I'm gonna tell you why  
  
Because they've covered up the exits  
We got a spotlight just for you  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Hear me calling, stars are falling  
Taking me away  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Stand up, shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up, shout it out  
Rock 'n' roll  
  
Can't you feel we're gettin' stronger  
gettin' stronger every day  
There ain't nothing gonna stop us  
Oh, there ain't no way  
  
It's like a rolling ball of thunder  
You know, it's never gonna stop  
You know, it's gonna drag you under  
See me soaring, thunders roaring  
Things afraid again  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
Stand up, shout it out  
Sell your soul  
  
Stand up, shout it out  
Let the music take a hold  
Stand up, shout it out  
Rock 'n' roll  
  
I got a solid silver reason  
I got something you'll never buy  
I've spent my life with rock 'n' roll  
Oh no, would I lie?  
  
But if you want to taste the freedom  
Just let the music take a hold  
I'm possessed by rock 'n' roll  
There's a thunder, see it and wonder  
How to play the game, it's easy  
  
It's gonna drag you under  
Gonna take your heart and soul  
You gotta stand up  
You gotta shout, shout, shout, shout, shout it out  
?

I don't care if the rain don't shine  
Oh, I don't care if the sun don't fall  
You are the one in a million, child  
And you knew that I would call  
Thoughts of you alone with me  
I can't slow them down  
But I can't sleep at night  
Because you're not around  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be waiting for you girl  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
To be without you girl  
I've tried every kind of distraction  
But nothing will ease this pain  
There is only one solution, girl  
So why do you make me wait  
Got to say I didn't think  
That I could read your mind  
But I can't sleep at night  
'cause baby you're on mine  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
Oh, I miss you girl  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be without you  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
Just too long  

Don't try to be anything else  
But what you are  
Don't try to do anything else  
But the things you do  
'Cause I had a dream  
About seven stars  
And the seven good things  
That you are to me  
  
The very reason I'm livin'  
Is just for lovin' you  
And the seasons are changin'  
Makin' it all come true  
'Cause with the spring  
And clearing skies  
Love's soft light  
Will fill my eyes for you  
  
Who fills my head  
With these dreams  
As I'm leaving my mind  
Seven new stars are born  
Seven are waiting to die  
  
The very reason I'm livin'  
Is just for lovin' you  
And the seasons are changin'  
Makin' it all come true  
'Cause I had a dream  
About seven stars  
And the seven good things  
That you are to me

You're looking at me  
Like I must be mad  
But I've been through all this before  
You'll kick and kick until I'm down  
So don't think you're  
Comin' past my door, oh no  
  
You think that love is such a pain  
So the more it hurts  
The more you laugh  
Just take it and  
Shake it up and down  
Till you think you've had enough  
But you won't get enough of my love  
  
If you want to carry on  
In the same old way  
Treating everyone like a piece of dirt  
Just take it and  
Break it and throw it away  
There won't be anyone left to hurt  
  
North, South, East and West  
Wherever you go  
You'll find the same  
And the only way you'll ever learn  
Is to realize that you're to blame

Well, I've been on the road  
For a year or more  
And I've done a lot of things  
I never did before  
Now I want everyone  
To listen to my song  
And you can tell me  
When you've heard it  
If you think I'm wrong  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes, I'm so tired  
And I'm so uninspired  
Please help me  
  
Well I've seen 'em rise  
And I've seen 'em fall  
And I use to think that  
I was having a ball  
But I was kiddin' myself  
For a long long time  
But now I got myself a spoon  
And I'm feeling fine  
  
But I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
Yes, I'm so tired  
And I'm so uninspired  
Won't you please help me  
  
Where can you go  
Where can you go  
When there is no one  
To show a guiding light  
What did you say  
What did you say  
Have you been thinking about me  
Day and night  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Of everybody staring at me  
And I'm so, so tired  
I'm so uninspired  
Please help me  
Won't you please me

There's never a day  
When I've got nothing to do  
Something to me  
Might mean nothing to you  
  
So don't don't don't don't  
Look at me strangely now  
We'll find the line  
That's in the middle and run  
  
Something, something or nothing  
  
You say you love to spend days  
But I will save mine  
Waiting for the sun in your eyes  
To turn the river to wine  
  
But don't don't don't don't  
Look at me strangely now  
We're gonna find the line  
That's in the middle and run

I gotta stay in the race  
The die has been cast  
That's the way I'm going  
I tried to jump from the river  
That flows so fast  
But it just keeps flowing  
  
It's a hell of a journey  
A just can't wait  
There's no way I can hide it  
But it's a killer of a storm  
And it looks like rain  
I guess I'm got to ride it  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Ain't no question if you win or lose  
Whether it's cold or rainy  
Gotta find my place whatever I choose  
Never say if or maybe  
And there's so many turns that I can see  
In a world that I'm no stranger  
Survive in the face of danger  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know

I had a spider woman  
And she was so good  
She chained me  
In her web so tight  
I lost the freedom  
Of release that night  
So I stayed right by her  
  
I dreamt I saw a blind man  
Who was singing a song  
About a guy who  
Couldn't take no more  
And the meaning of  
The words he swore  
Told me go find her  
  
She was a spider woman  
But she was good to me  
Spider woman  
But she was good to me  
  
I told her 'bout my vision  
But she laughed in my face  
So I told her go  
And walk in the street  
But by the time  
She got past my feet  
I lost control

(realizing the new world)  
  
I know instinctively  
When something is right  
With no one there to save me  
You came into my life  
The words you whispered  
Still echo in my mind  
Forget about tomorrow  
Forget about time  
  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom - in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
There's no time to waste in this life  
There's no time at all  
So good to see the truth and touch  
The spirit of freedom  
  
I never thought that  
I could ever feel this way  
To see the warmest sunlight  
On a cold and rainy day  
Dawn wakes the silence  
And I know that I can't wait  
To hear the words  
I wanna say again and again  
  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom - in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
There's no time to waste in this life  
There's no time at all  
  
There's no time to waste in this life  
There's no time at all  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom - in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
There's no time to waste in this life  
There's no time at all  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom - in your soul

Everybody got somebody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Ain't' none of their business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up, walk away  
Nobody gives a damn for a  
Single thing you say  
  
I'm singing  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Here comes the thunder  
  
Hide money in your pocket  
Be nobody's fool  
Always think of number one  
That's my golden rule  
Take care of business  
Go for it with the best  
Be strong enough to take it  
Ain't no need to rest  
  
I'm singing  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Watch out for the thunder  
  
Bad times make you cry  
But the good times get you high  
  
I can't stand it  
I can't stand it no more  
  
Somebody, everybody  
Trying to make you feel real bad  
Ain't' nobody's business  
Talking behind your back  
Be strong in yourself  
Stand up, walk away  
Nobody's gonna listen  
To a single word you say  
  
Stay on top, never go under  
Lightning strikes  
Before you hear the thunder  
Stay on top, never go under  
Hold on tight  
Look out for the thunder  
  
Stay on top  
You've got to stay on top  
Stand up and sing it  
Stay on top  
Take care of business  
Stay on top

Take me across the water 'cause I need some place to hide.  
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride.  
  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.  
  
Well, there's a hundred miles of desert  
Lies between his hide and mine.  
I don't need no food, no water, Lord,  
'cause I'm running out of time.  
  
Fightin', killin',  
Wine and women gonna put me to my grave.  
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin'.  
Nothing left to save  
But my life.  
  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah  
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.  
  
Stood on a ridge and stunned religion  
Thinking the world was mine.  
I made my break and a big mistake,  
Stealing when I should have been buying.  
  
All that fightin', killin',  
Wine and women gonna put me to an early grave.  
Runnin', hidin', losin', cryin',  
Nothing left to save

You came on like an angel  
I didn't see the evil in your eyes  
I could see but I was blinded  
Oh, believed your lies  
  
You hit we with your promises  
You shot me, I fell to the ground  
Your promise of tomorrow  
When I looked, you were  
Nowhere to be found  
  
You set me up right from the start  
Stripped me of my dignity  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
You cut me and left me for dead  
  
You promised me a heaven  
Turned out to be one hell all the time  
The truth that you're pretending  
Was just a chorus of lies  
  
You set me up right from the start  
Strip me of my dignity  
And got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
Got me straight through the heart  
You cut me and left me for dead  
You cut me and left me for dead  
  
You came on like an angel  
Just like an angel  
You set me up  
  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
Got me straight through the heart  
You cut me, you left me  
Straight through the heart  
You never gave me a chance  
Got me straight thought the heart  
I'm bleeding, you're leaving  
Got me straight through the heart

Waiting by the window  
Staring at my shadow  
Not believing what I'd seen  
Touching but not feeling  
And wondering what I was dealing  
And not knowing where I'd been  
  
So I began walking  
To myself I was talking  
But didn't know which way to go  
Then I found a direction  
And now I needed some action  
But I should have just said no  
Should have said no  
  
Why won't you help me  
Or give me hand  
'Cause I'm close to becoming  
A suicidal man  
What I need is someone  
With a definite plan  
For I've waited for just about  
As long as I can  
  
Suicidal man, suicidal  
  
So on my travels  
Still with all my troubles  
I found someone who cared  
The answer was so easy  
That all she did to please me  
Was to say a problems smaller  
When it's shared  
  
He was a suicidal man

I'll see you at sundown  
You can't back out now  
The news is all over town  
I'll see you at sundown  
And they can put one of us  
In a hole in the ground  
Now it's three in the afternoon  
And I'm frightened to death  
When you're in the saloon  
I wonder if he feels the same  
For whoever wins there's still  
The cowboy to blame  
Sundown, give me some strength  
I know I can't go it alone  
Sundown, give me your strength  
Give me a chance to go home  
To go home  
Three in the afternoon  
And I'm frightened to death  
When you're in the saloon  
I hear the reverend feels the sin  
For whoever wins there's still  
The cowboy to blame  

Sunrise  
And the new day's breakin' through  
The morning  
Of another day without you  
And as the hours roll by  
No-one's there to see me cry  
Except the sunrise  
The sunrise and you  
  
Tired eyes drift across the shore  
Looking for love and nothing more  
But as the sea rolls by  
No-one's there to see me cry  
Except the sunrise  
The sunrise and you  
  
Sunrise  
Bless my eyes  
Catch my soul  
Make me whole again  
  
Sunrise, new day  
Hear my song  
I'm tired of fightin'  
And foolin' around  
But from now on  
Till who knows when  
My sword will be my friend  
And I'll love you, love you  
For all of my time

For many years I felt like a man  
Feeling his way through darkness  
This priceless treasure  
For which Ive searched  
  
Appeared to me nothing more  
Than a mirage in the sea  
But when the vision faded  
From this struggle and dream  
Suddenly my illusion is diary  
I've now discovered what is reality  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
Ive found you  
  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
  
Ive found you  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
I'll be both most impressions  
  
And I arrive this with a smile  
As the picture book shows Stanley  
Standing at the source of the Nile

As you look around you  
Do you like what you see?  
Though it sometimes  
Makes you lonely  
Do you like being free?  
And are you sure you'll be okay  
Without my company?  
I just want you to be happy  
Even if it's not with me  
  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Will the line between all this  
And my love ever meet  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
  
What I'm really tryin' to say  
Is that I will be around  
Should you find that after all  
You can't get by  
With what you found  
  
Oh, it wasn't just my heart you took  
And gently tossed into the sea  
Though it's hard to find  
The words I need  
I guess it was me  
  
Will the line between all this  
And my love ever gonna meet  
Sweet sweet freedom  
Sweet sweet sweet  
  
Oh sweet, oh sweet sweet freedom  
So sweet, so sweet

Would you like to take  
This magic potion with me  
On a trip to a cosmic  
Playground far beyond  
She understands  
She's been before  
It's in her hands  
To find the door  
  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I will swim the sea  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I can feel the breeze  
  
There is no time, no wealth  
Only I surround you  
The fortune of this guide  
Is simply sincerity  
She understands  
'Cause she's been before  
It's in her hands  
To find the door, so

I didn't see you standing there  
You took me by surprise  
In your long silk dress  
And those deep brown eyes  
I was captured by your smile  
But when fate put out it's hand  
You're walking to your love  
How was I to resist  
The passion and the kiss  
We raised the future alone  
She stole my body and soul  
With a heart next to mine  
I didn't wanna face the day  
But I have no choice when we kiss  
She said  
Goodnight my sweet pretender  
Tonight we live forever  
One heart, one soul  
On the edge of the world  
Goodnight my sweet pretender  
Feels like we died together  
In each others arms  
On the edge of the world  
When she touched me so warm  
And so was her body  
A kiss she gave to me  
The name she said to pain and pleasure  
Time my soul rescue me  
But I know I'd be here on my own  
As soon as the sun would rise  
I didn't wanna face the day  
But I have no choice when we kiss  
I've dreamed of a place I know  
With the shadows of my past  
Still remain  
You're buried in the midst of time  
For always you'll be the sun that shines  
Shines on me  
Goodnight, goodnight  
My sweet pretender ...  

(over importance of money)  
I've no time for boring things  
There's no religion  
That can make my heart sing, no  
They call me up  
Say: hey come on down  
We've got credit salvation  
All over town  
And I can see it everywhere I go  
I can hear it on my radio  
They keep telling me it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
Is their sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
Just need your love girl, every time  
We don't need these  
Pointless things  
We just need to mend  
Our broken wings  
Take a look, a look  
What's going down  
We've gotta stop  
Before we hit the ground  
Yeah, we can have it  
Don't you know  
Take part in their tv show  
They'll keep telling us it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
You can't fool me  
It's a waste of time  
You're selling tears  
Down the credit card line, yeah  
But giving up is not  
Their frame of mind  
They'll find a way  
To break us in time  
Yeah, I can meet you  
Everywhere I go  
And I can hear you on my radio  
You keep telling me it's alright  
But there's one thing  
I don't need tonight  
Is your sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I just need your love girl, every time  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I don't need these things  
To make me feel fine  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
Just gimme your love girl  
Gimme your love, gimme your love  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I need your love girl  
Yeah, all the time  
Sweet sugar, poison wine  
I just need you girl, everytime  

I see your face in  
The magazine stand  
I wanna hold you in the palm  
Of my hand  
I love everything about you  
You're such a long way away  
Your sweet talk  
Ain't enough for me  
I may be deaf, but you're  
Too blind to see  
You're gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
Your sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Don't wanna hear your  
Sweet talk tonight  
I hear your voice on the radio  
It's gettin' so bad I don't know  
Which way to go  
Why don't you wake up girl  
You're such a long way away  
Your sweet talk ain't enough  
You see  
I need a woman  
Who's a woman to me  
You're gonna break my bones  
With those feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
Oh, I don't wanna hear it  
Not tonight  
You're gonna break my bones  
With your feminine tones  
But I don't wanna hear  
None of that sweet talk tonight  
Oh, not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Sweet talk tonight  
Not again tonight  
When I call tonight  
Don't wanna hear your sweet talk  

Sympathy just doesn't mean  
That much to me  
Compassion's not  
The fashion in my mind  
And if you're looking for  
A shoulder to cry on  
Don't turn your head my way  
'Cause I'd rather have  
My music any day  
  
You and I are  
Masters of our destiny  
We look for consolation all the time  
Until we find out things are not  
What they were meant to be, oh no  
And if it doesn't suit our mood  
We'll call it crime  
  
Dedication's not an obligation  
Or a figment of  
Someone's imagination  
It's the only way they say  
To live from day to day  
To make each passing way  
A small sensation  
  
Dreams are the possession of  
The simple man  
Reality the fantasy of youth  
But living is a problem that  
Is common to us all  
With love the only  
Common road to truth

We told our tales as we sat under  
Morning's sleepy sky  
With all the colors of  
The sunrise shining in our eyes  
  
One, then another  
With a story of yesterday's life  
Or of a lover who had  
Gone in a moment of strife  
  
No thought of sleep ever dwells  
Upon the wise man's mind  
Some task or audience  
Stealing every moment of his time  
  
Thus we have learned to live  
While mortal men  
Stand waiting to die  
How can we do what must be done  
In just one short life  
  
And if you ask  
Then you must know  
If you still doubt  
You should be told  
It was not we  
That made it so  
It was by those  
Who went before  
  
And there you sit  
Tomorrow's child  
So full of love  
So full of life  
But you must rise  
To meet the day  
Lest you become another tale  
  
Another tale

I thought no one could keep us from sharing the rest of our lives.  
Like a fool I believed you were true and had no disguise.  
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,  
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.  
  
It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man.  
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can.  
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,  
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.  
  
It's the same ugly story of a woman abusing a man.  
So I have to forget you though I'm not even sure if I can.  
There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,  
But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine.

Locked behind the door  
Taken by force  
But I'm not guilty of the crime  
How can this be real  
What is aganst the law  
To say what's on your mind  
Then I see your face  
So warm as it comforts me  
And tells me I am not alone  
Pray for me tonight  
Give me the strength of love  
To help me cross the virgin snow  
I will run till daybreak  
My tears will fade away  
They'll never take me again  
No I'm never going back  
'cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely be so clear  
Can we give ourselves  
Like a mother to her child  
They took a part of me  
Whenever I think of it  
I shiver to the bone  
The scar is on my heart  
When will the crimes of  
Inhumanity be known  
I am only one voice  
I will not fade away  
So many are silent  
But I will never look back  
'cause when I get to the golden palace  
Everything will surely disappear  
The snow has gone at last  
I'm out of the shadows and into the sun  
And then I see you smile  
Angel of mercy  
The fight has jus begun  
I can hear them calling  
Across the frozen land  
The world will hear us  
You know it's never too late  
'cause when we get  
To the golden palace  
The memory will surely be so clear  

Passing through the arms of Satan  
Reaching for the hands of God  
Robbing every mind for wisdom  
Running so he won't get caught  
He's outlawed by majority  
Been branded all his life  
Some say that he's a sinner man  
As he rides from day to night  
  
He's a bad man, so they say  
Living for his love and living free  
Riding swift and secretly  
So he'll miss the hanging tree  
Wounded spirit on the wind  
Riding to his dream and destiny  
  
He's laughing at the wanted posters  
Calling for his friends to see  
Laughing aloud as he rides away  
Kicking up the dust with speed  
Time hands him down a pathway  
And freedom is a horse he rides  
Glory is a dream he's after  
And fortune is his heart's delight  
  
Riding swift and secretly  
So he'll miss the hanging tree  
Wounded spirit on the wind  
Riding to his dream and destiny

Late at night I'll be knocking  
On your door  
Late tonight I'll be calling  
You can be sure  
I'll be waiting  
Standin' in the shadows once again  
Sneakin', creepin'  
Howling like a tom cat once again  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
  
You know I don't love you  
But I love what you can do  
Some more of that hot persuasion  
This time it's ? just like you  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere  
You can hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
I'll be knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
Knock, knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
  
I'm gonna take you  
I'm gonna make you  
At midnight, at midnight  
  
Late at night  
I'll be knock knock knockin'  
On your door  
I said late tonight I'll be callin'  
You can be sure  
I'm gonna take you  
Oh, it's gonna hurt so good  
I'm gonna make you do  
What a bad girl should  
  
Oh, there'll be nowhere to hide  
When I take you  
On the other side of midnight  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be knockin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
On the other side  
I'll be waitin', I'll be callin'  
The other side of midnight  
I'll be knock knock  
Knockin' at midnight

Let me walk a while alone  
Among the sacred rocks and stones  
Let me look in vain belief  
Upon the beauty of each leaf  
  
There is green in every blade  
The tree tops lean providing shade  
Maypoles spin in happy sound  
All nature's strength around  
  
And there's a horse that feels no pain  
It's iron strength to take the strain  
Children rock it to and fro  
And gaily drink it's colour-glow  
  
Above, the sky, devoid of cloud  
Thinks not to cast a thunder shroud  
Upon this place so full of joy  
A field of gold of loves employ  
  
So, why my heavy heart? You say  
When tears would stain  
The sights so gay  
My brother's dreams once here did soar  
Until he died at the hand  
Of needless war

Oh, they're moving in again  
Hidden by the shadows  
And the wind  
But we'll just wait awhile and then  
We'll show 'em all that  
This time we ain't giving in  
  
Without a care they  
Sweep aside our dreams  
To try and make way for their own  
No more should we surrender  
To their schemes  
It's time to stand and  
Show 'em we are not alone  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
And it's time to use it, use it  
  
Nature gave us colour  
Day and night  
So if you really got a reason  
Then you better be right  
The seasons of the year  
Still are spring and fall  
But there's nothing in the world  
That's says it's right to fight  
  
Time has changed us all  
We have our minds  
Life has taught us  
We all have our love  
Why don't we use it  
Come on and use it  
Why don't we use it  
Come on and use it  
  
La la la la la ...

I gotta stay in the race  
The die has been cast  
That's the way I'm going  
I tried to jump the river  
That flows so fast  
But it just keeps flowing  
  
It's a hell of a journey  
And I just can't wait  
There's no way I can hide it  
But it's a killer of a storm  
And it looks like rain  
I guess I've got to ride it  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Ain't no question if you win or lose  
Whether it's cold or rainy  
Gotta find my place whatever I choose  
Never Say if or maybe  
And there's so many turns that I can see  
In a world that I'm no stranger  
I'm in the race and now I can't turn back  
Survive in the face of danger  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know

I've had all I can take  
I've taken just too much  
I've made a big mistake  
That put me out of touch  
I don't think I can face  
Another single day  
Without a call from you  
To take this pain away  
  
So many tears ago  
You turned and walked away  
It could've been the end  
But I knew better  
I had to tell myself  
There'll be another day  
She wants to call it quits  
But don't you let her  
  
Can't you see  
There's a chance for you and me  
Think it over  
Don't believe  
In the things that may not be  
Think it over  
  
Why don't you think it over  
Forgetting you is out  
I ain't givin' in  
The fuss was down to you  
But it's not over  
You have to face the truth  
I'm still in love with you  
I have to make you see  
That it's not over  
  
Why don't you think about it, babe

Won't you take  
A chance my brother  
Follow me to a time of revelation  
Can't you see that  
Destiny will take a turn  
And show you  
There's no need to fight  
'Cause you know it's right  
  
And I finally see where I'm going  
I finally know what I'm knowing  
Now our journey's only just begun  
  
You won't need to ask forgiveness  
What you find  
Will be your inspiration  
You don't have to pray for glory  
All is equal, no more pain  
You know it's true, it's up to you  
  
'Cause I finally see where I'm going  
I finally know what I'm knowing  
Now our journey's only just begun  
  
Over the bridge  
Where you start to believe  
Down at the edge of the rainbow  
Dark is the night  
But we've seen another time  
Follow the light of the shadow  
  
Right or wrong, there is no reason  
There will be no hidden destination  
With the strength that you discover  
You can show the way  
How it was meant to be  
For all to see  
  
'Cause I finally know  
What I'm knowing  
I finally see where I'm going  
Now our journey's only just begun
