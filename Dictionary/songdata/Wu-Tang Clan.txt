(come on in)  
  
Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn  
(come on in)  
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH  
(come on, come on, come on in)  
  
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggaz!  
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)  
  
[Chorus]  
As high as Wu-Tang get  
Allah allow us pop this shit  
Just like black shoe fit  
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!  
  
Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long  
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong  
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually  
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant  
  
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk  
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk  
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force  
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source  
  
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment  
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President  
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green  
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans  
  
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical  
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why  
Said he know that sounds define the note  
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes  
  
Too many dope niggaz I see starvin  
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain  
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights  
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights  
  
A fugitive bass playin rap czar  
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly  
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty  
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin  
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya  
  
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts  
Prone to drops ya, slash ya, rip shit up  
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff  
An MC too good to be touched, John John  
  
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush  
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold  
As we move on, saga unfold  
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger  
  
Caught up in a cliffhanger  
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest  
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here  
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here  
  
Don't ever roam, in the naked city  
Eight Fingers stories none pretty  
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable, conditionin be critical  
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink  
  
Is a toast to your memory  
When I go how many niggaz gon' remember me  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Light is shinin' beauty sunshine  
Here comes one-time the ball was so fine  
Heat is blazin' the kids were playin'  
His partner was shady tryin' to slave the babies  
  
Hey yo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in  
Brooklyn  
All this while he let the fiends cook it  
The base heads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up  
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up  
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy  
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady  
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin'  
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens  
Even though her leg was bitten  
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins  
Paleface cop who done popped the desk  
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste  
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block  
Some niggaz know him as the Godson of Gotti  
And his black partner, he was scared to speak  
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street  
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks  
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin' his beat  
They call him desk duty, Robocop  
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the  
Block  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son  
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo  
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care  
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor  
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her  
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face  
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her  
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her  
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her  
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid  
Wavin' her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks  
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked  
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five  
Wildest niggas just smilin' cause it look live  
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me ?  
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten  
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin'  
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat  
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about  
Livin' in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store  
The bum holdin' the door, the mugging no one saw  
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw  
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores  
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position  
Transformation from critical to, stable condition  
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical  
Watchin' you like salt-water sharks that's tropical  
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it  
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it  
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin' or a wet up  
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up  
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts  
And for some, another way out, is music and sports  
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot  
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Hard days of work  
You had a hard day at work baby  
I want you to sit down, relax  
While I soak you in my mentals  
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo  
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears  
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair  
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning  
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening  
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean  
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers  
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin  
Diesel splash, long lovin in your oven  
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft  
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off  
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout  
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out  
Brain message, think about pink  
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink  
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play  
Back rub, Calgon, take me away  
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish  
Comfort me through all the damn madness  
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea  
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees  
Jet skis breeze  
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers  
Vapor action, tropical sunshower  
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour  
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug  
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug  
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance  
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace  
Complete silence, what surround us  
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets  
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites  
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats  
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail  
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails  
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells  
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell  
Violin, good medicine, sound swell  
Sunshine life, love right without the hell  
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick  
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt  
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling  
Company, ice cream licking now we holding  
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden  
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly  
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly  
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies  
Soon, taste these spoons  
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm  
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices  
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best  
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war  
Paradise life, recipe now pour  
Musicness, model, gentle mental  
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island  
Put the message in the bottle  
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty  
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty  
Yo, this is that body shop shit  
Love love slam  
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath  
Have your snack on that ass that  
Know what I mean?  
Massaging these melodies  
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf  
Blow winds, blow, through your hair  
Sea breeze sticks and shit  
Right right  
  
When your around boo  
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick

Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword style  
If what you say is true,  
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous  
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?  
  
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus  
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus  
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus  
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus  
  
Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse  
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse  
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk  
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk  
Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'  
However, I master the trick just like Nixon  
Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era  
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot  
P.L.O. style, hazardous, cause I wreck this dangerous  
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas  
  
I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore  
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down  
A literate type asshole, songs goin' gold, no doubt  
And you watch a corny nigga fold  
Yeah, they fake and all that  
Carryin' gats but yo, my Clan  
Rollin like forty Macs  
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense  
Wu-Tang, yo sew, represent  
I wait for one to act up  
Now I got him backed up  
Gun to his neck now, react what?  
And that's one in the chamber  
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches  
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits  
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'  
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'  
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Segal, Out For Justice  
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus  
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue  
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun  
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness  
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown  
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA  
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga  
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab  
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots  
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops  
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!  
A mud hole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp  
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night  
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous  
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe  
Choppin' through ya back swish  
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks  
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him  
I blow up his fuckin' prism  
Make it a vicious act of terrorism  
You want to bring it, so fuck it  
Come on and bring the ruckus  
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets  
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame  
Who sellin' gain, I'm givin' out a deadly game  
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin'  
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette  
Bring da fuckin' ruckus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
So bring it on  
  
Punk nigga!

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain  
Let's go inside my astral plane  
Find out my metal's based on instrumental  
Record hey, so I can write monumental  
  
Methods, I'm not the king  
But niggas is decay I stick 'em for the cream  
Check it, just how deep can shit get  
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it  
  
In your cross color, clothes you've crossed over  
Then got totally crossed out and Kris Cross  
Who the boss? Niggaz get tossed to the side  
And I'm the dark side of the force  
  
Of course it's the Method Man from the Wu Tang Clan  
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece protect it  
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus  
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it, styles I gets buck wild  
  
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files  
I'm sick, insane, crazy, drivin' Miss Daisy  
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze  
  
Is it real son, is it really real son  
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real  
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one  
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real  
  
And when I was a lil' stereo  
(Stereo)  
I listened to some champion  
(Champion)  
I always wondered  
(Wondered)  
Will now I be the numba' one?  
(Yo)  
  
Now you listen to the Gorgon  
(Gorgon)  
And the Gorgon summary  
(Yo)  
And any man that come test me  
(Test me)  
Me wanna lick out them brains  
(It's that why)

[Intro: kung fu sample from "8 Diagram Pole Fighter"]  
Today I'll talk about kindness  
Justice, faith and kindness  
I want you to listen carefully  
Kindness and faith, are the foundation  
Without them, we can't become good people  
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life  
And how can I be a good man then, eh?  
Well, first of all, you have to practice honesty  
Uhmm...  
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself  
Keep control...  
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything  
  
[Chorus: The Persuasions "Gypsy Woman" sample]  
Out of nowhere, there came a caravan  
This was around a campfire light  
A lovely woman in motion  
Her hair was as dark as the night  
  
[Method Man]  
Cruising on the interstate, just follow while I innovate  
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate  
Front and get ya dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait  
I'm trying to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake  
Spitting like a calico, kush from a Cali hoe  
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali, yo  
RZA you know how we go, on them 20's, that's how we roll  
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though  
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro  
My, my dames pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though  
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow  
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible  
I left my chick for cheating on me, now that bitch is miserable  
Popping bottles, painting hella Wallo's on my physical  
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle  
  
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl  
Fuck a coma, now the state you laying is a vegetable  
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable  
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Interlude: kung fu sample (RZA)]  
Only God, has lept into avenged mind  
And can, distinguish good, from evil  
Hahaha (Aiyo Cappa)  
  
[Cappadonna]  
We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out  
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house  
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real  
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attacking the field  
All in Chicago, grinding, putting it down  
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playing around  
Yo, you heard me on The Bassment, giving it to 'em  
Fake dudes hiding they self, but I could see through 'em  
Diggler, what? I'm trying to live and raise kids  
While you throwing up ya sign, I'm laying 'em down, kid  
Plus, I'm back home now, doing my thing  
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring  
  
[Chorus 2X]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
A good friend, holds his drink  
Bad company makes bad wine!  
Drinking among friends  
Red wine means a good life  
A few drinks bring comfort  
Two drinks are enough  
Money can't buy courage  
Riches mean nothing to us  
Brilliant, a display of genius

Started off on the island, AKA Shaolin  
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone dialin'  
Back in the days of 8 now, making a tape now  
Rae gotta get a plate now  
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one  
Till I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one  
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16  
Shooting that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream  
That's the life of a grimey, real-life crimey  
And niggas know that habit's behind me  
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto  
Now I'm a weed fiend, jetting the Palmetto  
In Medina, yo, no doubt the God got crazy clout  
Pushing the big joint from down South  
So if you're filthy stacked up  
Better watch your back and duck  
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up  
Now my man from up north, now he got the law  
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt  
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks  
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke  
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop  
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot  
Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!  
Fuck that!  
  
Dedicated to the winners and the losers  
Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers  
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)  
Dedicated to the Y's, 850-I's  
Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys  
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)  
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's  
Dedicated to MPV's: phat!  
  
Kicking the fly cliches  
Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day  
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots  
Running up in spots and making shit hot  
I'd rather flip shows instead of those  
Hanging on my living room wall  
My first joint, and it went gold!  
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade  
Plus the spotlight, getting my dick rode all night  
I want to have me a phat yacht  
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops  
But for now it's just a big dream  
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen  
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain  
Cause times is changed and life is strange  
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad  
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs  
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes  
Receiving all types of calls from upstate  
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure  
Settling for lesser  
The God left lessons on my dresser  
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way to  
Continue to make more hits with Rae and A  
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime  
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9

What that nigga want God?  
Word up, look out for the cops (Wu-Tang five finger shit)  
(Cash Rules) Word up, two for fives over here baby  
Word up, two for fives them niggas got garbage down the way, word up  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
(Cash Rules Everything Around Me  
C.R.E.A.M. get)  
Yeah, check this ol' fly shit out  
Word up  
(Cash Rules Everything Around Me) Take you on a natural joint  
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money) Here we here we go  
(Dolla dolla bill y'all) Check this shit, yo!  
  
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side  
Staying alive was no jive  
At second hands, moms bounced on old men  
So then we moved to Shaolin land  
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose  
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot  
And let's start it like this son, rollin' with this one  
And that one, pullin' out gats for fun  
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend  
Started smokin' woolies at sixteen  
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes  
Making my way on fire escapes  
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed  
The combination made my eyes bleed  
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all  
Sticking up white boys in ball courts  
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater  
Times is ruff and tuff like leather  
Figured out I went the wrong route  
So I got with a sick ass click and went all out  
Catchin' keys from across seas  
Rollin in MPV's, every week we made forty G's  
Yo nigga respect mine, or anger the tech nine  
Ch-chick-POW! Wu from the gate now  
  
Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me  
C.R.E.A.M.  
Get the money  
Dollar, dollar bill y'all  
  
Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me  
C.R.E.A.M.  
Get the money  
Dollar, dollar bill y'all  
  
It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin  
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival  
I peep at the shape of the streets  
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep  
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.  
Which failed I went to jail at the age of 15  
A young buck sellin' drugs and such who never had much  
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not, could not,  
The court played me short, now I face incarceration  
Pacin' going up state's my destination  
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us  
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff  
But as the world turns I learned life is hell  
Living in the world no different from a cell  
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin' chase, sellin' base  
Smokin' bones in the staircase  
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess  
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed  
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?  
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth  
Who explained working hard may help you maintain  
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain  
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks  
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot  
Leave it up to me while I be living proof  
To kick the truth to the young black youth  
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin' beer  
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear  
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted  
That what? That life is hectic  
  
Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me

Yo, first of all son peep the arson  
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark  
Call me dough snatcher just the brother for the rapture  
I hand glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture  
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant  
Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit  
  
It's manifested the Gods work like appliances  
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences  
The ninth chamber leave you trapped inside my hallway  
You try to flee but you got clamped by the doorway  
  
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence  
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt now how you restin'  
While I'll be trapped by sounds locked behind loops  
Throwin' niggaz off airplanes and the cash rules  
  
Everything around too black as you can see  
Swallow this murder one verse like God degree  
Then analyze this soundtrack with satisfaction  
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction

The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on  
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christen Slaters  
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital  
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggas  
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways  
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas  
Now that's a money thing  
Yo yo  
  
I was Dashing through the hood  
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray  
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way  
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine  
Yo son we gotta make that cream whether raps or Nixon times  
  
They call me Rollie, watch me polly with the wide body Dinali  
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey  
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki  
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy  
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block  
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy  
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy  
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti  
Snatch the cream, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby  
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giuliani  
like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi  
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party  
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body  
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me  
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky  
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread  
then call myself Collar Ratsi  
Professionally trained, I am for your artery  
I give the autographs but charge for photography  
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody  
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys  
Spark the broccoli, spas off this ghetto opery  
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse  
Seen  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
Come, come, come  
One for the dough, son  
Give me the reasons  
  
They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly  
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy  
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy  
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty  
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?  
While the stage catch shells from forceful gun play  
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack  
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back  
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart  
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart  
Brought to a halt from a front full assault  
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results  
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts  
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts  
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes  
It was layin' in the sip drive from chest five  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Meth on deck man, on deck  
For e'rything routine right here  
Routine, Gambino, that's that shit  
Y'all thought it was over,  
  
Yeah, yo  
I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp, bowl of cereal  
Cartoons is on, my favorite shit is The Smurfs  
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt,  
cause by this time I done seen life,  
and figured the amount that it's worth  
It's the first, cops is slippin' for work  
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweatin' like a hooker in church  
This old woman on her way to the church,  
she said the neighborhood's fucked up,  
and we the ones that's makin' it worse  
Now that's fucked up!  
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up  
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us  
They tell me only God can judge us  
But they ain't ever met Judge Kufner  
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench  
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent  
But that's possession with intent  
Player, I ain't stressin', I'm a pimp  
My bitches love the cocktail dressin' with the shrimp  
  
[Chorus]  
(Killa Hill!) 'Cause we do it like how we do it  
This is big truck style shit, diesel fluid  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown, Park Hill, we just doing our thang  
  
C'mon, yeah! You fools don't have a clue, do you?  
Moving them ki's crucial, troopin' like Isuzu  
Nigga your weed doo doo, we burn that Cali kush  
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took  
Hurtin' the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot  
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books  
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out  
Con Ed status like Fab nigga, it's "Lights Out"  
What your life 'bout? Nigga my life plush  
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks  
Us Billy Boys hold toys cause they don't like us  
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffin' that white stuff  
Moving with the semi, eggplant pennies  
Hoppin' out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy  
Never been a sloucher dog, cause I'm an alpha-  
Male got that product on sale redeem your voucher  
Leader of the gang, I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa  
Little Rascals, with no hassle, I will out ya  
Sincerely doubt ya, and I will house ya  
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scalper  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time pick up the mic, I put work down  
Cops don't like me cause I live in the murder town  
My high school homies sold crack, through songs  
You can't get right through the team like two wrongs  
Mad criminal minded cream motherfuckers  
Type of subliminal rhymes scheme mothafuckers  
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch  
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch  
Killa Bees wild like C-74  
New York bitch, adolescents at war  
Fuck the government, yo they made us this way  
You a fagot, listenin' to what that chick say  
Escape route, gotta be free like furlough  
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know  
Hardcore, move with or without Clan  
Diss me in the cab and they murked your man  
I'm a general, don with the crazy hype game  
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game  
Killa Hill son, they don't like where I live at  
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back  
Real talk, hard jeans and hard dick  
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage  
Nigga feel me, or nigga feel that blast  
ATF bitch, just guns and cash  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Killa Hill!) 'Cause we do it like how we do it  
Trife, Meth and Cap yo, nothin' to it  
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang  
Stapletown, Park Hill, we just doing our thang  
  
(Straight up, Wu-Tang killa bees)  
The best that ever do it  
One-oh-three-oh-four, you know how we do  
Legendary Weapons  
Come in our section, get a blessing  
Cause we don't play

I don't give a damn!  
I'll kill anyone in my way  
  
Homicide city shit  
Homicide city shit  
Yeah yeah, homicide, yo  
You see the neck lit, fist glisten, chain drippin', lane shiftin'  
Riding dirty dirty, got that thang, know I stay grippin'  
Facin' life with it or without it bitch it's same difference  
Lames drippin' if it's day or night, I'ma bang with it  
Situation's sickenin' niggas broke, and they can't fix it  
Dough is all I know so if you slip it, then I can't miss it  
Ain't mention Sin and broke niggas, in the same sentence  
Got the game twisted, mayne listen, say pimpin'  
What you pushin'? Product pumpin' like a piston hardly gettin' by  
Or probably gettin' high off what you pitchin', while we sittin' fly  
Tryin' to keep it simplified, movin' like we Semper Fi  
My niggas is born to ride, y'all niggas get sent to die  
All you do is mention I, general exemplify  
Sin City been gritty, ten city enterprise  
About to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind  
And improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high  
You don't want the semi flyin' nine at your Hemi fine  
All you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time  
Mad 'cause my ones up, and scared 'cause my guns bust  
God's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumb fucks  
Sin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps  
Hit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks  
Dodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug thugs out  
The bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch  
Glock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust  
Rug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush  
Dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us  
Your back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us  
Stack bread like Wonder from the winter 'til the summer come  
Upgrade to made, that's when the Benzs and the Humers come  
I ain't want no Humer stunt, ask how I stack well like Maxwell  
Nigga tryin' do a little some'n some'n

Yo, one two one two  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
It's the Wu, creepin' in the shadows  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Sir I, Excalibur  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)  
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Yo, hey yo my rap style swing like Willie Mays  
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades  
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page  
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades  
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher  
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture  
Limited edition composition spark friction  
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant  
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence  
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin  
The most high, most try, to get close by  
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high  
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter  
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga  
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya  
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa  
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often  
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman  
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack  
Words attack like a British bulldog, observe the stacks  
  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
  
Now all pay tribute to this entity  
A spark that surges through the undergrowth  
Overwhelmin' the populace from the entry  
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged  
From this elite fleet  
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve  
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words  
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe  
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas  
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off  
And spray, an array of shots  
That travel downwind, just respect pyrhiffic pen  
As I send, the minds of the weak  
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land  
As we stand, expanding our cream  
A dollar to every grain of sand  
Let the mind use the physical as planned  
  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
  
Yo, yo, this is Beirut  
Try to comprehend check out my new suit  
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction  
Dissappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere  
Fallin' out the sky tall sniper  
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside  
Poetry whirlpool, Rza and True collide  
We produce article exception to the rule  
We the black men that struck oil, the hard boiled  
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled  
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with Cyrus  
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes  
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers  
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers  
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven  
Slang reverend, put the best work in  
  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"  
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang  
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"

[Intro: Method Man]  
If you got it, light it up [8X]  
  
[Method Man]  
Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em  
Little niggaz hugging the block, cops is booking 'em  
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em  
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em  
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em  
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em  
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em  
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em  
Get cash, get that ass, or put a foot in 'em  
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam  
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em  
Niggaz still got that juks in 'em  
  
[Chorus 2X: Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]  
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)  
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)  
  
[U-God]  
I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem  
It took a little time to get his juices going  
Producers know him, as the kid with the Iron Palm  
Righteous hammer, examine the firearm  
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar  
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star  
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible  
Where I'm from, we use dum-dums in the arsenal  
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check  
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck  
Universal conquest, kung fu, buckle vets  
  
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs  
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand, we programmed  
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam  
I fear no man, son, you get lynched up  
Nigga bitch, get Frankenstein stitched up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Masta Killa]  
Yeah, voice skipping off percussion  
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved  
All praise, the daunting, calm yet  
So alarming, without a word being spoken  
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look  
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books  
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed  
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook  
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks  
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot  
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up  
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather  
Yet heavier than weight, when my mind state starts to break, take cover  
Over RZA instrumental, I'm damn near invincible, it's simple  
  
[Chorus 2X]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
Tell me, what are they like?  
They got holes in the top, five round holes  
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them  
But his fingers went right through the bone  
So then, they've... mastered it  
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?  
The Skeleton Claw

We got butter  
We got butter  
  
Gonna go  
Gonna go  
  
One thing for sure keep you a vault  
Keep a nice crib fly away Keep to the point  
Keep niggas outta your face who snakes  
Keep bitches in their place keep the mac in a special place  
  
Keep movin for papes  
Keep cool  
Keep doin what you doin  
Keep it fly keep me in the crates  
  
[Rekwon]  
Cause I will erase shit on a real note yous a waste  
Its right here for you I will lace you  
Rip you embrace you  
Put a nice w up on your face  
Word to mother you can get chase  
It s nothing to taste  
Blood on a thug  
If he gotta go  
All I know is  
We be giving grapes  
  
This is a place from where we make tapes  
We make them everywhere stealing all  
We be making base  
You'll be making pace  
These little niggas they be making shapes  
Our shit is art yours is trace  
  
This is the way that we roll in the street  
You know when we roll we be packing the heat  
Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go  
  
[Method Man]  
This is poverty island man these animals don't run  
Slums where the ambulance don't come  
Who got the best base fiends waiting to smoke some  
Approach son  
Ask him where he getting that coke from  
My dudes hug blocks like samurai shogun  
Cause no v and no ones Equalin no fun  
Who wanna treat they know huh  
Body to go numb  
A woman need funds plus her hair and her toes done  
It is what it is though  
You Fuck with the kid flow  
  
You make it harder to dough the harder the get go  
Harder to pimp flow harder when it snow  
The pinky and the wrist glow  
Cause here we live fo  
Get guap and get low  
But first off you gotta get the work off  
To get from the curse boss  
Yeah See I'm the shit  
Them dirt on the fifth know  
Hustling from the get go

[Chorus]  
This is the way that we roll in the street  
You know when we roll we be packing the heat  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go  
  
[Gza]  
We was quiet flashy brothers  
Strapped all along with the dirty 38 long  
12 hour shift gate took case in state  
you think he wont hold his weight  
put the money on the plate and watch it get scraped  
  
We get ape up in that club  
Off that juice and hen  
And its an no win situation  
Fucking with them  
  
You mean like Ewen at the front of the rim  
Finger roll a dutch  
Million dollar stage is touched  
Techs gauges bust  
  
Trust no one  
The lone shogun  
Rugged tim boots stompa  
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher  
  
Nothing can calm the quakage  
When I break kid  
Peace to my brothers up north  
Doing state bids  
  
This is the way we be rollin in the street  
You know when we roll that we be packing the heat  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go  
  
This is the way we be rollin in the club  
You know when we roll that we be packing 32 slugs  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go

[Raekwon]  
High potency top, smoke a bag of black  
And feel the vibe, want to be wise  
We, form on a rising corner mean five  
Laws in disguise, throw on your slides  
Young niggas racist, smokers is basic  
We seen the eyes, laying up playing the cut  
What, stay in the truck, something told me duck  
Folding me up, my shoulders struck  
Out of luck, fuck the potters up  
Fell on a daze like a Golotta snuff  
Niggas tried to body me up  
I'm in the lobby bleeding  
Niggas in the witness office probably eating  
And sprinting and beefing, when they heard the shots  
Called the precinct and seen barber nieces beasting  
Niggas shot Shalar features and shocked her was a Elisis,  
Bent the spinal cordless creatures  
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down  
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down  
Macking it was Dale Breedy the greedy  
Caniving ass snake genie  
Cop with a bikini will murder charge and benini  
I'm feeling wheezy and the drain from the cheeba  
Grieving ain't even looking decent  
Seeing police niggas reaching  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my...  
  
[Inspectah Deck]  
Fleeing the crime scene speeding  
Beefing leaving behind cream  
Not even peeping that I was leaking  
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten  
Still jakes are creeping  
Don't blow ya spot, stay the weekend  
Keep the ruger peeling who's squealing  
Few knew the dealings  
Keep the steel concealed in  
Cause we got no time for feelings  
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing  
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing  
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro  
They boost his ego path and broke down  
Reduced to zero  
Cops feel we poors hoping I'll reveal my source, source  
  
That splash against my hollow bones  
That rocks my soul  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
[Ghostface]  
Outside the check cashing, flashing  
Dipped in fashion  
Five cherry-faced fagots tried to cash in  
They keep laughing, Ghost you get ya face bashed in  
Who gave you these privileges son? why you maxing?  
And we..  
Feigning to take those move slow  
I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose  
And I heard you keep a banging hammer  
Golden brass diamonds embroideries  
That was stolen that you haven't reported g  
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup  
Don't make this big stick up bigger  
Me and the boys I thought for a second then chose  
Rather than froze  
Had the Jim star on my hand  
Yo what the fuck yo! that's when I ripped Timothy  
Snatch and dip john like imbaggable  
Had the mini axe tool, faxed him  
Shots rang off, bing, boggle-de-dumb  
  
That splash against my hollow bones

Hey mom, can I have some money?  
The ice cream man is coming!  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts  
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe  
Even caramel sundaes is gettin' touched  
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up  
(The ice cream man is coming!)  
  
Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin  
See you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clickin'  
I catch shootin' strong notes as we got close  
She rocked rope, honey throat smellin' like Impulse  
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod  
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God  
Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood  
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule  
They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy  
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's  
Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true  
Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe  
Caramel complexion, breath smellin' like cinnamon  
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again  
God damn, backyard's bangin' like a Benz-why  
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spudz McKenzie  
I'm high powered put Adina Howard to sleep  
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but uhh  
Back to you Maybelline Queen let's make a team  
You can have anything in this world except CREAM  
So whatchu want to do? Whatchu want to do?  
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shaolin's finest, whattup Boo, peace your highness  
Yo I'm loungin', big dick style, y'all niggaz is the flyest  
Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking  
Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian  
Ghettoes, them is your hometown, we can go the whole round  
After that, I'm shootin' downtown  
I'm rockin' hats and you wig is all intact  
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes curly black  
Freaks be movin' in fly sneaks  
Two finger rings and gold teeth, and ain't afraid to hold heat  
So when I step in the square dear  
You better have Cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Black chocolate girl wonder, shade brown like Thunder  
Politic til your deficit step, gimme your number  
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs  
Catch my eyes like highs I want your bodily surprise  
Double dime some time, Ice Cream you got me fallin' out  
Like a cripple, I love you like I love my dick size  
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches  
Take pulls off the dutches, orgasm in my mind state  
Masturbate in your clutches, I want you for self  
Like wealth, so play me closely  
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me  
Only a hard dozen want to be callin' me cousin  
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shoppin' spree you're lovin'  
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets  
I jizm like a giant break brooms out of their sockets  
  
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggaz what?  
It's the after party and bitches want to fuck  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ice cold bitches melt down when my clutch  
And what they titties sucked, ice cream  
  
Yeah, your guts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch  
They want they titties sucked, ice cream  
  
One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done  
And your wigs tight, word up  
One love to my butter-pecan Ricans for calling me papi  
That's for real  
One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top  
Yeah  
And big up to my french vanillas  
Parlez vous, francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons  
And all that good stuff  
That good stuff

[Chorus]  
Murder one of y'all niggas,  
Get to hurtin' one of y'all niggas,  
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas  
  
Kick dirt  
Color glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors  
Fly paintings remainin', reclinin' pro-commissioner  
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off  
Hibernatin', dead in the makin', ear-rake him, gear-rake him  
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe  
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust  
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin' in some Wu googles you follow  
Mail and jail letters, sendin' niggas lottos  
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes  
What made you fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe  
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes  
We paintin' pictures if it's ? I seen a lot of those  
Gettin fly with Ghost, power just buy the boats  
Rsa your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls  
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose  
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho  
  
Devestatin' shockwaves strikin' the nation  
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination  
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form  
In any form mixed untampered it's pure  
Dissect each line of the rhyme  
Find my ingredients and nutrients  
Teach patience and obedience before movement  
Killer bee student enrollment  
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic  
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk  
Slang therapist Shallah Rae  
Plus the people, with magnificent wordplay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey yo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path  
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin' fast  
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft  
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash  
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash  
Floatin' past in an alley with the oak dash  
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair  
They goin' mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads  
Crabs want to play me close and grab  
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin' jabs  
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag  
You posin' bad, show your ass son, you won't last  
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass  
Compose a smash, rollin' grass at Ghost lab  
  
"drink to your new life, iron flag brothers"

Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh  
Yeah stanyoi, whoi  
Oh God, I beg for forgiveness, so help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness  
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness  
Allah you Akbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness  
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying  
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip  
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Koran  
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and  
They threw burners in our babies' faces  
Pale hands that looked scary  
Touched our bodies in the strangest places  
Sweat from the white man's head  
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head  
Almighty, alrighty, niggaz is screwing  
God won't you tell me why these ho niggaz is screwing?  
I'm sorry Father, sacrifice me, leave me wife  
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise  
So we heed our God King Sellasie I, Jah rastafari  
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in all, in the hearts of all flesh  
Let my task oh Jah with them that strive with me  
Fight against them, that fight against me  
Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health  
Oh Jah, oh Jah, only you can comfort me  
La la la, la la la la la, la la la  
La la whoi stand out  
Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away  
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away  
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow and white seed  
We don't discriminate man over color, creed  
They tried to snatch up our beats, son and steal our culture  
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures  
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?  
Kidnap the truth and destroying the black evidence  
Glory be to the Father, glory be to the Son  
Glory be to the holy one, the holder of creation whoi  
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be  
Jah world, Jah world without end whoi  
So we heed our God King Sellassie I, Jahova God, Jah rastafari  
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in the hearts of  
In the hearts of all flesh whoi  

[RZA]  
See, sometimes...  
You gotta flash em back  
See niggaz don't know where this shit started  
Why'all know where it came from  
I'm sayin we gonna take why'all back to the swords  
We bounce, yo  
  
[Chorus: GZA, (RZA)]  
When the MC's came, to live our their name  
And to perform (forrrrm)  
Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne)  
With before Pete Rock-ed it on, now gone  
That the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn)  
With the building to be born  
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to guy  
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH  
  
[GZA]  
Fake niggas get flipped  
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns  
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down  
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe  
  
On some loud howl shit, to insert a fiend  
But it was yo ock, the shop stolen art  
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart  
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes they get hurt  
  
Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt  
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals  
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble  
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt  
  
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts  
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon  
I represent from midnight to high noon  
I don't waste ink, nigga I think  
  
I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink  
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed  
Through clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed  
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted  
Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[GZA]  
I'm on a Mission, that niggaz say is Impossible  
But when I swing my swords they all choppab

But whoever she gonna do anyway  
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it  
Who else, who else is gonna  
It's dedicated to all you bitches  
  
Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass  
Blew my hole in the past  
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea  
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina  
Boy you shoulda seen her  
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's  
Called up talkin' Tina  
I put my dick in a womb  
She blew my head like a balloon  
I had her walkin' on the moon  
  
Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time  
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind  
You walked by smellin' like watermelon  
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'  
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick  
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick  
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy  
After that we can cheat  
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat  
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke  
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke  
Compound porno flick music  
Daddy came with it when I wrote it  
  
Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog  
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch  
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie  
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy  
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty  
I like it muddy or swampy  
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky  
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV  
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease  
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze  
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch  
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese  
Now to blow fifty G's overseas  
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850  
  
Suicidal  
She been in more hotels than bibles  
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle  
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue  
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split  
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot  
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web  
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf  
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons  
Big ass in tight denim  
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed  
To watch relationships get destroyed  
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless  
Her attitude was blameless  
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list  
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection  
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection  
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em  
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom  
  
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible  
(That's exactly what we've done)  
But you'll fail, and you'll all die  
(If we die, the next generation will fight them too  
And the one after them, for as long as they must  
And eventually we shall succeed)

I don't touch that swine  
I want that unnecessary beef  
You smoke garbage buds  
We smoke tons of keef  
Fishing, looking for that big-mouth bass  
An' flashing, jack your whole stash  
In fashion, keep my goons lined  
In an orderly fashion  
It's glossy with 500 horsies in the Benz  
Tinted out to spend the night  
You ain't got angel funds is low, stack  
Your bitch been ho-jacked  
Still scoop her up, bring her home  
And blow that, 'cause Ghost be mostly  
Looking pretty toasty  
Front row at Mayweather verse Mosley  
With a Bin Laden bottle  
A Brazilian model  
Got the paparazzi jumping  
Like they hit the Lotto  
I party hard, like I"m fresh out of the cages  
I rages like Charlie Sheen, out in Vegas  
  
You drop your pants at your ankles  
At the urinal at a ballgame  
I'm on the stool getting brain  
From a tall dame, 'cause I'm 5'8"  
Shorty like 6'2"  
Feed her coke, locked jaw like a pitbull.  
I was born to rep you fucking with a hornet's nest  
Old shooters in the corner like Hornacek  
Young boys that be handling the rock  
Chris Paul dish off, hammer in the sock  
Gold flakes in the Gold Schlager  
The ammo green XJ12, you know the old Jaguar  
Got the birch-wood lacing the interior  
Poppy bagels getting flavored out in Syria  
Only the Fonz, best laced plates  
Cheese that reach maturity,  
Dick sucks from Shannon Doherty  
Take your temperature anally and orally  
Make a batch of home drizzle royally with oil B  
  
Hopping out the Rolly Royce  
Rolls Gold nouveau  
Diamond-studded shoes, so  
Fliest nigga you know  
Puerto Rican version of Scarface  
Fuck with the God's say  
Disrespect, piss in your broad's face  
Chains stay chunky like Oprah's belly  
Got the purple and the brown:  
Peanut butter and jelly  
When I step up in the spot with the rock  
You'll see the popular poppin' rappers  
Go in their pocket and pull out their wallet  
When I click-clack, now get up on the ground  
Cause I Onyx, Pete Rock, Chuck D shut 'em down  
You know Term, I'm the kid with the 'preme beats  
Butter Pecan J Lo, kid with the mean cheeks  
Boobies on my gold fronts, iced out notebook  
Making volcanoes in the kitchen when the coke cook  
I rode around with all kinds of thugs  
High on drugs, pissing out tiger blood

Here I am, here I am, the Method Man  
  
Straight from the slums of Shaolin  
Wu-Tang Killa Bee's on a swarm  
(Your soul have just been taken through the 36 chambers of death, kid)  
  
(Word to mother, Method Man signing off, peace)

Run'din from fires of the city, and tee blood  
Blood, blood, blood.. blood  
You two ta both from EE-hee-ma, ah ya both from Jahnker  
You ta both from fire outside  
You both from To-ah-ee  
One blood, one blood, one blood  
  
I was rollin', showin' my age, unshaven  
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid  
I walk with a slight lean from the way that my heat  
Givin' a green the shine infra-red beam  
At the street traffic light recorders  
Takin' pictures of our corners  
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em  
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window  
We movin' in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan  
With plastic phasers in rubber hands  
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim  
How dare you call the Gods in vein!  
Not knowin' the seriousness of this and why I came  
To Earth, feet first  
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum  
No questionin' to the session, I walk with gun  
The magnum of bust-es head for many directions unknown  
Another statistic, change the ballistics  
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow  
Scrape the craters of the brain for data  
Old scriptures on withered paper  
Beginnin' take shape and form  
When the gods get on it and crash your college dorm  
  
You two ta both from uptown, ah your both from downtown  
Your ta both from An-ah-town, ah yeah both from 'round town  
One blood, one blood, one blood  
The pussy 'nit find it  
Travel w'on, raise your wine  
That's blood yud, blood  
  
Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage  
Part 2 for you, I give this dedication, project elimination  
He's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve  
I'm just vanishing with the vanishing cream  
Here's Jews to live by, 'dentify before you intake can't leave with weed  
Fuck that, you waist no time in search of those who can't breathe  
A bum only has one time to explode  
When I break I'm takin' everything,  
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes  
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone  
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume,  
Who gave the order to bust 'em?  
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft  
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical  
Comin' back, to attack in black fatigue  
Wu-Tang and Junior Reid  
  
You two ta both from Lebanon, ah ya both from Iran  
You da both from China, ah ya both from Japan  
One blood, one blood, one blood  
You two ta both from uptown, ah ya both from down sout'

One blood, one blood, one blood  
The pussy 'nit find it

Fathers fighting sons  
Sisters hating sisters  
Rappers getting murdered, every day

One blood, one blood, one blood

RZA came and got me, this what I came to do, come on  
Ring the bell so it's time to eat  
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats, bomb inside the palm  
Doc rock a wife beater with me beatin' my wife ass ironed on  
The front, my pump built like the Klumps  
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk  
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days  
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise  
Blast, don't panic  
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock  
The rap game single-handed? Hell nah  
I won't tell you son, if I find a wack ID, I sell you one  
Doc and Hot Nick, Inspectah  
My lecture's like Hannibal Lector's  
Where's the ketchup? Don't speak on it, shut ya trap  
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustard packs  
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone  
You say you got the rap games sewn  
But it's sewn wrong  
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck  
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones  
Yeah, ya little fucks  
Gimme ya fuckin' money  
[Incomprehensible]  
Uhuh, check it  
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on  
Playing with a dynamite stick, where did I go wrong?  
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp  
If ya lukewarm leavin' ya clothes and boots torn  
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's  
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on  
First issue, got issues  
What is hip-hop to hot nickels?  
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word  
Look at my hand and get the third  
Finger out ya ear hole like "Fuck what you heard"  
Now, that's what I call hardcore, let's act fool  
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool  
I been shitty, I'm from the veils of the city  
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty  
Baggy Dun Gurees, dick need room to breathe  
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese  
Ain't no rules to the game  
If it is we ain't playin'  
In your business like EPMD, "So whatcha sayin'?"  
You co-designin' that bullshit yo man tryin'  
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat  
Slugs flyin'  
[Incomprehensible]  
Yo, ya  
Check, the code echoes from magazines to the big screen  
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream, kids fiend  
From the urban to sub-urban  
Roll upon me thirstin' like "Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant"  
We roll longer than dice in a casino  
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0  
Behind the tinted windows I lie low  
On some hydro tryin' to slide from the 5-0  
But now, get wild similar to Ol' Dirty  
On third time felon just hit with over 30  
No worries, style have 'em so thirsty  
First degree heats are quittin' on me  
Cold turkey, no mercy  
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines  
But a thousand shoutin' my name that's why I came  
But first bring the cash burst, then the outburst  
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse  
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle  
Trouble with ya here and face the tec-muscle  
Even the best buckle win, I take it to the extreme  
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get cream  
This life  
[Incomprehensible]  

The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in our streets."  
And so it was. We were raised between the clans,  
And that meant pressure on me to make more weapons.  
And as word of the gold shipment spread,  
Strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village  
  
Ay yo, ay yo, Machete still stainless  
The archbishop run from the Knox  
A Chris biscuit plus play the heart, wrists glisten  
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians  
Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman, bangers a blue coupe  
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot  
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2  
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper  
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan  
In a flight goons switchblade poke out the night boots ?  
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on  
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm  
All this is made for the Forbes list  
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"  
All this is calculated, the Batman with a black hand  
Mafia money, killas who rock tans(?)  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist  
  
Rigamortus, I watch the body rot to the bone structure  
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture  
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot  
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac  
Suicidal tendencies, down to white Hennessy  
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b  
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, it's duck season  
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing  
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger  
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas  
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock  
Straight up and down beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks  
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags  
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags  
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions  
I piss out brewhas, poisonous potion  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist  
  
Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims  
Shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants  
Left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em  
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em  
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb  
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance  
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps  
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance  
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants  
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants  
Hollow chrome to your collarbone  
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone  
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone  
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone  
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known  
We straight street, we keep seats in the palace throne  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist

All you hoes, be cryin' for these bitches  
All you niggas, be cryin' for these hoes  
  
"Both hands clusty" Ghost, "Pullin' out gats"  
"Double barreled" Meth, "Blew off the burner kinda dusty"  
"We back, don't test" Raekwon, "Bring it to em proper, potnah"  
"Comin' from the thirty-six chamber"  
"Math, let the plate spin", "Many brothers y'all be sparkin'"  
"Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot"  
"If ya fuck with Wu, we gots ta fuck witchu"  
  
Who the fuck knocked our buildings down?  
Who the man behind the World Trade massacres, step up now  
Where the four planes at huh is you insane bitch?  
Fly that shit over my hood and get blown to bits!  
No disrespect, that's where I rest my head  
I understand you gotta rest yours true, nigga my people's dead  
America, together we stand, divided we fall  
Mr. Bush sit down, I'm in charge of the war!  
  
Yes yes y'all, the I-N-S bless y'all  
Stop hearts like cholesterol, let's brawl  
Never fall, tear it down like a wreckin' ball  
Role call where my niggas that's one for all  
And all for one, we draw the guns on impulse  
Cash in the envelope, spend it on kinfolk  
Then smoke a ounce as we count mills  
Providin' you pure ecstasy without pills  
  
[Chorus:]  
Y'all know the rules, we don't fuck with fools man  
How the fuck did we get so cool man?  
Never ever disrespect my crew  
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu  
  
Y'all dogs better guard ya grills, it's all real

Yo wonderful, spark the blillz  
Let me build with the people for the mills  
I'm rollin with the Rebel I-Ill from Killa Hill, peace to Brownsville  
Brothers that'll kill for the will of the righteous  
Twenty-five to lifers, true and livin snipers  
You wait like "Sixth Sense" 'til hard to kill  
  
How you livin' StreetLife? I'm surrounded by criminals  
Serial killers tote guns without the serial  
High-tech, street intellect, all digital  
Project original, sheisty individual  
New York's bravest, always supply you with the latest  
We hall of famers, and still hit you with the greatest  
Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us  
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sendin' letters to ? my cousin in Wendy's on Viacom  
At home, it's worth money, I adorns  
Order drinks, all real niggas order your minks yo  
We got the fitteds on, lookin' all fink  
Daddy everybody get money from now on  
Payday flash Visas livin' like, Easter everyday  
Don't fuck Benz, rather a 430  
That shit that float through water, eyeball come up, drop birdies yo  
  
We can eat right, or we can clap these toys  
I'm with StreetLife, ain't never been a Backstreet Boy  
Who y'all kiddin'? Tryin' to act like my shoe fittin'  
Confused with ya head up yo' ass like who's shittin'?  
It's Hot Nixon, same team same position  
Battin' average three-five-seven and still hittin'  
Y'all still bitchin', still lame and still chicken  
I'm still here, one leg missin' and still kickin'  
Cause I'm hard! Hard like a criminal  
Love like a tennis shoe, throw slug to finish you  
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth  
I can tell this motherfucker ain't Wu, look at his neck  
  
"Comin' from the thirty-six chamber"  
"Bring it to em proper, potnah"  
"Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang"  
  
It's Wu-Tang, rushin' yo' gang, crushin' the game  
Pretty thugs, clutchin' they chain, hand cuppin' they thing  
Who get strange, gassed up playin with flames  
Let a nigga take off his shades, see what I'm sayin' is  
  
[Chorus]

[Intro: Raekwon]  
Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggaz is back, son  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga  
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man  
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is  
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what  
  
[Raekwon]  
Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants  
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent  
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar  
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up  
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes  
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast  
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp  
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps  
Back to the dormatory, where niggas  
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory  
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade  
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad  
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't  
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped  
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back  
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down  
  
[GZA]  
From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother  
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors  
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it  
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it  
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion  
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned  
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork  
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt  
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted  
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted  
We criticize producers til they joints are right  
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light  
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions  
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen  
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old  
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano  
  
[RZA]  
Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers  
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers  
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German  
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning  
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight  
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like  
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?  
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings  
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto  
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro  
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple  
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle  
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline  
Plump breasts, was filled with saline  
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine  
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team  
  
[Masta Killa]  
Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?  
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?  
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets  
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding  
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus  
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue  
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum  
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit  
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room  
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker  
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener  
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel  
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional  
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in

God damn man these radio station be buggin  
Man it's three o'clock in the mornin, damn  
This hip-hop shit just keep  
Damn we got to slow this shit down man, ya know what I mean?  
  
Fiends were never waiting in the hill  
They ran one step ahead  
But the jiggy was always there  
  
Upon the project pavement  
There was death, enslavement of the mind  
Single mothers are filled with stress  
  
As I lay there with my baby  
We would look, from the window, and cry  
Then suddenly in the sky  
  
Between the new world ages  
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear  
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)  
  
False MC's are melting  
In the dark, all the weak LP's are  
going down  
  
God released the tape out, early May  
And, I don't think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hip-hop game'll never be the same  
  
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang  
  
Upon the project pavement  
There was death, enslavement of the mind  
Single mothers are filled with stress  
  
Between the new world ages  
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air  
With the knowledge that God possess  
  
As I lay there with my baby  
We would look, from the window, and cry  
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky  
  
Billboards started melting  
In the dark, all the weak MC's are  
Going down  
  
God released the tape of, Earthly pain  
  
And, I don't think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hip-hop game'll never be the same  
  
And I don't think the world can take it  
Cause it took so long to make it  
And the hip-hop game'll never be the same  
  
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang  
  
Wu-Tang

You could never capture the Method Man's stature  
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggaz resigning  
Now master my style? Never

Razor sharp, I sever the head from the shoulders  
I'm better than my compeda  
You mean competitor, whadeva, let's get together

(Wu come wild with the tri blaow)  
I react so thick, I'm phat and yo  
Rae came blowing and blew off ya headphones  
Black, rap from yo, Cali to Texas  
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to wreck this  
Brothers approach and half step but ain't heard  
Half of it yet and I bet you're not a what? Vet?  
So when you see me on the real, forming like Voltron  
Remember I got deep like a Navy Seal  
(Shame on a nuh who try to run game on a nuh)  
(Wu buck wild with the trigger)  
(Shame on a nuh who try to run game on a nuh)  
(I'll said get out)  
Yo, I come with that ol' loco  
Style from my vocal  
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals  
I'm no joker, play me as a joke  
I be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya  
Crews be acting like they gangs, anyway  
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play?  
Hurry, I getting it on, I let it out like diarrhea  
Got burnt once but that was only gonorrhea  
Dirty, I keeps the 'nuff stains my drawers  
So I can get Fizzy funky for yuh  
Murder, takes the fame of the Wu-Tang, rahh  
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane  
Ow, be like wild with my style  
Punk, you playing me, chump? You get dumped  
Wu is coming through at a theater near you  
And get funk like a shoe, what?  

Who's the knucklehead wantin' respect  
  
Yo, yo  
Never doubt the life  
Yo  
Who the fuck are you to criticize me  
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta' ya' wifey  
Yo, respect, that's my word  
  
Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen  
All my life I've been poverty stricken  
Always took what's mines, never was given  
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision  
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin'  
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position  
Street jurisdictions, nigga, no restriction  
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission  
Special edition crash course mission  
Push through like the task force and crush all competition  
See you from a distance, dry snitchin', whisperin'  
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches  
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches  
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin' with the fishes  
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas  
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business  
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted  
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin' from hot biscuit  
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district  
Leave no finger prints and no survivin' witness  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Street Life, Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O.  
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go  
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go  
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go  
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!  
  
Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese kitana  
Ninja coma, piranhas crack teeth on my armor  
Scandalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda  
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama  
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin' a revolver in my parker  
Bombin' unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder  
Fear the bow of the silent archer  
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter  
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror  
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda  
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar  
Your highness, the crowd holla  
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma  
Crowd sponsor, hotter than Bahama steam saunas  
The Rebel of opera, popped off the chocolate and the gosha  
Monster truck crush you impostors  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
I.N.S., Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential  
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru  
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to  
Actin' like the street, they ain't got no street credentials  
Crack villains, raps be killin' instrumentals  
The caps pealin' and slap a feelin' out ya dental  
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials  
Up shits creek lookin' for some more shit to get into  
Got the clan jewels as I continue  
To serve you everythin' on that's on the menu  
With chef John Jacob, remember sons Of man told you wake up  
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly  
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me  
The jedi, only use the force if ya force me  
Shaolin what  
Don't get it fucked up and cross me  
Rappers gettin' stuck for actin' stuck up and flossy  
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico  
Rap from the island called Stat', here we go  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
It's them kids from the other side Shaolin worldwide  
Method Man, Homicide, nowhere to run to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wantin' respect, wantin' respect  
Who's the knucklehead wantin respect  
Wantin' respect, wantin' respect  
Wantin respect, sharpest niggas in the ...

[Oh, fuck, you can't even sing]  
Hey, baby, I like it rawww...  
Yeah baby, I like it raawww!!!  
Ooh, baby, I like it raww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
Sh...  
  
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay  
Gimme the mic so I can take it away  
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage  
Yeah, from the home of the Dodgers, Brooklyn squad  
Wu-Tang Killerrr Bees on a swarm!  
Rain on ya dollar's ass, disco dorm!  
For you to even touch my skill  
You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he ain't gonna kill. Now  
My producer slam, my flow is like bam!  
Chop that down, pass it all around!  
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground!  
For any MC in any fifty two states  
I gets psycho killerrrr Norman Bates!  
My producer slam, sharp like bam!  
Jump on stage, and then I dun-daaaah!  
[I like the way you come]  
Hey, baby, I like it rawww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
Ooh, baby, I like it raww...  
Yeah baby, I like it rawww!!!  
  
(Repeat)

For money, I assassinate  
Today, I have an opponent that's worthy  
Now killing me  
You won't find that so easy  
  
Clap your hands  
Let's start the show, c'mon!  
Let's go  
Say one, two, three, four  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Uh, let's start the show  
C'mon, c'mon  
Say one, two, three, four  
  
Revolutionary gangster, the will to kill  
Everything up, my roots is steel  
Do it big time, march through the desert and shine  
Let the C's live free while we open the minds  
Of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand  
Is like dynamite, I fight for land  
Blood stains yo, gettin' money affect the plan  
We travel to Beijing and end up in Japan  
Hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear  
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards  
Then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa  
We know that's theirs, yes, we been actin' up  
Bush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers  
Out in Iraq, bless them with roses  
Foes try to approach, we roast them goats  
We terrorize the city while forgettin' the quotes  
  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Let's start the show, c'mon!  
Let's go  
Say one, two, three, four  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Uh, let's start the show  
C'mon, c'mon  
Say one, two, three, four  
  
They tryin' to take us back to Reaganomics with atomic bombs  
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic  
But Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ  
Islam means peace, the beast must pay a price  
For his wickedness, politics is the trickiest  
Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest  
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider  
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?  
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?  
The unclean man from the unclean land  
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest  
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless  
Put a price on things, that are priceless  
The fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness  
Who really has the power, is is theirs, is it ours?  
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?  
Do we have a press or President?  
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?  
Who got the evidence?  
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence  
  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Let's start the show, c'mon!  
Let's go  
Say one, two, three, four  
  
I oversee the world  
You taught many of 'em, many dudes  
I'm moldin' rappers and showed 'em how to eat  
Chef, the senator of thoughts  
Democratic gats  
Saved by the judge  
The flavor, that was brought about that day  
Steaks come out, raw  
  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Let's start the show, c'mon!  
Let's go  
Say one, two, three, four  
Say oh! Clap your hands  
Uh, let's start the show  
C'mon, c'mon  
Say one, two, three, four

[Chorus: Sunny Valentine (Tash Mahogany)]  
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter
chick  
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit  
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...  
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)  
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...  
  
[Streetlife]  
You'se a starter, like Candice Parker  
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father  
Still the athlete, play of the week  
G.P.A. 4.0 and the game's complete  
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team  
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen  
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing  
Together we can capture the ring  
You the human highlight, body type, just right  
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night  
All-star shine so bright  
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights  
You're my number one draft pick, Madonna classic  
No look dunks to the basket  
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[GZA]  
Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke  
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips  
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep  
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets  
Whatever situation or the circumstances  
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances  
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn  
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin  
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess  
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress  
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping  
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains  
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead  
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride  
Strapped and ready to ride  
  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Inspectah Deck]  
Yeah, that's my down bitch  
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man  
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan  
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves  
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs  
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back  
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that  
Damn right, she the star of my team  
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene  
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens  
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen  
Playboy status, every man's lust  
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs  
  
[U-God]  
I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor  
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?  
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now  
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down  
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground  
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down  
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first  
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt  
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down  
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style  
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off  
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off  
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer  
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro: kung fu sample]  
You've learned how to kill  
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end  
Yet, we wish to preserve life  
The first thing to learn, is that difference  
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning

[Sample]  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrows, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be....  
  
[RZA]  
I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shinin  
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds  
That be twinklin, while my love be sprinklin  
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinklin  
ALLAH's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious  
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless  
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases  
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces  
  
[Break]  
  
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions  
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection  
Who gives you all and never ask more of you  
The faithful companion that fights every war with you  
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical  
He's the all and all, you searchin for the oracle  
A mission impossible, purely philosophical  
But you call him on your death bed when you layin in the hospital  
  
[Break]  
  
And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil  
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil  
Building a home for themselves and storing food  
At night we praise ALLAH and adore the moon  
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child  
Only fearin' GOD, we great a ghost with a smile  
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh  
Meaning life has no partnership with death  
  
[Break]  
  
Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us  
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce  
Mentally dead, essentially lead by the false teachings  
And eventually pledge their allegiance  
To that which was against them and exempt them from the truth  
Then juiced them and pimp them to givin them ties  
So the church can rise, while their babies home hungry covered with flies  
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Trying to harness the wind  
ALLAH's the father from without and within  
On Christ return, who will announce him?  
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?  
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?  
ALLAH is the father of all, why do you doubt him?  
  
[Sample]  
  
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts  
the fists are the arrow, the body is the bow  
All movements have to be mental  
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful  
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance  
Avoid the enemy's strong points

After laughter, comes tears  
  
Yo check yo yo, check the script  
Me and the gods get it ripped  
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip  
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast  
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed  
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss  
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)  
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far  
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!  
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead  
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread  
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer  
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner  
"Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"  
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "No!"  
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag  
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.  
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block  
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)  
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet  
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete  
I picked him up, then I held him by his head  
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was  
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?  
It's always the good ones who have to die  
Memories in the corner of my mind  
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time  
I taught him, all about the bees and birds  
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
  
Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter  
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma  
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck  
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect  
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed  
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give  
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next  
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex  
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real  
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal  
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do  
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you  
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt  
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you  
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory  
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story  
But he carried on, with the same old stuff  
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck  
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.  
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now  
No life to live, doc says two more years  
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears  
  
After laughter, comes tears  
After laughter, comes tears

That's black?  
Whattup God?  
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?  
Oh shit! Yo!  
Hold the fuck up  
  
Aiyyo yo, eight niggaz down (just enough)  
Fuckin' around with my sound (city)  
Yo, bring backup (city)  
Fuckin' with me, and mine  
Murderous  
  
Check it, yo  
The world is shifty, we livin' just enough for the city  
The rough witty killa bee sting just like the jiggy  
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone  
Label them my anus and the casualty's home  
It glows coffin, Wu stormin' like the light brigade  
ride the wave like Frankie Avalon  
As I decipher AIDS crime pays  
The law's long arm be tryin' to strongarm, walkin timebombs  
before I bomb firearm  
The chalm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster  
He toke with his own love and expose the black toaster  
Composer was shook  
I took your bad looks for joke get your back broke  
Deep throat this murder I wrote  
The antidote be seekin' like a buried treasure  
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector  
Wanted dead or alive  
Rebel I escapes across the desert sand  
leavin' no footprints to trace  
Keep a war face, in your place  
Conceal the baby knives on the North breaks  
I still shine in shady times  
  
Yeah, yo  
We livin' just enough (livin' just enough)  
Just enough (in the city)  
Just enough, for the city  
  
Yo, in the jungle  
I make moves like Iron Monkey  
Plots to bump me off D.O.T. be on the hunt for me  
We stay hungry, for money drugs and guns  
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs  
Know the science be my Goddess  
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence  
And break the project silence, a vision  
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison  
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world  
for the world war is ocean bomber  
Visionary soldier comma  
My code of honor, mind still start from the drama  
Trauma sent the victim, witness them run, scream in horror  
Military chopper come gun down the slum  
The outcome do or die Son it's bound to come  
Mentally aware I see truth within the square  
The future's here catch me on computer software  
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official  
It's a thirty-eight special, that steps through  
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle  
I may die in the scuffle but I'm takin' forty devils  
  
We livin' just enough  
Just enough  
Just enough  
For the city  
  
Killa beez, sting McEEEZ, yeah, Wu

Yeah, yeah  
I see everything  
I see everything  
You know what I'm sayin?  
  
It's like when we come through  
You better have your fuckin' third eye open  
You know, cause that's what time it is  
You know what I'm sayin?  
  
'Cause it's like, when you walk  
You striving for perfection  
That's what we doing  
Understand?  
  
So all that little fake shit out there  
We know the science on that  
We done seen that shit from, from  
From difference of angles  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
It's like, yo kid, for real  
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid  
You know what I'm sayin?  
  
But you know, you know us  
We play it calm, humble  
You know what I'm sayin?  
But I just be checking out niggaz darts and I be like  
  
Damn, them niggaz, them niggaz is  
Really, really, really, really, really  
They gonna stay shit!  
Uh ha, uh ha ha  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller  
You know what I'm sayin?  
Rather I say we the soul controllers  
  
The bottom line, like I said  
Deal with freedom, justice, equality  
You know?  
Keep shining, add on  
  
Food, clothing, and shelter  
All my niggaz, go pick up uniforms  
Go, when you buy this album  
Go pick up uniforms, for real  
  
You know what I'm sayin?  
'Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody  
We doing this shit for certain niggaz kid  
Certain people rather, certain  
  
Certain fans, certain supporters  
Certain delegators, word  
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these  
Fake ass niggaz fucking, running with the fucking globe  
  
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the  
Way it, it should really be seen  
You know what I'm sayin?  
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics  
  
Spread it right  
You know what I'm sayin?

Wu, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang, Tang  
  
The joy the flowers bring me  
The pain still has me sinking  
All while the heart gently weeps  
Your smell has got me shrinking  
The tears in your eyes are twinkling  
Because the heart gently weeps  
  
[Raekwon]  
Snowy night, fiends basing  
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing  
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off  
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck  
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck  
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two  
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl  
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent  
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding  
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut  
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies  
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib  
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her  
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess  
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her  
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us  
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers  
  
[Ghostface Killah]  
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart  
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's  
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar  
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark  
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down  
  
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound  
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim  
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again  
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby  
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though  
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...  
You better kill me... you know you're booty...  
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!  
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it  
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing  
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him  
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him  
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles  
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows  
I had to show him what it's all about  
Next thing you read in the paper "A man who came to kill, gets knocked out"  
  
[Chorus: Erykah Badu]  
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you  
Man's not supposed to cry...  
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy  
How tears of joy, bring so much life  
  
[Method Man]  
Yo aiyo yo yo yo  
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch  
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up  
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup  
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up  
He killed Kase and now he hassling us  
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up  
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block  
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot  
  
[Chorus]

[Both] Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up

[Ghost] We too black for BET

If a civilized person doesn't perform, his duty  
What shall be done?  
[Ghost] Pardon me God, that nigga gotta gun  
Bulgin out his sweatpants, check out his stance  
See the side of his grill?

[Busta Rhymes]  
Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?  
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?  
Yeah yeah yeah..  
Historical and monumental shit  
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball  
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall  
Niggas play hard and shit, if you know what's best for you  
Why y'all niggas better safeguard your shit  
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap  
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap  
Street niggas now the corporate boss  
Still go to why y'all restaurant for steamed fish and Irish moss  
And why-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb  
Your whole show wack and I'ma cancel your sitcom  
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm  
You ain't knowing my name tattooed on your bitch arm  
The way we blow shit is a shame  
Casually bust my gun and celebrate busting a cork on the champagne  
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas  
Why'all should know I only ball like a coach, now!  
  
[Raekwon the Chef]  
Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches  
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous  
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs  
That's my specialty, more to bust  
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord  
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established  
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry  
S-5, blowin through Asbury  
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand  
Them them niggas, robbing from Pinkhouse's  
Show and prove, knocking off cab drivers  
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand  
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem  
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses  
Limousine, automatic new Uzi's in 'em yo  
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him  
  
[GZA]  
Move up the block, giant box blast my song  
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on  
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias  
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris  
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in  
Some assuming they paid dues and joined the union  
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle  
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble  
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed  
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed  
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant  
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments  
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise  
Starlight scope, with the night vision device  
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice  
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
