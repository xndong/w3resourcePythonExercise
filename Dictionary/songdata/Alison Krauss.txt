In this world I walk alone with no place to call my home  
But there's One who holds my hand  
The rugged road through barren lands  
The way is dark, the road is steep  
But He's become my eyes to see  
The strength to climb, my griefs to bear  
This Savior lives inside me there  
  
In Your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
  
In these trials of life I find  
Another Voice inside my mind  
He comforts me and bids me live  
Inside the love the Father gives  
  
In your love I find release  
A haven from my unbelief  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee  
Take my life and let me be  
A living prayer my God to thee

Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
I'm just trying to make a living  
Working jobs that I enjoy  
But it ain't easy finding something  
For this lonesome-hearted boy  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
You know my life is like a highway  
Just too many roads to take  
You know I'll try to take the right one  
Just gets harder every day  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
Another day, another dollar  
That's what I'm working for today, hey  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
Another day, another dollar  
Sure can't buy my blues away  
  

Wind is blowin' 'round the cabin  
I hate to hear that lonesome sound  
I'm all alone and so downhearted  
Since my true love she ain't around  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
She had no cause to go and leave me  
For I had never done her wrong  
She left our own little children  
Now with another man she's gone  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn  
  
Children they are sound asleepin'  
Oh they don't know that their mother's gone  
What will I do when they awaken?  
Can I tell them their mother's wrong?  
  
I hate to see that sun a sinkin'  
Another night to toss and turn  
Another night to dream about her  
Another night for her I yearn

The big moon is risin' so bright in the sky  
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes  
It rises above me so bright and so blue  
And I won't see anyone, as lovely as you  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know, in my heart  
So lay down beside me and hold me tonight  
For your love has found me and it feels so right  
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few  
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know  
Take me into the night,  
Past these lonely dreams in my heart  
I love you, more than I could show you  
More than I could know, in my heart  
In my heart  
  

Baby, dry your eyes  
There's no need to cry  
'Cause I'll see you again  
It might be a while  
Before you understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
Crossing over Jordan  
To the other shore  
I'll be standing, waiting  
With all who've gone before  
I'm just away down the river  
A hundred miles or more  
  
Now the pictures on the wall  
Will help you to recall  
They're not there  
To make you sad  
But to remember  
All the good times we had  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it's time to leave  
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze  
And the snow will fill the stream  
And carry you to me  
  
[Chorus]

Baby mine, don't you cry  
Baby mine, dry your eyes  
Rest your head close to my heart  
Never to part  
Baby of mine  
  
Little one, when you play  
Don't you mind what they say  
Let those eyes sparkle and shine  
Never a tear  
Baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All of those people who scold you  
What they'd give just for the right to hold you  
  
From your head, down to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Sweet as can be  
Baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All those same people who scold you  
What they'd give just for the right to hold you  
  
From your head, down to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Sweet as can be  
Baby of mine  
Baby of mine

Baby, now that I've found you  
I won't let you go  
I build my world around you  
I need you so, baby even though  
You don't need me now  
  
Baby, now that I've found you  
I won't let you go  
I build my world around you  
I need you so, baby even though  
You don't need me  
You don't need me no no (mm)  
  
Baby, baby, when first we met  
I knew in this heart of mine  
That you were someone I couldn't forget  
I said right and abide my time  
  
Spent my life looking for that somebody  
To make me feel like you  
Now you tell me that you want to leave me  
But darling, I just can't let you  
  
Baby, baby, when first we met

(mm mm mm)

Whenever my soul is lonely  
Whenever I'm feeling blue  
I start thinkin' 'bout my blue eyed darlin'  
And my heart starts pinin' for you  
  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
'Cause my sweet baby ain't around  
When my life's got me down  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
  
When I'm lost in this ocean of darkness  
Not knowing which way I should turn  
And my eyes are filled with sadness  
Of knowing you'll never return  
  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
'Cause my sweet baby ain't around  
And when my life's got me down  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
'Cause my sweet baby ain't around  
And when my life's got me down  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound  
And when my life's got me down  
I wanna hear that high lonesome sound

Blue trail of sorrow  
Lies upon the ground  
And I get so lonely  
Since you let me down  
Well, I used to be so happy  
Walkin' on these streets  
Now there's just sadness  
Everywhere I meet  
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down  
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground  
Now when I had a dollar  
You'd stick right by me  
Now I've got nothin'  
But blues for company  
Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow  
I'm tired of this old town  
But it won't be hard to find me  
If you look down on the ground  
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town  
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down  
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around  
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground  

So you're on your own lookin' down the road that goes only by one way  
And you don't need the signs to see lonely still runs both ways  
So who's the fool that would think the ties would be better off undone  
Did your heart even warn you when you veered from the path that was narrower
and straight  
  
On the borderline  
Somewhere between the flight for freedom  
Feeling like you can't move on  
The chore will be the time  
Takes you off of my mind and out of my heart I know  
And when you cross over there's no turning back  
Once that burning bridge is gone  
  
I may lose but I'm in it for the long run  
Loving you for good reason could be the wrong one  
I don't wanna lose control but the heart won't learn  
To let it well enough for long  
  
On the borderline  
Somewhere between the flight for freedom  
Feeling like you can't move on  
The chore will be the time  
Takes you off of my mind and out of my heart I know  
And when you cross over there's no turning back  
Once that burning bridge is gone  
  
So you're on your own lookin' down the road that goes only by one way

From the bright sunny south to the war, I was sent,  
E'er the days of my boyhood, I scarcely had spent.  
From it's cool shady forests and deep flowing streams,  
Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.  
Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.  
When I had to leave home in our tender years.  
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,  
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.  
Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:  
"As you go in defence of our dear native land,  
"Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.  
"Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again."  
In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,  
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.  
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,  
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord.  
  

I stood on faith and the corner of ambition  
I came here to sink or swim  
And to show them all that they were wrong  
And though I never thought I'd make it this far  
  
So the curtains are down  
For the moment I'm someone  
There were those in the wings who waited,  
Who came this way  
Now there gone  
But there's always someone at home  
Who never forgets who you are  
  
When I'm down and I'm growing old  
I won't be along no railroad track  
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home  
  
When I'm down and I'm growing old  
I won't be along no railroad track  
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home  
  
Can't go on,  
I'm on the top of my better years  
I'm going home,  
It's too lonesome on the bottom rung here  
  
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps  
Between these cracks on Broadway  
And my stride in rhythm to  
The beat of home, sweet home

Come down off your throne and leave your body alone  
Somebody must change  
You are the reason I've been waiting so long  
Somebody holds the key  
  
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time  
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home  
  
Come down on your own and leave your body alone  
Somebody must change  
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years  
Somebody holds the key  
  
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time  
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home  
  
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time  
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home  
Can't find my way home  
Can't find my way home  
Can't find my way home

Dark clouds hangin' over me  
When will they go away?  
Rain is in my eyes and I can't see  
Life's become just cloudy days  
  
Why she done me like she done  
I guess I'll never know  
She knows I need her more than anyone  
I made a point to let it show  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
I recall a time when times were good  
Lord, it seems so long ago  
But you know they say if rain won't come  
Then love has no chance to grow  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand...  
  
Cloudy days don't the sun ever shine anymore?  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days  
  
Stormy weather will you always be around?  
When I'm down, I can't stand cloudy days

Go on and lie I've heard it all before  
You had no shame  
This pain I feel you've never known  
The rain outside is shifting in the wind  
The road is looking lonelier  
Alone again  
  
Love is real  
Then love goes on and on  
The words you say condemn you  
As the guilty one  
I guess you're not the kind you claim to be  
Always looking out to get your love for free  
  
Could you lie and say you love me just a little  
One more wrong will keep us one more night  
When quiet fades at the light of day  
I see the truth  
It's on your face again  
  
When morning breaks my heart won't understand  
Spend a lifetime raising houses on the sand  
The rain outside is shifting in the wind  
The road is looking lonelier  
Alone again  
  
Could you lie and say you love me just a little  
One more wrong will keep us one more night  
When quiet fades at the light of day  
I see the truth  
It's on your face again

I lit my love and watched it burn:  
Asking nothing in return.  
Except the lessons I will learn.  
From holding crazy faith.  
  
I've been touched by that bright fire.  
Down to the root of my desire,  
While the smoke, it rises higher.  
Glowing crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:  
It tells me.  
  
Am I a fool for hanging long?  
Would I be a fool for being long gone.  
When is daylight gonna dawn,  
On my crazy faith.  
  
The questions will not let me sleep,  
The dance is buried way too deep.  
But the bottom lover, lover's keep,  
Made by crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:  
It tells me.  
  
Love you're losin', those you love,  
Let the hope fly from the glove.  
Do not search the skies above.  
Search your crazy faith.  
  
Love is lightning, love is ice.  
It only strikes the lucky twice.  
Once or you will know the price.  
And once for crazy faith.  
  
You're not asking if I love this man.  
I know you don't, you don't believe you can.  
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.  
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.

I don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain  
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue  
If I lost you to another, think I'd drown out here for sure  
Won't you stay with me and be my only cure?  
  
Dark skies may cloud my day  
But that don't bother me  
As long as I can hold you close to me  
  
I don't need a part time lover to leave me in the cold  
With empty arms to hold when I need you  
Tell me that there is no other, send the cold wind from my door  
Give you all my love and more if you want me to  
  
Dark skies may cloud my day  
But that don't bother me  
As long as I can hold you close to me

Daylight falls  
And I'm lost in the big parade  
Hold my hand, darling  
I'm afraid of the daylight  
  
Shade is dark  
Cool and languid for life or long  
Safe in shadow,  
It's never as dark as the daylight  
As the daylight  
  
When I was just knee high  
My momma told me never try to be  
Someone that I am not  
Yet over time I had forgot  
A wandering child, so lost at play  
He's found himself,  
But he can't find his way  
In the daylight, oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight  
  
Life is short  
And there's no turning back the time  
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb  
In that daylight  
  
In my mind  
There's a corner I need to turn  
Lessons left is a lesson learned  
In the daylight  
In the daylight  
  
I miss the forest shade  
That took me there  
The promise I made  
Can never leave the dark so dear  
Safe and soothing yet I fear  
As I recall and I reflect  
I see it's safer to connect  
To the daylight  
Oh the daylight  
Oh daylight, oh daylight  
  
Daylight falls  
And I'm lost in the big parade  
Hold my hand darling, I'm afraid  
Of the daylight, of the day ...

Leaving is the longest word I ever learned  
In the time it takes to say it, the whole world has turned  
If a heartbeat lasts a lifetime then I've lived before  
'cause I remember standing at this open door  
  
[Chorus]  
This path is not the one I'd choose to travel  
Even as we watch what tied us unravel  
And the tears fall like rain  
Deeper than crying, the loving still remains  
  
Neither wants to be the one to say goodbye  
And neither wants to be the one who's left to cry  
But in our secret heart of hearts we both know  
That the time for patching up has passed and it's time to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I'll be the one to pull our tangled lives apart  
I won't dodge the angry words that hide a broken heart  
And my calm fare-thee-wells cannot obscure  
That deep inside, my heart is also hurtin' so  
  
[Chorus]

Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay  
Didn't leave nobody but the baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn  
Didn't leave nobody but the baby  
  
You're sweet little babe  
You're sweet little babe  
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop  
Gonna' bring a bottle to the baby  
  
Don't you weep pretty babe  
Don't you weep pretty babe  
She's long gone with her red shoes on  
Gonna' need another lovin' baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
You and me and the Devil makes three  
Don't need no other lovin' baby  
  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Go to sleep you little babe  
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones  
And be my ever-lovin' baby

Sometimes I wonder where you're coming from  
When you roll in like thunder just to turn around and run  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
  
You smell like moonlight and early morning rain  
Pray til a fool but surrender to your pain  
Or find a cure for your decay  
  
Chorus:  
You're at your best with an ache in your chest  
And that worn out old song that you play  
Only Jesus and you who long to teach us  
Should know and be left to betray  
  
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame  
You can choose the dancer if you could choose the flame  
I think you'll find they're one in the same  
It doesn't have to be this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame  
Pray til a fool but surrender to your pain  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
  
Sometimes I wonder where you're coming from  
When you roll in like thunder just to turn around and run  
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay  
It doesn't have to be this way

As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O sisters let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O sisters let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O brothers let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
Come on brothers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O fathers let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O fathers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O mothers let's go down,  
Let's go down, don't you want to go down,  
Come on mothers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O sinners let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O sinners let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!

My father's name was Hannibal, Mama was Hanna-Mariah.  
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire  
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry.  
We lost it all only love was left, and that was the one thing money can't buy.  
  
We're all dust bowl children  
Singin' a dust bowl song  
And the crops won't grow,  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
When the green fields are gone.  
When the green grass growing fields are gone.  
  
Well, they said in California, there was work of every kind.  
The only work that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.  
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream.  
But now all the work is being done by a big ol' machine.  
  
We're all dust bowl children  
Singin' the dust bowl song  
And the crops won't grow  
And the dust just blows  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone  
When the green fields are gone  
When the green grass growing fields are gone

Are you leaving, are you going?  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing?  
Are you wishing you'd never met me?  
Does it take some train whistle blowing  
To forget me?  
  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel  
  
Are you leaving, are you going?  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing?  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel

Endless highway,  
As far as I can see  
The road'll take me  
Back to him tonight  
It's been so long since  
I've seen him smile  
I'll be counting all the miles  
'Til I get home  
  
[Chorus:]  
How many hours  
'Til I hold him?  
How many days  
Before we hit the road again?  
Endless highway,  
He don't know  
How much I miss him  
Heading down this road,  
Bound for Tennessee  
  
Lonesome feeling,  
Deep inside my heart  
Longing for  
This weary night to end  
I'll think about him,  
Try to keep my tired eyes open  
Come the morning light,  
I'll be back home again  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Look at the sky, baby  
What do you see?  
Looks like the tears that I cry  
Fallin' down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
Take a look around now  
Why don't you feel  
The way that cold wind stings and bites  
And your words just are like arrows through my heart  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes  
  
Look at the sky, baby, see how it cries?  
Ain't it just like my tears  
Fallin' down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes

Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Isaac  
He walked with God both day and night but he didn't wanna die  
He cried, oh Lord, please let me live, death is close I know  
God smiled down on Isaac and gave him fifteen years to go.  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die  
Well, I long for the day when I'll have new birth 'cause I love the livin'
here on earth  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.  
  
When Jesus lived here on this earth he knew his father's plan  
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of men  
When Judas had betrayed him his father heard him cry  
He was brave until his death but he didn't wanna die hey.  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die  
Well, I long for the day when I'll have new birth 'cause I love the livin'
here on earth  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die.  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die

Forget about it  
I'm admittin' I was wrong  
And I'll just take what's mine  
And walk right out the door  
  
Forget about it  
I'll split and I'll be gone  
And you'll have memories  
You'll find hard to ignore  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When I can't recall  
How you drove me crazy  
Forget about it  
When forever's over  
I won't remember how much  
I loved you anymore  
  
Forget about it  
Put me out of your head  
Now that you're free and easy  
Out there on the town  
Forget about it  
When you're lying in bed  
Just wishing I was there to lay you down  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When you will recall  
How I drove you crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I can't remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it  
  
Forget about it  
When you see me on the street  
Don't wink, don't wave  
Don't try to tease me with your smile  
Forget about it  
If we chance to meet somewhere  
Don't think it's 'cause I'm trying to reconcile  
  
'Cause after all  
I'll see you sometime maybe  
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier  
Forget about those stars in your eyes  
Laying by the fireside  
Holding you tight  
I can't remember when I felt so right  
So just forget about it

I don't pick up the mail,  
I don't pick up the phone,  
I don't answer the door,  
I just soon be alone  
I don't keep this place up,  
I just keep the lights down,  
I don't live in these rooms,  
I just rattled around  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm shadow upon these walls,  
As quietly as a mouse,  
I haunt these halls,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
I don't care if it rains,  
I don't care if it's clear,  
I don't mind stayin' near,  
There's another ghost here,  
He sits down in your chair,  
And he shines with your light,  
And he lays down his head,  
On your pillow at night  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,  
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house

Some sunny day-hay baby  
When everything seems okay, baby  
You'll wake up and find out you're alone  
Cause I'll be gone  
Gone, gone, gone really gone  
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong  
  
Everyone that you meet baby  
As you walk down the street baby  
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone  
Why you're on your own  
Just say I'm gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong  
  
If you change your way baby  
You might get me to stay baby  
Ya better hurry up if ya don't wanna be alone  
Or I'll be gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Really gone  
Gone, ga-gone  
Cause you done me wrong

I'm soaring the sky  
I can hear the birds and man they don't lie  
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this high  
  
I'm moving on  
I got the words to a brand new song  
How you gonna catch me, when I'm this close  
  
Chorus:  
Gone tomorrow here today  
Just in case you got somethin' to say  
I'll be leaving with the breast of  
Goodbye is all we have  
  
I disconnected the phone  
Told the neighbors I'll be heading home  
As soon as the light hits the morn  
  
I'm heading north  
Gonna see what this heart's really worth  
I guess it's time to be on my own  
  
(Chorus)  
  
I sure would love to see you tonight  
Maybe try to end this fight  
If I don't hear you knockin' on my door  
Then I'll know for sure  
  
(Chorus)

With your love I was complete  
Like a haven safe from harm  
Till the bitter stole the sweet  
I was perfect in your arms  
A precious while I had your smile  
Till it all fell apart with one change of heart  
  
The pain and regret will fade but a fact of love will still remain  
You can't always trust happiness  
Love like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fades  
You can't always trust happiness  
  
If a single star I see  
Ever made a wish come true  
It would bring you back to me  
But the best my heart can do  
Is to love again, I don't know when  
Still it's worth all I fear, the heartaches and the tears  
  
Love like a lesson learned when we pass the point of no return  
You can't always trust happiness  
There in love's steady glow hides the power to hurt us so  
You can't always trust happiness

Way up north where the snow flies and the sun don't hardly shine  
If it weren't for my true love, I'd long ago lost my mind  
I'd long ago lost my mind  
  
There's good folks here, good folks there, most everywhere I go  
But the land of my heart is down where the snow white cotton grows  
Where the snow white cotton grows  
  
When the river runs over from the melting snow, we'll take to the higher
ground  
When the water goes down again we'll saddle our old paint  
We'll be homeward bound  
Me and my love will be homeward bound  
  
Heartstrings hold tighter than the roots of a live oak tree  
Holdin' through tornado winds  
Tougher than timber, stronger than steel  
They'll guide me back southward again  
They'll guide me back southward again  
  
When the river runs over from the melting snow, we'll take to the higher
ground  
And when the water goes down again we'll saddle our old paint  
We'll be homeward bound  
Me and my love will be homeward bound

Out on the hills of glory land  
So happy and free at God's right hand  
They tell of a place of marvelous grace  
On heaven's bright shore  
Pilgrims on earth someday will go  
To live in that home forever more  
Trusting in Him who died for sin,  
And rose from the grave  
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),  
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)  
Not one little grave (not one little grave),  
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).  
Not even a tear will dim the eye,  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)  
When I must cross that rolling tide,  
There'll be someone on the other side  
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love  
When I walk up the milky white way,  
I'll see that home coming in a ray  
How great it must be for angels to see  
A pilgrim reach home  
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),  
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)  
Not one little grave (not one little grave),  
In all that fair land (that wonderful land)  
Not even a tear will dim the eye,  
And no one up there will say goodbye  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore  
Just singing His praise through endless days  
On Heaven's bright shore  
  

I've had nothing but sorrow  
Since you said we were through  
There's no hope for tomorrow  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Every sweet thing that matters  
Has been broken in two  
All my dreams have been shattered  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Got no plans for next Sunday  
Got no plans for today  
Every day is blue Monday  
Every day you're away  
  
Though our pathways have parted  
To your memory I'm true  
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted  
How's the world treating you?  
  
Do you wonder about me  
Like I'm hoping you do?  
Are you lonesome without me?  
Have you found someone new?  
  
Are you burning and yearning?  
Do you ever get blue?  
Do you think of returning?  
How's the world treating you?

I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow  
Norman Blake  
I am a man of constant sorrow  
I've seen trouble all my day.  
I bid farewell to old Kentucky  
The place where I was born and raised.  
(The place where he was born and raised )  
For six long years I've been in trouble  
No pleasures here on earth I found  
For in this world I'm bound to ramble  
I have no friends to help me now.  
(chorus) He has no friends to help him now  
It's fare thee well my old true lover  
I never expect to see you again  
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad  
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.  
(chorus) Perhaps he'll die upon this train.  
You can bury me in some deep valley  
For many years where I may lay  
Then you may learn to love another  
While I am sleeping in my grave.  
(chorus) While he is sleeping in his grave.  
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger  
My face you'll never see no more.  
But there is one promise that is given  
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.  
(chorus) He'll meet you on God's golden shore.  
  

Last night, my dear , the rain was fallin'  
I went to bed so sad and blue  
Then I had a dream of you  
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening  
Underneath the harvest moon  
I was thinking about you  
Then we met out in the moonlight  
The stars were shining in your eyes  
But another was there to  
  
I don't believe you've met my baby  
You looked at her, you looked at me  
I wondered who you were talkin' to  
I shook the hand of your stranger  
But I was shaking all inside  
I was still wondering who  
Your arm was resting on her shoulder  
You smiled at her, she smiled at you  
Her eyes were filled with victory  
She said, "my brother wants to marry"  
And then my heart was filled with glee  
I knew that you would marry me

I been up and down before  
Grief won't hold me any more  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
Thought I loved you for awhile  
You were loaded up on style  
Talk is cheap but I won't play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
No I won't play the games that you've designed  
And I won't wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
I'll repeat it so I'm heard  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
You won't stay another night  
Or did you want another right  
Now I've got the eyes to see  
You get your kicks by hurting me  
  
No I won't play the games that you've designed  
And I won't wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
I'll repeat it so I'm heard  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way

I don't know why the sky is so blue  
I don't know why I'm so in love with you  
If there were no music, I would not get through  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why somewhere dreams come true  
I don't know where we'll find a place for you  
Every time you look that way I lay down my life for you  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why sun can make you cry  
I don't know how I'm bound to get you back, but I'll try  
They don't mean to cause you pain, they're just afraid of loving you  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do  
  
I don't know why the trees grow so tall  
I don't know why I don't know anything at all  
If there were no music, I would not get through  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do, I do  
I don't know why I know these things, but I do

The wind is blowing down the quiet river  
A shining road that carries you alone  
Baby boy, my love will last forever  
If you're to live, I must give you up to God  
  
I know our God will guide, protect, and keep you  
Teach you faith and hold you by the heart  
Though your mother's heart is broken by your leaving  
Her Father knows just who he is and who you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish that life wasn't always ending up this way  
With Heaven's love at stake and hell to pay  
But you in God's loving plan might be the missing part  
You must live  
So I give you to his heart  
  
The wind is blowing down the silent river  
A shining road that leaves me all alone  
A life for you's worth losing you forever  
Some day we'll stand in God's fair land, forever home  
  
[Chorus x 2]

I don't know about tomorrow  
I just live for day to day  
I don't borrow from the sunshine  
For it's skies may turn to gray  
I don't worry o'er the future  
For I know what Jesus said  
And today I'll walk beside Him  
For He knows what lies ahead  
Many things about tomorrow  
I don't seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand  
Ev'ry step is getting brighter  
As the golden stairs I climb  
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter  
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined  
There the sun is always shining  
There no tear will dim the eye  
At the ending of the rainbow  
Where the mountains touch the sky  
Many things about tomorrow  
I don't seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand  

Who knows how long I've loved you?  
You know I love you still  
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?  
If you want me to, I will  
  
For (and) if I ever saw you  
I didn't catch your name  
But it never really mattered  
I will always feel the same  
  
Love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart  
  
And when at last I find you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
Make it easy to be near you  
For (and) the things you do endear you to me  
You know I will  
  
I will  
  
Love you forever and forever  
Love you with all my heart  
Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart  
  
And when at last I find you  
Your song will fill the air  
Sing it loud so I can hear you  
Make it easy to be near you  
For (and) the things you do endear you to me  
Oh, you know I will

I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold  
I'd rather be His than have riches untold  
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land  
I'd rather be led by His nail scarred hands  
  
Than to be the king of a vast domain  
Or be held in sin's dread sway  
I'd rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today  
  
I'd rather have Jesus than mens applause  
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause  
I'd rather have Jesus than world wide fame  
I'd rather be true to His holy name  
  
Than to be a king of the best domain  
Or be held in sin's dreads way  
I'd rather have Jesus than anything  
This world affords today

I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind  
I know this is just a customary feelin'  
The moon is our deceiver that will leave you running blind  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If I didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love with you  
  
Didn't want to  
Look in the eyes of the one that I would be drawn to  
I'm a moth lost in a fire  
And I know this is just a beautiful illusion, a case of the confusion, between
love and desire  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If I didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love  
  
When the flame burns out  
And fine'ly settles down  
And you'd forget I ever came around  
  
Your heart is pullin'  
If I didn't know any better  
I'd be fallin'  
Deeper and deeper it's true  
I'd hear it callin'  
If didn't know any better  
And I'd be in love with you  
  
I turned around  
Before I could run I found you already settled down in the back of my mind

When the curtains of the night are pinned back by the stars  
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky  
Dewdrops from heaven are kissing the rose  
It's then that your memory flies  
  
Well, upon the wings of a beautiful dove  
I'll hasten this message of cheer  
And I'll bring you a kiss of affection and say  
I'll remember you love in my prayers  
  
Now the angels of heaven are guarding the good  
As God has ordained them to do  
In answer to prayers that I offer to him  
I know there's one waiting for you  
  
Now go where you will upon land or on sea  
And I'll share all your sorrows and cares  
At night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers  
  
Well at night as I kneel by my bedside to pray  
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers

When you came to me  
You said love could not erase  
The ever present memory of another face  
  
I tried to make you love me  
How I could I be so blind  
To think I'd be the one to change your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I'm gone before you start  
Well you can find me in your heart  
Who can say if its right wrong  
I've waited for you too long  
And if I can't hold on  
I'm Gone  
  
When you came to me  
I said love will find a way  
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay  
  
I guess you couldn't see  
As the shadow's in the night  
It seems the time for us just wasn't right  
  
[Chorus]

In your eyes, I see gentle rain  
Springtime comes, in love again  
Puts me back on my feet again  
And in your eyes, I feel no pain  
and in my mind, I saw love walk past  
A lovers dream within my grasp  
I never knew I could fall so fast  
But in your eyes I found love at last  
I found your love waiting at my door,  
I found a dream come true  
I've never known a love like this before  
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you  
I found your love waiting at my door,  
I found a dream come true  
I've never known a love like this before  
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you  
In your eyes, I see gentle light  
It gives me hope, it gives me life  
It gives me love when I hold you tight  
And in your eyes I found love tonight  
And in your eyes I found love tonight  
  
  

Who do you think you're talkin' to  
You know me and I know you  
Your silence and your stony face  
You don't have the ground to waste  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
What can we say when all is said  
A house divided cannot stand  
Your head and heart and chary gaze  
Life is just too short to waste  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind  
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
What can we do when all is done  
Your life's not the only one  
Just take a look beyond yourself  
The reason of your private hell  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  
I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind  
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied  
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter  
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you  

It's finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
How, I want to know  
Can you tell me plain and true  
How high will you fly  
Without me there to be your sky?  
Well, it don't matter now  
  
Don't mean to leave you  
Standing on your own  
I think back on days and nights  
We had long ago  
Maybe love  
Is just a game you play  
This much I do know  
It don't matter now  
  
It's finally come  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when  
I was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
Now I don't tell stories  
And I don't pretend  
I won't be around  
To say I told you then  
'Cause it seems like something's  
Finally broken  
That'll take a lot of mend  
But it don't matter now  
  
Is that sorry on your breath?  
Where were you when I  
Was sitting back here  
Missing you to death?  
It don't matter now  
It don't matter now  
It don't matter now

Do you remember the last time I said  
If I ever thought of lying  
I'd rather think of dying instead  
And the last time you called me  
To say we were through  
How it took a million tears  
Just to prove they all were for you  
  
But it wouldn't have made any difference,  
If you loved me  
How could you love me  
When it wouldn't have made any difference,  
If you loved me  
You just did not love me  
  
'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be  
In the most unfaithful arms  
That you always picture me  
Though I can't always show proof I was true  
No one else could change my mind  
Or stop me coming home to you  
  
But it wouldn't have made any difference,  
If you loved me  
How could you love me  
When it wouldn't have made any difference,  
If you loved me  
You just did not love me  
  
Enough to believe me  
Enough not to leave me  
Enough not to look for  
A reason to be unhappy with me  
And make me regret ever wanting you  
  
It wouldn't have made any difference  
Wouldn't have made any difference

No matter what I say or do,  
I just can't seem to get inside your heart  
What have I done wrong?  
Lately you're so far away,  
You just don't seem to hold me like you used to  
Something's going on  
I've got that old feeling, you're leaving  
I'm so tired of goodbye  
I can't wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind  
Morning finds us face to face  
I feel you staring through me while I'm talking  
Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks that said goodbye the last time  
Something I'm used to  
I've got that old feeling, you're leaving  
I'm so tired of goodbye  
I can't wait on your love forever  
While you change your mind  
  

In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground  
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town  
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind  
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side  
  
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead  
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread  
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside  
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?  
The day is almost over, soon it will be night  
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore  
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door  
  
Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream  
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream  
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log  
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek  
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east  
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene  
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

When He cometh, when He cometh  
To take up his jewels  
All his jewels, precious jewels  
His Loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown.  
  
He will gather, He will gather  
The jems for His kingdom  
All the pure ones, all the bright ones  
His loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown.  
  
Little children, little children  
O love their Redeemer  
All the jewels, precious jewels  
His loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown

I'm writing my last love letter  
And for reasons now, I don't know where to start  
Seems so many times I've written down "I love you"  
Well I hope this time I can get that through your heart  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall  
But I can't fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart  
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter  
And maybe I was wrong to ever think that you could love me  
I was hoping you just couldn't find the time  
Have my efforts been in vain with pen and paper?  
Did you ever care, did I ever cross your mind?  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall  
But I can't fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart  
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter  
In this letter  
In this letter  

It's been a long time coming  
As you shed a lonesome tear  
And now you're in a wonderama  
I wonder what you're doing here  
The flame no longer flickers  
You're feeling just like a fool  
You keep staring into your liquor  
Wondering what to do  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
Let me touch you for a while  
I'm gonna ruin my black mascara  
You're drinking whisky when it should be wine  
You keep looking into that mirror  
But to me you're looking really fine  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you  
Laugh at that cowgirl as she's walking out your door  
I know a way to make you smile  
Just let me whisper things you've never heard before  
Just let me touch you, baby  
Just let me touch you for a while  
I don't hardly know you  
But I'd be willing to show you  
I know a way to make you smile  
It's been a long time  
Let me touch you for a while  

Save me, free me from my heart this time  
Train's going down the track and I stay behind  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and lose again  
When the heart calls, the mind obeys  
And it knows better than me  
Hold on one more day and maybe he'll be true  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and I'll lose again  
Save me, free me from my heart this time  
Train's going down the track and I stay behind  
Nothing can free me from this ball and chain  
I made up my mind that I would live today  
And you're keeping me going, I know it's insane  
Cause I love you, and I'll lose again  
  

I got to run to keep in hidin'  
And I'm bound to go on ridin'  
I've got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I don't own the clothes I'm wearin'  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharin'  
I got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I got past the point of carin'  
And the road goes on forever  
I got one more silver dollar  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider  
  
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me Lord  
I ain't' gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider

It's feelin' longer now than it ever has before  
Another memory is another slammin' door  
It's gettin' too dark now to see  
  
Every photograph is another lesson learned  
Every sleepless night is another page I've turned  
I wake up to fallin' dreams  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
  
If I had a chance, I must've missed it long ago  
If I could run away, I wouldn't have to let you go  
This angel's bound to stray  
  
Like an hourglass, I'm a soul to sinkin' sand  
You try to hold my heart and I will slip right through your hands  
Time just blows away  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And the tears forever flow  
  
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences  
Just another shade of miles and miles to go  
And this angel's bound to stray  
It's another shade of miles and miles to go

Every time I think of you  
I always catch my breath  
And I'm still standing here  
And you're miles away  
And I'm wondering why you left  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
I hear your name in certain circles  
And it always makes me smile  
  
I spend my time  
Thinking about you  
And it's almost driving me wild  
And there's a heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What I might say  
  
There's a message  
In the wild  
And I'm sending you  
This signal tonight  
  
You don't know  
How desperate I've become  
And it looks like I'm losing this fight  
In your world  
I have no meaning  
Though I'm trying hard  
To understand  
And it's my heart that's breaking  
Down this long distance line tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
And there's a message that I'm sending out  
Like a telegraph to your soul  
And if I can't bridge this distance  
Stop this heartbreak overload  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I keep lying to myself  
And there's a storm that's raging  
Through my frozen heart tonight  
  
I ain't missing you at all  
Since you've been gone  
Away  
I ain't missing you  
No matter  
What my friends say  
  
Ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I keep lying to myself  
Ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
I ain't missing you  
Ain't missing you  
  
Oh no  
No matter what my friends might say  
I ain't missing you

What a dying world re-defines, the reasons we strive to exist  
Refrain control and we're bound to learn the meaning of moments like this  
'Cause in the peaceful lull, the quiet  
Seduced by the promise of bliss, we soon forget that nothing's happened yet  
We're living for moments like this  
  
So hold me, whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn who we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
  
From the dim light in the greyness, the aim of the soul tends to miss  
Then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitch  
We're made for the moments like this  
  
So hold me, whisper gently that there's nothing to fear  
You'll always be near, to remind me, to stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up  
  
It's in our power to face the storm with all its fury and madness  
The flash of thunder will be harnessed with the longing and sadness  
The clouds will grey.  
  
Hold me. Whisper gently this is what we live for, how we learn how we are  
It defines us, ever reminding us that life never is more precious than this  
Hold me. Whisper gently that there's nothing to fear,  
You'll always be near, to remind me, stand behind me  
Although life can be rough we can never give up.

Momma loved us, every one  
Every daughter, every son  
She gave herself so happily  
That's just the way she was, you see  
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore  
And work it 'til it was no more  
And every day until she died  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Her little girl was snatched away  
She was there and then just gone one day  
And momma blamed herself, I'd say  
But all of us had debts to pay  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
I did my best to cheer her pride  
That day that something broke inside  
I swore I'd find her and I tried  
In the evening, momma cried  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  
Momma cried  
There was mourning in the evening  
And momma cried  
'Cause her little girl was gone  

Album: Cold Mountain  
(Music from the Miramax Motion Picture)  
Year: 2003  
  
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire,  
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down,  
No cutlass pull will mark thy face,  
And you will be my ain true love.  
And you will be my ain true love .  
  
And as you walk through death's dark vale,  
The cannon's thunder can't prevail,  
And those who hunt thee down will fail,  
And you will be my ain true love.  
And you will be my ain true love.  
  
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth,  
The captain cries, Here comes the rout,  
They'll seek to find me north and south,  
I've gone to find my ain true love.  
  
The field is cut and bleeds too red,  
The cannon balls fly 'round my head,  
The infirmary man may count me dead,  
When I've gone to find my ain true love.  
I've gone to find my ain true love...

More wishes than a thousand hearts can count for you  
More smiles than a merry-go-round  
The sweetest ending to a bedtime story told  
My love follows you where you go  
  
More laughter than a kindergarten out to play  
One Sunday morning song that says it all  
More summer than the California beach can hold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow  
  
Take forgiveness, take a prayer, take the deepest breath  
And take the answers in your heart  
When you wake up and the world is cruel and cold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow  
  
More freedom than a field of flowers in the day  
More beauty than a mornin' after rain  
Up the steepest hill, a dark and crooked road  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin' at the unknown  
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me  
Watchin' you walk away slow

Don't expect too much from my poor old heart,  
You can blame me unforgiven for my scars,  
You might just be the best that I can find,  
But I can't seem to forget the tears I've cried,  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,  
It's a price I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found,  
  
Once upon a time I did believe,  
In my true love that swept me off my feet,  
Then the wind of change swept him away,  
And left me drowning in my own pain  
I don't know that I will ever love again,  
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found,  
I don't know that I will ever love again,  
It's the price that I must pay for all my sins,  
  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,  
It's the price I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found.  
  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,

My father was a farmer  
But his head was in the sky  
He worked everyday but Sunday  
'Til the day he died  
  
He prayed for rain and thunder  
And listened for the sound  
In the dry years he went under  
He never got off the ground  
  
We all dream when we're younger  
That we will do great things  
Me, I used to have a hunger  
To wear a pilot's wings  
  
But the circle's that I ran in  
Turned my head around  
And the planes I had my plans in  
Never got off the ground  
  
Don't raise your hopes  
You hear so many say  
The higher they get  
The closer they are to flying away  
Fly away  
  
Don't raise your hopes  
You hear so many say  
The higher they get  
The closer they are to flying away  
  
They say there but for fortune  
Is the way it would have been  
If we could take a bigger portion  
We'd fill our hands again  
  
You see them on the sidewalks  
In the parks all over town  
Those who've taken flight  
Never got off the ground

When this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no  
And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no, no,  
No I never will, No, no, no, no, no  
  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
You know I always will, ya, ya,  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya  
When they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill  
I'll always remember, ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will ya, ya, ya, ya, ya  
  
Guitar Instrumental  
  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no.  
No I never will give up, no, no.  
No I never will no, no  
And when this world is caught on fire  
I wanna be caught in your will  
I never will give up no, no,  
No I never will, No, no, no, no, no  
  
I'll always keep singin', ya, ya.  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya  
I'll always keep singin' ya, ya,  
Ya know I always will, ya, ya,  
And when they crucified my Lord up on Calverie's hill

No I never will give up, no, no,  
No I never will, no,no, no, no, no  
  

Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart  
Time forgets these bitter things I feel  
But your days are numbered  
You'll learn your lesson well  
When you finally play a heart that plays for real  
There's a new fool somewhere waiting  
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair  
She'll see through your intentions  
With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way  
Leaving was so easy  
But old hands do make fancy moves  
And I for one fell victim to your game  
But someday, you'll see that cold hearts can be broken too  
What goes round must come around your way  
There's a new fool somewhere waiting  
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair  
She'll see through your intentions  
With each lie that you tell  
And the old ways will go out with the new some way  
  

When I was a traveler  
I used to love to watch the rain  
I'd stand under the downspout  
Let the water cool my brain  
I never thought to worry  
If the river rose too high  
That all the seeds we planted  
Would get washed out with the tide  
But now I am a man  
And I need a place to hide  
But there's nowhere to run  
And there's no place to hide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide  
When I was a young man  
I could work through wind and rain  
I never thought to worry  
Had no reason to complain  
I thought that I was standin'  
On a rock so firm and strong  
But it was easy then to see  
Just what was right and what was wrong  
But now I am a man  
I won't be hangin' 'round too long  
When I was a child  
I used to love to watch the rain  
I'd stand under the downspout  
Let the water cool my brain  
I never thought to worry  
If the river rose too high  
And all the dreams we planted  
Would get washed out with the tide  
But there's nowhere to run  
And there's no place to hide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide  

Hey mama, when you leave  
Don't leave a thing behind  
I don't want nothin'  
I can't use nothin'  
  
Take care into the hall  
And if you see my friends  
Tell them I'm fine  
Not using nothin'  
  
Almost burned out my eyes  
Threw my ears down to the floor  
I didn't see nothin'  
I didn't hear nothin'  
  
I stood there like a block of stone  
Knowin' all I had to know  
And nothin' more  
Man, that's nothin'  
  
As brothers our troubles are  
Locked in each others arms  
And you better pray  
They never find you  
  
Your back ain't strong enough  
For burdens double fold  
They'd crush you down  
Down into nothin'  
  
Being born is going blind  
And buying down a thousand times  
To echoes strung  
On pure temptation  
  
Sorrow and solitude  
These are the precious things  
And the only words  
That are worth rememberin'

Same old place  
Same old city  
What can I do?  
I'm falling in love  
  
I'm just an old hound dog  
Roaming around, oh Lord  
I've got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
I get a feeling in me  
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights  
Can't you hear the music playing?  
You must have heard them saying  
We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Same old place  
It's the same old city  
What can I do?  
I'm falling in love  
  
I'm just an old hound dog  
Roaming around, Lord, Lord  
I've got all this and Heaven above  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
I hear you calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia  
  
Oh, Atlanta  
Hear me calling  
I'm coming back to you one fine day, hey  
No need to worry  
There ain't no hurry cause I'm  
On my way back to Georgia  
On my way back to Georgia

And I've lived a dozen lifetimes in twenty-some-odd years  
Got no use for trouble, got no use for tears  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
You're out all night, asleep all day, so pack it up and leave  
I've got no use for trouble, trouble's using me  
Don't you see my love won't be forever deaf and blind  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
I've had my share of sorrow, more than you could know  
Save your lies and alibis, I've heard that tune before  
Can't you see it's killing me, I'm old before my time  
I won't let you double the pain of a troubled life  
Can't you see that love can't be forever deaf and blind?  

Caught out running  
With just a little too much to hide  
Maybe baby  
Everything's gonna work out fine  
Please read the letter  
I pinned it to your door  
It's crazy how it all turned out  
We needed so much more  
  
Too late, too late  
A fool could read the signs  
Maybe baby  
You'd better check between the lines  
Please read the letter, I  
Wrote it in my sleep  
With help and consultation from  
The angels of the deep  
  
Once I stood beside a well of many words  
My house was full of rings and  
Charms and pretty birds  
Please understand me, my  
Walls come falling down  
There's nothing here that's left for you  
But check with lost and found  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
  
One more song just before we go  
Remember baby  
All the things  
We used to know  
Please read my letter  
And promise you'll keep  
The secrets and the memories and  
Cherish in the deep  
  
Ah...  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote  
Please read the letter that I wrote

Rain, please go away  
Leave me alone, come another day  
My love is gone, this time to stay  
Rain, please go away  
  
It's tough to live the whole day through  
Thinkin' of her is all I do  
She's happy now, and I'm so blue  
Rain, she's cold like you  
  
If only the time wouldn't drag so slow  
Find a new love and let it grow  
I'm kiddin' myself, it don't happen that way  
Rain, please go away  
  
Rain, please go away  
Leave me alone, come another day  
My love is gone, this time to stay  
Rain, please go away

The things that I love  
I hold dear to my heart  
They are borrowed and  
Not mine at all  
Jesus only let me use them  
To brighten my life  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then  
Show me where you brought me from and  
Where I could have been  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Nothing good have I done  
To deserve God's own Son  
I'm not worthy of the scars  
In His hands  
Yet he chose the road to Calvary  
To die in my stead  
Why He loved me I can't understand  
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then  
Show me where you brought me from and  
Where I could have been  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
Just remember I'm a human and human's forget  
So remind me, remind me dear Lord  
  
  

Honey, I know you've been alone some,  
Why don't you 'phone some, 'cause I love you.  
An' honey, I know I've been away some,  
I've had to pay some and you have too.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around, apprehended and led down town.  
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,  
'Cause I'm restless tonight.  
  
I just can't stand bein' alone.  
Gonna have to change that some day.  
There's a restless feelin' in my bones an' I know,  
That at times, it just won't go away.  
  
So if it's all the same, honey, I can't take the blame, baby,  
I can't play your game, honey, what's true is true.  
And if, in the end, the temptation wears you thin, honey,  
I'll, I'll just pretend that I'll leave it up to you.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around, apprehended andled down town.  
Can't help it if I'm full of fire.  
  
But the one thing I know: that when I, I turn out the light,  
Visions of you, dear, dance in the night.  
I've been put down, pushed around,apprehended and led down town.  
An' I can't help it if I'm out of sight,  
'Cause I'm restless tonight.

I got a woman with plenty of money  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
called my baby late last night  
She told me, daddy, everything was all right  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
I don't have to worry 'cause she's real fine  
I know my baby and she's all mine  
She give me a Cadillac, a diamond ring  
She told me, daddy, don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
She got the money and I got the Honey  
  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's the best woman that I ever had  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
She's all mine and I'm so glad  
  
Ah, stop your train  
Ah, mama, stop your train

Way back in the mountains  
Way back in the hills  
There used to live a mountaineer  
They called him Fiddlin' Will  
He could play most anything  
And some say he could sing  
But the one thing that he liked to do best  
Was sawing on the strings  
  
So, get out the fiddle  
And rosin up the bow  
Look at ol' Will a-pattin' his toe  
We'll make music till the rafters ring  
All that pickin' and a sawin' on the string  
  
When the neighbors had a shindig  
And they all had vittles to eat  
We'd always have to wait on Will  
To make the frolic complete  
When he comes down from the mountain  
All the gals began to sway  
Sometimes he'd pick that ol' five-string  
Until the break of day  
  
So tune up the five-string  
Tighten up the hide  
Tell all the hill folks to get inside  
All them pickin' and a-sawing on the string  
  
So tune up the five-string  
Tighten up the hide  
Tell all the hill folks to get inside  
All them pickin' and a-sawing on the string

Feat. Tony Rice  
  
Let me reach out Love and touch you, let me hold you for awhile  
I'd be known around the world, oh how I long to see you smile  
There's a shadow on the moon, and the waters here below  
Do not shine the way they should, and I love ya just in case you didn't know  
  
Let it go, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone,  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
  
Won't you lie down by me baby, run your fingers through my hands  
I'd be known around the town and still I do not understand  
Is it me or is it you, or the shadow of a dream  
Is it wrong to be in love, could it be the finest love I've ever seen  
  
Set it free, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind, and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door.  
  
Please kiss me gently darlin, where the river runs away  
From the mountains in the springtime, on a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around, as the shades of night grow deep  
As the morning stars grow dim, they will find us in the shadows fast asleep.  
  
Let it go, let it happen like it happend once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone,  
And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

Little yellow house sittin' on a hill  
That is where he lived  
That is where he died  
Every Sunday morning  
Hear the weeping willows cry  
  
Two children born  
A beautiful wife  
Four walls and livin's all he needed in life  
Always giving, never asking back  
I wish I had a simple love like that  
  
[Chorus]  
I want a simple love like that  
Always giving, never askin' back  
For when I'm in my final hour lookin' back  
I hope I had a simple love like that  
  
My mama was his only little girl  
If he'd had the money, he'd have given her the world  
Sittin' on the front porch, together they would sing  
Oh, how I long to hear that harmony  
  
[Chorus x 2]

I called you today  
Wanting a change  
I never meant to hurt anyone  
Never meant for you to pull out your guns  
But feelings won't stay  
In this meager parade  
You're beating to a different drum  
In this lack of all the luster we've become  
  
Save your breath  
You know we've both  
Tried our best  
But it's leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone  
  
Don't sit on the fence  
Living past tense  
Holding on to wishes and words  
Folding out a picture we blur  
'Cause here in the end  
I'm losing a friend  
Fighting back a tear when it burns  
Dividing up the pieces that we were  
  
Save your breath  
You know we've both  
Tried our best  
But it's leaving  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone  
  
I can't say you're all alone  
I'm accepting what I own  
Here lies a blanket and not a bandage  
  
I'm unable to restrain  
When the wake that we became  
Is drawing me under  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
  
This might as well be done  
I'm falling with the sun  
When the hours getting sour won't save with time  
I'm waving off the one  
Who wouldn't let me run  
Though we tried, it's a lie I can't keep dragging on  
I'm untying this sinking stone

Strange things are happening everyday  
I hear the music up above my head  
Though the side of my heart has left me again  
I hear music up above  
  
Secrets are written in the sky  
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found  
Though the sound of hope has left me again  
I hear music up above  
  
Standing in my broken heart all night long  
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost  
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross  
The finders love  
I know I loved you too much  
Ill go alone to get through  
  
I hear Rosetta singing in the night  
Echo's of lighting shine like stars after there gone  
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon  
With the music up above

I sat in the window of my room  
Watched you go away  
It was all I could do  
It was all I could do  
  
Your going away  
To leave me alone  
In all of this sorrow  
In this misery  
  
So look now, my darling  
I'll have to abandon  
All thought of you  
As your going away  
  
I still see your dear little head  
As it touched mine  
Saying goodbye, forever goodbye  
Those words you said to me have broken my heart  
Yes, they've broken my heart  
They were false and did lie  
  
Goodbye, my dear  
Goodbye forever  
Your going away  
Your going away  
  
Death is hard  
But your leaving is worse  
Oh yes, my dear  
Your leaving is worse  
  
Your going, my dear  
Your going forever  
And leaving me all alone with this grief  
  
So how, my dear  
How will I forget you  
When I see your face wherever I go  
When I close my eyes  
It's as though I see you  
Your beautiful blue eyes, your beautiful lie  
  
I sat in the window of my room,  
An' I watched you go away,  
It was all I could do,  
It was all I could do

Could your heart ever be mine  
Your arms hold me so close to you  
All through the night  
Your eyes gaze into mine  
Saying I should believe you  
I always do, I don't know why  
  
Cause you taught me a lesson the hard way one time  
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind  
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now  
Sleep on  
  
Could your heart ever be mine  
My arms hold me so close to me  
All through the night  
My heart warned me this time  
But I need to believe you  
I do, just for tonight  
  
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time  
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind  
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now  
Sleep on  
Sleep on

I know I'll be lonesome  
That brings about a little fear  
I know I'll be sad and I'll be blue  
I have given the best of me  
When I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long, so wrong  
  
I have tried and cared, baby, it was never enough  
In your mind I never had a clue  
So I'll repave the same old road I'm on  
Where I forgot to say to you  
What you forgot to say to me  
So long, so wrong  
  
Did we take forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last  
  
You have tired me with your wanting ways  
You can't buy yourself to be complete  
I have given up caring anymore  
Once you were big in a world that's small  
And now you're all alone  
  
Have we taken forever in vain  
Into the past  
Did we think forever was really gonna last

Thousand miles  
Of lonesome highway  
Drinking gallons of coffee in a little cafe  
Brought me here, and it's so good to find there's someone who's got  
The same story as mine  
  
Just look at us, we're a couple hard cases  
So how'd we end up where we are?  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
I don't know where it's callin me  
Well I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
(Alison)  
Been so long  
I can't believe I'd get somethin so sweet  
Where an ache used to be, don't fall  
If love anymore but I'd never met anyone like you before  
Stay here with me for a couple more weeks  
I think there's somethin goin' on  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
Don't know where it's callin me  
I just know it starts  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
(Shenandoah)  
Well it sure took a while to find it  
It's been waiting there all this time  
(Both)  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
I feel somethin hittin me awful hard  
(Alison)  
Don't know where it's callin me  
(Shenandoah)  
Well I just know it starts  
(Both)  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  
Somewhere in the vicinity of the heart  
  

I don't drink as much as I used to  
Lately, it just ain't my style  
And hard times don't last like they used to  
They pass quicker, like when I was a child.  
[Chorus:]  
Somehow I've learned how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
And the magic the morning is bringing home  
A song for a life I have found  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
[Solo]  
The midsummer days sit so heavy  
But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind  
When nothing appears in a hurry  
To make up for someone's lost time  
[Chorus]  
  
  

Stood out in the rain  
Let it soak me down  
For I called you, I called you  
You did not see me there  
Hidden by the dark  
Beneath your window  
But I saw you  
  
When putting on a face  
For the mirror on the wall  
Dreaming that the looking glass is you  
Catching my fondest gazes  
Livin' through my fickeled phases  
I love you  
  
Spend my dimes on phones  
Trying just to talk  
But you don't answer  
You let it ring  
Spend my nights alone  
Catching falling stars  
To give to you love  
There just for you  
  
Stars fall ev'ry time  
A lover has to face the truth  
And far to many stars have fell on me  
And as they trail the skies  
I burn there paths upon my eyes  
I cry  
  
And it's getting easier  
Each day to weep about you  
Harder ev'ry night to sleep  
Without you  
  
How many years must I be  
Driven by this dream of love  
With you

Where have you been,  
My long lost friend?  
It's good to see you again.  
Come and sit for a while  
I've missed your smile  
Today the past is goodbye.  
Time can't erase  
A lover's embrace.  
Can't you hear it calling?  
A new day dawning  
You were longing to find.  
  
Love's taken you far  
Away from my heart,  
And I've been here all alone.  
Have your eyes failed to find  
What took you from mine,  
A vision that's faded through time?  
But you sailed away,  
A fine summer's day,  
Cause you heard it calling,  
A new day dawning,  
You were longing to find.  
  
There is a way to make you stay.  
Darlin' don't turn away  
Don't doubt your heart  
and keep us apart  
I'm right where you are  
Stay  
  
There is a way to make you stay.  
Darlin' don't turn away.  
Don't doubt your heart  
and keep us apart  
I'm right where you are  
Stay

Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
It's not the first time I've found myself alone and known  
If I really had you once, then I'd have you when I'm gone  
Whistle blows, blowin' lonesome in my mind  
Calling me along that never ending metal line  
  
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Sun is shining, through the open boxcar door  
Lying in my mind with the things I've known before  
I've lost count of the hours, days, and nights  
The rhythm of the rails keeps the motion in my mind  
  
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend  
Winding through the trees, like a ribbon in the wind  
I don't mind not knowing what lies down the track  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back  
  
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back

Don't choose me because I am faithful.  
Don't choose me because I am kind.  
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  
Take me for longing or leave me behind.  
  
I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow,  
I would be, for you, an opening door.  
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom.  
Try to forget them or love me no more.  
  
I'm not asking your heart to believe me.  
I'm not asking for promise or pledge.  
Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question.  
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.  
  
Don't choose me because I am faithful.  
Don't choose me because I am kind.  
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking.  
Take me for longing or leave me behind.

When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Take me and make me your lover one more time  
Close in your arms as before  
'Til o'er your shoulder the early morning shines  
Then I'll leave you and grieve you no more  
  
When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Daises need sunshine and roses need rain  
So it was all meant to be  
A wild bird needs wings, free to take to the wind  
And so it was meant for you and me  
  
When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Teardrops will kiss the morning dew

You've made up your mind  
We don't want the same thing  
And that we won't change things  
Wishing there were ways  
And there's no use staying together  
Nothing lasts forever  
That's what you say  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who can't give up  
If you can walk away from the life we've made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
I still believe we've got something worth saving  
I keep hoping and praying for another chance  
You've held my heart and your gonna break it  
Cause you want to make it  
A part of your past  
  
And that makes one of us not in love  
And that makes one of us who can't give up  
If you can walk away from the life we've made  
Then that makes one of us  
  
Then that makes one of us

Tell you a little story and it won't take long  
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn  
The reason why I never could tell  
For that young man was always well  
He planted his corn in the month of June  
And by July it was up to his eyes  
Come September, came a big frost  
And all the young man's corn was lost  
His story, kith, had just begun  
Said, "Young man, have you hoed some corn?"  
"Well, I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain  
But I don't believe I raised no grain"  
He went down town to his neighbor's door  
Where he had often been before  
Sayin', "Pretty little miss, will you marry me?"  
Little miss what do you say?"  
"Why do you come for me to wed?  
You, can't even make your own corn grain  
Single I am and will remain  
A lazy man, I won't maintain"  
He turned his back and walked away  
Sayin', "Little miss, you'll rue the day  
You'll rue the day that you were born  
For givin' me the devil, 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn"  

I met a man  
Traveling down the road  
He looked me in the eye  
And he gave me a ring  
And he gave me a rose  
And he told me some gypsy lies  
The road is a lover, you never recover  
Not now or any time soon  
My head starts to spin  
When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh  
As the wind chases after the moon  
Through the kindness  
Shown me that day  
I gave him this melody  
And we sang in duet  
'Neath the stars in the sky  
And the shadows of dancing trees  
The road is a lover, you never recover  
Not now or any time soon  
My head starts to spin  
When I think where I've been  
Playin' twin to an old fiddle tune, oh  
As the wind chases after the moon  

Album: Tribute To Tradition  
  
There's a village hidden deep in the valley  
Among the pine trees half forlorn  
And there on a sunny morning  
Little Jimmy Brown was born.  
  
All the chapel bells were ringing  
In the little valley town  
And the songs that they were singing  
Was for baby Jimmy Brown.  
  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
Bless this hour of meditation  
Guide him with eternal love.  
  
There's a village hidden deep in the valley  
Beneath the mountains high above  
And there twenty years thereafter  
Jimmy was to meet his love.  
  
All the chapel bells were ringing  
Twas a great day in his life  
For the songs that they were singing  
Was for Jimmy and his wife.  
  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
Bless oh Lord this celebration  
May their lives be filled with love.  
  
From the village hidden deep in the valley  
One rainy morning dark and grey  
A soul which wait in the heaven  
Jimmy Brown had passed away.  
  
Just the lonely bell was ringing  
In the little valley town  
Twas there will it was singing  
To our good old Jommy Brown  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
May his soul find this salvation  
Of Thy great eternal love...

I've seen hard times and I've been told  
There isn't any wonder that I fall  
Why do we suffer, crossing off the years  
There must be a reason for it all  
  
I've trusted in You, Jesus, to save me from my sin  
Heaven is the place I call my home  
But I keep on getting caught up in this world I'm living in  
And Your voice it sometimes fades before I know  
  
Hurtin' brings my heart to You, crying with my need  
Depending on Your love to carry me  
The love that shed His blood for all the world to see  
This must be the reason for it all  
  
Hurtin' brings my heart to You, a fortress in the storm  
When what I wrap my heart around is gone  
I give my heart so easily to the ruler of this world  
When the one who loves me most will give me all  
  
In all the things that cause me pain You give me eyes to see  
I do believe but help my unbelief  
I've seen hard times and I've been told  
There is a reason for it all

Under the snow  
Beneath the frozen streams  
There is life  
  
You'll have to know  
When nature sleeps she dreams  
There is life  
  
And the colder the winter  
The warmer the spring  
The deeper the sorrow  
The more our hearts sing  
  
Even when you can't see it  
Inside everything  
There is Life...  
  
Oh....  
  
After the Rain  
The sun will reappear  
There is life  
  
After the pain  
The joy will still be here  
There is life  
  
For it's out of the darkness  
That we learn to see  
And out of the silence  
That songs come to be  
  
And all that we dream of  
Awaits patently  
There is life  
  
There is life

Well, the rain is apourin' down in a fury  
And the road is lookin' long  
And the only thing that comes to mind  
Is the tune of this sad song  
Tune of this sad song! Oh Lord!  
  
Well, the wind is acreepin' up my back  
Through the door, through the roof, through the window crack  
Tossin' and a-turnin' all night long  
To the rhythm and the sound of a saddened song  
Saddened song! Oh Lord!  
  
In a dream of passion I saw a face  
Of a beautiful woman in a terrible place  
She looked at me, and she called for you  
Then she closed her eyes and she sang this tune  
Sang this tune! Oh Lord!

Somewhere, someday we'll be close together  
Wait and see  
Oh, by the way  
This time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand  
This time the dream's on me  
  
[Chorus]  
It would be fun  
To be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I, at least  
Supply the shoulder you cry upon  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To see you through  
Till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true but  
This time the dream's on me

Believe me when I tell you  
I will try to understand  
Believe me when I tell you  
I could never kill a man  
  
But to know that another man's holding you tight  
Hurts me, little darling  
Thru the morning thru the night  
  
The bond has been broken  
The promise you gave  
The words that were spoken  
I can not be your slave  
  
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone  
Hurts me, little darling  
Through the nighttime through the dawn  
  
I dreamed just last night you were there by my side  
Your sweet loving tenderness  
Easing my pride  
  
But then I awoke and found you not there  
It was just my old memory of how much I care  
  
Believe me when I tell you  
I will try to understand  
Believe me when I tell you  
I could never kill a man  
  
But to know that another man's holding you tight  
Hurts me little, darling  
Through the morning through the night

He was just a little farm lad, so busy at play  
With his little playmate outside the gate  
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door  
At the home of his tiny playmate  
Then he saw his daddy watching too  
As the men swiftly walked to the cottage door  
He knew they were strangers that came from the town  
Men he had never seen before  
They soon went to work when he heard his daddy say  
?Our neighbors are moving today?  
?Oh no!? he cried, ?Dear God don't let it be  
They can't take my sweetheart away?  
I know dad, you don't understand  
How a heart so young could conceive a plan  
I'm only seven now but it's just like you say  
Daddy, someday I'll be a man  
The man who owns the farm where your playmates do live  
He told me it'd have to be this way  
For winter time has come and the work is all done  
That's why they are moving today  
Let us buy the farm so they can stay  
And give them all the toys that dear Santa gave  
And give them all my pennies in my little piggy bank  
Pennies that my darlin' help me save  

Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,  
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.  
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.  
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.  
  
It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on,  
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.  
I hear the death man has lost his mate,  
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.  
  
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes,  
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize.  
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through,  
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you.  
  
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,  
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.  
You won't get more than you're living for,  
And it's too late to cry tonight.

Two highways lay before me, which one will I choose  
Down one lane I'd find happiness and down the other I would lose  
There is no one that I can trust, I must decide alone  
My decision is an awful one, which road will take me home  
  
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone  
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long  
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice  
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice  
  
Perils, there are many, as I set out on my way  
If I lose your love I know that I can call it back someday  
Rambler, lonely rambler, just 'cause anyplace is home  
Nashville, lights how you have always shined  
  
Wishing now that you had found a word or two to say  
But the mornin' came and we both knew my eyes gave it away  
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye I thought only time will tell  
And you can't draw water from an empty well  
  
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone  
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long  
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice  
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice

I got shoes, you got shoes  
All of God's children got shoes my Lord  
And when we get to Heaven, gonna put on our shoes  
We're gonna walk, we're gonna talk  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven  
I got a robe, you got a robe  
All of God's children got a robe my Lord  
And when we get to Heaven, gonna put on our robes  
We're gonna shout, we're gonna shout  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven  
Heaven, Heaven, everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven  
Ain't goin' there Heaven, Heaven  
Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven, ain't goin' there  
Well, I'm gonna walk, I gonna talk  
All over God's Heaven, Heaven  

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart  
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark  
Try as I may, I could never explain  
What I hear when you don't say a thing  
  
[Chorus]  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me  
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me  
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall  
You say it best when you say nothing at all  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud  
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd  
Old Mr. Webster could never define  
What's being said between your heart and mine  
  
[Chorus x 2]

She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette  
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget  
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time  
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind  
Until the night  
  
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger  
And finally drank away her memory  
Life is short, but this time it was bigger  
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees  
We found him with his face down in the pillow  
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'  
And when we buried him beneath the willow  
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby  
  
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself  
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath  
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time  
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind  
Until the night  
  
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger  
And finally drank away his memory  
Life is short, but this time it was bigger  
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees  
We found her with her face down in the pillow  
Clinging to his picture for dear life  
We laid her next to him beneath the willow  
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Oh it seems the sun will never shine  
The skies are so gray and the heart you left broken is lonely  
The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing  
I long for the days you loved me only  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new  
Young hearts so tender in their yearning  
But seasons, change and lovers too  
And winter's twice as cold  
But the fire in one heart is always burning  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain  
And what was love is just a spell that's broken  
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do  
Seems our hearts have never really spoken  
  
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart

Walking out on me must be the way you show me how it feels to be her  
I realize the fault is mine, I'm getting everything that I deserve  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you  
My troubles would be all over now if I could only get you off my mind  
And I would give a fortune now if I could only hold you one more time  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you  
  

Take me back to Anona street  
Fill my glass again  
With a bittersweet  
Cause I don't wanna see  
The life I have  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldn't be so bad  
  
Same mistake that I made before  
I'll be waking up  
On the kinlin' floor  
While the bells are ringing  
So low and sad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldn't be so bad  
  
Same mistake that I made before  
I'll be waking up  
On the kinlin' floor  
I remember how  
I made you mad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldn't be so bad  
  
I Thought the next time around  
Wouldn't be so bad  
Thought the next time around  
Wouldn't be so bad

Ain't gonna marry in the fall  
Ain't gonna marry in the spring  
For you're in love  
With a pretty little girl  
Who wears a diamond ring  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just a country boy  
Money - have you none?  
But you've got silver  
In the stars  
Gold in the morning sun  
Gold in the morning sun  
  
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips  
Of the prettiest girl in town  
Never gonna ask her if she'll marry you  
She'd only turn you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never could afford a store-bought ring  
With a sparklin' diamond stone  
All you could afford is a loving heart  
The only one you own  
  
[Chorus]
