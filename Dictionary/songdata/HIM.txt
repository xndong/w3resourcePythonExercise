Covered the carcass of time with flowers  
To send the scent of blame to the grave  
Set the darkest thoughts on fire  
And watched the ashes climb to Heaven's gates  
  
We hide behind the crimson door  
While the summer is killed by the fall  
Alive Behind the crimson door  
While the winter sings: "Your love will be the death of me"  
"Your love will be the death of me"  
  
Death served wine for lovers  
Brought from the world where devils reign  
And intoxicated angels with sorrow  
They witnessed in the eyes of their slaves  
  
We hide behind the crimson door  
While the summer is killed by the fall  
Alive Behind the crimson door  
While the winter sings: "Your love will be the death of me"  
"Your love will be the death of me"

I see your scars  
I know where they're from  
So sensually carved and bleeding  
Until you're dead and gone  
I've seen it all before  
Beauty and splendor torn  
It's when heaven turns to black  
And hell to white  
Right so wrong and wrong so right  
  
Feel it turning your heart into stone  
Feel it piercing your courageous soul  
You're beyond now- redemption  
And no one's going to catch you when you fall  
  
I see you crawl  
You can barely walk  
And arms wide open  
You keep on begging for more  
I've been there before  
Knocking on the same door  
It's when hate turns to love  
And love to hate  
Faith to doubt and doubt to faith

You had demons to kill within you screaming  
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes  
  
Love preys the living and praises the dead  
In the heart of our hearts by death we were wed  
  
Bleed well the soul you're about to sell for passion deranged  
Kiss and tell, baby we're bleeding well  
Bleed well the heart you're about to fail for reasons insane  
Kill and tell, baby we're bleeding well'  
'In hell  
  
'No love lost under her will', I heard you weeping  
And on those words a church was built to keep the pain in  
  
If death is the answer to love's mysteries  
Then bleed on my darling to the sound of a dream

Essential Salts of animals may  
Be so prepared and preserved  
That an ingenious man  
May have the whole Ark of Noah in his own  
Study and raise the fine shape of an animal  
Out of it's ashes at his pleasure  
  
Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood  
Bring only fear and sadness  
Old years of play  
Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours  
In vast and dismal chambers  
With brown hangings  
And maddening rows of antique books  
  
Watch them in twilight groves  
Oh in twilight groves  
Oh in twilight groves  
  
By method from the essential salts of humane dust  
A philosopher may call up the shape of any dead ancestor  
From the dust where into his body has been  
Incinerated incinerated incinerated  
  
You're under pressure baby  
Christ has returned he's returning

Christ has returned he's returning

In every new born child

Again the burden of losing rest  
Upon my shoulders  
And its weight seems unbearable  
Your tomb is where your heart is,  
I should have told her  
But within Me a secret so terrible  
  
To cry is to know that you're alive  
But my river of tears has run dry  
I never wanted to fool you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
The kiss of vanity you blessed me with a spiritual murder  
Fed the gods of war  
Your home is there in the darkness, I should have told her  
Embrace the fire indestructible  
  
To die is to know that you're alive  
And my river of blood won't run dry  
I never wanted to lose you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Bring no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
Oh, it seems to cry is to know that you're alive  
And my river of tears has run dry  
I never wanted to fool you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And a desert soul is gone  
A cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile,  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
Buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love

Let me wake up in your arms, you say it's not alright  
Let me be so dead and gone, so far away from life  
Close my eyes, hold me tight  
And bury me deep inside your heart  
  
All I ever wanted was you my love  
You're all I ever wanted  
You, my love  
  
Let me never see the sun, never see you smile  
Let us be so dead and so gone  
So far away from life  
Just close my eyes, hold me tight  
And bury me deep inside your heart

Heartache is knocking on her door  
Shadows dance outside her window  
Tears keep falling on the floor  
As the world around her crumbles  
  
If you want to save her  
First you have to save yourself  
If you want to free her from the hurt  
Don't do it with your pain  
If you want to see her smile again  
Don't show her you're afraid  
Because your circle of fear is the same  
  
Love can be as cold as grave  
A one-way ticket to endless sorrow  
An empire of gentle hate  
Today without tomorrow  
  
It's the circle of regret  
The circle of hate  
The circle of death  
Your circle of fear is the same

I know how it feels to be on your own  
In this cruel world where hearts are bound to turn to stone  
Where you are alone and tired of breathing  
It's all going wrong and you just can't stand the pain anymore  
You're too numb to believe in anything  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
  
I know how easy it is to let go  
Surrender to despair lurking at your door  
To lose your soul and all your feelings  
Strength all gone  
And so many things left unsaid and deeds undone  
You've stopped caring  
Cause it's all in vain  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
  
You're so alone and tired of breathing  
It's all gone wrong and you just can't stand the pain  
  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Baby just don't close your heart  
Darling don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down  
Just don't let me down

All our times have come  
Here but now they're gone  
Seasons don't fear the reaper  
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain  
We can be like they are  
  
Come on baby, don't fear the reaper  
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper  
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper  
Baby I'm your man  
  
Valentine is done  
Here but now they're gone  
Romeo and Juliet  
Are together in eternity  
Romeo and Juliet  
  
Forty thousand men and women everyday, like romeo and Juliet  
Forty thousand men and women everyday, redefine happiness  
Another forty thousand coming everyday, we can be like  
They are  
  
Come on baby, don't fear the reaper  
Baby take my hand, don't fear the reaper  
We'll be able to fly, don't fear the reaper  
Baby I'm your man, love of two is one  
Here but now they're gone  
Came the last night of sadness  
And it was clear we couldn't go on  
Then the door was opened and the wind appeared  
The candles blew then disappeared  
The curtains flew then he appeared  
Saying don't be afraid  
  
Come on baby,and we had no fear  
And we ran to him, and we started to fly  
We looked backward and said goodbye  
We had become like they are  
We had taken his hand  
We had become like they are  
  
Come on baby, don't fear the reaper

Hiding underneath  
The veil of broken dreams  
We find her weeping  
  
On her once white wings  
She will be carrying the weight of our deeds  
And she bleeds for love  
Forever gone  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
Finding souls to feed  
The night side of Eden  
We see the struggling  
For her love's  
Last breath and walk off  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
She's blinded by the fear  
Of life and death and everything in between  
We smile when she cries a river of tears  
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
So alive  
(Drunk on shadows)  
So alive

I've seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts,  
And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem,  
Echoing across the ocean reminding me why I still try  
To hold onto whatever is left of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more,  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life.  
  
I've seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought,  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs,  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light,  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song,  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrow's trembling at the sight of you and I.  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun 'til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song,  
Sound a lot like life and love,  
Life and love,  
Life and love (dying song)  
Life and love (a dying song)  
With you (a dying song)  
With you (dying song)  
With you (dying song)  
With you (a dying song)

Words like violence  
Break the silence  
Come crashing in  
Into my little world  
Painful to me  
Pierce right through me  
Can't you understand  
Oh my little girl  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm  
  
Vows are spoken  
To be broken  
Feelings are intense  
Words are trivial  
Pleasure remain  
So does the pain  
Words are meaningless  
And forgettable  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm

I'm drained but aching for more  
And the devil inside is reading  
The words of the saddest poem  
To be engraved on the stone of my grave  
  
I'd kill to share your pain  
(And carry the shame)  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
Nothing will be enough  
For the ones Who keep on stumbling  
In the garden of withering trust  
Without the courage to leave  
  
Oh I'd take my life for your kiss  
(Grant me my wish)  
And lose it all to take you across the abyss  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what I'm Dreaming  
And See what I'm seeing  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the Face of God  
  
Labyrinth in a shape of a heart  
Love's secret architecture  
I find myself to be lost in the  
Arms of your fate  
  
I'd kill to share you pain  
(Please let me stay)  
And sell my soul for you just to say  
Love's name in vein  
Again and again  
  
I dream what you're dreaming  
And feel what you're feeling  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
  
You dream what I'm Dreaming  
And See what I'm seeing  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of god  
Love's our shadow on the wall  
With the face of  
(Face of)  
The face of  
(Face of)  
God  
  
(Face of)  
God

Hand of Doom  
  
What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you  
Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return  
Take your written rules, you join the other fools  
Turn to something new, now it's killing you  
  
First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm  
Disillusioning, you push the needle in  
From life you escape, reality's that way  
Colours in your mind satisfy your time  
  
Oh you, you know you must be blind  
To do something like this  
To take the sleep that you don't know  
You're giving Death a kiss,  
Oh, little fool now  
  
Your mind is full of pleasure  
Your body's looking ill  
To you it's shallow leisure  
So drop the acid pill, don't stop to think now  
  
You're having a good time baby  
But that won't last  
Your mind's all full of things  
You're living too fast  
Go out enjoy yourself  
Don't bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To stick the needle in, yeah  
  
Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality  
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave  
It's too late to turn, you don't want to learn  
Price of life you cry, now you're gonna die!

Farewell heartless world,  
I'll send you a postcard burnt in flames  
You've tried so hard to extinguish with the fear of failing,  
I'll write down everything I have learned,  
And edit it down to a single word "Love"  
For you I'm waiting, anticipating  
  
[Chorus]  
Sparks will fly beneath the Luna alight,  
Lazarus at Frankenstein's,  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
A little we die above the lesser light,  
For you I'm open wide,  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
  
Heartkiller  
  
Top hats off to the return,  
Of the beat to lick a wound  
Too cursed for some and blessed for a few,  
It doesn't have to make any sense at all,  
Come hither and we'll fall in love  
For love I'm crawling out of patience, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Paint all your sorrows for me to sing hearkiller  
Draw your pain and hear me hum it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heartkiller  
Heartkiller  
  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller  
Babe I'll be a flatliner for a heartkiller

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
  
I keep looking for something  
I can't get broken hearts lie all around me  
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this  
Her diary it sits on the bedside table  
The curtains are closed  
The cats in the cradle who would've thought  
That a boy like me could come to this  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must've been something you said  
I just died in your arms tonight  
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight  
  
It must've been some kind of kiss I should've walked away  
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?  
On the surface I'm a name on a list I try to be discreet  
But then blow it again  
I've lost and found  
It's my final mistake she's loving by proxy  
No give and all take 'cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times.  
  
Oh I, I just died in your arms...  
It was a long hot night she made it easy  
She made it feel right  
But now it's over the moment has gone  
I followed my hands not my head  
I know I was wrong  
Oh I, I just died in your arms...

Caught under the starry night  
Breathing in everything but air  
See as the fire light  
Dies in your eyes  
Oh you're leaving  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And I'm pleading  
Don't you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that you've got  
And I will be so free  
  
Hear the cries of the stormy skies  
Letting go of all that she has held in  
Waiting for that shadow to smile  
And realize you're not winning me  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And I'm pleading  
Don't you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that you've got  
We will be so free  
  
Love screaming  
I will be the end of you  
And I'm pleading  
Don't you stop now  
Go on and tear me apart  
Show me all that you've got  
We will be so free  
Free from all that has been  
So free from all that we've seen  
So free

She got a nasty reputation and a talent for sin

She's the kinda women makes me wanna misbehave  
So give it what you want boy

So get on your knees boy and do what you should  
If ya wanna be bad ya gotta be good  
  
Let's make a night to remember  
From January to December  
Let's make love to excite us  
A memory to ignite us  
Let's make honey baby soft and tender  
Let's make sugar darlin' sweet surrender  
Let's make a night to remember all life long

Oh girl we are the same  
We are young and lost and so afraid  
There's no cure for the pain  
No shelter from the rain  
All our prayers seem to fail  
  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
Oh girl we are the same  
We are strong and blessed and so brave  
With souls to be saved  
And faith regained  
All our tears wiped away  
  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my home's in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
And my home's in your arms  
And it is breaking my heart  
My home's in your arms  
And it is breaking my heart

In love and lonely  
Just to see you cry  
In love and lonely  
  
I'm not with you my baby  
  
I'm in love with you  
Not the tears in your eyes  
I can't remember  
The last time you smiled  
Oh I know how it feels  
I know what it's like  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
Don't what to do my baby  
  
It's not alright  
This can't be the end  
  
The time to say good bye  
No I won't walk away that easy  
After all this time  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what it's like  
  
In love and lonely  
To be  
In love and lonely  
  
Oh you know how it feels  
You know what it's like  
You know how it is  
But you just can't stop crying  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
  
In love and lonely  
In love and lonely

Once again we found ourselves to be lost  
Holding hands while straying from the path in the forest dark  
Aren't you happy to see me crawl serpentine towards the sun to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Lift the lid of your heart's casket in the arms of rain  
We'll drift along this river of sadness 'til we feel no pain  
Baby it's the hail Marys for the secrets you've kept from me  
Hail Marys for tomorrow's dream  
In the arms of rain we are free  
  
Again, I fought myself and lost  
Come bite the apple and I'll coil around your heart  
I'm so happy to see you weep along  
In these arms you belong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ave Maria we've tried  
Ave Maria we've cried  
Ave Maria we've died  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's the end of a road, hold me  
It's the end of a road and we're free

Let's fall apart together now  
Zipping cupid in a body bag well-worn  
Next to the mausoleum he was born in  
Picking up the pieces of this gory glory of it all  
From eve to morn, for eve to mourn  
  
[Chorus]  
Have no fear  
There are wounds that are not meant to heal  
And they sing in venere veritas  
Come inside let the fire burn you alive  
And sing baby sing  
There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all  
In venere veritas  
  
Let's fall apart together now.  
  
There is a method to our sadness  
As we drag the mirror ball and chain  
Through the twilight again dressed up in shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We are begging for a reflection  
From an unshuttered heart  
To blind and chase us over the edge  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the wounds that are not meant to heal at all  
  
Let's fall apart together now  
Let's fall apart together now

I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
Open your arms and let me show  
you what love can be like  
It's all tears and it will be  
'til the end of your time  
Come closer my love  
Will you let me tear your hearth apart?  
Now all holp is gone so drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
So my love your laughter is finally  
turning into tears  
And you're begging for more though  
the end is getting near  
come closer my love  
I'll violate you in the most sensual way...  
until you drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love

There was a time when I  
Could breath my life into you  
One by one your pale fingers  
Started to move  
And I touched your face  
And all death was erased  
And you smiled like an angel  
Fallen from heaven, oh -  
Just to be lifted up again, ohh  
  
And you kissed my lips  
With those once cold fingertips  
You brought me back to life  
And all things come to an end  
We don't have to pretend  
Slowly we fall asleep  
And never wake up again, oh oh ohh  
  
We're so Christ like  
So lifelike  
Vampire Christ  
  
We're so lifelike  
So Christlike  
Vampire Christ  
  
In the grace  
Of our love  
We writhe in pain  
And death is not far away  
And soon we'll sleep  
And never wake up again  
  
Shhh...  
  
There was a time when I  
Could breathe my life  
Into you  
And all things come to an end, oh  
We all have to pretend  
Slowly we fall asleep  
  
And we're Christlike  
So lifelike  
A Vampire Christ  
  
We're so lifelike  
So Christlike  
A Vampire Christ

Come on and break me a limb at a time  
Wrap me around your spokes so tight  
There is no letting go  
Spin me around to blur the line between you and I  
What are you waiting for?  
  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel  
  
Holding hands won't be enough  
In a world giving head to a god  
Love in theory and practice chapter one  
  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel  
  
I twist and turn in your arms swirl  
The dizzier I get the clearer I see with you  
I'm at peace with the world within  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Lo and behold baby  
These are the things you make me do  
Katherine wheel I'm burning for you  
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams  
Katherine wheel  
Katherine wheel

Memories sharp as daggers  
Pierce into the flesh of today  
The suicide of love took away all that matters  
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Nailed to the cross together  
As solitude begs us to stay  
Disappear with a lie forever  
And denounce the power of death over our souls and secret brings us in to
start a war  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me  
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
I'm killing loneliness  
  
Killing loneliness  
I'm killing loneliness  
With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me

I'm losin' power and I don't know why?  
Not really sure if I'll live or die  
I wanna leave but I can't get away  
It's a strange sensation  
Out of control bein' by myself  
I feel this gravitation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm bein' pulled (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
This place is spinnin', spinnin' around (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole  
This crazy feelin's screwin' with my head  
I'm overloadin' and my gauges are red  
State of confusion's got a hold on me  
I feel a hesitation  
I'm bein' drugged, fallen out of the track  
Don't like the situation  
Caught like a magnet and I'm bein' pulled (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
My head is spinnin', spinnin' around 'round (Into the void)  
This force is gettin', gettin' stronger (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole (Into the void)  
I'm bein' pulled, bein' pulled down down  
Down down  
I wanna really get away (Into the void)  
Don't like this feelin', I'm bein' pulled down (Into the void)  
I wanna get away, get away (Into the void)  
Feel like it's spinnin', spinnin' around (Into the void)  
I'm being pulled, bein' pulled down down  
Down down (Into the void)  
Get away, get away (Into the void)  
Fell like I'm bein' pulled into a black hole (Into the void)

In the name of love lost  
I'm frozen to her and I want you  
To come build me a bridge soaked  
In gasoline and pass the torch  
  
Hey baby let me be your Valentine  
Saint Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep a lie alive  
Like Saint Valentine  
  
Like the couple from Pompeii  
Our drama is put on display  
Along with a dove stuffed in a coffin of glass  
Entitled "Love lust and the holy ghost"  
  
Those were the days  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
Like St. Valentine  
  
Love is the only war worth dying for  
Lift me up to knock me down I'm all yours for now  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
Like St. Valentine  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Like St. Valentine

Don't run away  
I can't live without you  
Please stay  
And I'll learn to love you right  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I'm not going to  
Lose you tonight  
  
Don't run away  
I never wanted to hurt you  
Please stay  
And I learn to treat you right  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life

Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I'm not going to  
Lose you tonight  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I ain't gonna  
Lose you tonight  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life  
And I ain't gonna

And I've been crying for you  
Dying for you all this time  
  
I was waiting for you  
Waiting for all my life

Serpentine love's thighs wrap around me in search for death  
Drenched in blood the adored and beloved will give in to'  
  
Love in cold blood  
Breathe me in sweet suffering  
Love in cold blood  
Put me out of my misery  
  
Love's feline eyes in darkness shine on her web  
Demonized with divine insight we draw our last breath  
  
Darling take me home  
To the castle made of skulls and bones  
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong  
In your arms, my love, in cold blood

As the light across the room flickers  
It's dying song waited for a reason to keep going on  
The sweetest smile is now turned bitter by these thoughts  
So I wonder the dark of my own, I should've known all along  
  
The love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Goes to the side in here a boy who can't let go  
Won't take no for an answer  
Crying his for, I should've known all along  
  
Love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Go on and prove me wrong  
  
I should've known all along  
That love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Go on and prove me wrong  
  
Love without tears, love without tears  
Please let me be someone

On my heart I'll bear the shame  
No prayer can ease the pain  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you, love you like I do  
  
And there's no escape  
Just countless mistakes  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you, love you like I do  
  
It will never be the same  
Witness trust fade away  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love you the way I do  
No one will love you , love you like I do  
  
No one will love you  
No one will love the way I do  
No one will love , love you like I do  
  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do  
Love you like I do

Confusion writhes around our hearts impatiently  
It drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free  
From the chains of our war and the pain we once called love  
The poison of doubt enslaves our minds and we bleed  
We abandon the trust that kept us blind and disappear  
Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe  
Until they love again  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
We pray to the serpent of delight desperately  
The questions are answered and we try not to weep  
Until we are sure we're suffering for love  
In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak  
The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep  
We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  
  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
The salvation we seek will be waiting us there  
In the heart of darkness lonely and scared  
With a promise of death for our love  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love  
I'm lost  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song  
Hold me until we're one and sing me your beautiful song  
The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there  
And that hope will be our love's requiem  
Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song  
Hold me until we're one and sing me your beautiful song...

Is it so hard to believe our hearts  
Are made to be broken by love  
That in constant dying lies  
The beauty of it all  
My darling won't you feel  
The sweet heaven in  
Our endless cry  
  
Oh at least you could try  
For this one last time  
  
Ever amazed how bright are the flames  
We are burning in  
Ever smiled at the tragedies  
We hold inside  
My darling won't you cherish  
The fear of life that keeps  
You and me so alive  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
For this one last time  
It could be alright  
For this one last time  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
(and we just will be closer)  
For this one last time  
(let me fall into your arms)  
It could be alright  
(don't let us grow colder)  
For this one last time  
(let me close to your heart)  
  
Oh at least you could trust  
(and before it's over)  
For this one last time  
(and let me fall into your arms)  
It could be alright  
(before it's all over)  
For this one last time  
(let me close to your heart)

In the biblical sense and sensibility  
Let me know you  
I'll kiss that smile off your face just say when  
  
Just say when.  
  
I'm not afraid to say "I love you"  
Any more than I used to be babe I am scared to death  
To fall in love (with you)  
  
All these pick-up lines from hell  
Icebreakers infernal  
From a heart so black and blue  
Only for you  
  
Just say when again.  
  
I'm not afraid to say, "I love you."  
Any more than I used to be, babe.  
I am scared to death.  
I am scared to death to fall in love with you.  
  
With you.  
  
I'm not afraid to say, "I love you."  
Anymore than I used to be, babe.  
I am scared to death.  
I am scared to death to fall in love.  
  
I'm not afraid to admit I adore you  
Any more than I was before babe I am scared to death  
To fall in love with you  
  
With you.  
With you.  
  
I'm scared to death.  
I'm scared to death.  
I'm scared to death.  
  
And you're sweet like poison.

The girl who cried "Love, won't you come and play with me?"  
You can be Cassandra, underneath the sword of Damocles  
We'll tear this baby apart wise like Salomon  
  
[Chorus]  
Run, come shatter me now, shatter me with hope  
Crawl, come breathe me in, bleed out all sorrows  
Scream me a dream, untouched by shadows  
Baby, shatter me now, shatter me now  
Shatter me with hope  
  
She'll be the witness to the repose of Evelyn  
Push the needles into the of canticles of ecstasy  
Turn to page forty three  
And you'll know how I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Swear on your heart's grave I'm wrong  
And run like your life's depending on it  
'Cause it is!  
  
We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon  
Turn to page forty three, and you'll know how I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shatter me now, shatter me now, shatter me now  
Oh, you oh  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now  
Oh, you oh  
Scream me a dream  
Shatter me now shatter me now shatter me now  
Scream me a dream  
(Shatter me now, shatter me now, shatter me now)

Melinda was mine  
'Til the time  
That I found her  
Holding Jim  
Loving him  
  
Then Sue came along  
Loved me strong  
That's what I thought  
Me and Sue  
But that died too  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
A girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  
  
I've had it to here  
Bein' where  
Love's a small world  
Part-time thing  
Paper ring  
  
I know it's been done  
Having' one  
Girl who'll love me  
Right or wrong  
Weak or strong  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
The girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  

There are things you should know,  
  
And the distance between us seems to grow.  
  
But you're holding on stronger,  
  
And oh how hard it is to let go.  
  
Oh so hard to let go.  
  
I'm waiting for your call,  
  
And I'm waiting to take your 666 in my heart.  
  
And I'm longing for your touch,  
  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart (oh my love)  
  
I'm losing my faith in you,  
  
But you don't want it to be true  
  
But there's nothing you can do,  
  
And there is nothing you can do, yes I've lost my faith in you.  
  
Waiting for your call and I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart.  
  
And I'm longing for your touch, and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,
right here in this heart.  
Ooh right here is this heart, ow, my love.  
  
"And I know it's too late,  
Oh my god it's a long way! "  
  
I'm waiting for your call, and I'm ready to take your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
I'm longing for yout touch and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
I'm ready for the fall and I'm ready to take your sweet 666 in my heart,  
  
Longing for your touch and I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart,  
Right here in this heart,  
  
Right straight through my heart,  
  
Right here in my heart.

Today tomorrow seems so far away and the wait in vain  
So safe in the blinding light of love unchained in yesterday's grave  
  
The truth that could set souls free  
Is buried within sweet pandemonium  
Concealed by disbelief  
The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  
  
Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream  
Ashamed of the shattered remains of promises made  
  
Drained by the anger and grief  
Fazed by the envy and greed  
The secret cries for a release  
The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium

Your world is coming to it's end  
But you don't have to be afraid, I'm here for you  
Save your happiness for tomorrow  
And today we'll drown in your tears  
A drop of your blood tastes like wine today  
  
Come closer my dear  
It is just the beginning of the end  
Yes, I'm here for you  
Save your happiness for tomorrow  
And today we'll drown in your tears  
A drop of your blood tastes like wine today  
  
And because I love you so  
And I'm here for you  
Save your happiness for tomorrow  
And today we'll drown in your tears  
A drop of your blood tastes like wine today  
Save your happiness for tomorrow  
And today we'll drown in your tears  
Your blood tastes like life today  
  
Will you let it rain  
Let it rain  
So won't you let it rain  
Oh, let it rain  
Won't you let it rain

For years I've seen you fighting  
Against your heart  
Living like you're dying  
So far from the sun  
  
Waiting for a guardian angel  
To lead you through the dangers  
That lie ahead on your way  
Towards tomorrows arms  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
  
We all have our fears but yours are  
The scariest of them all  
Lift your head and let us taste  
The horror you adore  
  
And it all starts to makes sense  
All the blood wisely shed  
Just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you're locked in  
  
Tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days  
You're hiding yourself away  
From our cruel world's embrace  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage  
And as your days turn to weeks  
You'll cry yourself to sleep  
In the cage you've locked yourself in

love's the funeral of hearts  
an ode for cruelty  
when angels cry blood  
on flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you  
  
She was the sun  
Shining upon  
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail  
He was the moon  
Painting you  
With it's glow so vulnerable and pale  
  
Love's the funeral of hearts  
And an ode for cruelty  
When angels cry blood  
On flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you  
  
She was the wind, carrying in  
All the troubles and fears you've for years tried to forget  
He was the fire, restless and wild  
And you were like a moth to that flame  
  
The heretic seal beyond divine  
A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind  
The last rites for souls on fire  
Three little words and a question, why?  
  
Love's the funeral of hearts  
And an ode for cruelty  
When angels cry blood  
On flowers of evil in bloom  
  
The funeral of hearts  
And a plea for mercy  
When love is a gun  
Separating me from you

Your pain ain't love  
Can't you see he's the heartless  
Your pain is not love  
He's taking it too far  
Don't you know it is wrong  
  
You're the one for me lady  
You're the one  
If you'd only see in my heart  
You'd know know all is not lost  
  
Your time is running out  
And you still haven't made up your mind  
Can't you see he's the heartless  
And you're one of a kind  
  
He's the heartless  
You can't you see he's the heartless  
Your pain won't ever be love  
It doesn't matter how hard you try  
To you all is lost  
  
He's the heartless

Blinded I am  
And so are you  
By shedding tears  
Confusion that separates us two  
We hold dear  
  
Just look into my eyes  
Kiss our fears goodbye  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain that you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm tired of the games  
I'm playing with you  
When you're not here  
Death frees from the fear of dying  
It's true, have no fear  
  
Let me look into your eyes  
And see death pass us by  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn  
Touching the pain you left me with  
At the kiss of dawn  
  
I'm reaching for your shadow  
Drowning in the kiss of dawn

There is no turning back  
From this unending path of mine  
Serpentine and black  
It stands before my eyes  
To hell and back  
It will lead me once more  
It's all I have as I stumble in  
Out of grace  
  
I walk through the gardens  
Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time would've passed us by  
  
With every step I take  
The less I know myself  
And every vow I break on my way towards your heart  
Countless times I've prayed  
For forgiveness  
But Gods just laughed at my face  
And this path remains  
Leading me into solitude arms  
  
I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But I'll carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn  
  
Amidst all the tears there's a smile  
That all angels will greet with an envious song  
One look into strangers eyes  
And I know where I belong  
  
I walk through the gardens  
Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time would've passed us by  
  
Oh I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But I'll carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn

I hear you breathe so far from here  
I feel your touch so close and real  
  
And I know my church is not of silver and gold  
Its glory lies beyond judgment of souls  
The commandments are of consolation and warmth  
  
You know our sacred dream won't fail  
The sanctuary tender and so frail  
The sacrament of love  
The sacrament of warmth is true  
The sacrament is you  
  
I hear you weep so far from here  
I taste your tears like you're next to me  
  
And I know my weak prayers are not enough to heal  
The ancient wounds so deep and so dear  
The revelation is of hatred and fear

We're still breathin'  
This can't be love.  
Baby we're tryin'  
Shed a few tears more.  
And we keep on waiting,  
Just to get caught.  
And we know this is exactly what we want.  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
(x2)  
  
Now we feel it comin',  
Peircing our hearts.  
Fingers crossed and we're praying,  
Nothing goes wrong.  
And it's finally happenin',  
Just a knock on our door.  
Our hearts are beatin',  
Oh it's just begun.  
  
Chorus(x2)  
  
  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
We fear for the best and hope for the worst,  
Too happy to be alive.  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
Oh we fear for the best  
Too happy to be alive  
When love lies blessed and love lies cursed  
Too happy to be alive.  
Too happy, too happy, we're too happy to be alive.  
Too happy. too happy. we're too happy to be alive.  
Too happy. too happy. CAUSE we're too happy to be alive. oh my love  
So...

Come feed the beast within  
My teeth cut through this grin  
That the razors that can shred your heart apart  
Feel my dark sound begin to wash away the sin  
That made these bloodshot eyes start to spark  
  
You tore the skin of day till light went dark  
  
Now I've seen the side of my soul  
Now I've found what I was searching for  
Now I'll take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting,
holes  
  
Let night pour through your veins  
As my voice leaves these stains  
Like the tears that never got to drop  
Let me devour your pain  
Till hurts to touch like crane  
And the words become a roof to shelter us  
  
My words become a roof to shelter us  
Now I've seen the side of my soul  
Now I've found what I was searching for  
Now I'll take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting,
holes  
  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
  
Ooh, cruelty is our song  
Ooh, sins are sins to wash off  
  
Now I've seen the side of my soul  
Now I've found what I was searching for  
Now I'll take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting,
holes  
  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I, I instill in me  
This world's pressuring  
I, I, I can breathe  
All the insanity

You can't escape the wrath of my heart  
Beating to your funeral song  
All faith is lost and hell, regained  
In the dust of the wrath of shame, just be brave  
  
Let me wake in the sun of my heart  
We move along this path in the dark  
Where I belong until my feet grow cold  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me like you held onto life  
When all fears came alive and entombed me  
Love me like you love the sun  
Scorching the blood in my vampire heart  
  
I'll be the thorn in every rose you give  
Sin my woe, I am the nightmare waking you up  
From the dream, the dream of love  
  
And paint you my soul, scarred and alone  
I wait for your kiss to take me home  
  
[Chorus]

Leave all behind now to watch her crawl  
Through our dark gardens of insanity  
She'll be the light to guide you back home  
Just give her a kiss worth dying for  
And open your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All dreams are of you  
My Venus doom  
  
Grieve all your hearts out and she'll writhe enthralled  
In tragic ecstatic agony  
And in her flames we will die some more  
Just show me her life worth living for  
And light up the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me inside your infernal offering  
Touch me as I fall  
Don't lose yourself in this suffering yet  
Hold on  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
  
Watch me fall for you  
My Venus doom  
Hide my heart where all dreams are entombed  
My Venus doom  
All tears are of you  
My Venus doom

Her Heaven's a lie to those who threw away the key  
Her God is alive and well when the higher believes  
And you can't bend the river of her dreams  
Or understand the divine words she speaks  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
Her savior was never on a cross pierced with nails  
Thirty pieces of silver never retraced her mistake  
She'll always be free from the arms of your sins  
That made you weak as your world started crumblin'  
  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
Venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
  
(She's in our blood)  
Venus denies your severing tides above dark waters  
You can quench her thirst with the fear hiding away from the day  
The venus denies you in your dark waters  
The moon kissed the sun and now we hold her in our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
In our blood  
(She's in our blood)

The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
It's strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you  
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you  
  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
And I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
  
What a wicked game to play  
To make me feel this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To let me dream of you  
What a wicked thing to say  
You never felt this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To make me dream of you  
  
And I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
  
The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
It's strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
No I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you  
And I never dreamed  
That I'd lose somebody like you  
  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
  
No I (this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
Nobody loves no one

No I won't surrender  
At any cost  
You're something so sweet and tender  
From my heart  
  
Yes I've done my evil  
I've done my good  
Just believe me honey  
I won't let go off you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
We've had our share of misfortune  
We've had our blues  
And God is not on our side  
Yes it's true  
We keep forgetting baby  
The others too  
There is no one who can take that away  
From me and you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
.

There are things you should know  
The distance between us seems to grow  
But you're holding on strong  
Oh how hard is it to let go  
Oh so hard to let go  
  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
I'm losing my faith in you  
You don't want it to be true  
But there's nothing you can do  
There's nothing you can do  
Yes I lost my faith in you  
  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
How long we have to wait  
For love is fading so slowly  
I know it's too late  
Oh my God you're so lonely  
  
(2x)  
I'm waiting for your call  
And I'm ready to take your 666 in my heart  
I'm longing for your touch  
And I welcome your sweet 666 in my heart  
  
In my heart  
In my heart  
In my heart
