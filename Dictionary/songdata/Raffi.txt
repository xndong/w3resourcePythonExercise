There's a little white duck sitting in the water  
Little white duck doing what he oughta  
He took a bite of a lily pad  
Flapped his wings and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little white duck sitting in the water  
Quack, quack, quack  
  
There's a little green frog swimming in the water  
Little green frog doing what he oughta  
He jumped right off of the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little green frog swimming in the water  
Gulp, gulp, gulp  
  
There's a little black bug floating on the water  
A little black bug doing what he oughta  
He tickled the frog on the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little black bug floating on the water  
Quick, quick, quick  
  
There's a little red snake lying in the water  
A little red snake doing what he oughta  
He frightened the duck and the frog so bad  
And he ate the little bug and he said, "I'm glad"  
That I'm a little red snake lying in the water  
Sss, sss, sss  
  
And now there's nobody left left sitting in the water  
Nobody left doing what he oughta  
Nothing left but the lily pad  
The duck and the frog ran away  
There's nobody left sitting in the water  
Boo, hoo, hoo  
  
Because of the snake that ate the bug  
That tickled the frog, that went kerchug  
There's nobody left to sing about alas and alak  
Not even the little white duck  
Quack, quack, quack, quack

I'd like to be under the sea  
In an octopus's garden in the shade  
He'd let us in, knows where we've been  
In his octopus's garden in the shade  
  
I'd ask my friends to come and see  
An octopus's garden with me  
  
I'd like to be under the sea  
In an octopus's garden in the shade  
  
We would be warm below the storm  
In our little hideaway beneath the waves  
Restin' our head on the sea bed  
In an octopus's garden near a cave  
  
We would sing and dance around  
Because we know we can't be found  
  
I'd like to be under the sea  
In an octopus's garden in the shade  
  
We would shout and swim about  
The coral that lies beneath the waves  
Lies beneath the ocean waves  
Oh, what joy, for every girl and boy  
Knowing we're happy and we're safe  
Happy and we're safe  
  
We would be so happy you and me  
No one there to tell us what to do  
  
I'd like to be under the sea  
In an octopus's garden with you  
In an octopus's garden with you  
In an octopus's garden with you

Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I can' find an elephant to tie my shoe.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need an elephant to tie my shoe  
No, you don't need an elephant to tie your shoe  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I can' find a lumberjack to pour my milk.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a lumberjack to pour my milk.  
No, you don't need a lumberjack to pour your milk.  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I can' find a dinosaur to eat me up,  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a dinosaur to eat me up,  
No, you don't need a dinosaur to eat you up.  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I don't have a radio to sing a song.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a radio to sing a song.  
No, you don't need a radio to sing a song.

Waiting throughout the year  
For Christmas morning to be here  
And counting how many days  
Till Christmas morning, drawing near  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day  
Presents under the tree  
There's one from me to you and you to me  
Family and friends are here  
On the very best morning of the year  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day  

A peanut butter sandwich made with jam,  
One for me and one for David M. now a  
A peanut butter sandwich made with jam,  
Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick  
  
I can think of wiches good and bad,  
But the best wich that Ive ever had was a  
A peanut butter sandwich made with jam,  
Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum  
  
A peanut butter sandwich made with jam,

A peanut butter sandwich made with jam,

Robin in the rain,  
Such a saucy fellow.  
Robin in the rain,  
Mind your socks of yellow.  
Running in the garden on your nimble feet,  
Digging for your dinner with your long strong beak.  
Robin in the rain,  
You don't mind the weather  
Showers always make you gay.  
Bet the worms are wishing you would stay at home,  
Robin on a rainy day -- don't get your feet wet,  
Robin on a rainy day!  

I've gotta shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
Clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
Clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
Jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
Jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
Yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
Yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away,  
And wiggle my waggles away!

Lyrics for Animal Songs  
6 Little Ducks  
Traditional  
From the album More Singable Songs  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fast ones, skinny ones, fair ones too.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Down to the river they would go.  
Wibble wobble, wibble wobble to and fro.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Home from the river they would come.  
Wibble wobble, wibble wobble, ho-hum-hum.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fat ones, skinny ones, fair ones too.  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  
Quack, quack, quack-quack, quack, quack  
He led the others with his quack, quack, quack.  

Here we go sodeo sodeo sodeo  
Here we go sodeo all night long  
Step back sally sally sally  
Step back sally all night long  
I went to the plaza and what did I see  
A big fat man from Calgary  
I bet you five dollars I can catch that man  
I bet you five dollars I can catch that man  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
I went to the doctor, the doctor said:  
Ooh, ah I got a pain in my side  
Ooh, ah I got a pain in my stomach  
Ooh, ah I got a pain in my head  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
Here we go sodeo sodeo sodeo  
Here we go sodeo all night long  
Step back sally sally sally  
Step back sally all night long  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  
To the front, to the back to the sea-saw side  

Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I don't care if I never get back  
  
With our root, root, root for the home team  
If they don't win, it's a shame  
For it's one, two, three strikes  
You're out at the old ballgame  
  
Take me out to the ballgame  
Take me out with the crowd  
Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack  
I don't care if I never get back  
  
With our root, root, root for the home team  
If they don't win, it's a shame  
For it's one, two, three strikes  
You're out at the old ballgame

There came a girl from France  
Who didn't know how to dance  
The only thing that she could do  
Was knees up Mother Brown  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up, knees up, never let the breeze  
Up  
Knees up Mother Brown.  
  
Oh, hopping on one foot,  
Hopping on one foot,  
Hopping, hopping, never stopping  
Hopping on one foot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, prancing up and down  
Prancing up and down  
Prancing, prancing, never dancing  
Prancing up and down  
  
And whirling round and round,  
Whirling round and round  
Whirling, whirling, never twirling  
Whirling round and round  
  
(Repeat chorus)

In the town where I was born  
Lived a man, who sailed the sea  
And he told us of his life  
In the land of submarines  
So we sailed off to the sun  
Till we found a sea of green  
And we lived beneath the waves  
In our yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
And our friends are all aboard  
Many more of them live next door  
And the band begins to play  
Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
As we live a life of ease  
Everyone of us has all we need  
Sky of blue, a sea of green  
In our yellow submarine  
Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine  
We all live in a yellow submarine  
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
