85 miles out of Nashville, thinkin' bout  
The way things change  
Try an keep it by the reigns  
I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper  
Take anything you got on the rocks in snifter  
I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana  
I never had no lovin' like I had in Alabama  
A man of my word ain't out to hurt nobody  
I'm just a M see to keep the boogie in the party  
Been singin' lodi dodi since 84  
And I'll be singin' lodi dodi 'til I'm 84  
I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet  
So you can save the planet,  
I'll save your seat  
  
I been gone for weeks, I ain't slept days  
I can't find myself in this self made maze  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
I never thought about change until  
Spend a little time where time stood still  
Been lookin' for a mill but I keep comin' up shy  
I been a broke fool, I ain't tryin' to be that guy  
Want to ride like lightning, roll like thunder  
I'm tryin' to get some money, I ain't getting any younger  
At times I wonder, at times I won't  
Sometimes I give a fuck but most times I don't  
  
even care, through stained glass windows these eyes stare  
I try to stay straight but it's kickin' my ass  
Every time I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past  
I sit half mass like a soldier's flag  
That's why my left leg limps and my Dickies sag  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
Well I been around this crooked land  
I come across walks, I shook Jim Beam's hand  
I got no plans and no place to go  
It keep getting harder to just say no  
I see the people laugh and people cry  
That's how some live and that's how some die  
Well me myself I'm gonna sit right here  
And I'm a watch this world break down in tears  
All my fears and dark grey skies  
Couldn't crack my smile or break my stride  
Got too much pride, I got too much shout  
I might be down but I still ain't out  
Got too much time and that's all I have  
When I leave this world I'll still be sad  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin', to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way

Embers in the ashtray,  
Six-pack down behind my seat,  
One hand up on the wheel,  
Eat A Peach playin' on repeat.  
Got my baby at my side,  
Her hair whippin' all in the wind,  
The last time I felt this good,  
I can't remember when  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
Ain't lookin' for direction,  
Don't need it if it don't come free,  
A billboard says "Trust the Lord"  
A piece of country I ain't never seen.  
Nobody wavin' in the rearview,  
Just put the pedal to the floor and drive  
Don't it feel so good to you?  
I feel so alive  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
  
Her painted toes on the dash,  
Her hand on my knee  
She ain't looking out the window  
Cause she's too busy lookin' at me  
Yeah  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.

Hey What 'chu tryin' to do  
Why you tryin' to see through me baby  
It's way too hazy  
Hey I'm still feelin' the same  
So don't go tryin' to change me baby  
You can't save me  
So many people try to bring me down  
They wouldn't last a second in my town  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey I little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight  
  
You stem so far from the truth  
You hide inside all your talkin' papers  
Flashin' statements  
You never put your money down  
And watched a big wheel go around and take it  
And in remake it  
All you do is follow me around  
Then you go ahead and ride it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said don't try walkin' inside my shoes baby baby  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless your puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless your unless your unless your  
Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight

I can learn to live alone and move on with my life  
There's a million things that I can do to occupy my time  
I can wake each morning, I can go about my day  
I can fumble through my words until I find a few to say  
  
But the hardest thing I've had to do since we've been apart  
Is learning how to deal with all this pain inside my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
I can work all day, or I can hang out every night  
I can do the wrong things and pretend that they're allright  
I can make believe that everything is cool  
And put on the face that covers up the lies of a fool  
  
[Chorus]  
But I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
You said that time would ease the pain  
But I still hear your voice whisper my name  
Since you've been gone my world stands still  
You said I'd forget, but I never will  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I can write a song and make the whole world laugh and cry  
I can use some words to paint a vivid picture in your mind  
  
I can use my hands to wipe the dust off this guitar  
And let this music that I'm playing take the mind off my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
But I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
[Bridge]  
  
You said that time would ease the pain  
But I still hear your voice whisper my name  
Since you've been gone my world stands still  
You said I'd forget, but I never will  
(Chorus Repeated 2x)  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you

Day after day I'm more confused  
Yet I look for the light in the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame  
  
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul  
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away  
(won't you take me away)  
  
Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm countin' on you to carry me through  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You help me along makin' me strong

Half a mile outside Buloxi  
Did I come or did I go  
Seven sirens singin' to me  
Why I listen I don't know  
I got some smokes I got some coffee  
My head is ready to explode  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road  
I'm not much for conversation  
And I don't care for playin' games  
I've heard all the hard luck stories  
Man they all turn out the same  
I'm the last lonely survivor  
And I'm still carryin' their load  
I'll be makin my way further down the road  
I'll be makin' my way  
I want to get there some day  
I'll be makin' my way  
Past the one eyed Jocks layin' rail road tracks in my soul  
I'll be makin' my way  
I want to get there some day  
I'll be makin' my way  
Past the one eyed Jacks layin' rail road tacks in my soul  
Sometimes I wake up with a fever  
Then I just have another beer  
I'd like to wake up to a new life  
A million miles away from here  
But I got Beam instead me chasin'  
And I live by the legend's code  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road  
I'll be makin' my way further down the road

If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
  
it would be about the same to me  
Detroit city from Aretha to Aaliyah  
to Bob Segar to  
Joe Louis n' his arena an now on me  
Paradime the mic of overachievers  
Smokin' sewer cops bottom feeders  
and parking meters  
  
A bunch of bad dude in the mad brew and tattoos  
So think twice before you pass through  
Or get clapped through wack crews get hurt  
We can take you for a ride or take you for your shirt  
I did it in the Bronx, I did it in Queens  
And you can see me do it, down in New Orleans  
Fat backs n greens I'm a scene of amazement  
You'll be picking all your teeth up off the fucking pavement  
Is that Kracker with a see?  
Naw Kracker with a K!  
  
Kracker mother fucker all god damn day  
You could take Gratiot south but that's a real rough route  
You'll get found face down with your pockets hangin' out  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me...  
it would be about the same to me  
My name is Cowboy  
My Name is Cowboy  
  
I'm I'm I'm goin' Platinum  
Back in the mother fuckin' saddle  
want to battle Kid Rock bitch your up shit's creek  
without a paddle  
I'm no tattle cause I do not snitch  
I lick clits n' drop cock n' twats that spit  
I spit like hick's n' mix hits for Flom  
And that's what you call droppin' bombs  
Got a bullet head a dick with a 30 odd 6  
And from a thousand yards I'll hit ya right in the lips....shit  
  
Motherfuckers wamma talk about shinin'  
Here's four fingers, kiss my fuckin' diamonds  
I keep climbin' but these charts ain't shit  
I'm a whinin, linin', rhymin' son of a bitch  
I'm the song of a shotguns unsung cry  
And I'm the only MC that'll never die  
  
'Cause if it's real you'll feel it, so check for the name  
Or look for the dog with the fade in the chain, yeah!  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
it would be about the same to me  
  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker  
Kracker's the name, double X in size  
An' I reside on the side where the sun rise  
See I'll never be touched, cause I'm outta reach  
Call me Kracker just be fuckin' up spots like bleach  
Worst in my division, I got bitches on file  
From the Mississippi river on back to Belle Isle  
  
I got style but it doesn't show  
I got more love for Detroit than you'll ever know  
I I I I know cats that sling  
Crack n' cats that scrap  
Cats that bust beer bottles over baseball caps  
  
Cats that get drunk and like to spark up skull  
Cats that keep sawed off's chillin' up in the trunk trunk trunk  
Whores an' 4 4's n' scoops n' blow  
  
And fuck Faygo bitch we pound cans of Stroh's  
We run the mitten from the river way up to the farms  
That's why we got these fuckin D's tattooed on our arms  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I don't want to go  
If heaven ain't a lot like Detroit  
I'd just a soon stay home  
If they ain't got no 8 mile  
Like they do in the D  
  
Just send me to hell or Salt Lake City  
It would be about the same to me  
it would be about the same to me

You spend your lonely days lookin' for someone  
I just want to be the one that makes your river run  
I know it ain't so fun bein all alone  
And I know you wonder when you'll find yourself a home  
You ain't foolin' no one baby  
See you don't believe in you  
But I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do  
  
If you want some company  
I don't mind a ride  
I don't want your money baby  
And I don't want your pride  
You might think I'm crazy  
You just might be shy  
I think this is good for us  
But I could just be high  
We can make this happen baby  
I believe that's true  
Yeah I do  
Yes I do  
Oh I do  
Yes I do  
  
You keep on lookin' baby  
I hope it's all too sweet  
I hope its fairy tales  
And everything you dream  
  
But just remember that we ain't all this kind  
When you get tired of lookin' baby I ain't hard to find  
Your wastin' all your time out there  
'cause they don't care about you  
But I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do  
Oh I do  
Yeah I do

I'm nothing fancy  
I'm nothing special that's true  
But I know what your thinkin'  
'cause I'm thinkin' that same thing too  
Now you'd like everything to go your way  
And I should probably say everything you'd like me to say  
But that's not me and baby that just wouldn't be you  
You better watch how long you wait  
'cause baby you might wait too long  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know if I could make you happy  
And I don't know if I could make you cry  
I don't know if the clock stops at midnight  
I can't see past forever but together we can fly  
Together we can fly  
  
Now let's pretend for a while that we've got no place to be  
You've been broken before but baby that wasn't me  
Now I'm trying to ask you to come  
  
To that same old place that you've been runnin' from  
We've been down that road  
You know there's nothing to see  
You better watch how long you wait  
'cause baby you might wait too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bay there' no use in waiting  
I can see that your hopes are fading  
They tell me that time is precious baby  
Why do you keep wastin' time?  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
  
I've been lost in Boston, Austin Texas is always sweet  
I stumbled around that Texas town but I never left Sixth Street  
You know it's always hard to keep my feet from tryin' to run away  
And it seems I spent a lifetime tryin' to make everything ok  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
I wish sometimes that I could say she never told me so  
And I'd walk a million miles on down the same old broken road  
Now you can always reap just what you sew I know that's true  
And I pray some day that I wake and my poor feet won't fit these shoes  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright  
If I listened closely I can hear it oh so clear  
  
Like a south bound train like fallin' rain like a whisper in my ear  
Everything I'd like to hear you know I don't hear much no more  
But I know someday that you'll come my way and you'll walk right through that
door  
  
I want to go down to see her  
She's my little queen  
I want to go down to tell her  
She means the world to me  
I wish I was down to watch her  
Play that tambourine  
She always brought a smile to me  
I'd do anything  
I wish I had a dollar for all the times somebody told me  
Everything's gonna be alright

Not a minute goes by, that you ain't on my mind.  
Not a place in my heart, that you don't occupy.  
I miss you.  
  
If I could. I would crawl through the phone.  
Yeah, this drink gets me by, but it don't get me home.  
Are you sleeping? I ain't sleeping.  
  
So I wrote you a song, cause it's been so long.  
Since I looked in your eyes.  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile.  
I'd be there, I'd be there  
I'd be there.  
  
I'm watching the clock, but the clock doesn't care.  
I'm the star of the show called, "I wish I was there."  
Babe, I miss you.  
  
And thinking of you puts a smile on my face.  
And it makes me forget that I hate this place.  
I've been dreaming.  
But I still ain't sleeping.  
  
So I wrote you a song, cause it's been so long.  
Since I looked in your eyes.  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile.  
I'd be there, I'd be there  
I'd be there.  
  
Not a minute goes by, that you ain't on my mind.  
Not a place in my heart, that you don't occupy.  
I miss you.  
  
So I wrote you a song, cause it's been so long.  
Since I looked in your eyes.  
If there was a way I could see you today  
And hold your sweet sweet smile.  
I'd be there, I'd be there, I'd be there, I'd be there  
  
I'd be there.

Here's to the good life or so they say  
All those parties and games that all those people play  
They tell me this is the place to be  
All those beautiful people and nothing to see  
  
Chorus:]  
Sometimes I feel like something is gone here  
Something is wrong here  
I don't belong here  
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town  
And I've lost what I've found  
It'll all turn around  
In a little while I'll be thinking about you  
In a little while I'll still be here without you  
You never gave me a reason to doubt you  
In a little while I'll be thinking about you baby  
I'll be thinking about you baby  
  
On the other side of a coin there's a face  
There's a memory somewhere that I can't erase  
And there's a place that I'll find someday  
But sometimes I feel like it's slipping away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some things are lost, some left behind  
Some things are better left for someone else to find  
Maybe in time I could finally see  
I just wonder, wonder if you think about me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be thinking about you baby  
I'll be thinking about you baby, baby, baby

I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it,  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
Ain't it great to be alive  
Ain't it great to breathe  
Ain't it great to have hit songs hidden up my sleeves  
I ain't silly and my songs ain't cute  
I don't fly like a bird I just shine for loot, uh!  
You can believe I ain't close to done  
You talk hits, you've never been close to one  
  
You ain't supposed to run, you can tell them I said that  
Quick from the get, you know my hearts where my heads at  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it,  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
  
Spent the last six months sittin' out in the cold  
You know I cried for help but I got put on hold  
We dropped double wide and you thought it would fold  
It wasn't lookin' good, but now your uncle went gold  
  
Sold five hundred thou like plow  
Pushed one million everybody went how?  
Now I'm two plus, sittin' two plush  
I dare your punk ass to ask me what?  
I sold the farm and bought it right back  
I was sittin' in the red but now I'm back in the black, uh!  
  
I'm in tact went from broke to plastic  
All my hoopties turned into classics  
I've outlasted singin' yes yes y'all  
Got em' all kinda hopin' I'll return their calls  
And just when you thought that there was nothin' to see  
You heard me comin' around the corner hummin', follow me  
And here I am, I'm live and direct  
I'm makin' everybody wonder what I'm gonna do next  
I don't flex because that's not my style  
I'll be singin' what I'm bringin' baby all the while and I  
  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it, I'll keep it, I'll keep it  
  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh  
I'll keep it comin' with the oh, oh

[Spoken:] it must have been about 100 years... at least 100 years... I wish
you could come back- just come back home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago  
And I'm still waiting with my hand right by the telephone.  
Yeah maybe where you are you cannot make that call  
Or you can't find a pen, I know its not your fault.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Please come home.  
I watch the clock hands tick, my hours turn to days.  
And I can't fall asleep cause I don't want to miss that ring.  
I know that this year that your car will park outside,  
But I can't put my arms around the girl who took my life.  
My friends think I'm insane cause I've turned old and gray  
And I'm still waiting and I cannot be alone.  
Please come home  
Oooh baby,please come home.  
[Spoken:] its been so long, its been about 100 years and a million dreams
since the last time I saw your pretty face.  
I would do whatever it takes.  
I would wait another hundred years, and if that didn't work, maybe i would try
and see what forever feels like. but until then, and I Know you hear me, and
whatever your doin, wherever you are, please come home.  
The day we met feels like 100 years ago,  
And I'm still waiting for you  
Baby Baby, won't you please come home.  
Please come home.  
Won't you please come home.  
Please come home

I stayed out late last night  
But I nothing could drink  
Could help me drink you off my mind  
Everywhere I looked, I saw your face  
And I wonder, and I wonder  
If there still might be  
A little space in your heart for me  
'Cause I'm so cold, I'm so alone  
And I miss you, babe  
  
So won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
I was a fool to leave  
Leave behind everything that meant everything to me  
Every day and night my heart pays the price  
And I'm out here, stranded out here  
On this lonely road, I'm so lost won't you lead me home  
  
I need you back, need one more chance  
And I miss you, babe  
  
So won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
I'm drowning baby  
I need you to save me, yeah  
Don't leave me like this  
Throw me a line, baby one more time  
  
Won't you come to my rescue  
Shake this pain from my soul  
And take this fool back in your heart baby  
I'll go crazy if you don't  
'Cause I'm a mess here without you  
Ain't no pill for this pain  
So please, please come to my rescue baby  
Make it right away  
  
Make it right away

Well she was lookin out the window  
And I was starin at the door  
The dog was sleepin on the sofa  
This place has never been this quiet before  
You can't pretend it never happened  
You can't pretend it's still the same  
You can't say you were only jokin'  
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Some things you can't take back  
Though you wish you could  
Some things you can''t take back  
Though the glass has been broke  
And the milk has been spilled  
And your loves on the line  
Some things you can't take back  
When someone says there's no tomorrow  
When the writings on the wall  
After all have cried and spoken  
And your poor heart has taken such a fall  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS ]  
If I could reset the clock and go back in time  
I'd erase the thoughts that went through my mind  
You know I never would leave  
And I'd still have you with me  
You can't pretend it never happened  
You can't pretend it's still the same  
You can't say you were only jokin'  
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS ]  
Some things you can't take back  
'Cause in the cold light of day the pieces all blew away  
And now I'm livin' a lie  
Some things you can't take back

You can move it on down the highway  
You can turn another page  
And when you finally get to the old folks home you can finally act your age  
I can make a million dollars  
And you can spend it as fast as it comes  
And you can sit there and cry on a bed full of lies  
And be thinking that you got you some  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
You can hear me on the radio  
You can see me on TV  
You'll have to dig you a hole just to find your soul  
And get you a word from me  
You can run as fast as a hour glass  
You can fly as high as the wind  
You can be as strong for as long as you like  
But you'll end up right back where you been  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Because I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
I got a song for every occasion  
I been told I got a way with words  
I been told I'd be loved forever  
I been sold on the lies that I heard  
I been bold in my days  
Been gold in my ways  
Been packed up and rolled out  
And thrown out the way  
I belong to a song, for as long as I say  
But I'll always have a song to play  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
They'll be songs about me  
They'll be songs about you  
They'll be songs about everything from money to blues  
But there wont be no songs about regret  
Cause I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
No I ain't wrote no songs like that yet  
Baby I ain't wrote no songs like that yet

Ahh It still feels good  
You were always there to bring me breakfast in bed  
And when I stayed out late you had some powder for my head  
I've been a bad man  
But you never paid no mind  
  
[Chorus]  
We've had some long nights  
But we're alright this time  
  
I believe in something I just don't know what it is  
And every time I climb I wind up back on the skids  
You always stood by me  
When the natives start to whine  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You're like an angel with a 12 gauge (Lock and load)  
You're like a wheelman on a get-away (Hit the road)  
And together we ride  
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde  
But we made out of town just the same  
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive  
You always come between me and the mess outside  
I could buy you a ring  
But you'd rather have the cash  
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And together we ride  
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde  
But we made it out of town just the same  
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive  
You always come between me and the mess outside  
I could buy you a ring  
But you'd rather have the cash  
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme  
  
[Chorus: x3]

I know a cabin down there in Tennessee  
Where you can't find the forest on account of the trees  
And Old Perry Foster he got something to say  
And you can smell the pigs 'cause' they been cookin' all day  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I don't need no critics  
I don't need no suits  
I just need somebody who can tell me the truth  
You can keep your opinions  
You can keep on walkin'  
I'm gonna raise my glass yeah to Thunderhead Hawkins  
  
Miss Mary Jane she always looks like a star  
But the rock n roll banker likes to sleep in his car  
You won't hear no opry you'll hear six strings  
And you won't know what to do when you hear Thunderhead sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Mr. Hawkins got a family tree  
He got that their legendary cabin down in Tennessee  
You know he'll hook up that guitar everybody gather round  
You stay close to the fire when the sun goes down  
Old Brother Merle he's always waiting in the wings  
Only man up in them woods wearin' all them gold rings  
Old Mr. Hawkins he won't do nobody wrong  
But he'll he'll tear your heart out with one sad song  
  
[Chorus]

You made me laugh some  
You made me cry some too  
You sent me off to a world of pain  
You made me someone new  
You made all kinds of promises  
But only some came true  
Now I now you need me  
More than I need you  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
You know I'm not perfect  
I tried to make you see  
Somehow you thought of everything  
But you didn't think of me  
Lies and disappointment makes your world go round  
It's too late to save me  
So you might as well come down  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But, we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
To think I used to love you  
For reasons I don't know  
You polished up my halo  
And I dirtied up your soul  
I sure had a good time  
But, we both know I can't stay  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway  
  
To think I used to love you  
But, I'm leaving anyway

The birds outside my window  
Want to drive this stupid song into my head  
I wake up in this empty bed alone  
I guess it's somethin' that I said  
I tried to open up a door between us  
But I guess it was a wall instead  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Seven forty five  
I got a flight  
But you're still mad about last night  
Tear apart Pandora's box  
I try to open every lock in sight  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Another Sunday mornin' comin' down  
But I'm tryin' to see the bright side  
Another cold and unforgiving dawn  
I wish I was on your right side (right side)  
I wish that you could understand  
That words can fail the best intentions, ma'am  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean?  
And what do we want from each other?  
Where do we go?  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other?  
  
And them birds outside my window  
Wanna drive this stupid song into my head

747 11 come to bust  
Somebody take me home I wanna live in lust  
When trust is low and stakes are high  
That's all I ever did in Denver was die  
That's all I ever did in New York was die  
That's all I ever did in L.A. was die  
So put em' up, put em' up to the sky  
And wave goodbye to Miss American Pie  
Cuz you been tellin' lies, you took it all and abused it  
Whatever happened to the feel good music?  
Somewhere, somehow, someway, somebody pulled the plug  
And left me sittin' in a dirty little body  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
You run around pullin' stunts like that  
See never in my life could I front like that  
I ain't cut like that, I couldn't run like that  
I'm a keep it nonfiction and take my hatuh  
Remember back when things looked grim  
I spent a lot of time and money on whims  
I remember the crew, remember the good times  
Remember the orange and I remember the sunshine  
It's all gone that's a thing of the past  
The fact remains that it moves real fast  
So why you sit around hopin' things might change  
I'll be sittin' pretty singin' Hey Pockey Way!  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
You'll hear me comin' hummin' songs of redemption huh  
I've been oppressed for less that attention  
I got your extension, but I'll probably never call  
Cause this time last year you ain't seen me in your crystal ball  
And I'm uphauled by things you've done  
Left a trail of wrongs and can't account for one  
Now you're done and I'm glad but it's a shame you'd waste it  
You want this so bad you can taste it  
Detroit love can you feel that feel that  
That's stick an move can you feel that feel that  
I'm on the rack for the two triple zero  
Full failure all American Hero  
  
I gotta tell you baby life's been good to me  
And I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
Oh I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
  
I'm here to tell you baby life's been good to me  
I know that makes you mad  
Cause that's something you can't see  
I got everything I ever wanted  
And I'll never give that back  
I know you hate that fact  
But you ain't gotta look at me like that  
I said you ain't gotta look at me like that  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at  
What'chu lookin' at

Guess I never thought again I'd hear your voice  
When you packed your bags and pulled out of Detroit  
Yeah the snow falls alone get hard to bear  
Knowin' you're down south with sunshine on your hair  
Sent a postcard from Graceland when you passed through  
Read even though we lost, I still love you  
I keep it like a locket on a chain  
I tell myself that I've moved on but only half the way  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I'd have some words to say  
Ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
  
Lately I've been talkin' to God again  
And a string of things I didn't do back then  
No doubt I'm better off havin' had you  
Yeah you taught me how to love  
Taught me how to lose it too  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I've have some words to say  
Ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're dancin' 'neath the full moonlight  
Your faded jeans across the hood  
My arms wrapped 'round you tight and good  
And I'm wiser than I was that day  
Now I'd have some words to say  
The ones that just might make you stay with me  
That's only when I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes

Who bring's it to you  
Whoooooohhh  
  
I laid cuts with Jay and rocked rhymes with Run  
A couple mil in the bank and I ain't even done  
I got platinum plaques, I write platnum tracks  
I got it all from raps and that's the platinum face, Uh  
All that and there ain't nothing I fear yet  
Sippin champagne up in company leer jets  
Five star meals, Caribbean vacations  
Everything's plush deluxe accommodations  
Nationwide, the stations vibe  
To the cat who covers tracks like the lace on thighs  
My ace is high, there ain't gonna be no guessin  
And I'm the illest mother fucker on the block no question  
I ain't destined I don't fuck with fate  
Self made millionaire while your bussin plates  
You see I've already done everything you want to do  
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you  
  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
  
I shot dice with the devil on many occasion  
Drank shots with God in an old gas station  
A couple accountants, that count my statements  
Cribs all paid for, no car payments  
Rocked in basements for gas and beer  
And now I get all that and big loot to appear  
I couldn't steer so I got me a chauffer  
Hired a chef cause I was tired of stouffers  
I got over and people showed envy  
Cause I couldn't choose between a Lincoln and a Benzy  
Fendi shades and topless maids  
I don't worry about clothes cause their custom made  
I drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years  
Your smokin OP's, drinkin three-two beer  
I've already done everything you want to do  
So what makes you think I give a fuck about you  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
  
Detroit to Texas  
Texas to LA  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?  
Brooklyn to the bayou  
Across the southern plains  
Who brings it to you  
Whooooohh  
Who's your uncle?

I might walk a lil funny but my walk is me  
I might stutter when I talk but I say what I see  
I don't agree with every other li'l thing that's proven  
I do a lot of things that I shouldn't be doin'  
I'll ruin everything you mighta had in mind  
I'm a consistent, belligerent, solidified find  
Rhinestone freak, suburban star  
I ain't got no money and I got no car  
I might make par if it don't take much  
See I don't ride very far 'cause I ride on luck  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And I do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I don't know why I come here  
But I know I'll never leave  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea  
  
I'm a long way gone but I ain't short lived  
I got deep deep pockets that leak like a civ  
I give 110 throughout the course of a night  
And if I don't go home then I did things right  
I'd like to settle down but I ain't that guy  
'cause everything I ever did I always did on the fly  
I like to ride the wave 'til the tide don't swell  
I don't like cocaine but I like the smell  
I dwell in the place you might see unfit  
But there ain't nothin' you can ever say to make me give a shit  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'd like to say that I don't do them bars  
But my street called straight don't stretch too far (uh huh)  
I'm on the move goin' nowhere fast  
And you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass  
I'll take a pass be the last in line  
And if it takes 10 years then I'ma be just fine (ah!)  
I saw the signs in the grass ain't green  
I found love at the bottom of a bottle of Beam  
See comin' clean just seemed so jaded  
And bein' underrated is underrated but I don't hate it  
I stay stuck in a rut like I should  
You know I do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea,  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea!

I've been wasting all my time  
And I've been drinkin' all that wine  
And I've been drinkin' all that beer  
And I've been sheddin' all these tears  
  
I can't go but you can't stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go  
  
I've been down this road before  
And I just can not care no more  
I can't see what you can see  
I'm too busy bein' me  
  
See I can't go and you can't stay  
You not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go  
  
I don't need to save no face  
I can't wait to leave this place  
I've been fooled by lesser things  
And I don't care what tomorrow brings  
See I can go but you can't stay  
Your not gonna take me out that way  
Because you can't take me  
I said you can't take me  
No you can't take me anywhere I don't want to go
