Nakita kitang may kasama ng iba  
Halos di mo na pansin na  
Akoy may kasama rin  
Abot langit ang iyung ngiti  
At parang kay saya  
Bakit lungkot aking nadarama  
Gayun akoy meron naring iba  
  
Bakit mahal parin kita  
Bakit ba lagi mong nasasaktan  
Ang puso ko  
Bkit mahal parin kita  
Kahit pareho tayung meron ng iba  
Di ko maamin na nasasaktan parin ako  
Ayokong malaman mong nag kukunwari lamang sayo  
Hindi ko ma pigilan ang aking damdamin  
Bakit mahal pa rin kita  
  
Hawak nya ang yung kamay  
Nais ko sanang agawin ngunit  
Di na maaari pagkat sya ng nag mamayari alam kung may mali sa aking nadarama
mas mahal parin kita kahit ngayuy ibang kasama  
  
Bakit mahal parin kita  
Bakit ba lagi mong nasasaktan ang puso ko  
Bakit mahal parin kita  
Kahit pareho tayung meron ng iba  
Diko maamin na nasasaktan parin ako ayokong malaman mong nag kukunwari lamang

Hindi ko ma pigilan ang aking damdamin  
Bakit mahal parin kita ahh ahh ahh wooh wooh ooh

Hindi ko mapigilan ang damdamin  
  
Bakit mahal pa rin kita

Wish I was your child  
Hold me in your heart  
We could love so free  
And oh we'd never part  
But I'm not a child  
And wishes are just child's play my love  
No I'll never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who I'm not  
Come what may  
  
Wish I was a bird  
I'd warm you with my wings  
Safe from all the storms  
You know true love can bring  
But I'm not a bird  
And wishes can just fly away  
My love  
And I'll never be afraid  
Of who I am  
And who I'm not  
Come what may  
  
Oh I'm just a moon shining in your eyes  
And you're the stars my love  
No we'll never be afraid  
Of who we are  
And who we're not  
Come what may  
  
Of who we are  
And who we're not  
Come what may

Doors. why do there have to be doors  
'Coz when you walked right out that door of mine  
It made me wonder why there are tears  
Where is the end to all these tears  
Where's the face that use to cheer me up  
Girl, that makes me wonder  
Why does my hear tjust keep on beating  
Why do my arms just keep on reaching  
To someone who's no longer there

What can I say to change your mind  
What can I do to make tomorrow yours and mine

A chance you'll walk back through the door  
When my heart knows there's no hope anymore

I just can't believe it  
You are always on my mind  
I hope I can forget it  
And wish that I was blind

Here I am playing with those memories again  
And just when I thought time had set me free  
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me  
  
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew  
Though each and every part of me has tried  
Only you can fill that space inside  
  
So there's no sense pretending  
My heart it's not mending  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh, baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without you  
  
On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone  
I've done everything I can to ease the pain  
But only you can stop the rain  
  
I just can't live without you  
I miss everything about you  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without  
Go on without  
It's just no good without you  
  
Without you, without you, without you  
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without, you

I believe we'll be together  
And we can be one again  
I believe in the end it's still you and I

Deep in my heart I know that  
You never meant to walk away  
And I know you wanted to stay  
  
Chorus:  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe  
  
I believe one day you'll wake-up  
And you will be missing me  
And I know that you will come back  
Oh, come back to the one you really love  
And when that day comes  
I'll take you in my arms again  
And never ever let you go

Time, I've been passing time watching trains go by  
All of my life  
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly  
Wishing there could be  
Someone waiting home for me  
Something's telling me it might be you all of my life  
  
Looking back as lovers go walking past all of my life  
Wondering how they met and what makes it last  
If I found the place would I recognize the face  
  
Something's telling me it might be you  
It's telling me it might be you  
So many quiet walks to take  
So many dreams to wake  
And there's so much love to make  
  
I think we're gonna need some time  
Maybe all we need is time  
And it's telling me it might be you  
All of my life  
  
I've been saving love songs and lullabies  
And there's so much more  
No one's ever heard before  
Something's telling me it might be you  
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you  
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life  
I've been waiting for  
All of my life  
  
Maybe it's you, maybe it's you  
I've been waiting for all of my life  
Maybe it's you, maybe it's you  
I've been waiting for all of my life  
It's you, it's you I've been waiting for all of my life

Nitong umaga lang, Pagka-lambing-lambing  
Ng iyong mga matang  
Hayup kung tumingin  
Nitong umaga lang, Pagka-galing-galing  
Ng iyong sumpang  
Walang aawat sa atin  
  
Chorus  
O kay bilis namang maglaho ng pag-ibig mo sinta  
Daig mo pa ang isang kisapmata  
Kanina'y nariyan lang o ba't bigla namang nawala  
Daig mo pa ang isang kisapmata  
  
Kani-kanina lang  
Pagka-ganda-ganda ng pagkasabi mong  
Sana'y tayo na nga  
Kani-kanina lang, Pagka-saya-saya  
Ng buhay kong bigla na lamang nag-iba

Nag-iisa at hindi mapakali  
Ibang-iba pala pag wala ka sa aking tabi  
Pinipilit kong limutin ka  
Ngunit di magawa  
Sa bawat kong galaw  
Ay laging hanap ka  
  
Nag-iisa ang isang kagaya mo  
Na nagmahal at nagtiyaga  
Sa isang katulad ko  
Bakit nga ba di ko man lang nabigyan ng halaga  
Nagsisisi ngayong wala ka na  
  
Refrain:  
Kulang ako kung wala ka  
Di ako mabubuo kung di kita kasama  
Nasanay na ako na lagi kang nariyan  
Di ko kayang mag-isa  
Puso ay pagbigyan  
Kulang ako, kulang ako kung wala ka  
  
Nag-iisa sa bawat sandali  
At tila ba biglang nahati ang aking daigdig  
Umaasa na sana'y maging tayong dalawa muli  
Sa puso ko'y wala kang kapalit  
  
Repeat Refrain  
  
Ooohh...  
  
Repeat Refrain  
  
Kulang ako, kulang ako kung wala ka

I'll find my way beyond the fiery desert  
I'll swim across the vastness of the sea  
I'll climb to reach the dangers of the mountains  
I'll follow you to where you wanna be  
  
No creature's hand will lay upon your shoulder  
No ghost will bring you terrors from the past  
No witch's curse will keep me from believing  
In the truth that our love is meant to last  
  
I will face the trials that come my way  
And fight the forces evil kings have made  
It's enchantment that I need to live forever  
In a kingdom full of love that never fades  
It's the magic of our love that never fades

Rain falls  
Dark clouds are racing up above  
I gaze in solitude  
Looking through a misty glass window  
'Cause then it used to be the two of us  
  
This empty room  
Filled my thoughts with memories of you  
I turned and looked around  
Oh, but found no sight of you  
I guess it'll never be as true, no no ooh  
  
Chorus  
Starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Oh, starbright  
Grant my wish tonight  
I'm beggin' you, starlight  
All I need is you tonight  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight, ooh  
  
Rain falls  
Dark clouds keep racing up above  
It's still in solitude  
Oh, longin' for you  
Guess my heart will always be with you  
My heart will always be with you  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Hoh, starbright  
Get rid of the spell tonight

Words nothing but words  
For me to show  
How much my love for you unfolds  
Through trouble and fears  
This love feels so real  
And I need you to know  
  
Even though we're far apart  
You're right beside me in my heart  
  
Chorus:  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Time, nothing but time  
To make up your mind  
I'll give you all that you need  
I want you to know  
I'll never let go  
'Til you come back to me  
  
Even though you're far away  
I'm right beside you day by day  
  
Chorus:  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Even though we're far apart  
You're right beside me in my heart  
  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real for you?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you

The moment you walked through the door  
My heart stopped beating  
I know you've heard that line before  
Baby don't tease me..  
  
Somehow I knew that I met you before  
Without you I am lost  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Baby you're a mystery  
I know what you do to me  
And I know, coz love's a mystery  
Baby you're a mystery  
You walked into my dream  
And I know  
Coz you're a mystery  
  
The moment your eyes met mine  
I feel the passion  
I guess it's time to realize  
Anything can happen  
  
With your sweet kiss  
How can I miss your love  
Don't leave me hangin' on  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
How can I.. Each time you cry,  
Hold you endlessly..  
Will there ever be you and me?  
Baby it's here and now..

What has life to offer me  
When I grow old  
What's there to look forward to  
Beyond the biting cold  
'Cause they say it's difficult  
Yes, stereotypical  
  
What's there beyond sleep, eat, work in this cruel life  
Ain't there nothing else 'round here but human strife  
They say it's difficult  
Yes, stereotypical  
You gotta be conventional  
You can't be so radical  
  
So I sing this song to all of my age  
For these are the questions  
We've got to face  
For in this cycle that we call life  
We are the ones who are next in line  
We are next in line  
  
What has life to offer me  
When I grow old  
What's there to look forward to  
Beyond the biting cold  
Cause they say it's difficult  
Yes, stereotypical  
You gotta be conventional  
You can't be so radical  
  
So I sing this song to all of my age  
For these are the questions  
We've got to face  
For in this cycle that we call life  
We are the ones who are next in line  
We are next in line  
  
We are next in line... Oooh... Ohh...  
We are next in line  
  
And we gotta work, we gotta feel  
Let's open our eyes and do whatever it takes  
And we gotta work, we gotta feel  
Let's open our eyes(ooohhh)  
  
And I sing this song to all of my age  
For these are the questions  
We've got to face  
For in this cycle that we call life  
We are the ones who are next in line  
We are next in line

I remember the days  
When you're here with me  
Those laughter and tears  
We shared for years  
Mem'ries that we had  
For so long it's me and you  
Now you're gone away  
You left me all alone  
  
Go on, do what you want  
But please don't leave me  
You'll break my heart  
Hey, what should I do  
Babe, I'm missing you  
Please don't disappear  
These are the words that you should hear  
Time and time again  
I wish that you were here  
  
I don't wanna lose you girl  
I need you back to me  
I don't wanna lose you  
Baby can't you see  
Oh, I need you  
You've been a part of me  
  
I wish someday you'll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling, please come home  
  
I wish someday you'll be back home  
Cause I really miss you  
Darling, please come home  
  
I remember the days  
When you're here with me

I'm sittin' here all alone, and I am thinking, ' startin' out in the rain I
felt, it pourin on the window pane  
  
I saw your face and I look, and wait to see if you're lookin back at me, I
swear it hit me like I want to be, like I want to be with you, girl  
  
I've been running and running around, been looking for you but there's no one
around  
I tried so hard to find you, you've been blowing my mind, coz I want you, girl  
  
I returned to the place, where I saw you, sittin' out in the rain, I'm wet, I
felt it rollin down my face  
  
I felt the pain that I took, coz I'm wanting you bad, girl, if you only knew  
I wish I know just what to do, you know I'm dying just to have you  
  
[Bridge:]  
I've been longing, I've been longing for a girl like you, I want to find you,
I want to love you  
I really want to be with you

You said that I will always be the one for you  
Tell me babe who's that guy you kissed last night  
You know how much I really love you  
Seems you just can't keep your love from dying tonight  
  
Chorus  
Running away from the places and things that make me think of you  
But I guess there's just no letting go  
All these feelings I ache inside  
Running away  
I've been trying so hard to keep away from you  
Now forgetting you is all I have to do  
That's why I'm running away from you  
  
The times that we've been through  
Are always on my mind  
And I never thought that there would be an end  
Oh how I wish that this was all a dream  
Hurting me inside all over again  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
After all I gave to you  
Your love is still untrue  
Now there's nothing I can do  
But to run away  
  
Repeat

How can I make it through the day  
Without you  
You have been so much a part of me (and if you'll go)  
I'll never know what to do  
  
How can I carry on my way  
The memories  
When all that is left is the pain in my history  
Why should I live my life today  
  
[Refrain]  
I can't live out on my own (I can't do anything at all)  
And just forget the love you've always shown  
And accept the fate of my condition  
Please don't ever go  
For I cannot live my life alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go out my way  
Say you'll never go  
For we can still go on  
And make it through  
Just say you'll never go  
Say you'll never go away  
  
How can I make my dreams come true  
Without you  
You were the one who gave love to me (and don't you know)  
Your are my fantasy  
  
(Repeat Refrain)  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

You are the one in my life  
And I know it's you  
And all that I own and I have will give to you  
Oh all the love in this world  
This I offer you  
My love, my heart and my soul  
I'm giving it all  
  
I'm giving it all when I'm with you  
Living a life that's all brand new  
Oh nothing has ever made me feel so right  
Alright  
  
All of the things I do  
I do 'em all for you  
In love I will stay and remain  
  
That's what I would do  
For you are the love of my life  
And I promise you  
My love, my heart and my soul  
I'm giving it all  
  
[Bridge:]  
Life is all that I could spare  
This I want to share with you  
To prove my love for you  
Oh oh love  
Believe in me  
Forever I will cherish you

Would you know my name  
  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
I must be strong and carry on  
Cause I know  
I don't belong here in heaven  
  
Would you hold my hand  
If I saw you in heaven  
Could you help me stand  
If I saw you in heaven  
  
I'll find my way  
Through night and day  
Cause I know  
I just can't stay  
Here in heaven  
In my heart, I'll remember  
And forever you'll stay  
  
Time can bring you down  
Time can bend your knees  
Time can break your heart  
I keep begging please  
Begging please  
  
Would you know my name  
If I saw you in heaven?  
Would it be the same  
If I saw you in heaven  
Beyond the dawn  
There's peace I'm sure  
And I know there'll be no more  
Tears in heaven  
Forever I will Stay  
Till we both meet someday

This is the moment!  
This is the day,  
When I send all my doubts and demons  
On their way!  
  
Every endeavor,  
I have made - ever  
Is coming into play,  
Is here and now - today!  
  
This is the moment,  
This is the time,  
When the momentum and the moment  
Are in rhyme!  
  
Give me this moment  
This precious chance  
I'll gather up my past  
And make some sense at last!  
  
This is the moment,  
When all I've done  
All the dreaming,  
Scheming and screaming,  
Become one!  
  
This is the day  
See it sparkle and shine,  
When all I've lived for  
Becomes mine!  
  
For all these years,  
I've faced the world alone,  
And now the time has come  
To prove to them  
I've made it on my own!  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned,  
I never reckoned,  
Second Best!  
  
I won't look down,  
I must not fall!  
This is the moment,  
The sweetest moment of them all!  
  
This is the moment!  
Damn all the odds!  
This day, or never,  
I'll sit forever  
With the gods!  
  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all

If only a song could capture a memory  
I would be with you  
If only a heart could fall for a melody  
I know you'd love me too  
  
But a song is just a song  
And a melody won't do  
If you don't belong to me  
In the way I'd want you to  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
I'd always remember  
The way you are to me  
And that's how you'd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
If only a dream could be realized  
I'd have you here with me  
Here in my arms  
Here in my life  
The way it's meant to be  
  
But I've had enough of dreaming  
Of a life I'd never have  
If you don't belong to me  
I guess I'd have to live with that  
  
But just as long as you know  
This is song is for you  
For as long as the memory of this melody lives on  
I'd always remember  
The way you are to me  
And that's how you'd always be  
Here in the memory of a song  
  
For as long as you know  
This song is for you

You're the one that never lets me sleep  
To my mind, down to my soul you touch my lips  
You're the one that I can't wait to see  
With you here by my side i'm in ecstasy  
  
[refrain]  
I am all alone without you  
My days are dark without a glimpse of you  
But you came into my life  
I feel complete  
The flowers bloom, my morning shines  
And I can see  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Every time I hear our music play  
Reminds me of the things that we've been through  
In my mind I can't believe it's true  
But in my heart the reality is you  
  
Coz' I am all alone without you  
My days are dark without a glimpse of you  
But you came into my life  
I feel complete  
The flowers bloom, my morning shines  
And I can see  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside  
  
Your love is like the sun  
That lights up my whole world  
I feel the warmth inside  
Your love is like the river  
That flows down through my veins  
I feel the chill inside
