Just before our love got lost you said  
"I am as constant as the northern star"  
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness  
Where's that at  
If you want me I'll be in the bar"  
On the back of a cotton coaster  
In the blue T.V. screen light  
I drew a map of Canada  
Oh Canada  
With your face sketched on it twice  
  
In my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter and so sweet  
Well, I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
Oh I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I'm frightened by the devil  
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid  
I remember that time you told me  
"Love is touching souls"  
Surely you touched mine  
Cause part of you pours out of me  
In these lines from time to time  
  
My blood  
My holy wine  
Tastes so bitter and so sweet  
Well I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
I met a woman  
She had a mouth like yours  
She knew your devils and your deeds  
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him  
But be prepared to bleed"  
  
My blood  
My holy wine  
Tastes so bitter and so sweet  
Well I could drink a case of you, darling  
And I would still be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet

On my way up north  
Up on the Ventura  
I pulled back the hood  
And I was talking to you  
And I knew then it would be  
A life long thing  
But I didn't know that we  
We could break a silver lining  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
Things you said that day  
Up on the one o one  
The girl had come undone  
I tried to downplay it  
With a bet about us  
You said that  
You'd take it  
As long as I could  
I could not erase it  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
And I ride along side  
And I rode along side  
You then  
And I rode along side  
Till you lost me there  
In the open road  
And I rode along side  
Till the honey spread  
Itself so thin  
For me to break your bread  
For me to take your word  
I had to steal it  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
I could pick back up  
Whenever I feel  
  
Down New Mexico way  
Something about  
The open road  
I knew that he was  
Looking for some Indian blood and  
Find a little in you find a little  
In me we may be  
On this road but  
We're just  
Impostors  
In this country you know  
So we go along and we said  
We'd fake it  
Feel better with  
Oliver Stone  
Till I  
Almost smacked him  
Seemed right that night and  
I don't know what  
Takes hold  
Out there in the  
Desert cold  
These guys think they must  
Try and just get over on us  
  
And I'm so sad  
Like a good book  
I can't put this  
Day back  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
A sorta fairytale  
With you  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along side  
For a while till you lost me  
And I was ridin' by  
Ridin' along till you lost me  
Till you lost  
Me in  
The rear  
View  
You lost me  
I said  
Way up North I took my day  
All in all was a pretty nice  
Day and I put the hood  
Right back where  
You could taste heaven  
Perfectly  
Feel out the summer breeze  
Didn't know when we'd be back  
And I I don't  
Didn't think  
We'd end up like  
Like this

Alamo  
Heard all about your fandango  
Banged on my knees on your back door  
Only to wake you to blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
  
Embarcar  
Figures you'll see me as older  
Twenty-three hours till the border  
Don't think I'll be going as fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
Fast as I came  
  
Tears on my pillow  
Of course they're not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody invent the telephone line  
I'll take mine  
My chances  
  
Alamo  
Wish I could do what gold does  
Heard that the stars were in order  
Got yourself dealt a hand with  
Two queen of spades  
And blues on the way  
Blues on the way  
  
Tears on my pillow  
Of course they're not mine  
Alter that altar  
Making a play  
Somebody, just somebody, invent the telephone line  
I'll take my chances

Just a minute of your time  
Yes I've been known to delude myself  
So let me put those rose  
Colored glasses to the test  
  
Now is this real enough for you  
Cause blonds here don't jump out of cakes  
If that never impressed you much  
  
Come board this lunatic express  
  
Just why do they say  
Have a nice day anyway  
We both know they wouldn't mind  
  
If I just curled up and died  
Let's not give that one a try  
Chin up put on a pair of these roseys  
Raise those blinds  
Chin up a happy mask was never  
Your best disguise  
Chin up put on a pair of these roseys  
In no time you will feel almost fine  
  
Almost rosey  
  
Now some girls here will huddle with  
No not footballers that are rich  
But will confide in small white sticks  
He bats as The Virginian Slim  
  
Then I tried once to comply  
With an authority that would  
Subsidize my wild side  
But at this altar was sacrificed  
  
Yes you can laugh a femme fatale  
In a bride's dress now married to  
The effortlessness of the cracks  
That lie now in between the facts  
  
Now about when violet died  
The cause still unidentified  
She thought her love would be enough  
But you can't seduce seduction  
  
Her tentacles of endless want  
Reach through my corridors  
And tempt me to taste of her power  
I sober with the witching hour  
  
And when I hear of one more bomb  
Yes we have all been robbed of song  
And nightingales who throw their arms up  
When is enough enough?

Well he lit you up  
Like amber waves in his movie show  
He fixed you up real good  
Till I don't know you anymore  
From ballet class to a lap dance  
Straight to video  
And the pool side news  
Was that he would be  
Launching you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Into every young man's  
Bedroom - you gave it up  
On Dvd and magazine  
You gave it up  
A private right of passage  
You gave it up  
To every boy's sweet dream  
With their paper cuts  
  
You said "he's got a  
Healing machine  
It glows in the dark  
Glows in the dark:  
You say "there's not a lot  
Of me  
Left anymore  
Just leave it alone.  
But if you're buy, and you have  
The time, tell the Northern  
Lights to keep shining - Lately it seems like they're drowning"  
  
He cold light you up  
And summon every swan  
Or the Lakesie  
Off to Cabo San Lucas  
For some optical stimulus  
Then you started to guess  
There was someone else  
Though his flint glass  
Seeing all of you  
Immersed in his sepia  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I went by  
Cause I had the time,  
And told the Northern Lights  
To keep shining  
They told me to tell you  
They're waving

In the streets, the children screamed  
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed  
And not a word was spoken  
The church bells, all were broken  
The three men I admired most  
The Father, Son, and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
They were singing, "Bye, bye, Miss American Pie"  
I drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye  
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die, this'll be the day that I die"  
And the three men I admired most  
The Father, Son, and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  

With a wink  
And a smile  
You toss your instructions on  
How to catch a train  
While it's moving  
You always were the one  
That kept us all guessing  
How you could survive  
The fall you had  
  
from medicine men  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
"He's got to watch his back"  
  
they're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But it's not how you think  
You'd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you can't remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
Tell me where they've gone  
  
From Jordan to Chicago  
Another child is born  
Trusting that we'll get it  
Right this time  
I should've worn my glasses  
You said just to trust  
Then you chose  
To sign the dotted line  
  
From modern Magdalenes  
To my DJ friends  
They all have said  
"He's got to watch his back"  
  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But it's not how you think  
You'd be surprised  
They liberate  
Your dreamscape  
Till you can't remember  
To recall  
Where your wings  
Have gone  
  
Before I close my eyes at night  
I can still see you smilin'  
Before the truth was  
Buried alive  
Did we prize it  
Before you change the world  
Maybe boy you should change  
Your girl  
  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
They're trapping angels  
Lord I know this  
They're trapping angels  
By the Potomac  
But we're getting closer  
I said we're getting closer  
To where they've gone  
Tell me where they've gone  
  
Now it won't be long

Angie, Angie  
When will those clouds all disappear?  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here?  
With no lovin' in our soul and no money in our coats  
You can't say we're satisfied  
But Angie, Angie  
You can't say we never tried  
  
Angie, you're beautiful  
But I hate that sadness in your eyes  
Angie, I still love you baby  
Remember all those nights we cried  
All the dreams were held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Angie, Angie  
Where will it lead us from here? Yeah  
  
All the dreams we held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Hate that sadness in your eyes  
But Angie, I still love you baby  
Everywhere I look I see your eyes  
There ain't a woman that comes close to you  
Come on baby dry your eyes  
But Angie, Angie  
Ain't it good to be alive  
Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried

Bachelorette you climb on rooftops and you bachelorette  
You can turn dust into champagne  
You even remembered his name  
  
Bachelorette, the braves you painted pink for bachelorettes  
You tried to show him that he can  
But you can never rush a man  
  
You must remember  
You're a car girl  
You're a star girl  
You are at the door  
The tide will turn  
There's a window  
  
Bachelorette the things you do girls  
To your bachelorettes...  
You thought that...  
  
You must remember  
You're a car girl  
You're a star girl  
You are at the door  
The tide will turn  
There's a window  
  
Bachelorette, you fly alone now and you cry sometimes  
There's nothing like it in the world  
You'll go to Paris on your own  
Just bachelorette you climb on rooftops and you bachelorette  
You can turn dust into champagne  
You even yidiedididi...

Barons of suburbia take another piece of my good graces  
I'm in my war you're in yours  
Do we fight for peace as they take another piece of us  
But baby I would let your darkness invade me  
You could maybe turn this white light into navy  
Before you leave  
  
It was a slight miscalculation that my friends  
My friends would be waiting on the other side of the bridge  
On the other side of this  
This mole hill of a mountain  
This potion now a poison  
They're on the other side of right  
We're on the other side of her midnight  
  
When it's all said and done we will lose a piece  
To a carnivorous vegetarian  
Barons of suburbia I have heard you pray  
Before you devour her  
So baby will you let my darkness invade you  
You always liked your wafer sweet in the middle  
Before you leave  
  
It was a slight miscalculation that our friends  
Our friends would be waiting on the other side of the bridge  
On the other side of this  
This mole hill of a mountain  
This potion now a poison  
They're on the other side of right  
We're on the other side of her midnight  
  
I am piecing a potion  
To combat your poison  
  
She is risen  
She is risen  
Boys  
I said she is risen

Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
No one had more  
  
Sharper consonants than you, love  
And my vowels, well, were trusted  
  
First comes the Birch  
Rowan followed by the Ash  
Then through the Alder she forms  
And merges with Willow  
  
The Hawthorne blossoms  
As the Oak guards the door  
She is the hinge on which the year swings  
He courts the lightning flash and her  
  
Summoning the spirits  
Through incantations  
You said the Thunder God seems to have  
And our enemies are the Reed  
But we knew the Furies held the Holly sacred  
  
We were insulated  
In a circle of words we'd drawn  
With wisdom sent from nine Hazels  
A Rowan fire and a Willow rod  
  
At ten comes the vine  
That generates bramble wine  
The constant change of the night sun  
A song in the blood of the white bull  
  
Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
No one had more  
  
Sharper consonants than you, love  
And my vowels, well, were trusted  
  
From Ivy leaves is an ale that can unveil  
The hidden meanings and serpents  
Only revealed through visions  
Yes vowels could insert  
"A" was for the Silver Fir  
  
The Firs of course  
Then came next  
With Heather at her most  
Passionate  
  
The White Poplar's gift to the souls of the dead  
A promise that it was not the end  
But for the vine the "U", its coffer  
  
Vowels and consonants  
The power of trees  
The power they hold  
The power of prose  
  
So when the church  
Began to twist the old myths  
They built their own Tower of Babel  
From Ulster to Munster  
  
The Reed gave way then  
To the Elder  
The Earth turns her will  
So that night follows day  
  
From dawn to dawn  
From Winter to Winter  
At day the Ash had power over the Alder  
  
Our language of love  
The Battle of Trees  
We fought side by side  
Then he said to me:  
"I've dodged bullets and even poisoned arrows  
Only to be foiled by the blade of a vowel"

And through the life force and there goes her friend  
On her Nishiki it's out of time  
And through the portal they can make amends  
  
Hey would you say whatever we're blanket friends  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
  
And through the walls they made their mudpies  
I've got your mind I said  
She said I've your voice  
I said you don't need my voice girl  
You have your own  
But you never thought it was enough of  
So they went years and years  
Like sisters blanket girls  
Always there through that and this  
There's nothing we cannot ever fix I said  
  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
Bells and footfalls and soldiers and dolls  
Brothers and lovers she and I were  
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes  
There's nothing I can do  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
  
And now I speak to you are you in there  
You have her face and her eyes  
But you are not her  
And we go at each other like blank ettes  
Who can't find their thread and their bare  
  
Can't stop loving  
Can't stop what is on its way  
And I see it coming  
And it's on its way

Ride on, ride on friends of the black swan  
Ride on, ride on do you know where she's gone  
Gumdrops and Saturdays did Eric call by the way  
He knew, he knew, and he knew where the pillow goes  
  
Ride on, ride on friends of the black swan  
Ride on, ride on do you know where she's gone  
Buttercups and fishing flies the biggest thickest ever sky  
I know they know something  
I know  
  
Ride on, ride on now friends of the black swan  
Ride on, ride on you know where she's gone  
  
Little green men do O.K.  
It's the fairies' revenge they say  
And gumdrops and Saturdays did Eric call by the way  
  
Ride on, ride on, ride on

Father I killed my monkey  
I let it out  
To taste the sweet of spring  
Wonder if I will wander out  
Test my tether to  
See if I'm still free  
From you  
Steady as it comes  
Right down  
To you  
I've said it all  
So maybe we're a bliss  
Of another kind  
Lately, I'm in to circuitry  
What it means to be  
Made of you but not enough of you  
And I wonder if  
You can bilocate is that what I taste  
Your supernova juice  
You know it's true I'm part of you  
Steady as it comes  
Right down to you  
I've said it all  
So maybe you're a four horse engine  
With a power drive  
A hot kachina who wants into mine  
Take it with your terracide  
We're a bliss  
Of another kind

These devils of yours they need love

Stinky soul get a little lost in my own  
Hey General, need a little love in that hole of yours  
One ways, now, and Saturdays and our kittens all wrapped in cement  
From cradle to gundrops  
Got me running girl fast as I can  
And is it right Butterfly they like you better framed and dried  
  
Daddy dear if I can kill one man why not two  
Well, nurses smile when you got iron veins  
You can't stain their pretty shoes and pom poms and cherry blondes  
And their kittens still wrapped in cement  
From God's saviors to gundrops  
Got me running girl as fast as I can  
And is it right Butterfly they like you better framed and dried  
  
Got a pretty pretty garden pretty garden yes  
Got me a pretty pretty garden a pretty garden yes  
Got me a pretty pretty garden a pretty garden

That are captured  
  
Maybe he and I are like a pair of suns  
That are captured  
  
Eternally linked into chasing  
Each other's spin  
  
Eternally linked into chasing  
Each other's spin  
Bound by beliefs  
  
That have become steel cords  
  
Why the disharmony?

With a harmonic defiance I'll face this

Call all that lies  
  
Beneath both stories

carbon made found her at the  
End of a chain "time to race"  
She said "race the downhill"  
Behind crystalline irises  
Loons can drive  
Where the world bleeds white  
Just keep your eyes on her  
Keep  
Don't look away  
Keep your eyes on her horizon  
Bear claw free fall  
A gunner's view black and blue  
Shred in ribbons of lithium  
Blow by blow  
Her mind cut in sheets  
Layers deep now unravelling  
Just keep your eyes on her.  
Get me Neil on the line  
No I can't hold  
Have him read "snow glass apples"  
Where nothing is what it seems  
"Little sis you must crack this"  
He says to me  
"you must go in again carbon  
Made only wants to be unmade"  
Blade to ice it's  
Double diamond time  
And keep your eyes on her  
On her eyes on her horizon

I sing to the sun in the sky  
I sing to the sun raised high  
  
Carnival dancer, magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart  
I'll sing while he raises guitar  
I'll sing as the night wakes the dawn  
Will love come my way on this magical day?  
And will hope stay in my heart?  
  
Carnival dancer, magical time of youth  
And as the day draws nigh  
Dreams fill my heart and  
Sing while he raises guitar  
I'll sing my dream from afar  
Will love come my way on this magical day?  
And will hope stay in my heart?  
Will true love come my way on this magical day?  
Overlook, oh my love  
In my  
  
Stay (oh, dear)  
Stay (oh, dear)  
Stay  
In my  
You  
You  
(stay again)  
The way you're walking and walk, the way you can  
The way you're telling me you're not a danger  
This man, I said again, I say again  
I'm not too kind [to the] moon  
Telling me, well I watch you  
Kin to you  
You

Love, hold my hand  
Help me see with the dawn  
That those that have left  
Are not gone  
  
But they carry on  
As stars looking down  
As nature's sons  
And daughters of the heavens  
  
You will not ever be forgotten by me  
In the procession of the mighty stars  
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
  
Forever  
You have touched my life  
So that now  
Cathedrals of sound are singing, are singing  
  
The waves have come to walk with you  
To where you will live in the land of you,  
Land of you  
You will not ever be forgotten by me  
  
In the procession of the mighty stars  
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
Here I will carry, carry, carry you  
  
Forever.

If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Restring my wires why'know  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
I swear it seems of late boy  
I've even curved this body to fit your bow  
  
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come  
Come in rhythm  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
  
"Yeah that whip has skirt"  
You said it proud  
Sometimes I'd watch her idle while you'd tune her up  
Me with my silencer on  
You and your crocodile clip  
Me and my alligator pears yeah  
All tricked out for the trip  
That slid into a spin  
  
You say that "I miss you"  
You stop in at my drive-through  
You know who you'll order some some boy  
  
Cause it never was the cars and guitars that came between us  
Still a thought says what if I  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
Keep on drivin'  
  
If I choke boy  
You start me up again  
Resting my wires why'know  
This gearbox can make the shift polish my rims

Caught a lite sneeze caught a lite breeze  
Caught a lightweight lightningseed  
Boys on my left side  
Boys on my right side  
Boys in the middle  
And you're not here I need a big loan  
From the girl zone  
  
Building  
Tumbling down  
Didn't know our love was so small  
Couldn't stand at all  
Mr St. John just bring your son  
  
The spire is hot  
And my cells can't feed  
And you still got that Belle dragging your foots  
I'm hiding it well Sister Ernestine  
But I still got that Belle  
Dragging my foots  
  
Right on time you get closer  
And closer  
Called my name but there's no way in  
Use that fame  
Rent your wife and kids today  
Maybe she will  
Maybe she will caught a lite sneeze  
Dreamed a little dream  
Made my own pretty hate machine  
Boys on my left side  
Boys on my right side  
Boys in the middle and you're not here  
Boys in their dresses  
And you're not here  
I need a big loan from the girl zone

China all the way to new york  
I can feel the distance getting close  
You're right next to me  
But I need an airplane  
I can feel the distance as you breathe  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
In your eyes I saw a future together  
You just look away in the distance  
  
China decorates our table  
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show  
Pour the wine dear  
You say we'll take a holiday  
But we never can agree on where to go  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
In your eyes I saw a future together  
You just look away in the distance  
  
China all the way to New York  
Maybe you got lost in Mexico  
You're right next to me  
I think that you can hear me  
Funny how the distance learns to grow  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
I can feel the distance  
I can feel the distance  
I can feel the distance getting close

Someone's knockin on my kitchen door  
Leave the wood outside  
What all the girls here are freezing cold  
Leave me with your Borneo  
I don't need much to keep me warm  
  
Don't stop now what you're doing  
What you're doing my ugly one  
Bring them all here  
Hard to hide a hundred girls in your hair  
It won't be fair if I hate her  
If I ate her  
You can go now  
  
You're already in there  
I'll be wearing your tattoo  
You're already in there  
  
Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue  
He goes then it goes  
And kiss the violets as they're waking up  
  
Leave me with your Borneo  
Leave me the way I was before  
  
You're already in there  
I'll be wearing your tatoo  
I'm already in circles and circles and circles again  
The girl's in circles and circles got to stop spinning  
Circles and circles and circles again  
Thought I was over the bridge now

Maybe I didn't like to hear  
But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead  
So then I thought I'd make some plans  
But fire thought she'd really rather be water instead  
  
And Peggy got a message for me  
From Jesus  
And I've heard every word that you have said  
And I know I have been driven like the snow  
  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
  
But do I hate what she is  
But do I want to be her  
And don't we love something fresh  
Anything new, virgin  
  
Woman you got too many brambles  
Hiding under these bushes  
Woman you got too many brambles  
But I always liked a good storm  
I'm always good for a storm  
  
So then love walked up to like  
And said I know that you don't like me much  
Let's go for a ride  
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree  
  
And is your place in heaven  
Worth giving up these kisses  
These, these kisses  
  
And Peggy got a message for me  
From Jesus  
And I've heard every word that you have said  
And I know I have been driven like the snow, but  
  
This is cooling  
Faster than I can  
Hey yes, faster than I can  
Hey, this is cooling  
This is cooling

So don't give me respect  
Don't give me a piece of your preciousness  
Flaunt all she's got in our old neighbourhood  
I'm sure she'll make a few friends  
Even the rain bows down  
Let us pray as you cock cock cock your mane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you  
I can be cruel  
I don't know why  
Why can't my ba.ll.oo.n stay up  
In a perfectly windy sky  
I can be cruel I don't know why  
  
Dance with the Sufi's  
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain  
Lover brother bogenvilla my vine twists around your need  
Even the rain is sharp  
Like today as you sh-sh-shock me sane  
No cigarettes only peeled Havanas for you

Don't make me come to Vegas  
Don't make me pull you out of his bed  
I am vigilant that it will not be  
You on the menu he's serving up for his friends  
Don't make me come to Vegas  
Don't make me pull him out of your head  
Athena will attest  
That it could be done  
And it has been done  
And I think that I am up to it  
And the jacaranda tree  
Is telling me of the trouble you're in  
Just by the way  
She bends remember dancing and wondering  
As you were swaying  
What kind of woman you'd be  
"What will be will be" over my dead body  
Slip through your hand again and again  
Slip through your hand again and again  
My old flame was a jester and a joker  
And as healer of men, they called him the prince  
Prince of black jacks and of women  
And of anything that's slipped into his hands  
"And the ranches and the mustangs"  
And the way you said "you can have all this, except for me--  
You see lady luck is my mistress  
And you'll have to play second to her wish"  
And the jacaranda tree  
Is telling me it's not over yet,  
Just by the way  
She bends "if you come breezin' through"  
You said "I'll know that it's you by the taste on my lips,  
Bet on the deserts kiss"  
I could slip through your net  
"Over my dead body" slip through your hand  
Don't make me come to vegas  
Hmmm

Had me a trick and a kick and your message  
Well you'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole  
Then thought that I could decipher your message  
There's no one here dear  
No one at all  
  
And if I'm wasting all your time  
This time  
Maybe you never learned to take  
And if I'm hanging on to your shade  
I guess I'm way beyond the pale  
  
And southern men can grow gold  
Can grow pertty  
Blood can be pertty  
Like a delicate man  
Copper to steel to a hinge that is faltered  
That let's you in let's you in let's you in  
Something's just keeping you numb  
  
You told me last night  
You were a sun now with your very own  
  
Devoted satellite  
Happy for you  
And I am sure that I hate you  
Too sons too many too many able fires  
  
And if I'm wasting all your time  
This time  
I think you never learned to take  
And if I'm hanging on to your shade  
I guess I'm way beyond the pale

Father Lucifer  
You never looked so sane  
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain  
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid  
How's the Lizzies  
How's your Jesus Christ been hanging  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain  
He says I run and then I run from him  
And then I run  
He didn't see me watching  
From the aeroplane  
He wiped a tear  
And then he threw away our appleseed  
  
Nothing gonna stop me from floating  
  
Everyday's my wedding day  
Though baby's still in his comatose state  
I'll die my own Easter eggs  
Don't go yet  
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's but that's OK  
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave  
And girls that eat pizza but never gain weight  
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane

Fearlessness blew in with the wind  
Waking up to greet the sun  
We sailed on like the ancient ones  
Into the night underworld  
We knew dangers would come  
I had faith in both of us  
  
Listen to your heart  
(You can hear me)  
Listen to your heart  
(You can hear me)  
  
Day turned night when he questioned  
Why can't you balance the sky?  
Soulless storms have sent watchers  
With bladeless weapons to fight  
  
Teams of horses of the brine  
Followed his cries through the fire  
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind  
Did you listen?  
  
Listen to your heart  
(Can you hear me?)  
Listen to your heart  
(Can you hear me?)  
  
Fearlessness soon reminded me  
You must be stronger then they  
Cautioning there those who live  
To be cruel for the fun of it  
  
He let in a dark companion  
That orbited between us  
His siren friends convinced him that love  
Was no match against storms to come  
Their songs inflamed by doubt  
Fearlessness drowned them out  
  
Teams of horses of the brine  
Followed his cries through the fire  
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind  
Did you listen?  
  
Listen to your heart  
Can you hear me?  
Listen to your heart  
Can you hear me?  
  
Did we begin without knowing it?  
To find fault in every gift  
Then that was when the blame began  
What were once two forces joined  
In fearlessness

Shock, got the shock of my life  
Just buckle up girls, I'm stealin' the night  
From the still of the night  
What they're down to  
Let's see, in cold daylight  
  
I gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause she's all  
And I am low  
Watching you watching her play this game  
Yes, she's bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to your plain  
Her fire to your plain  
  
Pray  
You can pray to your Jane  
I put out the call  
But not to be saved  
Called my deviling kin  
With her yellow Aston Martin  
  
We gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause she's all  
And I am low  
Watching him watching her play this game  
Yes, she's bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to his plain  
  
She said, "get in"  
And set the SatNav to hell  
Or would it be a purgatory?  
  
I gotta get this right  
I gotta get this right  
  
Cause she's all  
And I am low  
Watching you watching her play this game  
Yes, she's bold  
Bold enough  
To set fire to your plain  
Her fire to your plain  
  
Her fire...  
Bold enough...  
Her fire to your plain

[Verse 1]  
Flicker, yes flicker  
There it is, a little less faint  
A little more of your flame  
Feel it warm your skin  
Part of you trapped within  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this  
Underneath the scarring from his defiling  
Underneath the pain  
[Chorus]  
Heroines  
They are not born, they are made  
A phoenix forms, her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satan's spell  
Fire purifies  
It's redemption time  
  
[Verse 2]  
Flicker, yes, flicker  
When neighbours and friends  
Only give you their burning silence  
Even with torches raised  
Part of you can't feel safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this, please  
Shed a little light on this  
And on those who excuse this act of violence  
Choosing you to play  
  
[Chorus]  
Heroines  
They are not born, they are made  
A phoenix forms, her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satan's spell  
Fire purifies  
It's redemption time  
  
[Outro]  
Shed a little light on this  
Shed a little light on this

Hey kid, I got a ride for you  
They say your brain is a comic book tattoo  
And you'll never be anything  
What will you do with your life  
That's all you hear from noon till night  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out-a-sight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
Straight suits, they don't understand  
She tried, that one, with the alligator boots but the other side drew her in  
Heart falling fast when she left, even the Milky Way was dressed in black  
  
Take a trip on a rocket ship baby where the sea is the sky  
I know the guy who runs the place and he's out-a-sight  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
Flying Dutchman are you out there  
  
'Cause they can't see what you're born to be  
They can see me  
They can't be  
What they can't believe  
They can see what you see  
  
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world ah.  
Tie him up so he won't say a word  
They'll keep the boy spinning in their own little world  
So afraid he'll be what they never were

From in the shadow she calls  
And in the shadow she finds a way finds a way  
And in the shadow she crawls  
Clutching her faded photograph my image under her thumb  
Yes with a message for my heart  
Yes with a message for my heart  
  
She's been everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
  
And in the doorway they stay  
And laugh as violins fill with water  
Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away  
We'll I'm not seventeen but I've cuts on my knees  
Falling down as the winter takes one more cherry tree  
  
She's been everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Rushin' rivers thread so thin limitation  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own  
Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue and the drugstores too safe  
In their coats anda in their do's yeah  
Everyone else's girl maybe one day maybe one day one day one day  
She'll be her own  
Smother in our hearts a pillow to my dots  
  
And in the mist there she rides  
And castles are burning in my heart  
And as I twist I hold tight  
And I ride to work every morning wondering why  
"sit in the chair and be good now"  
And become all that they told you  
The white coats enter her room  
And I'm callin' my baby callin' my baby callin' my baby callin'  
Everybody else's girl maybe one day she'll be her own [Repeats]

From in the shadow she calls  
And in the shadow she finds a way finds a way  
And in the shadow she CRAWLS

I took a taxi form LA to Venus  
In 1985 I was electromagnetically sucked  
Back into a party going on that night  
It was the gory of the 80s with karma drawn up in lines  
And two Bugle Boy models saying "baby it's a freebie  
You sure look deprived." I had the  
Story of O in my bucket seat  
Of my want to be mustang  
Auditioning for reptiles in their  
Raquel Welsh campaign  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
"I'm not afraid to die" I said  
I don't find that remotely funny, even  
On this space cake high  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Silicone party babies to the left  
And Joan of Arcs to the right  
No one feeling insecure  
We were all gorge and famous in our last lives  
In the glories of the 80's you said  
"the end is nothing to fear" I said  
Blow the end  
Now baby who do I gotta shag to get outta here  
And then when it all seemed clear  
Just then you go and disappear  
Sure you're out there orbiting around  
Wish I had you back now  
I met a drag king called venus  
She had a velvet hologram she said  
"My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am"  
In the glories of the 80's  
I may not have to die  
I'll clone myself like that blonde chick  
That sings Bette Davis eyes and then  
When it all seemed to clear  
Just then  
You go and disappear

God sometimes you just don't come through  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
Do you need a woman to look after you  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
  
You make pretty daisies pretty daisies love  
I gotta find what you're doing about things here  
A few witches burning gets a little toasty here  
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows  
Tell me you're crazy maybe then I'll understand  
You got your nine iron in the back seat just in case  
Heard you've gone south well babe you love your new four wheel  
I gotta find why you always go when the wind blows  
  
(Give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings)  
  
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall  
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky  
  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
God sometimes you just don't come through  
Do you need a woman to look after you  
God sometimes you just don't come through

John Lennon was shot here, at the entrance to the Dakota building.  
Lennon was shot four times with a 38 caliber gun,  
In what seems to be a totally senseless killing.  
  
[DR. EDISON AMOS]  
The second amendment gives the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  
This is a dispute which is going on in America now.  
We should work diligently to keep this second amendment in place,  
For any individual with responsibility-  
Let me repeat again, responsibility and boundaries of those who are
priviledged,  
To be a part of all of these twenty-seven amendments,  
Of the Constitution of the United States of America,  
Plus the Declaration of Independence.  
  
[GEORGE W. BUSH]  
I believe that uh, people who are gonna commit crimes shouldn't have guns.  
  
[GEORGE BUSH, SR.]  
I guess my reaction is the same as every other father's, every other
grandfather's.  
My heart goes out to the people- to the victims.  
Because I don't understand how kids can be out there, they're out making
bombs,  
And, and uh, and uh, families being totally unaware of it-  
With this culture going on. And I'm as troubled by it as anybody else,  
And I don't know any answers.

She's not a girl who misses much.  
(DR. EDISON AMOS: In these ten bill of rights,  
Each one gives the people a special right.)  
She's not a girl who misses much.  
(DR. EDISON AMOS: This second one is a right to bear arms.)  
Ah. She's well acquainted with the touch,

In my head I found you there  
And running around and following me  
But you don't dare  
But I find that I have, now, more  
Than I ever wanted to  
  
So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasn't born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to when she has left  
You there you are, here in my head and  
Running around and calling me "come back  
I'll show you the roses that brush off the snow and  
Open their petals again and again" and you know that  
Apple green ice cream can melt in your hands I can't so I  
  
Held your hand at the fair and  
Even forgot what time it was  
And even Thomas Jefferson wasn't born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe I'm just the horizon you run to  
When she has left you and me here alone on the floor  
You're counting my feathers as the bells toll  
You see the bow and belt and the girl from the south all  
Favorites of mine you know then all well  
And spring brings fresh little puddles that makes it all clear makes it all  
Do you know what this is doing to me  
Here in my head.

No one's picking up the phone  
Guess it's me and me  
And this little masochist  
She's ready to confess  
All the things that I never thought  
That she could feel and  
  
Hey Jupiter  
Nothing's been the same  
So are you gay  
Are you blue  
Thought we both could use a friend  
To run to  
And I thought you'd see with me  
You wouldn't have to be something new  
  
Sometimes I breathe you in  
And I know you know  
And sometimes you take a swim  
Found your writing on my wall  
If my heart's soaking wet  
Boy your boots can leave a mess  
  
Hey Jupiter  
Nothings been the same  
So are you gay  
Are you blue  
Thought we both could use a friend  
To run to  
And I thought I wouldn't have to keep  
With you  
Hiding  
  
Thought I knew myself so well  
All the dolls I had  
Took my leather off the shelf  
Your apocalypse was fab  
For a girl who couldn't choose between  
The shower or the bath  
  
And I thought I wouldn't have to be  
With you  
A magazine  
  
No one's picking up the phone  
Guess it's clear he's gone  
And this little masochist  
Is lifting up her dress  
Guess I thought I could never feel  
The things I feel  
Hey Jupiter

Hoochie Woman  
Hoochie Woman  
  
I wasn't thinking  
My head was in the book  
His hands were on her everywhere  
I saw his face I dropped my coffee  
He's cheating on me with a Hoochie Woman  
  
Ooo hoo hoo you can  
Keep your Hoochie  
Ooo hoo hoo  
And the bank accounts  
Cause boy I bring home the Bacon  
I said boys I bring home the Bacon now  
  
I went to work and the office girls  
Were all burning their poetry  
It wasn't good  
But in the neighborhood  
Now they're all just a  
Hoochie Woman  
  
He called me up  
And said "she has needs"  
I said "you'll find 'em  
On Barney's fourth floor"  
He said "I need a loan"  
(I said) "that's not a problem  
You better keep this from you  
Hoochie Woman"

Buzz Lightyear Sat on the Window  
Buzz Lightyear Had a Great Fall  
Sid Phillips and Scud the Dog  
Could Not Buzz Together Anymore  
  
Humpty Dumpty and Betty Louise  
Stole a Sony and some Camembert cheese  
And she said "Humpty baby  
Take me to the river  
Cause I like the way it runs  
Take me to the river  
You know I like the way it runs"  
  
He said "ah, ooh, everything's going my way"  
He said "maybe it's my lucky day"  
I said "anything you want I can give"  
She said "I want to take your picture, mm, just for me"  
He said "anything"  
She said "up there baby get on the wall babe"  
  
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall  
And looked at her as he was falling and  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put Humpty together again  
  
Hey Betty Louise Betty Louise  
She said "I like custard in the summer, honey"  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be

Aww... aww... aww... aww...  
The silicon chip inside her head gets switched to overload.  
And nobody's gonna go to school today,  
She's going to make them stay at home.  
And daddy doesn't understand her, he always said she was good as gold.  
And he can see no reason, 'cause there are no reasons,  
What reason do you need to be sho-wn...  
  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I want to sho... ot the whole day down, down, down,  
Shoot it all down, hi-yea, hey-yam.  
  
And the playing stopped in the playground now,  
She wants to play with her toys a while.  
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning,  
The lesson today is how to die.  
And then the bullhorn cackles and the captain tackles,  
With the problems and the "how's" and "why's."  
And he can see no reason, 'cause there are no reasons,  
What reason do you need to die, die, oh-oho  
  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
Tell me why, I don't like Mondays.  
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays.  
Ooh-mmm, I don't like Mondays, no.  
I want to to sho... ot the whole day n-down,  
Whole day, whole day, the whole day down.

I was a fool to say the things I said  
I just lost my head  
Made you cry, made you go  
I didn't mean to be so cold  
I had no right mistreating you that way  
And oh, how could I know the price I'd pay  
Sorry I ever caused you pain  
Sorry I, sorry I said those hurtful things  
But baby, all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just give me one more try)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just stop this hurt inside)  
I gotta get back with you  
I been walking down these cold and lonely streets  
I been losing sleep  
Had to prove I was strong  
But every night, every night just proved me wrong  
Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand  
And oh, just let it slip away like sand  
Oh, gimme one chance to make it right  
One more chance, one more chance back in your light  
'Cause baby, all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
(Hold me just like before)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Taking me somewhere warm)  
I gotta get back with you  
Baby, I'd give my soul  
Just to hold one more time  
Just to look in your eyes  
'Cause right now I'm half alive  
No matter what I do  
There's no living without you  
Can't you see, baby  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just give me one more try)  
I wanna get back with you  
(Just stop this hurt inside)  
I gotta get back with you  
(Hold me just like before)  
(Taking me somewhere warm)  
I wanna get back with you, babe  
I wanna get back with you, baby  
I wanna get back!  
I gotta get back with you!  
Oh, take me back!  
  
  

Hey little girl is your daddy home  
Did he go away and leave you all alone  
I got a bad desire  
I'm on fire  
  
Tell me now baby is he good to you  
Can he do to you the things that I do  
I can take you higher  
I'm on fire  
  
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby  
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley  
through the middle of my soul  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
and a freight train running through the  
middle of my head  
Only you can cool my desire  
I'm on fire

Can you patch my jeans Peggy Ann -  
Just a little stitch to mend the hole  
He has torn  
If you can  
  
Maybe I got too set in my ways  
He says she reminds him of me  
When we first met  
In those early days...  
  
The sexiest thing is trust  
I wake up to find  
The pirates have come  
Typing up along your coast  
How was I to know  
The pirates have come  
Between Rebecca's  
Beneath your firmaments  
I have worshiped  
In the Jamaica Inn  
In the Jamaica Inn  
  
With the gales  
My little boat was tossed  
How was I to know  
That you'd sent her  
With a lantern  
To bring me in  
  
"Are you positive this is a friend?"  
The captain grimaced,  
"Those are cliffs of rock ahead  
If I'm not mistaken."

Dropped off the edge again down in Juarez  
"don't even bat an eye  
If the eagle cries" the rasta man says, just cause the desert likes  
Young girls flesh and  
No angel came.  
  
I don't think you even know  
What you think you just said  
So go on spill your seed  
Shake your gun to the rasta man's head  
And the desert - she must be blessed and  
No angel came.  
  
There's a time to keep it up  
A time to keep it in  
The Indian is told  
The cowboy is his friend  
You know that I can breathe  
Even when I cheat  
Should. should've been over for me  
No angel came.

Look I'm standing naked before you  
Don't you want more than my sex  
I can scream as loud as your last one  
But I can't claim innocence  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isn't forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather  
  
I could just pretend that you love me  
The night would lose all sense of fear  
But why do I need you to love me  
When you can't hold what I hold dear  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isn't forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather  
  
I almost ran over an angel  
He had a nice big fat cigar  
"In a sense" he said "you're alone here  
So if you jump you best jump far"  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isn't forever  
And its not the weather  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God its all very clear  
If love isn't forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather

Surrender then start your engines  
You'll know quite soon what my mistake was  
For those on horseback or dog sled  
You turn on at the bend in the road  
I hear she still grants forgiveness  
Although I willingly forgot her  
The offering is molasses and you say  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
So I guess I can't take it personally  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
I'm liquid running  
  
There's a sea secret in me  
It's plain to see it is rising  
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know she's playing poker with the rest of the stragglers  
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world  
I know she's playing poker with the rest the rest  
And if your friends don't come back to you  
And you know this is madness  
A lilac mess in your prom dress  
And you say  
  
I guess I'm an underwater thing  
  
I go I go inside her shell  
I see it so and you're doing oh so well these days  
You do it again and I say it's coming back again  
Something like the saturdays such was it  
Can you bring me those jeans  
Keep it back daddy's done preaching in to himself  
Keep it just between us  
It's liquid  
Liquid  
Liquid

Little Amsterdam  
In a southern town  
Hominy get it on the plate girl  
Momma keep your head down  
Momma it wasn't my bullet  
  
Don't take me back to the Range  
I'm just comin out of the cell in my brain  
Girl you got to know there days  
Which side your own  
  
Momma got shit  
She loved a brown man  
Then she built a bridge in the Sheriff's bed  
She'd do anything to save her man  
You see her olives are cold pressed  
And her best friend is a sun dress  
But Momma  
It wasn't my bullet  
  
Round and a round and a round I go  
Round and a round this time for keeps  
Father only you can save my soul  
And playing that organ must count  
For something  
Girl you got to know these days  
Which side your on  
Little Amsterdam  
Shut down today  
They buried her with a  
Butter bean bouquet  
And the Sheriff now can't ride away  
Like he said into the sunset  
And I won't say  
He shouldna paid  
But Momma  
It wasn't my bullet

Yellow bird flying gets shot in the wing  
Good year for hunters and Christmas parties  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate elevator music  
The way we fight  
The way I'm left here silent  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
We danced in graveyards with vampires till dawn  
We laughed in the faces of king never afraid to burn  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate disintegration  
Watching us wither  
Black winged roses that safely changed their color  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you  
  
Give me life  
Give me pain  
Give me myself again  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces

Hey you gender nectar sifting  
Through the grain of gold tripping at  
Your door is that you. alpha in her blood  
And when the woman lies you don't  
Believe her  
  
Rolling and unrolling  
Coiling emerging  
Running free  
Running through the underworld  
Into your room  
  
Is he real or a ghost-lie  
She feels she isn't heard  
And the veil tears and rages  
Till her voices are remembered  
And his secrets can be told  
Hey you gender nectar  
Crystalline from the vine  
You know you'll drink her  
  
Rolling and unrolling  
Coiling emerging running free  
Running through the afterworld  
Into your room so she prays  
For a prankster and lust  
In the marriage bed  
And he waits till she can give  
And he waits and he  
Waits

Tuna  
Rubber  
A little blubber in my igloo  
And I knew you pigtails and all  
Girls when they fall  
And they said Marianne killed herself  
And I said not a chance  
Don't you love girls ladies babes  
Old bags who say she was so pretty why  
Why why why did she crawl down in the old  
Deep ravine  
  
C'mon pigtails girls and all those sailors  
Get your bags and hold down won't you just  
Hold down cause Ed is watching my every sound  
I said  
They're watching my every sound  
  
The weasal sqeuaks faster then a seven day week  
I said Timmy and that purple Monkey  
Are all down  
  
At Bobby's house  
Making themselves persters and lesters and jesters and my  
Traitors of kind  
And I'm just having thoughts of Marianne  
She could outrun the fastest slug  
She could  
Marianne  
Quickest girl in the frying pan

Take a walk down memory lane with me  
Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need  
On Martha's foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said-  
The part about that  
"Love taking over your life"  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
"Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you"  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done  
  
"Memories that we have yet" you said  
"To make like our Burning Bed..."  
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe  
On Martha's foolish ginger.

Then "Mom I want to forna  
I mean formulate and discover the realms of the unknown  
With Mary Jane  
After all you'll be away for the week-end  
Just please consent  
I need a friend."I admit you puberty was somewhat strange  
Could this be fixed with Mary Jane?  
  
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Mary Jane who?  
  
So I said, son you want to permeate  
And discover the realms of the unknown  
With Mary Jane  
After all the other boys that are you age  
They only wake to medicate  
Do I know her family?  
Is she even mannerly when she's out in society?  
"She even bakes"  
She even bakes?  
"These odd brownies"  
  
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Mary Jane who?  
  
Then he said, I believe in her family,  
On her maternal side there was a  
Dr Tetrahydrocannabinol Pure Isomer Dronabinol  
Mary Jane Who

Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know it's your day in the sun  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone  
  
"Relax love" he said before he left  
"Take those hands away from your eyes  
From where I stand you're in my sky"  
  
You must go must flee  
For they will hunt you down  
You and your unborn seed  
In all of Gaul is there safety?  
  
Les Saint Marie de la Mer  
You will dance the ring  
Marys of the Sea  
The lost bride weeps  
Les Saint Marie de la Mer  
We will dance your ring  
  
Hey there's a new Jerusalem  
Hey you built on rock that's on sand  
For now you have hijacked the son  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone  
  
I hear a voice and it says  
"The red of the red rose is its own  
And something no man can divide"  
So St. Jermaine hear the prayer of this supplicant  
For two scarlet women, Black Madonna  
Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know it's your day in the sun  
I know it's your day in the sun  
Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know it's your day in the sun  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone

Hey Mrs. C, please don't jump why not?  
Nothing is making sense anymore to me  
I don't know when I stopped making him smile  
Now the kids see me crying all the time  
  
From one mother to the other  
They'll never get over this for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So let's be strong for you and  
Me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
I'm feeling so (mad dear)  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
As mothers we have our troubles  
You'll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So let's be strong you and me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
I'm feeling so (mad dear)  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
Until then there will be starlight shining down  
For every tear and every child

Go to bed

The priests are dead  
And come sing it all again  
Go to bed  
Past the apple orchard  
And you'll feel nice  
  
Two can play  
I said, two can play

Out of the nest it's time  
Go go go now  
Circus girl without a safety net

Pantyhose running in the cold

I walked into your dream  
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream  
You are the clever one aren't you  
Brides in veils for you  
We told you all of our secrets  
All but one  
And don't you even try  
The phone has been disconnected  
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice  
Poison me against the moon

Just in just in case I like the dancing I can remember where I come from  
  
I escape into your escape into our very favorite fearscape  
It's across the sky and across my heart and I cross my legs oh my God  
First my left foot then my right behind the other  
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow

Lucky me  
I guessed the kind of man  
That you would turn out to be  
Now I wish that I'd been wrong and then  
I could remember to breathe  
And all along the watchtower  
The night horses and the black mares  
Ready themselves for the outcome  
For the strange times upon us  
  
But what you didn't count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution  
But what you didn't count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution  
You could've have me  
You could've have me  
You could've have me  
Right there beside you  
You could've have me boy  
You could've have me yeah  
You could've have me  
Right there beside you  
  
A wife on loan in a cafe  
In old El Paso  
Next I go to  
Seven Gates and my sister's Bass Bonanza  
And all along her watchtower  
The night horses and the black mares  
Steady themselves for the outcome  
For the strange days upon us  
  
What you didn't count on  
Was another mother of  
A mother revolution

Hello Mr. Zebra  
Can I have your sweater  
Cause it's cold cold cold  
In my hole hole hole  
Ratatouille strychnine  
Sometimes she's a friend of mine  
With a gigantic whirlpool  
That will blow your mind  
  
Hello Mr. Zebra  
Ran into some confusion  
With a Mrs. Crocodile  
Furry mussels marching on  
She thinks she's Kaiser Wilhelm  
Or a civilized syllabub  
To blow your mind  
  
Figure it out  
She's a goodtime fella  
She's got a little fund to fight  
For Moneypenny's rights  
Figure it out  
She's a goodtime fella  
Too bad the burial was premature  
She said and smiled

Life lines and suicide crimes --  
He found me in a state  
Grabbed my purse and hitched a ride  
With a Mrs. Jesus "how you been"  
I've been cruisin' a good invention  
But in some ways  
I don't think it gets any easier  
Your walking on the water  
Bit by far my favorite one,  
But now it seems we're drowning  
In a drop of water love  
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs  
I know there's heaven there  
And then empty arms that comes  
With the morning star  
Well, made my bed of  
Cut roses by understanding  
That the cause  
It just comes first  
With my Mrs. Jesus  
The gospel changes meaning  
If you follow John or Paul  
And could you ever let it be  
The Mary of it all  
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs  
Well, life lines and suicide crimes  
There's the something every day  
And there's someone always paging  
My Mrs. Jesus  
Your walking on the water  
So if you get the Jones at the crossroad  
The personals are great  
If you're my way  
Let me love you Mrs. Jesus

Muhammad my friend  
It's time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem  
And on that fateful day  
When she was crucified  
She wore Shiseido Red  
And we drank tea by her side  
  
Sweet sweet  
Used to be so sweet to me  
  
Muhammad my friend  
I'm getting very scared  
Teach me how to love  
My brothers who don't know the law  
And what about the deal  
On the flying trapeze  
Got a peanut butter hand  
But honey do drop in  
At the Dew Drop Inn  
  
Sweet sweet  
Between the boys and the bees  
  
Moses I know  
I know you've seen the fire  
But you've never seen fire  
Until you've seen Pele blow  
And I've never seen light  
But I sure have seen gold  
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine  
Till I get my own TV show  
Ashre ashre ashre ashre  
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave  
I got a place in the Pope's rubber robe  
  
Muhammad my friend  
It's time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem

Finally found a fella  
Almost completely divine  
But his vocabulary  
Is killing this romance of mine  
We get into an intimate situation  
And then begins this character's conversation  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
At a time like this  
He says, murder, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, solid, he says  
Takes me in his arms  
And says, solid, he says  
Meaning all my charms  
He says, solid, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, chick chick  
You torture me  
Zoom, are we livin?  
I'm thinkin' of leaving him flat  
He says, dig dig the jumps  
The old ticker is giving  
He can talk plainer than that  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
Keep it up like this  
He says, murder, he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobody's murder  
But his own  
He says, Jackson, he says  
And my name's Marie  
He says, Jackson, he says  
Shoot the snoot for me  
He says, Jackson, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, mmmhmm  
When he likes my hat  
He says, tsk tsk tsk  
What the heck is that?  
He says, woo hoo! he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says hep hep with helium  
Now babe, we're cookin'  
And other expression's too ill  
He says, we're in the groove  
And the groove is good lookin'  
Sounds like his uppers don't fit!  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
Keep it up like this  
In that, murder, he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobody's murder  
But his own

As the day gave way  
To Nautical Twilight  
I turned my back on  
The force of which I am made  
I am bound and gagged  
Rupturing a delicate balance  
When I left my world for his  
  
Day after day, as my city fades  
And is swallowed by his sea  
She is boundless  
Even breaking on the beach  
  
Every alchemist  
Knows fusion and fission  
Can unify or drive a force to split  
He has been possessed to drink of the spices  
From the east by his liquid mistress  
Which then pushed me into the lair of uranium  
She divides time between greed and his twin, tyranny  
  
Day after day cities are betrayed  
As the earthy sons lay their blades  
  
And she is boundless  
But by then she has been frayed  
As the night gives way  
To Nautical dawn I can see I must activate  
The force of which I am made

Some boy you are  
To take me by the hand  
Through an elevator  
Gotta a little red light  
That tells you, boy  
Where the razor's been  
  
You said, girl if you think  
You can turn that violator  
You'll finally be that woman, yes  
Finally be that woman  
That's been frozen in the pretty silver girl  
Yes  
  
And I've never seen blue  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
I said I've never seen eyes  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
Through me again  
Through me again  
  
Some boy you are  
To wear my color red  
To wear it very proudly  
And wear it like a lady  
Knows how to cross her legs  
Where the birdy's been  
  
I've never seen blue  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And though me again  
Said I've never seen eyes  
Like the blue she drives  
In and around  
And through me again  
Through me again  
Through me again  
  
Said now that I am  
Say goodbye to those left  
Say...

You, bastard fan  
You always speak badly about me  
Hoping in a new Pele  
Receiving just new Ireland  
You want the worst for me 'cause I know you say  
She makes good songs just when she's in pain  
Shame on you baby!  
You hope in my misfortunes  
And you think of what pain can makes me turn back to write good songs  
Sorry for the disappointment but in the family we are all good  
  
My father's well  
He's not dying today  
My mother's well  
She's not dying today  
My face is OK, so they say to me  
But don't worry 'cause it will not die today  
Maybe tomorrow somewhere  
  
Hi ears with feet  
Or I could say ears with six feet under  
You hope the beekeeper comes to take someone  
Shame on you  
I can do good songs if I'm happy too.such as goodbye pieces  
OK it's not a good example  
  
Mary Magdalene's alive and  
Not dying today  
Matt and john are OK  
They're not dying today  
Mac Aladdin is good too, I know you're sad about  
But he's not dying today  
Beenie lost her sunset but not dying today  
My career is on a thread but not dying today  
My face is OK, so they say to me  
But don't worry 'cause it will not die today

Man's got his woman  
To take his seed  
He's got the power mmmhmm  
She got the need  
Spends her life through  
Pleasing up her man  
She feeds him dinner  
Yeah, anything she can  
she cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women...  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
man make your hair gray  
He your life's mistake  
All you're really lookin' for  
Is an even break, 'cause  
he lies right at you  
You know you hate his game  
Slaps you once in a while  
And you live and love in pain  
she cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women mmmm...  
Only women bleed, you know  
Eehh, sweet..sweet mmmmmm....  
he lies right at you  
You know you hate this game  
Slaps you once in a while  
And you live and love in pain  
she cries alone at night too often  
She smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only womennmmmmm...  
Only women bleed  
Only womennmmmmm..mmmm..  
  

Operation Peter Pan Lyrics  
hola  
Rojo  
Morning to you  
You always helped me chase demons away  
Don't know what I'll do without you  
So Pan is the name of the plane  
second to the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
That's where I'll be waiting  
Second to the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
hola  
Tick-tock  
My time is up  
Pedro says  
I will forget him in days  
In my new life, no room for a lost boy  
Boys can be so dumb sometimes  
second to the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
That's where I'll be waiting  
Second to the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
Straight on 'til morning  
kiss Pedro for me
