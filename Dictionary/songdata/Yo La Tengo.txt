Well, it's 1 PM again  
I guess I'm ready to begin  
And it's reeling, there is a feeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
You don't have to show me how  
But I'm not ready to right now  
There is a feeling, and it's reeling  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
And if we don't leave today  
There's no hurry anyway  
I'm on the road here, safe at home here  
So let's make sure we're sure  
That it is reeling, and I'm pleading  
Let's not make any sudden moves  
  
  

I remember a summer's day  
I remember walking up to you  
I remember my face turned red  
And I remember staring at my feet  
I remember before we met  
I remember sitting next to you  
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking  
So we'll try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
We'll try and make it ours  
Cause we're on our way  
We're on our way to fall in love  
I remember your old guitar  
I remember I Can't Explain  
I remember the way it looked around your neck  
And I remember the day it broke  
I remember song you sang  
I remember the way you looked tonight  
And I remember the way it made me feel  
So we try and try  
Even if it lasts an hour  
With all our might  
We'll try and make it ours  
Because we're on our way  
We're on our way to fall in love  
  
  

The room was filled with talk  
For anyone listening  
I found a spot by the door  
With no one around  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune  
I kept a smile on my face  
For anyone looking  
Tried to turn away questions  
Before he asked  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune  
I was engrossed in the film  
Without really watching  
Said, "who's the guy with the gun?"  
As if I was involved  
Let my mind go  
Out of tune  
Out of tune  
  
  

You need someone to hide behind  
I don't mind, well I don't mind  
You need to be alone to unwind  
That's alright, that's alright  
  
Sure I know it's hard  
You know that it's that way for everyone  
for everyone  
Somethings go wrong  
They sink so low you even blame the sun  
Blame it at the ...  
Of the shadows on the wall  
They're not as bad as they appear  
Could it be that it's the season of the shark  
  
You need someone to help you through  
well, I don't know, I don't know  
Someone to take a chance for you  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
I want to be the one to make you fell okay right now  
Someway somehow  
When I fall short  
I sink so low I even blame the clouds  
Blocking out the sun  
And the shadows on the wall  
That is why you fell alone  
Could it be that it's the season of the shark  
  
Please don't be afraid  
No matter how much out there scares you so  
Scares you so  
Just look around  
If it's not me, then someone else you know  
You're not alone at all  
Ignore the shadows on the wall  
They don't mean a thing  
Could it be that it's the season  
I believe that it's the season of the shark  
Could it be that it's the seas

Scold me, that's all you've got to say  
Coldly, hurt me and turn away  
You say, "I'm not sorry yet" I'm resigned to what is next  
I head for the shadow  
Hold me taking it back through tears  
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears  
But I've got myself to protect. It's too soon for me to forget  
I'll wait in the shadows  
In the shadows  
Though I am alone  
They help me, see that I'm the only one in your heart  
So until I truly believe that your words convey what you mean  
I'll wait in the shadows (2x)  
I don't mind the shadows.

Speeding motorcycle  
Won't you change me  
In a world of funny changes  
Speeding motorcycle  
Won't you change me  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Always changing me  
Speeding motorcycle  
Don't you drive wrecklessly  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
  
Many girls have taken you out for a ride,  
Hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
Of my heart  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets be smart  
Because we don't want a wreck  
We can do a lot of tricks  
We don't have to break our legs  
To get our kicks  
Speeding motorcycle  
The road is ours  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets speed some more  
  
Because we don't need reason  
And we don't need logic  
Because we got feelin'  
And were damn proud of it  
  
Speeding motorcycle  
There's nothing you can do  
Speeding motorcycle  
I love you  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets just go  
Speeding motorcycle  
Lets go, lets go, lets go

Whatever you want from me, whatever you want I'll do  
Try to squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcube  
  
Try to be more assured, try to be more right there  
Try to be less uptight, try to be more aware  
Whatever you want from me, is what I want to do for you  
Sweeter than a drop of blood from a sugarcube  
  
And though I like to act the part of being tough  
I crumble like a sugarcube for you  
  
Whatever you want from me, whatever you want I'll do  
I will try

You tell me summer's here  
And the time is wrong  
You tell me winter's here and your days...  
Are getting long  
  
Tears are in your eyes... tonight  
You tell me that you haven't  
Slept in days  
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired...  
Anyway  
  
Tears are in your eyes... tonight  
Tears are in your eyes... every night  
  
Although you don't believe me you're strong  
Darkness always turns into the dawn  
And you won't even remember this for long...  
When it ends alright  
  
Please tell me how...you know tomorrow...staring at your shoes  
Tears are in your eyes...every night  
Tears are in your eyes...every night  
Tears are in your eyes...tonight

What did I miss here?  
What can't you take anymore?  
Expecting a whisper,  
I heard the slam of a door  
You say that all we ever do is fight  
Gee, I don't know that that's true.  
Then I wonder, am I right?  
Or is that part of our problem?  
Maybe I'm out of my mind.  
Maybe I'm blocking out the truth.  
But it seems like just a little thing,  
Like you don't want to listen,  
And I can't shut up.  
You don't have to smile at me.  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop,  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
You have the problem,  
It comes with our private jokes.  
When you're in a fury,  
Laughter gets stuck in my throat.  
Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble  
Cheering each other up sometimes,  
When one or the other of us is down.  
Instead it's like, when you're in a bad mood  
I look at you and I say, maybe she's knows something  
I don't know, maybe I should be upset.  
You don't have to smile at me  
We don't have to talk.  
All that I ask is you stop  
And remember, it isn't always this way.  
The way that I feel  
When you laugh  
Is like laughing.  
The way that I feel  
When you cry  
Is so bad.  
  
  

Well, I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
If I knew that you were waiting for me  
I used to have the notion I could swim the length of the ocean  
I'd plumb the depths of every sea for you  
I'd escape from my chains, and I'll reach out for you  
  
Maybe I'm in love with you  
Maybe, maybe I'm in love with you  
I had to contact you, found out I was in love with you  
I had to contact,  
  
That's it, that's the law, that's the whole of the law  
The whole of the law.

I followed you foolishly  
You were at a smoky bar, you were out til three  
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four  
We were gonna wait for you all night  
So I locked the door  
  
I was gonna spend the night, coulda been okay  
We were gonna talk all night, till I went away  
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late  
A minute later we're older now, I can't stay awake  
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet  
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday  
  
Saw my brother driving by, the other day  
I wished that I'd go out to him, but he drove away  
Saw my sister standing there, standing in rain  
Then I thought about nothing, that it feels the same  
  
Another day, come and gone  
Don't think I can ever sing that song  
Little secrets we bring along  
I'm taking my time, trailing behind, I thought of you  
Today is the day I think of you

Julie Christie, the rumors are true  
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued  
To the movie star and his sordid life  
Mr. X and his old-suffering wife  
  
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron  
In my room with the curtains drawn  
See her in the arms of Paul  
Say it, I can say no more  
  
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity  
Our hero finds his inner peace  
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm  
With a needle hanging out of its arm  
  
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen  
I know it's going away  
Gonna take its toll, gonna take its toll  
Gonna take my time  
  
And I'm thinking about the way things are  
And I'm thinking about the way things were  
Thinking about Eleanor Bron  
  
And I'm thinking about a lucky charm  
And I'm thinking about the needle  
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle  
And I'm thinking about...

Black on white  
The background chess  
You're racing time  
When are you coming to town?  
  
Before the fall  
Before the flood  
After the sinking feeling and the final cut  
What are you going to do?  
We're all waiting for you  
Loud bound train is always late  
We stay lost inside our day  
Impound train, engine blows  
Approaches home, never slows  
  
Loud bound train is flashing red  
We stay lost inside our head  
Impound train, engine blows  
Approaches home, never slows  
  
What are you going to do?  
We're all waiting for you
