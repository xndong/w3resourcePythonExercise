I've been romanced and dined and danced  
Crazy nights and wild times  
But life has lost it's mystery  
And love is blind, cannot find me  
I'm blowin' away -- and shadows take my love and leave  
I'm blowin' away -- these shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me  
I have cast aside my foolish pride  
I'm goin' down for the last time  
I have searched this earth and sailed these seas  
But love is blind, cannot find me  
I'm blowin' away -- and shadows take my love and leave  
I'm blowin' away -- these shadows keep takin' my love and leavin' me  
(Repeat last two lines)

When I was a girl, my favorite thing  
In the whole wide world  
Was to see a field and  
Run for no reason  
And off I'd go, no one behind  
Only earth below  
Just a patch of green, green as the season  
Don't ask why, your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that you're needin'  
  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
The sky is blue, blue for no reason  
Now that things have changed  
Everything's carefully prearranged  
Not a thing gets done  
Except for a reason  
Now I'm overrun, I'm startin' to feel  
Like a hired gun  
Where's the chance, where's the fun  
Where is the pleasin'?  
  
Try and try, you moan and sigh  
You just can't find a thing to believe in  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
The sky is blue, blue for no reason  
Don't ask why, your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that you're needin'  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
You're just blue, blue for no reason

Listen to my bluebird laugh  
She can't tell you why  
Deep within in her heart, you see  
She knows only crying  
Oh just lie  
  
There she sits, a lofty perch  
Strangest color blue  
Flying is forgotten, now  
Thinks only of you...just you...awh yeah  
  
So get all those blues  
Must be a thousand yous  
And you just differently used, you just know  
You sit there mesmerized, by the depth of her eyes  
If you could categorize, she got soul  
She got soul, she got soul, she got soul  
  
Do you think she loves you  
Do you think at all  
  
Soon she's going to fly away  
Sadness is her own  
Give herself a bath of tears  
And go home, and go home

Watch out, you might get what you're after  
Cool baby, you're strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary girl  
And I'm burnin' down the house  
  
Hold tight, wait till this party's over  
Hold tight, well we're gonna be in for some nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
And we're burnin' down the house  
  
Here's your ticket, pack your bags, it's time for goin' overboard  
Transportation is here  
Close enough but we're not too far, bet you're wonderin' where you are  
Fight fire with fire  
  
Burning down the house  
  
All wet, and you might need a raincoat  
Shake down, my dreams are walkin' in broad daylight  
365 degrees  
And we're burnin' down the house  
  
My house, out of the ordinary  
That's right, I don't want to really hurt nobody  
Some things sure sweep me off my feet  
And we're burnin' down the house

Come on so tough  
When you think you got a right  
Make love so rough  
Until I lose the will to fight  
You got that somethin', baby  
That turned my darkness in the light  
And I can't get enough of your love  
I never found a man  
Who took the time to see  
The woman that I am  
And not the one he hoped I'd be  
And I think we're onto somethin'  
And it's good enough for me  
I just can't get enough of your  
Come on so tough  
Baby, you know just how to please  
You got that stuff  
Brings this woman to her knees  
I think we're onto somethin'  
That is good enough for me  
I just can't get enough of your  
I just can't get enough of your  
And I just can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Just can't get it  
Can't get enough of your love  
Just can't get it  
Can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Well, I can't get enough of your love  

I want to feel my earth turn over, baby  
In this hardened winter ground  
Feel my earth turn over, darlin'  
Until' I'm rootless and unbound  
I want to feel my body tremble  
When there's no one else around  
Just this cool, clear water runnin'  
In this love that I've found  
Hey, baby  
See how it can be  
Every time you reveal yourself to me  
I'll come runnin'  
I want to feel myself go under, baby  
Where the deepest river bleeds  
I want to feel it pull me under, darlin'  
Until it drops me to my knees  
I want to know that I could find you  
When there's no more eyes to see  
In this cool, clear water runnin'  
You'll come runnin' to me  
Hey, baby  
All my life I have known there's something more  
Love to blind me like the sun  
Deep in dreams, I will wash upon your shore  
Now I know that you're the one  
And when I feel my baby callin'  
It's like a whisper in a sand  
When the softest rain is fallin', darlin'  
I will crumble in your hand  
And when all that's left is wonder  
And no need to understand  
Well, this cool, clear water runnin'  
Will be all that I am  
Hey, baby  
Will be all that I am  
All that I am  

My body is the only place  
Where we meet anymore  
Thought that I could handle the heartache  
Like I did before  
I remember your warning  
To never mention love  
A little crime of passion  
Is what I'm guilty of  
There were no witnesses  
Just the candlelight  
Glowin' as your sweetness awakened  
Every warm delight  
Show me some mercy  
What a fool I have become  
A little crime of passion  
That's what I'm sufferin' from  
Kisses ago it was so easy  
Dreams we shared together faded to forever  
And I just don't wear despair very well  
I can tell  
Now it's such a painful time  
And I'm too far gone  
Where are all the clever defenses  
I depended on?  
How could I be so crazy  
To believe all the things you say?  
A little crime of passion  
Is takin' my breath away  
Show me some mercy  
What a fool I've become  
A little crime of passion  
That's what I'm sufferin' from  
Baby, oh, just a little crime of passion  
What I'm sufferin' from  
What I'm sufferin' from  
What I'm sufferin' from  
Oh, just a little crime of passion  
Is what I'm sufferin' from  

I could say what I mean  
(or I could dance around it)  
It would feel good to scream  
(I should quiet down)  
I could be recognized  
(or I could stay in bed)  
Look the world in the eyes  
(or just hang my head)  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
  
When my ship has come in  
(when it runs aground)  
I'll be smiling again  
(turn those corners down)  
I've got something to say  
(no one's listening)  
It's my reckoning day  
(so where's the reckoning?)  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
  
My prodigy and my idiot play  
For the prize of my delicate line  
Somehow the score at the end of  
The day is still 51-49  
  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown  
Knowing I'll lose it if I look down  
I'm holding steady this crooked crown

Life isn't easy  
Love never lasts  
You just carry on  
And keep moving fast  
I turned off the highway  
Pulled into town  
I'm fancy free darlin'  
And I've travelled round  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes I'm down  
Tell me where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And howl like the wind  
So who shall I start with  
Tell me how to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And howl like the wind  
My thoughts are lost in memories  
That keep me free  
Know if all the stars were shining  
They would not help me see  
Don't you know that  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times down  
Where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
You cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
Well my life isn't easy  
And my love never seems to last  
So I'll keep on carrying on darlin'  
I'll just keep moving fast  
I turned off the highway  
Pulled into town  
And I'm still fancy free  
And I keep travellin' round  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times I'm down  
Where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
So who shall I start with  
Tell me how to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
Cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  

When you give more than you get, you're in danger (you're in danger)  
You may find that you're in love with a stranger (with a stranger)  
For who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men?  
It's vanity, insanity to play when you can't win  
When you find that you're losing, it's time to get on moving  
'Cause there's danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
  
It only takes one second, girl, to learn (to learn)  
That playing with fire will get you burned (get you burned)  
Now girl, don't you be foolish  
They say that love is blind, but it's clear as the highway sign  
That reads Danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
Heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Read the sign, girl, you'd better mind, girl  
Yeah, danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Once the lying starts, start packing up your heart  
Listen to me, girl  
When there's nothing to be gained, don't keep goin' on in vain  
'Cause there's danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
I said there's danger, I said there's danger

Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome  
I'd call you on the phone some  
But I don't have dime  
Darlin', you're so far behind me  
Tomorrow is gonna find me  
Further down the line  
Take a piece of paper  
A pencil in my hand  
I'm gonna write  
Darlin', I know I feel the cold nights  
Thinking of the old nights  
Spent alone with you  
Darlin', tears are in my eyes now  
Know that I should try now  
To make it back to you  
Darlin', I love you more than ever  
I wish we were together  
Darlin' mine  
Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome  
I'd call you on the phone some  
But I don't have a dime  
Darlin', you're so far behind me  
Tomorrow's gonna find me  
Further down the line  
Darlin', tears are in my eyes (oh, in my eyes)  
You that I should try now (I should try to make it back to you)  
To make it back to you

I don't believe the things I'm seein'  
I've been wonderin' 'bout some things I've heard  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
  
A bad enough situation  
Is sure enough getting worse  
Everybody's crying justice  
Just as soon as there's business first  
  
Toe to toe, touch and go  
Give a cheer and get your own souvenir  
  
Well you know the people running round in circles  
Don't know what they're headed for  
Everybody's crying peace on earth  
Just as soon as we win this war  
  
Straight ahead, gotta knock em dead  
So pack your kit, choose your own hypocrite  
  
You don't have to go to off-Broadway  
To see something plain absurd  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word

You say you're all alone  
With visions all your own  
The things you feel nobody feels the same  
But you know me  
You know what I've been through  
  
And everything that touches me  
And everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Touches you  
  
Friends along the road  
May lighten up your load  
By sayin' what they think you really want to hear  
But I'll only tell you  
What I feel is true  
  
And everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
And everything that touches me  
Touches you  
  
Share, 'cause I can't take you there  
Unless I know a part of what you're thinking  
Care, 'cause it's only fair  
Darlin' can't you feel my heart is breaking  
My heart is breaking  
  
Everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Everything that touches me  
Touches you

I met you on a Monday  
But Tuesday you stole my heart  
You gave me everything I ever wanted  
And then turned and walked away  
You just turned and walked away  
  
I get excited, excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
What you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
Soon as I was sure you were gone  
I see you somewhere standin' 'cross the room  
But you turn and walk away  
You just turn and walk away  
  
I still get excited, excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
  
Now that I know the problem  
The answer should be easy to find  
It takes common sense to simply convince him  
Not to turn and walk away  
Tryin' to get that man to stay  
  
I still get excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, baby, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
Hey, way to get next to me  
Way to get next to me

Sometimes I miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
You know I miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
And when my mind it gets to worryin'  
And I just can't get no rest, oh baby oh  
That's when I call you up instead  
After midnight baby  
Sittin' here all alone  
I tried to call your number baby  
But you weren't at home  
I've been a good girl baby  
I'm through with all that mess  
But the way I'm feeling right now, darlin'  
You know it scares me half to death  
That I miss that feelin' of  
Fallin' on over the ledge  
The summer night in Texas, baby  
It's too hot and wet to sleep  
I heard you pull up in the distance  
You're comin' to give me relief  
We went screamin' down the highway, baby  
So much faster than we should  
You pulled me over in the moonlight, darlin'  
Man, I still can feel that hood  
And I miss that feelin'  
Oh, I wanna fall on over the ledge  
When that rain start fallin', I wanna call baby  
I wanna take a real good look at that ledge  
It ain't something you get over  
You might think you made it through  
You can turn your head and walk away, baby  
But it never takes its eyes off of you and  
It'll push your foot right through the floor board, baby  
Make you cut them streamers down and back  
You waste what's precious and you can't afford, baby  
It runs your life right off the track  
It'll keep you boilin' in that poison  
Only the truly twisted know so well  
You don't need drugs to show you heaven, baby  
'Cause there's plenty clean in hell  
I'd miss that feelin' of fallin'  
Oh, on over the ledge  
Yeah, the blues start callin'  
[Incomprehensible]  
Break it down  
[Incomprehensible] baby  
Oh baby I'm gonna crawl  
Crawl into your arm now  
Into your arm now  

Something in your eyes, makes me want to lose myself,  
Makes me want to lose myself, in your arms.  
There's something in your voice, makes my heart beat fast.  
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life.  
If you knew how lonely my life has been,  
And how low I've felt so long.  
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along,  
And change my life the way you've done.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me,  
Feels like I'm on my way back where I come from.  
Feels like home to me, feels like home to me,  
Feels like I'm on my way back where I belong.  
  
A window breaks down a long dark street,  
And a siren wails over my head.  
But I'm all right, 'cause I have you here with me.  
And I can almost see through the dark there's light.  
If you knew how much this moment means to me,  
And how long I've waited for your touch.  
If you knew how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feels like I'm on my way back where I belong.

Lookout boy your bound to change  
You can't ever stay the same  
Cause if ya keep on sayin the same ol'lies  
Your gonna look around boy and find  
Yourself outta time  
Watchout girl the words you say  
Don't really fit the play  
Somebody else you might talk to now  
And knows what ya say and what ya mean  
But don't help this time  
CHORUS  
You might say that you ain't  
Got a, hold on yourself  
You might say that you only try your best  
You might say that you only need a rest  
You might say you can only fool yourself  
Fool yourself, fool yourself  
Don't believe the words you read  
Their written on the street  
Evry time you try to lay their game  
Their gonna knock you down  
And take your pride away  
See how bad you need to cry  
But no matter how hard you try  
Its the same old story once again  
You always hide from the one  
Who calls you friend  
I call you friend  
Repeat Chorus  
Fool yourself 3-5x and fades out  
  

Their eyes are down and the track looks slow  
It don't look like a good thing  
Your horse could jump it when the pack runs wild  
It don't look like a sure thing  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are crying  
And your bills ain't paid  
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
The deal is done so you slip right in  
You got the depth but you can't win  
The cards are cold and the cut feels thin  
You got the deck but you can't win  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are hungry  
And your brain ain't paid  
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
Gamblin' man, you're a ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
  

Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,  
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door,  
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know,  
Oh honey, if you want me to love you,  
You've got to give it up or let me go.  
  
I know it's useless to be jealous, I couldn't tire you if I tried,  
But when I think of you messing behind my back  
It brings a pain I just can't hide.  
Oh baby, I've been true to you.  
And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too.  
Well, you come home drunk and nasty, you won't tell me where you've been.  
Just when things are nice and sweet, you go back out again.  
Why do you want to mess up a good thing?  
I'm gonna find me another man, one who wants to give me everything.  
  
Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,  
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door.  
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know.  
Oh honey, if you want me to love you,  
You've got to give it up or let me go.

Darkness settles on the ground  
Leaves the day stumbling blind  
Coming to a quiet close  
And maybe just in time  
We've almost lost the heart to know  
How to keep our best in mind  
We've almost lost the heart to know  
How to keep our best in mind  
  
Time has turned an angry face  
Throws a dark eye back to sea  
But what will pass for mercy now  
We'll practice unforgivingly  
As if might and will make right  
Or either one could make us free  
As if might and will make right  
Or either one could make us free  
  
Lovers laugh and cross this way  
They're weaving out into the street  
It seems we never were so young  
Or it was never quite so sweet  
But the world is always beautiful  
When it's seen in full retreat  
The worst of life looks beautiful  
As it slips away in full retreat  
  
God only knows that we can we do  
No more or less than he'll allow  
God only knows that we mean well  
God knows that we just don't know how  
But I try to be your light in love  
Pray that is enough for now  
Well I tried to be your light in love  
And I'll pray that is enough for now

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey  
Midnight, I'm wound up tight  
Slowly comin' down in the daytime  
I been lyin' low from work, hangin' over from the hurt from you babe  
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain, till I get a  
Better thing with you, Darlin', me and you.  
So far to see ahead  
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed  
Gotta find me a good man, a good man, a good man.Yeah.  
You better stop, think about what you're saying  
I was seriously dedicated, in the game of playin'  
You made ten thousand promises you could'nt keep  
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped  
Put up with your disrespect and neglect  
What an experience, I'll never forget.  
Till now, everything I did was wrong. (I'm sorry, baby)  
Today you're free, but we live alone.  
Gotta find me a good woman...Good woman...Good woman...Yeah.  
It was twelve o'clock in the midnight hour  
I heard the door slam, and then the shower  
When I got up, you were already gone  
I slipped and fell, from the water you left on.  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man  
Gotta find a good woman  
Gotta find a good man.  
  

Yeah baby, I've been drinking,  
And I shouldn't come by I know  
But I found myself in trouble darling,  
And I had nowhere else to go  
  
Got some whiskey from a bar man,  
Got some cocaine from a friend  
I just had to keep on moving,  
Till I was back in your arms again  
  
Well I'm guilty, yeah I'm guilty,  
I'll be guilty for the rest of my life  
How come I never do,  
What I'm supposed to do  
How come nothing that I try to do ever turns out right  
  
Well you know how it is with me baby,  
You know I just can't stand myself  
It takes a whole lot of medicine,  
For me to pretend to be somebody else.

Hey Mister, we want you to know  
We think, you've taken this about as far as it can go  
It's about to blow  
You got nowhere to run  
Why don't you sit back and watch the show?  
You used to drop your little darlin' off at Sunday school  
Family values while you're gettin' some behind the pool  
She's nobody's fool  
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter  
Wants it bad as you  
You jack up the rent, you call in a loan  
Clear your intent is to screw 'em out of all they own  
Throw the dog a bone  
Well, you'll be cryin' for mercy when  
Your karma calls you on the phone  
Well you know, times are hard  
Ain't it a bitch but  
The Japanese are makin' you twitch  
All your investments are turnin' sour  
It kinda spoils your happy hour  
Look around, we're comin' your way  
It's a wonder to us how you ever thought  
You'd get away, what you say  
Well, the way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait  
The way it looks from here  
No need to hesitate  
Have a party celebrate  
The way it looks from here  
You won't have to wait for hell to pay  

Traveling at night, the headlights were bright  
And we'd been up many an hour  
And all through my brain  
Came the refrain  
Of home and its warming fire  
  
[Chorus]  
And Home  
Sings me of sweet things  
My life there has its own wings  
Fly over the mountain  
Though I'm standing still  
  
The people I've seen  
They come in between  
The cities of tiring life  
The trains come and go,  
But inside you know  
The struggle will soon be a fight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Traveling at night,  
The headlights were bright.  
But soon the sun came through the trees  
Around the next bend  
The flowers will send  
The sweet smell of home in the breeze  
  
[Chorus]

There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel  
'cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling  
I don't know what we did wrong  
I just know if you come home  
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again  
  
There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been  
Where you've been ain't where I'm going  
'cause if I ask you where you've been  
The hurting starts and it don't end  
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no  
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no no  
  
Tears don't become me  
Pain ain't my friend  
It seems like you enjoy my crying, baby  
You always said that I was strong  
But I believe that you were wrong  
Lately, God knows, I have been trying  
  
There ain't no use in you trying to kiss away the hurt, baby  
'cause it hurts where it's deep down inside of me and it's hiding  
If you decide you're coming home  
You walk in, it won't be like before  
'cause I ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no  
Ain't gonna let you break my heart again, no no

I don't know what's wrong with me  
I've been foolish as a fool can be  
Baby, I can't sleep at night  
And I lost my appetite  
Went to the doctor but he don't know  
It's getting to where it ain't funny no more  
Tell me baby what I might gonna do  
I believe I'm in love with you  
I believe I'm in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me, too  
I can't fight, baby I decided  
I'm in love with you  
I guess this time I realize  
For you baby I got eyes  
Come on baby and give me a chance  
All I need is your romance  
You know what I'm tryin' to fight  
I'm telling you baby I'll be true  
I believe I'm in love with you  
I believe I'm in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me, too  
I can't fight, baby I decided  
I'm in love with you

Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Billy was a friend of mine  
We used to walk down by the river  
And he'd hold my hand  
We were only ten or twelve years old  
Didn't know about love  
I found out that it could hurt you so  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Jimmie was the one in high school days  
We used to drive around the city  
Thinking we'd grown up  
Must've been just about sweet sixteen  
I found a brand new world  
Brand new love that I had never seen  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
No matter how hard I try  
I just can't leave it alone  
No use in wonderin' why  
'Cause my heart has a mind of its own  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
But I keep on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
I keep on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I keep right on falling  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
I can't help myself  
Can't help myself, falling in love  
Falling in love  

Turn down the lights  
Turn down the bed  
Turn down these voices inside my head  
Lay down with me  
Tell me no lies  
Just hold me close, don't patronize  
Don't patronize me  
  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't  
Here in the dark, in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't  
  
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see  
The love you don't feel when you're holding me  
Morning will come and I'll do what's right  
Just give me till then to give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight  
  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark, in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

Say goodbye,  
Well I know it's true.  
I know you're leaving me but i,  
I'm leaving too.  
You won't forget me,  
Or the sound of my name.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
  
It seems so empty now.  
Close the door.  
Ain't it hard to believe that you ever,  
Lived this way before.  
All that nothing,  
Causes all that pain.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
  
Well this broken soul,  
That I know a, a heart that's breakin'.  
You can't make it whole  
Until you know what has been taken.  
And all those pieces,  
Uh that you find them all your own.  
  
I said goodbye.  
Now you know it's true.  
You said you're leaving me, but honey i,  
I'm leaving too.  
You won't forget me  
Or the sound of my name.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.  
Please believe me,  
I feel the same.

It's such a clever innocence  
With which you do your sorcery  
As if somehow your years  
Would bow and let that young boy go free  
Well, I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought I knew where I was going  
Until I heard your laughter flowing  
And came upon the wisdom in your eyes, surprise  
Well, I've spent my whole life running 'round  
Chasing songs from town to town  
Thinking I'd be free by just never  
Let love slow me down  
So lonely and so wild until you turned and smiled  
By now I should have long been gone  
But here I am holding on  
As if I didn't know which way to run  
Well, it's such a clever innocence  
With which you show myself to me  
As if you know how it feels  
To never be who you wanted to be  
And I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought that I'd free but I'm just one more prisoner of time  
Alone within the boundaries of my mind  
I thought I was a child  

That was then and this is now  
I found my way back here somehow  
Knew you'd have to let me go  
I told you once I told you so  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me down  
You can hold me but you  
Can't hold what's within  
Pull me round  
Push me to the limit  
Maybe I may bend  
But I know where I'm not going  
I will not be broken  
I will not be broken  
I will not be  
  
Someone other than who I am  
I will fight to make my stand  
Cause what is livin' if I can't live free  
  
What is freedom if I can't be me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't let you near it  
I will let my spirit fly  
Fly  
High  
Oh take me down  
  
Take me down  
You can hold me but you  
Can't hold what's within  
Pull me round  
Push me to the limit  
Maybe I may bend  
But we both know where I'm not going  
I will not be broken  
I will not be broken  
I will not be

A true love story  
Is hard to find  
Can't get no rest  
Got no peace of mind  
You say you gave  
Your heart to me  
You put me down  
You set me free  
  
You said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
I guess you know he is because  
  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Always takes you by surprise  
  
There you was  
The only one  
Coming on me and ruining my fun  
  
Leave me setting  
At home all alone  
Waitin' on your call by the telephone  
  
You said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
Guess you know you always was deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
  
Finally made me realize  
That I tried and tried  
But you just cant get enough  
So you lied and lied and lied  
I will not be denied  
I'm gonna plant a seed  
I will not be denied  
Of the man and the love I need  
  
Said you're deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
Guess you know you are because  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Always takes you by surprise  
  
Its a sad situation  
When yes it's true  
I can say it baby  
I'm through with you  
Its over now  
And in the past  
Gonna find me a man  
With a love that'll last  
You know he's deadly  
Everybody said you was deadly  
  
Guess you know you always been  
Deadly  
Comes in every shape and size  
Deadly  
Finally made me realize  
  
That I tried and tried  
But you just couldn't get enough  
And so you  
Lied and lied and lied  
And I will not be denied  
I will not be denied  
I will not be denied

If you got to make a fool of somebody  
If you got to make a fool of someone  
Do you really gotta hurt me  
I'm the one that'll worry  
  
If you got to make a fool of somebody  
If you got to make a fool of someone  
Do you really gotta hurt me  
I'm the one that'll worry  
  
Daytime night time  
Anytime at all  
I'll be there waiting  
Anytime you call  
Just to be near you  
You know  
That anywhere I'll go  
How could you hurt me so

I'm in the mood  
I'm in the mood for love, yes, I am

What that man was puttin' down  
(Hm, puttin' down, down, down, down,down)  
In the mood, baby

(Baby)

(No, no)

Baby, won't you come and tell me  
Tell me what we're gonna do...yeah, baby  
I've tried everything I know just to,  
Just to try and get along with you  
  
Wake up in the morning and already  
You are aimin' for a fight  
No matter what I say or do  
I'm never gonna get it right  
  
But ain't we gettin' kind of tore down  
Always layin' it on the line  
I don't think that when they called it love  
This what they had in mind  
  
[Chorus]  
(Hey) Baby, don't you know that  
I'm on your side  
All you got to do now, darlin...  
  
Take my little heart and open wide  
Hey baby, I know we can work it out  
Might take a little mojo workin, baby  
But ain't that what love is all about?  
  
Hey, Baby, must be somethin bout this  
Push and pull  
Makes me wonder if we stir it up...  
Just to make sure things'll never get dull.  
  
Come on baby take the gloves off  
And then untie those shoes  
I got something more tantalizin  
For you left and right to do  
  
[Chorus]

I heard you say  
Life can't go on this way  
And you need to change your view.  
So you packed up and moved out of my life.  
To find a world of your own.  
Even now that you've up and gone.  
For you there's still a place in my heart  
Only real love in my life  
That even time can't erase.  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind  
Everytime.  
I knew you cared  
Cause in your letters you would write and say  
That you missed my lovin' every day.  
Well if that's true,  
All I'd ever why  
Aren't you next to me.  
And you call me on the telephone  
Afraid because you're all alone  
Well, Baby, just remember  
Oh love will abide  
So darlin'  
Keep this heart in mind  
Whenever the lights of love don't shine.  
Darlin' keep this heart in mind  
Everytime.  
  
  

Let's keep it between us  
These people meddling in our affairs  
They're not our friends  
Let's keep it between us  
Before the whole door closes  
And it comes to an end  
They'll tell you one thing, me another  
Till we don't know who to trust  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
Let's keep it between us  
We've been through too much together  
That they'll never share  
They've had nothing to say to us before  
Now all of a sudden it's as if  
They've always cared  
All we need is honesty  
A little humility and trust  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
I know we're not perfect, then again, so what?  
That ain't no reason to treat you like a snake  
Or to treat me like a slut  
And it's makin' me so angry  
Could we just lay back for a moment  
Before we wake up and find ourselves  
In a game that we both have lost?  
These easy cures and easy handsomes  
Somethin' tells me we can't afford the cost  
'Cause some things not fit for human ears  
Some things don't need to be discussed  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
They'll tell you one thing, me another  
Till we don't know who to trust  
Ohh, darlin', let's keep it between us  
Let's keep it between us  
Before the whole thing breaks down  
And goes too far  
If we can't settle our differences by ourselves  
Then we must be worse off  
Than they think we are  
Back seat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel  
But they sure know how to make a fuss  
Ohh, darlin', can we keep it between us?  
Can we keep it between us?  

Let me tell you 'bout a friend of mine  
He's a short order cook  
Long on speed and he's short on spice  
He reads his customers like a book  
He's seen this, and he's done that  
And now he's makin' fried eggs an art  
But there's one thing he can't fix no how  
There's a longing in his heart  
Tried for years to work it out  
At the grill and at his home  
Talks to his friends, he talks to himself  
He'd talk the chicken right off the bone  
Talks to his woman and she understands  
You know they're always eye to eye  
Well, she runs the joint, they live out back  
It's a small house under a big sky  
And even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin' apart  
And she knows 'cause she can feel it too  
There's a longing in her heart  
Longing in her heart  
Well, you and me, we're just like them  
We never wanted to be alone  
So we made a pact, sealed with desire  
For a happier house and home  
Only to find, it doesn't untie  
The knot where feelings die  
There's a longing deep inside our hearts  
Oh, and no one to tell us why  
Well, our friends ain't lookin' for anything new  
You know, they wouldn't know where to look  
Well, her, she likes runnin' that joint  
And he likes bein' a cook  
Together they're doin' very well  
You know they're mighty glad they could  
Well, there's a fire burnin' and it's towards them now  
Comin' from a distant wood  
Even the stars at night agree  
The sky is fallin' apart  
We know 'cause we can feel it too  
There's a longing in our hearts  
Longing in our hearts, longing in our hearts  

The men that I've been seeing  
Well they got their soul up on a shelf  
You know they could never love me  
'cause they can't even love themselves  
  
But I want someone to love me  
Baby I want one to understand  
Won't put himself above me  
Who can love me like a man  
  
I never seen such losers  
Even though I tried  
Find a mind to take me home instead of  
Taking me for a ride  
  
Baby, I use someone to care  
Believe it when I tell you darlin'  
You can love me like a man  
  
Oh they want me to rock them  
Like my back ain't got no bone  
I want a man whose gonna rock me  
Like my backbone was his own  
  
Baby, I want to wait until you can  
Believe it when I tell you darlin'  
You can love me like a man  
  
Come home sad and lonely  
Feel like I want to cry  
Come over here and hold me baby  
And don't ever ask the reason why  
I said I, I want a lover  
Won't have to work to understand  
  
Don't put yourself above me baby  
Love me like a man

I might forgive, but I won't forget  
Believe me, baby  
You swear you changed your ways  
You ain't proved it yet  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If I'm gonna take you back  
After the pain I've had  
Well, I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition  
  
Do me right, don't do me wrong  
Come home every night, no more carryin' on  
I explain my position  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
  
Well my friends try and tell me  
Say that I must be mad  
If I'm gonna take you back  
After the pain I've had  
Well, I explain my position  
That I made my decision  
I'll grant you love on one condition  
Love on one condition

Rainy night, I'm all alone  
Sittin' here waitin' for your voice on the phone  
Fever turns to cold, cold sweat  
Thinkin' about things we ain't done yet  
  
Tell me now, I've got to know, do you feel the same?  
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?  
  
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
If your whole world's shakin' and you feel like I do  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
  
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide  
Once love comes sneakin' upon your blindside  
And you might as well try to stop the rain  
Or stand in the tracks of a runaway train  
  
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be  
So come on let's finish what you started with me  
  
Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin' new  
That's just love sneakin' up on you  
If your whole world's shakin' and you feel like I do  
That's just love sneakin' up on you

You dust the bottles on the bar counter  
You're writing screenplays on the side  
Three nights a week can keep a girl workin'  
Sometimes it's good to lose your pride  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
You turn around and say, it's last orders  
You fix the ribbon in your hair  
Tomorrow's letter by the hall doorway  
Could be the answer to your prayers  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
It's in the luck of the draw  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
The natural law  
(Wheel ever turnin')  

Jimmy's not a high concept guy  
But he's front page news, let me tell you why  
He's on the cover of the New York Post  
Every network, coast to coast  
All he needed was a hot night in June  
'Cause he had the needle and he had the spoon  
When he spiked it bit, and man, he flew  
Into America's living room  
  
We all love tragedy and it loves us too  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
All you need to be a star is to die in open view  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
  
Loved by women, admired by men  
He walked down Broadway with his best friend  
His brain was wired like a light in a socket  
With his old friend in his back pocket  
That horse could kick, that horse could scream  
Ride you outta here into a different scene  
Unrequited love and that makes it fair  
But who keeps score when you're in mid-air?  
  
We all love tragedy, it loves us too  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
All you need to be a star is to die in open view  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
  
Like a free-fall chute that didn't open  
He looked down to see his dream was broken  
He stared back up at a hot grey sky  
Reran his life and then he died  
Well if you jump off a building, brother beware!  
'Cause my friend Jimmy woke up mid-air  
No time to smile, no time to wave  
They buried him in a media grave  
  
We all love tragedy, it loves us too  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
And all you need to be a star is to die in open view  
It's a marriage made in Hollywood  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you  
Between greed and you

Broken heart, bloodshot stare  
Signs of a fool who cared too much  
Now she's gone and he can't remember how  
To live without her touch  
Hopin' to die but surely livin' to tell  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing a fool won't get used to  
After all the whisky and the wisdom  
He could swallow, he thought  
It was time to start lovin' again  
So he found someone  
Afraid his heart would follow the heat  
He could hardly do more than pretend  
Though she knew in her heart  
That his love was alive  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing a fool won't get used to  
Now of all the things love teaches  
All the ways that it opens our eyes  
None more profound than the lesson he learned  
The day she walked out of his life  
Well when the road gets too narrow  
It's then he remembers her smile  
And he sees these words forming on her lips  
Across a river of tears he once cried  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing, you won't get used to  
Ooh nothing a fool won't get used to  
Hey baby  

I come to you, sweet man  
And I'm, I'm fallin' on my knees  
I come to you, pretty papa  
Fallin' on my knees  
Ask if you don't have nobody  
Won't you kindly take me please  
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman  
I'm a real tight woman  
Lord I'm a jack of all trades  
I can be your sweet woman  
Also be your slave  
Lord I can do things so good  
You will swear that I behave  
I got all of them sayin'  
That I'm tight in everything I do  
I got all the men cryin'  
I'm a broad that will never be blue  
What I need is a good man  
And I will make him happy too  
If you're a married man  
You ain't got no business here  
Cause when you're out with me  
I might make your wife shed a tear  
Cause I'm a mighty tight woman  
There is nothing, nothing that I fear  
  

You took a part of me that I really miss  
I keep askin' myself how long can it go on like this  
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, I told myself one too  
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
You took the silver and you took the gold  
You left me standin' out in the cold  
People ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
I'm driftin' in and out of dreamless sleep  
Throwin' out my memories in a ditch so deep  
I did so many things I never did intend to do  
And I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink  
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think  
I feel like talkin' to somebody but I just don't know who  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once  
Rock me for a little while and rock me for a couple a months  
You know honey I'll rock you too  
Well, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you  
  
Well, there's voices in the night tryin' to be heard  
I'm sittin' here listening to every mind-pollutin' word  
And I know, I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two  
Yes, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles  
Yes, I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you

Three days of snow in a burnin' hell,  
Bet you're wonderin' where I am,  
Rang that number all night long,  
Got no comfort on the telephone,  
Went out and caught me a midnight flight,  
Thought a little love would make it all alright,  
But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay,  
Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon.  
He left me with a Keno card, livin' in Vegas ain't too hard,  
I ran it up to about 50 grand, counted it out and held it in my hand,  
That kinda word will get around, and make a lost love come up found,  
I hear ya knockin' baby at my door, but you don't live here no more,  
Oh no, I think he made his move too soon.  
Instrumental  
I've been from Spain to Tokyo, from Africa to Ohio,  
I never try to make the news, I'm just a man who sings those low down blues,  
I'll take my lovin everywhere, I come back to know they still care,  
One lover here, one love behind, one in my arms, one on my mind,  
One thing baby never make a move too soon  
Yeah baby, never make your move too soon,  
Well you can count on this baby, we never make a move too soon  
(Too soon)  
  

One two, one two three  
Well, I went and gave away my TV  
Told the man, "Cut off the phone"  
I put an ad in the paper, baby, gonna sell everything I own  
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through  
But there's just no getting over you  
Well, I went and bought myself a new straw hat  
One eye pokin' under the brim, I bought myself a little seaside shack  
In case I might just want to swim  
Done everything I know in the world to try to shake these blues  
But there's just no getting over you  
Well, I try and try but honey it ain't no use  
Cry and cry, I just can't turn you loose  
Why oh why, can't I get you off my mind?  
You got that hook so far in baby, I gotta get you off my line  
Well, I got some transcendental meditation, baby  
And I'm taking up Japanese, I signed up at the cooking school  
I'm going to pick up on some hard cuisine  
Done everything in the world I know, to try to make it through  
But there's just no getting over you  
Honey I, I tried and I tried baby it ain't no use  
Cried and I cried but I just can't turn you loose  
Why oh, why can't I get you off my mind?  
Honey, you got that hook so far in, I just got to get you off my line  
Oh, I have much and I'm a fool for you baby, lay back in, stand on  
Now listen to this [Incomprehensible]  
You know the way you do, honey  
Well, I just can't make it over, can't seem to make it baby  
No matter what I say or do baby, I can't make it over, ooh  
Well, there's just no getting over you, that's a truth  

You can please me  
You can sweet talk and lead me on  
But believe me  
Won't be long till I'm catching on  
Now you left me here with nothing  
And you put my love on hold  
Well there must be something behind those eyes  
Because I believe every lie you told  
  
That ain't no way to treat a lady  
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love  
That ain't no way to treat a lady  
I could of sworn that you'd had enough  
  
So you leave me  
Well I'm lonely and in despair  
It intrigues me  
How you don't really seem to care.  
Well I ain't here for nothing  
And my love doesn't come that cheap  
I will hold you to all your promises  
If I could find one you meant to keep  
  
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady  
That ain't no way to treat a woman in love  
That ain't ain't no way to treat a lady  
That ain't no way, no way to treat a woman in love  
  
You can tease me  
You can sweet talk and lead me on  
But believe me  
Won't be long till I'm catching on  
For I ain't here for nothing  
And my love doesn't come that cheap  
And I will hold you to all your promises  
If I could find one you meant to keep

Last night I thought I found you  
I saw it in a dream  
I was tangled in the rushes, baby  
You were caught up in the stream  
And the more I tried to reach you  
The more you slipped away  
And when I woke up in the darkness  
I was callin' out your name  
  
[Chorus]  
You and we dance around it  
Why is the truth so hard to say  
We long for true love, well  
We've found it, it's just  
One Belief Away  
  
There's a shadow in the garden  
And it's coiled around our hearts  
Won't you help me to believe you, baby  
Won't you show me where to start  
  
The more I try to reach you  
The more you slip away  
I want to wake up in the darkness  
And hear you callin' out my name  
  
[Chorus]

When he looks into her eyes  
He sees only the truth  
Telling him he's been living a lie  
over and over like a line in a song  
About all the love he let pass by.  
  
To her he might be the man of her dreams  
To find where she's been hiding inside  
Broken or battered, it really doesn't matter  
Her heart's like a wave and he's the tide.  
  
They're not forever they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
He's like a boxer who had to retire  
After winning but killing a man  
He's got all the moves and none of the courage  
Afraid to throw a punch that might land.  
  
Not too much later she can't meet his glance  
You see her start pulling away  
Over and over like fire and ice  
One is color, one is grey.  
  
They're not forever, they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
So if you know how  
Why don't you say'em a prayer  
They're need all the help they can get  
They remember too much about what went wrong  
It might be they should learn to forget.  
  
Forget themselves in each other  
And leave what belongs in the past  
Carry their hearts like a newborn child  
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.  
  
They're not forever,they're just for today  
One part be my lover,one part go away.

You remind me, you remind me  
That it's a trick to know you.  
I don't even know  
How, I fel in love with you.  
Was it your eyes, or was it your clothes,  
Was the way you greeted me when the sun rolls, the sun rolls.  
I was lonely when I first called you.  
We were kids just foolin' with lovin'  
You took me in, and you didn't even know me or my games.  
Chorus: (3 times) I was out on the road, acting a lady  
I was with him for one night for some love and a song  
Then you came along, you don't care about money  
You don't care about time,  
And ourlove just keeps rolling, rolling along  
Say hey don't you worry,  
Cause we can get along  
If were pleasin' each other  
Pleasin'each other, pleasin' each other,  
Can't be wrong.  
  
  
  
  

Don't want no secret agent  
Don't need no long Cadillac  
Don't want nobody with no problems  
I don't need a man with a monkey on his back  
I need a real man  
I said a real man  
I need a real man  
  
Ain't messing with no toy  
I don't need no baby boy  
Don't need to send me no flowers babe  
Sending flowers is real nice  
Way I've been feeling my hearts been a-reeling  
I need a man that loves me once  
I want a man that loves me twice  
Its a sticky situation babe  
Keep me up late at night  
Honey don't know the difference  
Wanna go left when you should of gone right  
  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
I've been around the world  
I'm a woman not a girl  
  
I don't want no million dollers  
I don't need no diamond ring  
You can twist and shout  
For to knock yourself out  
I don't care about material things  
  
I want a real man  
I need a real man  
I want a real man  
I said a real man  
I want a real man  
I need a real man baby  
I want a real man  
I want a real man  
Real man  
Real man  
  
Ain't messing with no toy  
Don't need no baby boy  
I been around the world  
I'm a woman not a girl  
I want a real man  
Real man

I guess you got me in a sentimental mood  
Never thought I'd feel this way again  
Lyin' here with my dreams  
I get so lonely thinking of you  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I want to feel  
What your love can be  
I close my eyes  
The chances that I'll take  
Have made me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
I never let you know just what's been on my mind  
I never thought I'd hurt so bad for you love this long  
Lyin' here at night alone  
I keep on wonderin' just what went wrong  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I want to feel  
What your love can be  
I close my eyes  
Chances that I take  
Made me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
River of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears  
Oceans of heartbreak  
I wanna feel  
What your love could be  
I close my eyes  
The chances that I take  
Have got me so blind  
'Til I can't see  
River of tears  
It's a river of tear  
River of tears  
It's just a river of tear  
River of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears  
It's just a river of tears  
It's a river of tears  
It's a river of tears  
River of tears  
River of tears  

You need a man that'll treat you like the woman you are  
Those little boys are just fooling around with your heart  
Whatcha gonna do now that you're all alone?  
You need a rock not a rollin' sone  
Yeah so when I'm bored  
it just ain't enough  
You need a man made of stronger stuff  
Get ready  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you  
  
You need somebody who will help you with your heavy load  
Well I've been there baby  
Lord give me a rock and roll  
Well I can bend but I won't break  
cause you ain't got what I can take  
So when you're tired of those little girls  
you want a woman that'll rock your world  
Get ready  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you  
Amateurs are clearly tought  
They can't give you what you really want  
When all the other have been untrue  
I'll give you something you can hold on to  
  
Rock steady all night long  
Rock steady till the light of dawn  
Slow and easy tried and true  
Rock steady  
Just me and you

Well it was alright at midnight and you fell out at three  
So I made you warm and stoked the dying fire  
When it all came down this morning you were lying next to me  
How sweet the wine of desire  
  
Well we cheated on a friend and cheaters never win  
Oh the truth I know would be a small relief  
I could never be the one to say  
Her best friend took you down  
  
Gonna run in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief  
Just ain't no use think it over I was blind but now I see  
Well she's coming back and I know just what I'll do  
If it comes right down to you leaving her or staying here with me  
  
How sweet the memory of you  
Well we cheated on a friend and it looks like I lose again  
I could never be the one to say  
  
Her best friend took you down  
I'd rather run in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief  
Like a thief in the night hide when ever it's light  
Gonna run in the night like a thief

As I walk along I wonder what went wrong  
With our love, a love that was so strong  
And as still walk on I think of the things we've done  
Together while our hearts were young  
  
I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain  
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery  
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder  
Why, why why why why why she (you) ran away  
And I wonder where she (you) will stay  
My little runaway, a run run run run runaway

Take this silver lining  
Keep it in your own  
Sweet head  
And shine it when the night is  
Burning red  
Shine it in the twilight  
Shine it on the cold, cold ground  
Shine it till these walls  
Come tumbling down  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the darkest deep  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light don't sleep  
  
Step into the silence  
Take it in your own  
Two hands  
And sprinkle it like diamonds  
All across these lands  
Blaze it in the morning  
Wear it like an iron skin  
Only things worth living for are  
Innocence and magic, amen  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the darkest deep  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light don't sleep  
  
Whoa, whoa  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the talk so cheap  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light don't sleep  
Know that the light don't sleep  
  
Time after time  
They drag you down  
Down in the darkness deep  
Fools in their madness all around  
Know that the light don't sleep  
Know that the light don't sleep

Feels like nothin' happens fast enough  
Well maybe I just want too much  
But when something's wrong between us, baby  
Nothin' feels right  
  
I think it's time we cleared the air  
Take a long drive far away somewhere  
Tell me everything you feel inside  
We got nothin' but time  
  
Slide over, baby  
Here by my side  
I want to take you on a slow ride  
On a slow ride  
  
Your history shows on your face  
Yeah, you've been hurt you've been betrayed  
Now we can't change the past, but we can  
Leave it behind  
  
We'll forget about tomorrow, baby  
We'll just steal away into the night  
And we'll just be two shadows, darlin'  
In the dashboard light  
  
Slide over, baby  
Here by my side  
I want to take you on a slow ride  
On a slow ride

People are talkin' 'bout people  
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it  
They think we're lovers kept under covers  
I just ignore it, but they keep saying  
We laugh just a little too loud  
We stand just a little too close  
We stare just a little too long  
Maybe they're seeing something we don't, Darlin'  
  
Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love?  
  
I feel so foolish, I never noticed  
You'd act so nervous,  
Could you be falling for me?  
It took a rumor to make me wonder  
Now I'm convinced I'm going under  
Thinking 'bout you every day  
Dreaming 'bout you every night  
Hoping that you feel the same way  
Now that we know it, let's really show it, Darlin'  
  
Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love, love, love, love?  
  
Let's give them something to talk about  
A little mystery to figure out  
Let's give them something to talk about  
How about love, love, love, love?

There's a howlin' at my window, baby  
I hear him closin' in  
That green-eyed jackal's got the scent  
Knows I'll let him in  
He slinks in by me at the fire  
More bitter than the cold  
And it's a rage as old as Hades  
That'll sputter on these coals  
I'm callin' on the Furies, to let the toast begin  
I'm roasting on the spit of love again  
I never have believed you  
But I stick around for more  
Somethin' bout that hollow in your eyes  
There's a darkness at the core  
Well, it's got me slowly turnin'  
I'm basting on the bone  
I'm skewered like some drunken fool  
In juices all my own  
Callin' the Furies' carrion choir  
Singin' me back upon the pyre  
I'm roasting on that spit of love again  
You can call it what you want  
But it's lyin just the same  
There's no mercy in these ashes, baby  
When your love's a cryin' shame  
And they're howlin' in moonlight, baby  
They're here to call my bluff  
they're wonderin' if there'll ever come a day  
When I'll have finally had enough  
I'm callin' on the Furies, to let the toast begin  
I'm roasting on that spit of love again

It was more than just any old Friday night fight  
With your mean left hook and my roundhouse right  
We were both goin' for the heavyweight crown  
T-K-O in the very first round  
  
Thought you were gettin' the best of me  
Floatin' like a butterfly, stingin' like a bee  
Thought a good fight would get it out of our system  
But we walked away with a split decision  
  
Well, when we first met, you were a real knockout  
I was head over heels, I was down for the count  
But gettin' along got harder and harder  
'Til we were nothin' more than sparrin' partners  
  
I did my best to roll with the punches  
You wore me out with fakin' and a-duckin'  
Almost put me outta commission  
But we walked away with a split decision  
  
Split decision  
Split decision  
Everybody lose and nobody winnin'  
Just too tough, I had enough  
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love  
We took a split decision  
  
I did my best to roll with the punches  
You wore me out with fakin' and a-duckin'  
Almost put me outta commission  
But we walked away with a split decision  
  
Split decision  
Split decision  
Everybody lose and nobody winnin'  
Just too tough, I had enough  
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love  
  
Split decision  
Split decision  
Everybody lose and nobody winnin'  
Just too tough, I had enough  
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love  
We took a split decision  
  
Split decision  
Whoa baby

I know you got a different picture in mind  
Some dream world of a different kind  
I know this rhythm we've been moving to is way too slow  
Each time our bodies aresupposed to meet  
I'm here still missing a beat  
And when I look at you I see in your eyes  
We're still dancing to a different tune  
  
Take me to your dreaming place  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see what it takes to be  
Your lover in disguise  
show me how I do those things  
That make you want to stay  
'Cause I'll Go crazy if I don't find  
The words I gotta say  
To steal your heart away  
  
I'll buy you diamonds, buy you golden rings  
All kinds of Beautiful things  
But that don't matter to a lover with a Restless heart  
Cause you still want to wake up to a Different scene  
Some screen gem like the one in your dream  
And leave me standing like a foolin' the wings  
Still waiting for a part to Play  
  
Take me to your dreaming place  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see what it takes to be  
Your lover in disguise  
Show me? How I can do those things  
That make you want to stay  
Cause I'll go crazy if I don't find  
The words I gotta say  
To steal your heart away  
  
I know you think she's right for you  
That she's in tune with what you do  
That she can touch you deep inside  
Where all your deepest feelings lie  
But I got something you should know  
Before she starts to hurt you so  
You can bet your life she's gonna hurt you  
  
And maybe you think that it's alright  
To leave me waiting every night  
To put me down in company  
In front of everyone we see  
To take my loving when it's free  
And then to throw it back at me  
  
Well baby, I just can't stand it  
Cause I can be the one for you  
And I can make your dreams come true  
And I can love you like she can  
Cause fancy clothes don't make no woman  
Believe me baby  
I got what it takes to make you feel good  
  
And maybe you think a girl should be  
As perfect as a girl can be  
To love you when your feeling down  
And miss you when you're not around  
Well I can't be that one for you  
I can only be the one that loves you  
  
Hey, what's this on your mind  
Hey, what's this change of mind  
Hey, what's this on your mind

Storm warning,  
Feels like a heavy rain.  
Winds on the coast tonight.  
We may get tossed tonight.  
  
Storm warning,  
He's made it pretty plain  
He's fallin' for another,  
Found a new lover, and he won't be back again.  
  
Can't stop a river,  
When it's burst it's banks.  
I've seen the look in his eyes  
He's in love and hypnotized.  
  
Time of mourning.  
There's already been a flood of my tears.  
Such a sense of loss tonight,  
Nought to do but ride it out.  
  
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks.  
I wonder how long it's gonna take  
To get over this heartbreak.  
  
Storm warning,  
Feels like a heavy rain.  
Winds on the coast tonight.  
We may get tossed tonight.  
  
Storm warning...

I just want a man I can satisfy  
Ain't gonna be no sugar mama no more

Your sweet and shiny eyes  
Are like the stars above Laredo  
Like meat and potatoes  
To me  
  
In my sweet dreams we are  
In a bar  
And it's my birthday  
Drinking salty marguaritas with Fernando  
  
  
Young and wild  
We drove 900 miles of Texas highway  
To the Mexican border  
As the day was comin' on  
  
We crossed the Rio Grande River  
And we swore we'd have things our way  
When we happened to walk in to Nuevo Leon  
  
  
Your sweet and shiny eyes  
Are like the stars above Laredo  
Like meat and potatoes  
To me  
  
In my sweet dreams we are  
In a bar  
And it's my birthday  
And we're having our picture taken  
With Fernando

When you get home, baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
When you get home, little baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
That'll be consolation  
Lord, Honey, oh my worried mind  
  
Left my baby  
Standin' in the back door cryin'  
Well, I left my little baby  
Standing in the back door cryin'  
I never felt so sorry  
Lord, Honey, till he said goodbye  
  
Kokomo me, baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
She'll be back tomorrow night  
I'd like to cry in your arms tonight  
Baby, don't you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City?  
Sweet home Kokomo  
  
Go on down to the river, baby  
Goin' to sit down on the ground  
Well, I'm goin' down to the river, baby  
Goin' to sit down on the ground  
And let the way of the water  
Lord, Honey, wash my troubles down  
  
Kokomo me, baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
She'll be back tomorrow night  
I gotta cry with you, baby  
Baby, don't you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City  
Sweet home Kokomo?

I told you once the day we met  
I wouldn't be your queen  
Your little darlin', sweet coquette  
Just what my routine  
You've been around enough to know  
There's really no one else  
When I hear that siren call, baby  
I just can't help myself  
I gotta go  
I hope you'll understand  
I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go, baby  
Because the road's my middle name  
Well, it's hard enough to love someone  
When they're right close to home  
Don't you think I know it's hard, honey  
To squeeze the sugar from the phone  
Guess the road is in my blood  
'Cause I'm my daddy's kid  
Just have to learn how to let me go  
Just like my momma did  
I gotta go  
I hope you'll understand  
Yeah, I love you so  
Want you to be my man  
I hear it call, baby  
Sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
Because the road's my middle name  
Hear it call  
And it sounds so sweet and plain  
I gotta go  
'Cause the road is my middle name  
I gotta go  
'Cause the road my middle name  
Ooh, I gotta go, darlin'  
Because the road is my middle name  

Jesus cried, wept and died  
I guess he went up to heaven  
I've been downtown such a long, long time  
I'll never make it home by seven  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore  
  
Well I went down to Jason's  
Walked 'til my feet got sore  
But I never knew what laughin' was  
'Til you walked out the door  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore  
  
You can give my soul to Abraham  
Give my soul to Saul  
Give my bones to Canada  
My teeth, they don't hurt at all  
  
I don't know who made the highway  
I guess that's just my pride  
But I have heard the Prince of Darkness  
On his charger ride  
  
The silver blade is gleamin'  
The scales are in his hands  
I swear that night is fallin'  
Don't you lose another man  
Won't you come and take me home  
I've been too long at the fair  
And Lord, I just can't stand it anymore

So now there's somebody new,  
These dreams I've been dreaming,  
Have all fallen through.  
You say I'll be fine,  
It only takes time  
Someday, that may be true  
  
But it's too soon to tell  
It's too soon to say  
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well  
But right now,  
It's just too soon to tell  
  
It's all for the best, so you say  
You never intended to hurt me this way  
You want to hear  
I won't drown in my tears,  
Well, baby the best that I can say  
  
Is it's too soon to tell  
It's too soon to say  
Maybe someday I'll be able to wish you well  
But right now it's just too soon to tell  
Well right now,  
It's just too soon to tell

You said that your love was just for me  
That's why I've got to be yours  
You told me the day will never come  
When you would walk out and leave  
'Cause you know that  
  
[Chorus]  
True love is hard to find  
'Cause you know that  
True love is hard to find  
Everybody knows  
True love is hard to find  
Hard to find  
Very hard to find  
I say (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find  
  
You told me that you know I would have to travel all over  
You would take care of my business for me  
Darlin', all I ask of you  
Is to leave those business alone and save it just for me  
Yes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And glory fills my heart with joy from heaven  
With love for you  
Darlin', I always think of you  
Always have my arms filled with love for you  
'Cause you know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just because I know  
True love is hard to find  
I believe in love  
True love is hard to find  
Everybody should know that  
True love is hard to find  
You know that  
True love is hard to find  
I say (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find  
Hard to find  
True love (true love)  
True love (true love)  
True love is hard to find

No river can hold you darlin'  
No covers can hide you tying your shoes  
My cupboards are overflowing  
The wine is sublime I'm flyin' too  
  
So slide on over and forget it's wrong  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song it's new  
And darlin' so are you  
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
My government owns the bible  
My government owns the title too  
The car that I got this mornin'  
The car that I got for me and you  
  
So what's comin' on down that road  
It's two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that I'm gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know it's true  
We'll stay together 'til the end of time  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
So slide on over and forget it's wrong  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Come on over and pick up your song it's new  
And darlin' so are you  
Don't know nothin' 'bout no here and gone  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
No no no  
  
So what's comin' on down that road  
It's two lights in the nighttime baby  
You know that I'm gonna wanna  
Share my load with you  
And boy you know it's true  
We'll stay together 'til the end of time  
We're two lights in the nighttime baby  
Ain't nothin' that a fightin' heart won't do  
Honey you know it's true

Warm and lovely mystery, fire smiling through  
Before this moment fades away I want to know you  
I've got lightening in my pocket, thunder in my shoe  
Have no fear I've got something here I want to show you  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you  
And in your eyes the distance left is closing  
I've got a feeling in my oceans  
Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields this prison is opening  
Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why  
They hope and try, live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire  
Angels wait to take me higher and higher  
Higher and higher

I can't, I can't make love to your memory  
I can't put my arms, around what used to be  
Everything I had, was apart of me  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
My friends tell me, it'll be alright  
But my friends never, no, never held you close at night  
Every dream I had, that could see the light  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you  
  
I never knew, I never thought that you'd take my love and tear it apart  
I gave you my best, when I gave you my heart  
Oh, are you listening? Or is this all in vain? yeah  
I still can't believe, you're never comin' back again  
  
Everything I had, oh, except my pain  
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked out that front door with you, hey, yeah,  
Well you went and it walked, well you went and it walked,  
Right out the front door with you  
Well you went and it walked right out  
Never comin' back no more  
Right out

I woke up this mornin'  
Feelin' round for my shoes  
Know bout at I got these  
Old walkin' blues  
  
Woke up this mornin'  
Feelin' round oh for my shoes  
But you know bout at I got these  
Old walkin' blues  
  
Lord I feel like blowin' my  
Whoa old lonesome home  
Got up this mornin', my little  
Bernice was gone, Lord

Lonesome home  
Well, I got up this mornin'  
Whoa all I had was gone

Whoa ride the blind ah

Well, some people tell em that the worried

Some people tell me that these  
Old worried, old blues ain't bad

I most ever had  
  
She got a  
Elgin movement from her head down  
To her toes  
Break in on a dollar most anywhere  
She goes, oh oh  
To her head down to her toes  
  
Oh honey  
Lord, she break in on a dollar  
Most anywhere she goes

So you think the man is crazy  
He eats up your lies  
Like they're good for him  
Apple pie, he don't even cry  
  
He's not a fool  
He's just tryin' to do  
What his heart says to  
To love you  
  
As you take to the wind  
To the wind again my friend  
As he breaks down within  
Within, within, within  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin' that one day you'll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two?  
What do you want the boy to do?  
All he really wants is you  
  
He knows what you are  
Still he'll be up game  
Saved the world today  
But you know better  
You don't go around him  
  
Now and then you promise  
All the way out things that you're gonna get  
You will see, you will be,  
So damn glad that you finally found him  
  
As he watches you come and go  
Or you show  
As he watched you promise a zero  
He waits for you patiently  
Hopin' that one day you'll see  
That all he really wants to be  
Is yours and yours alone eternally  
  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see you're breaking the child in two?  
What do you want the boy to do?  
Don't you see that you're breaking the child in two?

How does one decide  
That the methods he's using,  
They just don't jive  
To truly believe and keep trying  
Over and over again  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
When will one change his mind  
And jump the fence  
For the dial a sign  
Its a sad thing, its a bad thing  
But so necessary  
Living in hopes,  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Now what, what, (i don't know, can you tell me what)  
What is success?  
Is it do your own thing?  
Or to join the rest  
And if you truly believe it,  
And try over and over again  
Living in hopes  
That someday you'll be in with the winners  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success  
  
Oh, tell me what it is  
Sweet success

Paradise  
I got man who loves me  
In his life  
He puts no one else above me  
It's paradise  
With everything I ever wanted  
Paradise  
It's just like love should be  
  
Now you're a thief  
Everybody I know knows it  
You're indiscreet  
Anybody on the street knows  
That you cheat  
The damage that you're doin' doesn't  
Cross your mind  
Steal the heart just like a thief  
  
[Chorus]  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me, tell me, tell me who  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Tell me, tell me  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
Who, but a fool lets a thief into paradise  
  
You got me  
Thinkin' I want what you're givin'  
You got me  
Wonderin' what I'm missin'  
I can see  
It's the same old fascination  
What a deadly game  
That sends them all right into your flame  
  
[Chorus]

Struck by the moon  
Risin' too soon  
I feel a pain deep inside me  
Cold northern winds  
Fist in my chin  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
What can I do  
To get back to you  
I'm feeling desperate and lonely  
The city's a river  
Of cold misery  
Makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry  
  
Nites I can't sleep  
My tears are cheap  
I'm losin' hold of my senses  
I can't contain  
All of this pain  
And it's makin' me wild for you baby  
  
I'm down on my knees  
Hear me cry for you baby  
Cold misery  
I would die for you baby  
I pray you will see  
These tears I cry

Rain is pourin' down like the  
Heavens are hurtin'.  
Seems like it's been dark since  
The devil knows when.  
How do you go on, never knowin'  
For certain,  
Will the sun ever shine again?  
  
Fells like it's been years since  
It started to thunder.  
Clouds are campin' out in the valley  
And glen.  
How do you go on, when you can't help  
But wonder.  
Will the sun ever shine again?  
  
What if the rain keeps fallin'?  
What if the sky stays gray?  
What if the wind keeps squallin',  
And never go away?  
  
Maybe the soon the storm will be  
Tired of blowin'.  
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen.  
How do you go on, if there's no way  
Of knowin'?  
Will the sun ever shine?  
Wish I could say.  
Send me a sign-  
One little ray.  
Lord, if you're listenin', how long  
Until then?  
Will the sun ever shine again?

Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't sit around gossiping, explaining what your good man really can do  
Some women nowadays, Lord they ain't no good  
They will laugh in your face, Then try to steal your man from you  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Your best girlfriend, she might be a highbrow, she changes clothes 3 times a
day  
What do you think she's doing now, while you're so far away  
She's loving your man in your own damn bed  
You better call for the doctor, mama, try to investigate your head  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't sit around, girl, telling all your secrets,  
Telling all those good things he really can do  
If you talk about your baby, you tell me he's so fine  
Lord honey, I just might sneek up and try to make him mine  
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man  
Don't be no fool, don't advertise your man (baby don't do it)  
  
  

Wounded heart I cannot save you from yourself  
Though I wanted to be brave it never helped  
'Cause your trouble's like a flood ragin' through your veins  
No amount of love's enough to end the pain  
Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong  
But the anger that you feel goes on and on  
And it's not enough to know that I love you still  
So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill  
If you listen you can hear the angel's wings  
Up above our heads so near they are hovering  
Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart  
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart  
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart  

I know that fan is moving air, I can see it in your hair  
But I can't bear to breathe it in somehow  
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now  
I'll rise and fall with you 'cause you can't fail me now  
  
Salt is sweet upon my mouth  
And dark throws sparks against my house  
The stain of love's a smudge on my brow  
But you see through me and you can't fail me now  
You see right through me, you can't fail me now  
  
I've bit off more than I can chew  
It's something that I tend to do  
When fewer words are what we need and how  
You bite my tongue, you can't fail me now  
I rant and rail but you can't fail me now  
  
I've lost the thread among the vines  
And hung myself in story lines  
That tell the tales I never would allow  
God knows the name of every bird  
It fills my mind like angry words  
But you know all my secret heart avows  
  
We're taught to love the worst of us  
And mercy more than life but trust me  
Mercy's just a warning shot across the bow  
I live for yours and you can't fail me now  
I live for your mercy,  
You can't fail me now  
You can't fail me now

Everytime I look  
Into your lovely eyes  
I see a love that money  
Just can't buy  
  
One look from you  
I drift away  
I pray that you  
Are here to stay  
  
Chorus  
Anything you want  
You got it  
Anything you need  
You got it  
Anything at all  
You got it  
Baby  
  
Everytime I hold you  
I begin to understand  
Everything about you  
Tells me I'm your best friend  
I live my life  
To be with you  
No one can do  
The things you do  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm glad to give  
My love to you  
I know you feel  
The way I do

You can make me do what you wanna do  
But you got to know how,  
You can make me cry, you can make me sigh,  
But you got to know how,  
You can make me do like this, you can make me do like that,  
Woh, baby, but you got to know how.  
Once a pal of mine stole a guy of mine,  
But I got him back, now,  
It's the same old song, she couldn't keep him long,  
'Cause she didn't know how.  
Well, I love my man, I make him holler,  
Woh, my,  
Yessir, I really know how.  
Technique ain't tough, if you care enough,  
You can learn to know how,  
I might drop a hint how to strike my flint  
If you yearn to know how,  
Well, don't tell me about the life you led,  
Don't try to drink me into bed,  
No, baby, no, that ain't the way how.  
You got to take your time, you know it ain't no crime  
If it lasts all night.  
I think you'll be ideal when you begin to feel  
That you're doin' right.  
When you love me right, you hear me holler,  
Woh, my,  
Yessir, when you really know how.  
(instrumental break)  
And if you stay with me, who knows how it will be  
When we finally know how,  
We'll get a house in town, no need to move around  
When we really know how,  
Well, there's tricks that I don't even know,  
Ones we'll make up as we go.  
Woh, mister, when we really know how.  
Yes, mister, when we really know how.  
  

Told me baby  
You were just too tired to try  
There was nothing left for you to give  
And no more tears to cry  
I know she hurt you  
But you know I've been hurt too  
You just come to me  
We'll see what a love can do  
Told me baby  
I was still too young to know  
All the ways that love was going  
To drag you down and just how low I'd go  
In love and time between us  
Makes no difference at all  
You know, you're as desperate to get back up  
As I am not to fall  
Oh, baby, I've been looking for a man like you  
Oh, darling, after all we've been through  
There's no one left to fool, nothing left for us to do  
Except me and you  
Told me baby  
To find somebody new  
Do you really think that I'd come this far  
Just to lose a man like you?  
You know you've got to take a chance  
If only you will stay  
And if you've got the time baby, I've got the love  
We might just find a way  
We might just find a way, yeah  
We might just find a way, yeah  
We might just find a way, ooh  

You came up on me like a landslide  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
I've got a Thunderbird parked right outside  
Give me a minute to finish this thing and we'll light it  
  
In all this heat it's a job keeping cool  
And I could fry an egg on you  
  
You came up on me like a landslide  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
  
You're gonna get what's coming  
You been asking for it two days running  
You're gonna get what's coming  
You're gonna get what's coming to you  
  
I hope that you're half as intrepid as you make out  
Often or not, but you never got what you asked for  
Keep on pouring until you hear me shout  
And turn up the sound if you want me to drive any faster  
  
Caution went out when you walked in the room  
If it never came back it would be too soon.  
  
You're gonna get what's coming  
You been askin' for it two days runnin'  
You're gonna get what's comin'  
You're gonna get what's coming to you  
  
You came upon me like a landslide,  
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it  
  
You're gonna get what's comin',  
You been askin' for it two days runnin'  
You're gonna get what's comin'  
You're gonna get what's comin' to you
