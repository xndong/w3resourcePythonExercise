You're heard enough  
Of the blues and stuff  
You're pretty swell now  
'Cause you're pretty tough  
But I don't have to tell you  
How hard it can be to get by  
  
You never bothered  
About anyone else  
You're well educated  
With no common sense  
But love, that's one thing  
You really need to get by  
  
All your troubles  
Come from yourself  
Nobody hurts you  
They don't care  
Just as long as you show them  
  
A really good time  
All the things  
You used to do  
A trip to the movies  
A drink or two  
They don't satisfy you  
They don't tell you anything new  
  
You know I don't talk much  
Except to myself  
'Cause I've not much to say  
And there's nobody else  
Who's ready and willing  
And able to know me, I guess  
Listen to me  
I'm not finished yet  
There's something to tell you  
That I can't forget  
Just have a really good  
  
There's a girl  
I used to know  
Her face is her fortune  
She's got a heart of gold  
She never goes out much  
But boy, when she does  
  
Then you know  
She's got no money  
Well, maybe a dime  
But she knows what she's worth  
And that's reason why  
She's gonna make it  
  
She's got what it takes  
You'll appreciate that  
She's probably late  
But I know  
And you know  
We all know  
She'll have a really good time

I've been around  
So far it seems  
Too bad the blues  
Blew my schemes  
Dynamite  
  
Such sweet surprise  
In southern heat  
Or northern skies  
Ain't that so  
Shadows cling  
Where shutters close  
  
Who can tell  
Heaven knows  
Why some can laugh  
And some can sing  
Stand in line  
Or get on down and swing  
Ain't that so  
Cross the street  
who's ringing bells?  
  
Peeling walls  
Of cheap hotels  
Neon flare  
A sudden chill  
And there you lie  
And time stands still  
Ain't that so

Somebody told me  
Just the other day  
That you're leaving me  
We're through  
Well if you knew  
How it hurt me so  
Then you'd change your mind  
I'm sure  
Don't want to hear  
What's going on  
I don't care  
What's new  
Don't want to know  
About anything  
Cause all I want  
Is you  
Going out with other girls  
Was always such a bore  
But since I fell in love with you  
I need you more and more  
Don't want to know  
About one-night-stands  
Cut-price souvenirs  
All I want is  
The real thing  
And a night that lasts  
For years.  
If you ever change your mind  
I've a certain cure  
An old refrain, it lingers on  
L'amour, toujours l'amour  
Don't want to learn  
About etiquette  
From glossy magazines  
Why should I try  
To talk correct  
Like they do  
In another scenes  
Say no more  
About imagery  
You're starting to confuse  
Just make an offer  
Of more romance  
Of course I can't refuse  
All I want is you  
Oo oo I'm all cracked up on you.

Is a zone where  
There is no doubt  
No more fall-out  
Why don't you step  
Through the mirror and see?  
  
From Arizona  
To Eldorado  
Sure is a mighty long way.  
Hey little girl  
Is something wrong?  
I know it's hard  
For you to get along  
  
The bell-tower rings  
It tolls a hollow sound  
But your castles in Spain  
Still maybe realized  
And longings more profound.  
  
You see, every cloud  
Has a silver lining  
And sometimes paradise  
Around your corner lies.  
In Amazona everything is nice  
  
Little one, come take my hand?  
I'll try to help you there  
I'll take you there.  
  
Amazona's  
Getting closer  
Soon you'll see.  
Journey's over  
We almost there!

Now the party's over, I'm so tired  
Then I see you coming out of nowhere  
Much communication in a motion  
Without conversation or a notion  
  
Avalon  
  
When the samba takes you out of nowhere  
And the background's fading out of focus  
Yes the picture's changing every moment  
And your destination, you don't know it  
  
Avalon  
  
When you bossanova there's no holding  
Would you have me dancing out of nowhere  
  
Avalon [Repeats]

Valerie please believe  
It never could work out  
The time to make plans  
Has passed, faded away  
Oh the way you look  
Makes my starry eyes shiver  
Then I look away  
Too much for one day  
One thing we share  
Is an ideal of beauty  
  
Treasure so rare  
That even devils might care  
Your swimming-pool eyes  
In sea breezes they flutter  
The coconut tears  
Heavy-lidded they shed  
Swaying palms at your feet  
You're the pride of your street  
While you worship the sun  
Summer lover of fun  
Gold number with neighbours  
Who said that you'll go far  
Maybe someday be a star  
A fast mover like you  
And your dreams will all come true  
  
All of my hope, and my inspiration  
I drew from you  
Our life's pattern's drawn in sand  
But the winds could not erase  
The memory of your face  
Deep in the night  
Plying very strange cargo  
Our soul-ships pass by  
Solo trips to the stars, in the sky  
Gliding so far  
That the eye cannot follow  
Where do they go  
We'll never know

At last the crimson chord cascade  
To shower dry cordials within  
Too late to leap the chocolate gate  
Pale fountains fizzing forth pink gin  
While destiny begins to fly  
The farmyard chorus sings its wake  
Upstanding anthem to the sky  
Too soon to realise their fate  
You were the raven of October  
I knew the sign you flew around  
Up in the air so high above me  
Never needed to look down  
I never thought I'd be a rover  
I didn't even look around  
But now I know you've found another  
So will someone please find me  
Give now the host his claret cup  
And watch Madeira's farewell drink  
Note his reaction acid sharp  
Should make the cognoscenti think

Please don't ever let me down  
'Cause you know I'm not so sure  
Do I have the speed to carry on  
Burn you out of my mind, I know  
You're a flame that never fades  
Jungle red's a deadly shade  
Both ends burning, will the fires keep  
Somewhere deep in my soul tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Now my course is plain as day  
Running bold across to play  
Both ends burning with a strange desire  
That feeds the fire in my soul tonight  
I will dance the night away  
Living only for today  
Both ends burning while you're counting sheep  
Hell, who can sleep in this heat this night?  
Tell me will I ever learn?  
  
It's too late, the rush is on  
Both ends burning and I can't control  
The fires raging in my soul tonight  
Oh will it never end?  
Put your foot around the bend  
Drive me crazy to an early grave  
Tell me what is there to save tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Keep on burning till the end, until the end  
Keep on burning till the end, the very end

Well I rush out blazin'  
My pulse is racin'  
As the rain streams down my face  
There's no turning back now  
To fight with fate  
Outnumbered, out of place  
They said go west young man, that's best  
It's there you'll feel no pain  
Bel-Air's okay if you dig the grave  
But I want to live again  
Can't let go  
There's a madness in my soul tonight  
Can't let go  
Must ride like the storm  
Can't let go  
Will I run out of control tonight  
Can't let go  
Until every trace is gone  
It's a winding road from Cuesta way  
Down sunset to the beach  
Though Canoga Park is a straight safe drive  
It's too far outta reach  
But now the headlights are flashin' by so fast  
All directions seems the same  
And the windscreen wipers keep a beat repeatin'  
You can't let go again  
What's in a name on the street tonight  
I'm only a face in the crowd  
All in the dark and afraid tonight  
Nowhere to run or to hide  
But I can't let go  
Sometimes the world outside'll take you in  
With just a smile  
And you so blinded with desire  
A hundred sleepless nights have left me  
Wasted and so cold  
But I can take it I'm hangin'on  
Can't let go  
There's a madness in my soul tonight  
Can't let go  
Must ride it like the storm  
Can't let go  
Will I run out of control tonight  
Can't let go  
Until every trace is gone

You, the hero  
So many times  
You've loved  
And didn't linger  
Now my finger  
Points at you  
Another loser  
You, an island  
On your own  
  
Complete  
In every detail  
Monumental  
A precious jewel  
Or just a fool  
Innovator  
It's in your mind  
And blood  
I watch it simmer  
I see you're courting  
More despair  
No hope?  
  
Not a glimmer  
Now you're nothing  
But second hand  
In glove  
With second rate now  
Now you're flirting  
With heroin  
Or is it cocaine?  
Casanova  
  
Is that your name  
Or do you live there?  
I know my place  
Is here with you  
Tonight  
But not together

Do you know what it means to me  
To delight in your company  
Could it happen to me  
Do you know what I'm certain of?  
I would love to fall in love  
Could it happened to me?  
Hey won't you look at me  
  
Now I'm cracked wide open I can't conceal  
My all-over trembling, I'm acting strange  
And while you're out of reach, I never change  
God knows I'm beside myself  
If a tear's a crime, then I must confess  
My guilty secret, I'm not ashamed  
Take me as I am, an average man  
Oh boy is it getting rough  
When my old world charm isn't quite enough  
I'd throw you cantos, I'd jazz 'em up  
When I lay me down, you don't pick up  
  
What's more, it's a crying shame  
Only this time no one but myself to blame  
All I touch turns to dust  
It's right there in my cards, I ought to cut  
Let us sing of the tortured heart  
And a lonely soul in this world apart  
As he plays a fear, takes a little pain  
And move our separate ways again  
Is it easy to say 'I do'?  
  
At this moment I love you  
See beyond me, it's true  
Now that evening is closing in  
Should I light that fire again?  
Could it happen to me?  
Did it happen to you?

Are you ready for bad blood?  
I've got my share  
I'm sick of them sweet sweet nothings  
Oh! In my ear  
  
Ain't funny I'm the honey  
All your money just can't buy  
So baby you can cry cry cry  
Now the last laugh is mine  
You ready for hot stuff?  
Be prepared  
  
I'm sick of your cheap cheap hustle  
Oh! Don't cha dare  
Let us pray the lord have mercy  
On your mercenary mind  
'Cause even if you cry cry cry  
Your heart out  
I won't be kind  
Are you ready for good times?  
Hard to bear!  
  
You're steppin' on holy ground  
Hold it there!  
I'm fading out your hologram  
A phoney toothpaste smile  
Remember when you cry cry cry  
Your heart out  
I did mine

Yesterday, well it seemed so cool  
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight  
I said "it's love" you said "all right"  
It's funny how I could never cry  
Until tonight and you pass by  
Hand in hand with another guy  
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying?  
Dance away the heartache  
Dance away the tears  
Dance away  
  
Loneliness is a crowded room  
Full of open hearts turned to stone  
All together all alone  
All at once my whole world had changed  
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall  
Let the strobe light up them all  
I close my eyes and dance till dawn  
Dance away  
  
Now I know I must walk the line  
Until I find an open door  
There was I, many times a fool  
I hope and pray, but not too much  
Out of reach is out of touch  
All the way is far enough  
Dance away

There's a new sensation  
A fabulous creation  
A danceable solution  
To teenage revolution  
Do the Strand love  
When you feel love  
It's the new way  
That's why we say  
Do the Strand  
Do it on the tables  
Quaglino's place or Mabel's  
Slow and gentle  
Sentimental  
  
All styles served here  
Louis Seize he prefer  
Laissez-faire Le Strand  
Tired of the tango  
Fed up with fandango  
Dance on moonbeams  
Slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans  
You know what I mean  
Do the Strand  
  
Had your fill of Quadrilles  
The Madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the Beguine  
The samba isn't your scene  
They're playing our tune  
By the pale moon  
We're incognito  
  
Down the Lido  
And we like the Strand  
Arabs at oasis  
Eskimos and Chinese  
If you feel blue  
Look through Who's Who  
See La Goulue  
And Nijinsky  
Do the Strandsky  
Weary of the Waltz  
And mashed potato schmaltz  
Rhododendron  
  
Is a nice flower  
Evergreen  
It lasts forever  
But it can't beat Strand power  
The Sphynx and Mona Lisa  
Lolita and Guernica  
Did the Strand

Well I'm here looking through an old picture frame  
Just waiting for the perfect view  
I hope something special will step in to my life  
Another fine edition of you  
A pin-up done in shades of blue  
Sometimes you find a yearning for the quiet life  
The country air and all its joys  
But badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price  
  
For just another night with the boys oh yeah  
And boys will be boys, will be boys  
They say love's a gamble, hard to win, easy lose  
And while sun shines you'd better make hay  
So if life is your table and fate is the wheel  
Then let the chips fall where they may  
In modern times the modern way  
  
And as I was drifting past the Lorelei  
I heard those slinky sirens wail, whooo  
So look out sailor when you hear them croon  
You'll never been the same again oh no  
Their crazy music drives you insane, this way  
So love, leave me. do what you will  
Who knows what tomorrow might bring'  
Learn from your mistakes is my only advice  
  
And stay cool is still the main rule  
Don't play yourself for a fool  
Too much cheesecake too soon  
Old money's better than new  
No mention in the latest Tribune  
And don't let this happen to you

Eight miles high  
And when you touch down  
You find you're  
Stranger than known  
Signs in the street  
That say where you're going  
Are somewhere  
  
Just being their own  
Nowhere is there  
Warmth to be found  
Just those afraid  
Of losing their ground  
Rain gray town  
Known for its sound  
In places  
  
Small faces abound  
Round the squares  
Huddled in storms  
Some laughing  
Some just shapeless forms  
Sidewalk scenes  
And black limousines  
Some living  
Some standing  
Alone

Think I'll walk out in the rain  
Called you time and time again  
I got no reply  
You've gone  
Reached the point of no return  
The more I see the more I stand alone  
I see the end of the line  
Were you ever lonely?  
Mystified and blue?  
  
Realising only  
Your number's up  
You're through  
Done my share of winning  
Now's my turn to lose  
After a fair beginning  
The game's up  
I'm through  
  
Think I'll walk out in the storm  
There no love to keep me warm inside  
Hope it's fine at the end of the line  
Now's the time to take a dive  
Try a magic carpet ride  
Everything is wrong  
You've gone  
  
If you ever miss me  
If I should cross your mind  
You know where to find me  
I'll be waiting at the end of the line

My friend's flesh and blood  
She lies overtime  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time  
I'm not that kind  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Night size, perfect ten  
So rude, she's no good  
But as she says  
It pays to win  
Play to win  
She plays to win  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Street wise for her time  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time

For your pleasure  
In our present state  
Part false part true  
Like anything  
  
We present ourselves  
The words we use tumble  
All over your shoulder  
Gravel hard and loose  
There all night lying  
With your dark horse hiding  
Abhorring such extremes  
You're rubbing shoulders  
With the stars at night  
Shining so bright  
Getting older  
  
But you'll wake up soon  
And fight  
In the morning  
Things you worried about  
Last night  
Will seem lighter  
I hope things  
Will turn out right  
Old man  
  
Through every step a change  
You watch me walk away  
Tara Tara

Blue suns and grey lagoons  
Silver starfish with honeymoons  
All these and more to choose  
If you  
  
Satin teardrops on velvet lights  
Morning sickness on Friday nights  
Heaven knows what others I might bring  
To you  
  
Broken partings making strange goodbyes  
Hopeless cases with fake alibis  
Even hoping we'll be there to share  
With you  
  
Blue suns and gray lagoons  
Grey lagoons  
Grey lagoons

Oh here it comes again  
That old ennui  
I hope it won't stay long  
Well it's every-man to his own thing  
And every singer to his song  
If you're feeling low  
And all upset  
  
Nothing's going right  
You just make a wish  
Like in a fairy tale  
And I'll bewitch you  
If it takes all night  
There are many things  
That I could say  
To try and comfort you  
But I know the words you'd like to hear  
Are simply "I love you"  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes I'm down  
A topsy-turvy life  
But only searching  
For the truth  
And I'll find it  
If it takes all night long  
Well I myself  
May main concern  
Is what I can afford  
So if music be my mistress  
  
Then at least she's Madame Claude, d'accord  
Ah, more champagne!  
To lose this pain  
Would be very nice  
So I'll help myself to one more drink  
And I'll find myself  
If it takes all night long

Please see note.  
  
If there is something that I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind I say  
Where would you go if you were me  
Try to keep a straight course not easy  
Somebody special looking at me  
A certain reaction we find  
What should it try to be I mean  
If there are many  
  
Meaning the same  
Be specific just a game  
I would do anything for you  
I would climb mountains  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I would put roses round our door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your hair girl with your ponytail  
Takes me right back (when you were young)  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
You used to walk upon (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The hills were higher (when we were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The trees were taller (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The grass was greener (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
You used to walk upon (when you were young)

In every dream home a heartache  
And every step I take  
Takes me further from heaven  
Is there a heaven?  
I'd like to think so  
Standards of living  
They're rising daily  
But home oh sweet home  
It's only a saying  
From bell push to faucet  
In smart town apartment  
The cottage is pretty  
The main house a palace  
Penthouse perfection  
But what goes on  
What to do there  
Better pray there  
  
Open plan living  
Bungalow ranch style  
All of it's comforts  
Seem so essential  
I bought you mail order  
My plain wrapper baby  
Your skin is like vinyl  
The perfect companion  
You float my new pool  
De luxe and delightful  
Inflatable doll  
My role is to serve you  
Disposable darling  
Can't throw you away now  
Immortal and life size  
My breath is inside you  
I'll dress you up daily  
And keep you till death sighs  
  
Inflatable doll  
Lover ungrateful  
I blew up your body  
But you blew my mind  
  
Oh those heartaches  
Dreamhome heartaches

I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
That's when my love comes tumbling down  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
When there's no one else around  
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you  
And do all the things I told you  
In the midnight hour  
  
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out  
And see that twinkle in your eye  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour  
That's when my love begins to shine  
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you  
And do all things I told you  
In the midnight hour

Maybe your heart is aching  
I wouldn't know, now would I?  
Maybe your spirit's breaking up  
I shouldn't care, now should I?  
Maybe you're thinking of me  
Well I don't know, now do I?  
If you only knew how I feel  
Wish I could die, now don't I?  
  
I'm just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Just another high  
Couldn't believe in my eyes  
You drifted into my life  
But marriages made in heaven  
Can they survive in this life?  
Surely it came as no surprise  
Love was too hot to handle  
Well I really blew my cool and you  
You just blew out the candle  
Didn't you just try just another high?  
Didn't you sign as you waved goodbye?  
  
Just another high  
I'm just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Lately it seems so empty here  
But I suppose I'm alright  
Maybe tomorrow's not so clear  
Still I remember that night  
Singing to you like this is  
My only way to reach you  
Though I'm too proud to say it  
Oh how I long too see you  
Shattered by dreams, by your goodbye  
As shattered my goodbye, as filled the sky  
  
Desolate am I  
Just another crazy guy  
Playing at love was another high  
Such a crazy high  
Maybe I should start anew  
And maybe I should find someone who  
Will maybe love me like I love you  
Maybe I'm too stuck on you  
Maybe I got stuck on you

Buttercup daisies  
And most anything  
They wither and fade  
After blossom in Spring  
Time conquers innocence  
Pride takes a fall  
In knowledge lies wisdom  
That's all  
  
Everything changes  
Weather blows hot or cold  
Through alchemy iron turns gold  
Quicksilver baby  
So hard to pin down  
Oh when are you coming around?  
Hopelessly grounded  
I walk through the streets  
Remembering how we spent time  
Hopefully yearning that someday we'll meet  
But when will we, how could we, why? Oh my!  
  
Fashion houses ladies  
Need plenty loose change  
When the latest creation  
Is last year's fab-rave  
Thought patterns hazy  
This auto-style age  
Will lady luck smile old and sage?  
She knows that,  
Never again, no, will I give up my heart  
To gamble with fate is my crime  
  
Nevertheless love, it's all here in my book  
I'd write it but don't have much time  
You see, I know it sounds crazy  
But what can I do?  
I've fallen head over heels, over you  
Chameleon color  
  
All phases of moon  
The shifting of planets  
And leopard spots too  
As destiny wills it  
So seasons will change  
Just like you

You've got me girl on the run around run around  
You've got me all around town  
You've got me girl on the run around  
And it's getting me down, getting me down  
Lady if you want to find a lover  
Then you look no further  
For I'm gonna be your only  
Searching at the start of the season  
And my only reason  
Is that I'll get to you  
I'll find some way of connection  
Hiding my intention  
Then I'll move up close to you  
I'll use you and I'll confuse you  
And the I'll lose you  
Still you won't suspect me

Once I thought I saw you  
In a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light  
From star to star  
Far across the moonbeam  
I know that's who you are  
I saw your brown eyes  
Turning once to fire  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away  
I am just a dreamer  
But you are just a dream  
You could have been  
Anyone to me  
Before that moment  
You touched my lips  
That perfect feeling  
When time just slips  
Away between us  
On our foggy trip  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away  
Once I thought I saw you  
In a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light  
From star to star  
Far across the moonbeam  
I know that's who you are  
I saw your brown eyes  
Turning once to fire  
You are like a hurricane  
There's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer  
Where the feeling stays  
I want to love you  
But I get so blown away  

T'ain't no big thing  
To wait for the bell to ring  
T'ain't no big thing  
The toll of the bell  
Aggravated, spare for days  
  
I troll downtown the red light place  
Jump up bubble up, what's in store  
Love is the drug and I need to score  
Showing out, showing out, hit and run  
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on  
Stitched up tight, can't shake free  
Love is the drug, got a hook on me  
  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug for me  
Late that night I park my car  
Stake my place in the singles bar  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Heart to heart as we hit the floor  
Lumber up, limbo down  
  
The locked embrace, the stumble round  
I say go, she say yes  
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug, got a hook in me  
Oh oh catch that buzz  
Love is the drug I'm thinking of  
Oh oh can't you see  
Love is the drug for me

I am for a life around the corner  
That takes you by surprise  
That comes leaves all you need  
And more besides  
I am for a life and time by numbers  
Blast in fast 'n' low  
Add 'em up, account for luck  
You never know  
  
I am into friendship and plain sailing  
Through frenzied ports o' call  
O shake the hand to beat the band  
With love is all  
  
Or nothing to the man who wants tomorrow  
There's one in every town  
A crazy guy, he'd rather die  
Than be tied down  
  
I am for the man who drives the hammer  
To rock you 'til the grave  
His power drill shocks  
A million miles away  
  
I am for the revolution's coming  
I don't know where she's been  
For those who dare because it's there  
I know I've seen  
  
Now and then I've suffered imperfection  
I've studied marble flaws  
And faces drawn pale and worn  
By many tears  
  
I am that I am from out of nowhere  
to fight without a cause  
Roots strain against the grain  
With brute force you'd better  
Hold out when you're in doubt  
Question what you see  
And when you find an answer  
Bring it home to me.

Turn the lights down  
Way down low  
Turn up the music  
Hi as fi can go  
All the gang's here  
Everyone you know  
It's a crazy scene  
Hey there just look over your shoulder  
Get the picture?  
  
No no no no (Yes)  
Walk a tightrope  
Your life-sign-line  
Such a bright hope  
Right place, right time  
What's your number?  
Never you mind  
Take a powder  
But hang on a minute what's coming round the corner?  
Have you a future?  
  
No no no no (Yes)  
Well I've been up all night again  
Party-time wasting is too much fun  
Then I step back thinking  
Of life's inner meaning  
And my latest fling  
It's the same old story  
All love and glory  
It's a pantomime  
  
If you're looking for love  
In a looking glass world  
It's pretty hard to find  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't trade you  
For another girl  
Divine intervention  
Always my intention  
So I take my time  
  
I've been looking for something  
I've always wanted  
But was never mine  
But now I've seen that something  
Just out of reach, glowing  
Very Holy grail  
Oh mother of pearl  
Lustrous lady  
Of a sacred world  
  
Thus: even Zarathustra  
Another-time-loser  
Could believe in you  
With every goddess a let down  
Every idol a bring down  
It gets you down  
But the search for perfection  
Your own predilection  
Goes on and on and on and on  
Canadian Club love  
A place in the Country  
Everyone's ideal  
  
But you are my favorita  
And a place in your heart dear  
Makes me feel more real  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't change you  
For the whole world  
You're highbrow, holy  
With lots of soul  
  
Melancholy shimmering  
Serpentine sleekness  
Was always my weakness  
Like a simple tune  
But no dilettante  
Filigree fancy  
  
Beats the plastic you  
Career girl cover  
Exposed and another  
Slips right into-view  
Oh looking for love  
In a looking glass world  
Is pretty hard for you  
Few throwaway kisses  
The boomerang misses  
Spin round and round  
Fall on featherbed quilted  
Faced with silk  
  
Softly stuffed eider down  
Take refuge in pleasure  
Just give me your future  
We'll forget your past  
Oh mother of pearl  
Submarine lover  
  
In a shrinking world  
Oh lonely dreamer  
Your choker provokes  
A picture cameo  
Oh mother of pearl  
So so semi-precious  
In your detached world  
Oh mother of pearl  
I wouldn't trade you  
For another girl

Walking home tonight  
It came as no surprise  
Certain parties making out  
Before my eyes  
My little girl  
  
Or woman of the world  
There's a small cafe  
Where lovers take their time  
It's good for rainy days  
Too bad the weather's fine  
My little girl  
  
Or woman of the world  
What's the story?  
True to life or just a lie  
See you later  
What's so new about goodbye?  
My little girl  
Or woman of the world

Before the morning comes, will I hear your song  
Come little nightingale, I won't be here for long  
When you're up there flying, do you care  
If there's no one else around?  
When your lover leaves you in the air  
Do you waver, do you fall?  
  
Now while the moon is high  
Shall we, nightingale,  
Duet all through the night  
A pair of souls for sale  
Stars cluster glistening  
Captive till the dawn  
Patiently listening  
They've heard it all before  
Should I stay here or should I go?  
  
I couldn't bear to be alone  
Was it really love I saw?  
Oh, now I'll never know  
What is this I hear?  
I recognize that song  
Sweet little nightingale I knew you'd come along  
Soon when the morning comes.  
We will both be gone  
So sing pretty nightingale  
Lead, I'll follow on.

So there goes your life  
Disappeared from ever loving friends  
And now a slave to obsession  
Your strange delight  
You lie awake  
  
How your senses ache  
Shaking off the night  
Is there more strange delight?  
There goes your self  
In the clear forever out of line  
And there you'll stray through obsession  
Your strange delight  
Can't bear this heat  
  
Your poor heart skips a beat  
Tearing off the years  
To when you really cared  
So where's your soul?  
In the field where every story ends  
And then how plain your obsession  
Your strange delight  
So this is hell  
  
Not so hard to tell  
Better men than I  
Have tried your strange delight  
Is there no strange delight?

Oh Yeah  
Roxy Music  
Brian Ferry  
  
Some expression in your eyes  
Overtook me by surprise  
Where was I how was I to know'  
How can we drive to a movie show  
When the music is here in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
They playing Oh Yeah on the radio  
And so came to be our song  
  
And so on through all summer long  
Day and night drifting into love  
Driving you home from a movie show  
So in tune to the sounds in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
They playing Oh Yeah on the radio  
It's some time since we said goodbye  
And now we lead our separate lives  
But where am I where can I go'  
  
Driving alone to a movie show  
So I turn to the sounds in my car  
There's a band playing on the radio  
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars  
There's a band playing on the radio  
And it's drowning the sound of my tears  
They're playing Oh Yeah on the radio

All you cares  
Now they seem  
Oh so far away  
All your fears  
I fear I once shared  
Now I know  
  
There's a future  
For all of us  
Not so long ago  
I was so scared  
You seemed so sad  
I could see  
  
Through your twisted smile  
So unsure  
Always confused  
Pale blue eyes  
Gazing down  
From your ivory tower  
Through the haze  
  
All broken and bruised  
Then: out of the blue  
Love came rushing in  
Out of the sky  
Came the sun  
Out of left field  
Came a lucky day  
Out of the blue  
No more pain  
I don't mind  
If it's only  
A passing craze  
Throwaway lines  
Often ring true  
If I were you  
  
I would stay  
For a little while  
I you were me  
Would you walk out  
In style?

Oh baby this is nowhere.  
Wish I was somewhere, over you.  
Your sweet lips tell me there's no chance  
No more romance, over you.  
Oh baby  
  
How can I go on.  
Crying so long, over you.  
Where strangers look for new love  
I'm so lost in love, over you.  
  
Some day  
Yes  
It might come  
Babe  
  
When I'll bebabe, over you.  
And always up to that moment  
I will try to say I'm, over you.  
  
Oh baby  
How can I go on?  
Crying so long, over you.  
Where stranger look for new love  
I'm so lost in love, over you.

Texas That's where I  
Belong  
It seems to me  
Texas Lonesome star  
Shine on  
The big country  
Texas With open skies  
And you  
For company  
Texas Oh prairie rose  
How happy  
I should be  
  
Hey hey You can take it from me  
Hey hey I'll be coming, you'll see  
Hey hey Oh what a state to be in  
Hey hey You're tantalizing me  
Texas I will compose  
In fancy rhyme  
Or just plain prose  
Texas A song of praise  
  
To you  
Prairie rose  
Texas Though I'm not sure  
I can explain  
Your strange allure  
Texas Prairie rose  
A crown of thorns  
A scented flower  
  
Hey hey I'd better leave right away  
Hey hey I can hear you calling me  
Prairie rose

Try on your love  
Like a new dress  
The fit and the cut  
Your friends to impress  
Try on your smile,  
Square on your face  
Showing affection  
Should be no disgrace  
Try out your God  
Hope He will send  
Kindness from strangers  
  
On whom you depend  
Try on His coat  
A mantle most fine  
Myriad colors  
His harmony-thine  
Believe in me  
Once seemed a good line  
Now belief in Jesus  
Is faith more sublime  
Head in the clouds  
But I can't see the Lord  
Short of perfection  
I'll try to be good  
I'll stand at His gate  
I'll wait for His sign  
Then I'll walk in His garden  
  
When it's my time  
Drink from His cup  
Hush now don't you cry  
His quiet waters  
Will never, never run dry  
Nearing death's vale  
He's here by my side  
He leads me to paradise  
A mountain so high  
Don't be afraid  
Just treasure His word  
Singing His praises  
I know that I'll be heard  
He's gonna take you by the hand  
He's gonna make you feel so good  
Open up your eyes  
  
And then you'll see all that you should  
Forget all your troubles  
You will feel no pain  
He's all that you need  
He's your everything  
When I'm feeling all at sea  
Deliverance is that distant shore  
I will not be worried  
Someday His house will be my home  
For ever more

Couldn't sleep a wink last night  
Oh how I'd love to hold you tight  
They say you have a secret life  
Made sacrifice your key to paradise  
Never mind, take the world by storm  
Just boogaloo a rhapsody divine  
Take a sweet girl just like you  
How nice if only we could bill and coo  
I may seem a fool to you for everything I say or think or do  
How could I apologies for all those lies  
The world may keeps us far apart but up in heaven, angel  
You can have my heart  
Diamonds may be your best friend  
But like laughter after tears  
I'll follow you to the end

You better take what's left  
'Cause I'm feeling rough  
In dread of the night getting high  
And name on the dress  
Stretch far too long  
But it pleases the mind  
And that's nice  
Rain rain rain  
  
She put her head on the line  
When she come strong  
A single girl about town  
And she stands or fall  
By the way she moves  
Ahead of her time  
She can't lose  
Rain rain rain  
  
You got trouble in mind  
Gets deep 'n' worse  
Oh please don't stop getting high  
You got lust for life  
It don't seem to die  
Gonna last for ever  
Getting high  
Rain rain rain

There's that melody again  
Burning through my head it does me in  
Turns me right around to my old friend  
Wonder how you've changed, are you still  
  
Running wild, like you do  
When all your dreams come true  
Happy days you pretend  
That your love will never end  
There's that melody again  
  
Where it's coming from I must have been  
Drifting out of time, now I'm in  
Underneath you'll find I'm just the same  
Running wild, like you do  
When all your dreams fall through  
  
I can always pretend  
That I'll fall in love again  
Running wild, like we do  
If only dreams came true  
I could even pretend  
That I'll fall in love again

Nothings last forever  
Of that I'm sure  
Now you've made an offer  
I'll take some more  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Will I still survive  
The same old scene?  
In our lighter moments  
precious few  
  
It's all that heavy weather  
We're going through  
When I turn the corner  
I can't believe  
  
It's still the same old movie  
That's haunting me  
Young loving may be  
Oh so mean  
  
Trying to revive  
The same old scene  
Young loving may be  
So extreme  
  
Maybe we should try  
The same old scene [Repeats]  
Nothings last forever  
Of that I'm sure  
Now you've made an offer  
I'll take some more

I've been thinking now for a long time  
How to go my own separate way  
It's a shame to think about yesterday,  
It's a shame  
Now that we are lonely  
Life seems to get hard  
Alone what a word - lonely  
Alone it makes me cry  
Thought-train set in motion  
Wheels in and around  
Express our emotion  
Tracks up, then it cracks down  
We've been running round in our present state  
Hoping help would come from above  
But even angels there make the same mistakes  
In love

Surely you cannot be leading me on?  
Well if that's so, however can I love again?  
How could I believe again?  
How can I hold on?  
Sentimental fool  
  
Knowing that fate is cruel,  
You ought to forget it.  
Yes, I know it's true,  
I've seen what love can do,  
But I don't regret it.  
Oh, you silly thing  
Don't you see what's happening?  
You're better without it.  
  
No, that's not the case  
If you were in my place,  
You never would doubt it.  
  
Sentimental fool  
Who broke the golden rule,  
You couldn't resist it.  
Though it's all in vain,  
I'd do it all again  
Just to relive a minute.  
A woman in love  
Can make you feel good  
  
You know what you're living for.  
She'll give you so much  
And keep you in touch  
With all that's worth living for.  
Oh once she gets in  
Through thick and through thin  
She'll show you what living's for.  
  
The rhythm of love  
It must go on  
Can't stop.  
The beat of your heart  
Is like a drum  
Will it stop?

Darkness falls  
Around your window pane  
A light still burns  
But just a smouldering flame  
Is it the end of another affair  
An open engagement with gloom  
Or will you be smiling  
When the sun conjures up  
A broken spell au clair de lune?  
  
Silhouette  
As you draw the shade  
Cloak of night  
You know it's tailor-made  
G-Plan gymnastics  
By an everglow fire  
Could never mean the same  
As summer enchantment  
By an old mill steam  
From courtly love to costly game  
Maybe I'm wrong for seeming  
Ungrateful, unforgiving  
Oh how it hurts now you're finally leaving  
I couldn't take anymore  
  
Now's the time!  
Let's hide away  
Sacred hours  
Saved from yesterday  
Boo-hoo willows weep around you still  
Mirror reflections of dew  
But waterfall pages of an open book  
Could shower new horizons soon  
Call the tune  
Will you swoon  
As I croon  
Your serenade

Now you're talking in headlines  
Up to the minute and free  
Stop press, hold the front page  
Up as a mirror  
Are you reading me?  
Watch you walking in waltz time  
A jigsaw puzzle in tune  
Or are you faking a straight line  
To suit yourself too soon  
Rather nouveau than never  
Contemporary ideal  
  
Some natural kind of poet might slow it  
But she sells more my speed  
She sells country and modern  
Ancient western song  
Of oriental confusion  
You so right, me so wrong  
Now you're fixing to fly me  
Auto-erotic, please,  
On the break that you're gliding.  
  
Your lingerie's a gift-wrap  
Slip it to me  
Nine till five  
The daily grind  
Made-up lies  
Make up my mind  
Same machine consuming you  
Consuming you  
Oh why  
She sells  
I need  
Oh why love why  
She sells  
I need.

Now the ballroom's empty  
Everybody I have known  
Has been and gone  
With the music over  
Here am I  
A shadow echoing on  
Spin me round  
  
Now there must be something  
In what they say of all things  
Great and small  
There's dozen roses  
Lying almost dying  
To say all  
Spin me round  
  
A nether world dancing toy  
I'm wired for sound  
Does it matter to me  
Who turns the key?  
Now if life is for living  
Then the way is clear  
But I don't understand  
Why the dream has ended  
Yet I can't wake up  
Lend a hand  
Spin a round

Dear Hyde  
No more can I  
Explain, I've tried  
With words in vain  
They pass you by  
Like falling rain  
From perfect skies  
Still falls the rain  
Inside  
  
Hey brother don't be square  
Here it is not over there  
I'm your man, I've got it made  
You need my fire you need my shade  
You're here Hyde  
  
Once more inspire  
This strangely tied  
Uncertain frame  
So torn inside  
Still falls the rain  
Two minds, one vein  
Still falls the rain  
Inside  
  
Hey doctor don't be scared  
It's you and me so where's my share?  
I'm the man just move aside  
Call me mister call me Hyde  
Hey lover don't be shy  
I'm a single minded guy  
  
Better watch me, boy I'm rough  
Half a man ain't strong enough  
Hey brother don't be square  
Here it is not over there  
I'm your man, I've got it made  
You feed my fire you need my shade

Wish everybody would leave me alone -yeah  
They're always calling on my telephone  
When I pick it up there's no one there  
So I walk outside just to take the air  
Come on with me cruising down the street  
Who knows what you'll see, who you might meet  
This brave new world's not like yesterday  
It can take you higher than the milky way  
  
Now I'm blinded I can't really see, yeah  
No more bright lights confusing me, no  
Don't ask me why I'm feeling blue  
'Cause loving you is all I can do  
Hey good-looking boys, gather around  
The sidewalk papers gutter-press you down  
All those lies can be so unkind,  
They can make you feel like you're losing your mind  
  
Street Life  
Street Life  
Street Life  
What a Life  
  
Back to nature boys, Vasser girls too  
Watch what you say, or think, or do  
Continental-style strasse girls might  
But you know exactly if it's wrong or right  
Education is an important key, yes  
But the good life's never won by degrees, no  
  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale  
Only window shopping, it's strictly no sale  
Week end starts Friday soon after eight  
Your jet black magic helps you celebrate  
You may be stranded if you stick around  
And that's really something

Before I die I'll write this letter  
Here are the secrets you must know  
Until the cloak of evening shadow  
Changes to mantle of the dawn  
Will it be sunny then I wonder'  
Rolling and turning  
How can I sleep'  
Hold on till morning  
What if I fall'  
  
Over the hills and down the valleys  
Soaring aloft and far below  
Lying on stony ground the fragments  
Truth is the seed we tried to sow  
Marking the time spent on our journey  
There isn't much we have to show  
Counting the cost in money only  
Strikes me as funny don't you know'  
Tongue tied the thread of conversation  
Weighing the words one tries to use  
Nevertheless communication  
This is the gift you must not lose  
Hauling me always are the voices  
  
Tell us are you ready now'  
Sometimes I wonder if they're real  
We're ready to receive you now  
Or is it my own imagination'  
Have you any more to say'  
Guilt is a wound that's hard to heal  
It's a cross you have to bear  
Could it be evil thoughts become me  
Tell us what you're thinking now  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Magical moment  
The spell it is breaking  
There is no light here  
Is there no key

Oh look at the sun, it's all a-glow  
Slow burning star, sinking low  
Heaven knows where you go  
Out of sight, out of minds eye, no  
Aw such a shame, you must leave  
All day long you were a friend to me  
Still, the moon's company  
  
Until morning when larks will sing  
Horizon's appointment you'll keep  
For sun swept flamingos must sleep  
Scenes like these from my dreams  
Cover cutting-room floors all over  
  
Warm heart we spin slowly from view  
Why are you sad, do you disapprove?  
How we've wasted our time  
Sunset, end of my day, my decline  
Postscript you trace colors the sky  
Red-letter light fades, is filed away  
Sunburst fingers you raise  
One last sigh of farewell, goodbye

As they say, two can play  
But keep that song away from me  
In my time too much love  
Has made me sad for so long  
I was lost, can't you see  
Through the long lonely night  
  
Heaven knows, I believe  
Won't you take a chance with me  
Sometimes I get so blue  
People say I'm just a fool  
All the world, even you  
Should learn to love the way I do  
  
I was blind, can't you see  
Through the long lonely night  
Heaven knows, I believe  
You can take a chance with me

The bogus man is on his way  
As fast as he can run  
He's tired but he'll get to you  
And shoot you with his gun  
  
Focused his mind  
On something he cared about  
But it came out a shout  
Just like before  
  
The bogus man is at your heels  
Now clutching at your coat  
You must be quick now hurry up  
He's scratching at your throat  
Concealed his doubt  
By skillful evasion  
  
But he couldn't find out  
About deception  
The bogus man is on his way  
As fast as he can run  
He's tired but he'll get to you  
And show you lots of fun

The sky is dark  
The wind is cold  
The night is young  
Before it's old and grey  
We will know  
The thrill of it all  
  
The time has come  
It's getting late  
It's now or never  
Don't hesitate or stall  
When I call  
Don't spoil  
The thrill of it all  
  
And before you go to sleep at night  
Preying shadows, do they ask you why?  
And in the morning through the afternoon  
Do you wonder where you're going to?  
  
Every word I use  
Each crumpled page  
Strange ideas  
Mature with age  
Like leaves  
When autumn falls  
Turn gold  
Then they hit the ground  
  
Every time I hear  
The latest sound  
It's pure whiskey  
Reeling round and around  
My brain  
Oh and all oh that jive  
It's driving me wild  
The dizzy spin I'm in  
  
Everywhere I look  
I see your face  
I hear your name  
All over the place  
Hey girl  
Though you're gone  
Still I recall  
The thrill of it all  
  
You might as well know what is right for you  
And make the most of what you like to do  
For all the pleasure that's surrounding you  
Should compensate for all you're going through  
  
So if you're feeling fraught  
With mental strain  
Too much thinking's got you down again  
Well let your senses skip  
Stay hip  
Keep cool  
To the thrill of it all  
  
When you try too much  
You lose control  
Pressure rises  
And so I'm told  
Something's got to give  
High life ecstasy  
You might as well live  
  
I can't see  
I can't speak  
I couldn't take more than another week  
Without you, oh no  
So I will drink my fill  
Till the thrill is you  
  
Oh the thrill of it all  
Oh the thrill of it all  
No I won't forget  
The thrill of it all  
  
No no no no no no no

You might remember  
How it used to be  
3 and 9 could show you  
Any fantasy  
Parti-coloured pictures  
Now and then 3D  
No cheap nostalgia  
Conjured up by me  
Back to the old days  
Close to home  
Show me some new ways  
I'll carry on  
  
Whether making out or played out  
Three and nine make twelve  
I've a dozen reasons  
Lying on the shelf  
be feature back rows  
Filed away  
No point pretending  
Change is here to stay  
  
3 and 9 to 45  
Decimal romance  
If you've warmed to centigrade  
You stand a sporting chance  
I'm not so special  
You're a misfit too  
  
Why must they interfere  
In everything we do?  
Should we play safe now  
Or go all the way?  
Six and two threes now  
More I cannot say

I could show you in a word  
If I wanted to  
A window on a world  
With a lovely view  
From close up inside a single room  
With an open book aside  
Like you read in school  
It's so easy, believe me  
When you need fun  
  
I do anything to turn you on  
Anything to turn you on  
Is it raining in New York  
On Fifth Avenue  
  
And off Broadway after dark  
Love the lights don't you  
I could walk you through the park  
If you're feeling blue  
Or whatever  
  
Spring Summer whenever  
Winter through Fall  
I'd do anything to turn you on  
Anything to turn you on  
I could leave you as you were  
If I wanted to  
  
Then I wonder is it fair  
Now you're on your own  
Who cares about you  
Except me, God help me  
When things go wrong  
I do anything to turn you  
Must phone me, you know me  
When things go wrong  
I do anything to turn you on

Here the soil is barren  
Here, nothing grows  
But crosses  
They, know not what they do  
You, your forgiveness  
Falls as dew  
Nailed upon a wooden frame  
Twisted yet unbroken  
Open mounted a silent choir  
Understood, unspoken  
Never was there heard a sound  
Until the heavens opened  
Now the tide is turning  
To other-wordly yearning  
Through the sun's eclipse seems final  
Surely he will rise again

So it gets to seven  
And I think of nothing  
But living in darkness  
And the diamond lady  
Well she's not telling  
I don't even know her name  
  
It's amazing  
Times have changed  
In days of old  
Imagination'd leave you standing  
Out in the could  
Dancing city  
Now you're talking  
  
But where's your soul  
You've a thousand faces  
I'll never know  
There are complications  
And compensations  
If you know the game  
Agitated in Xenon nightly  
I'll take you home again  
  
Travel way downtown  
In search of nothing  
But the sky at night  
And the diamond lady  
Well she's not talking  
But that's alright  
So I turn the pages  
And tell the story  
From town to town  
  
People tell me  
Be determined  
Poor country boy  
Too much luck  
Means too much trouble  
Much time alone  
But arm in arm  
With my seaside diamond  
I'll soon be home

Make me a deal and make it straight  
All signed and sealed, I'll take it  
To Robert E. Lee I'll show it  
I hope and pray he don't blow it 'cause  
We've been around a long time just try try try tryin' to  
Make the big time  
  
Take me on a roller coaster  
Take me for an airplane ride  
Take me for a six days wonder but don't you  
Don't you throw my pride aside besides  
What's real and make believe  
Baby Jane's in Acapulco We are flyin' down to Rio  
Throw me a line I'm sinking fast  
Clutching at straws can't make it  
Havana sound we're trying hard edge the hipster jiving  
Last picture shows down the drive-in  
You're so sheer you're so chic  
Teenage rebel of the week  
Flavours of the mountain steamline  
Midnight blue casino floors  
Dance the cha-cha through till sunrise  
Open up exclusive doors oh wow!  
  
Just like flamingos look the same  
So me and you, just we two got to search for something new  
Far beyond the pale horizon  
Some place near the desert strand  
Where my Studebaker takes me  
That's where I'll make my stand but wait  
Can't you see that Holzer mane?  
What's her name Virginia Plain

All of those people  
Everywhere  
Ever so needing  
Where's it all leading  
Tell me where  
  
Nothing insincere  
I'd better have pity  
I'd better go easy  
I never will lay down  
While my heart is still beating  
Where's it all leading  
  
Walk on air  
Am I still dreaming  
Words to spare  
Lost in their meaning  
I'd better be strong now  
I'd better stop dreaming  
My heart has flown away now  
Will it never stop bleeding?

May Day  
Cut down to size again  
What then  
When less is more my friend  
I'll change  
Let me start again  
Disguise  
It's too weird to explain  
  
Why I'll  
Always call your name  
Adieu, with you  
I could be anything  
That I want to be  
Whirlwind  
Wildfire and driving rain  
Wheels spin  
Bowl me over hurricane  
Whirlwind  
Crack your cheeks and blow  
  
Me Far  
So far  
How far  
Is Shangri-la from here  
And is it this way?  
There she blows  
Tear me down tornado  
Whirlpool  
Drag me to the deeps below  
Whirlwind  
Will a wildcat strike be tame?  
  
Earthquake  
Shake me to my feet again  
It's crosswords go you near  
A fatal clue I fear  
This case is closed  
Elementally, my dear.  
Beware  
Whirlwind

Would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you?  
And in a while I'll come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Well I'm sure I'll love you all my life  
And in the morning too  
Everything you have is out of sight  
But baby I can see through you  
And in a while I'll come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Would, would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you?
