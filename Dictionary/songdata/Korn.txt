I cannot ever find a way  
To throw these darkened thoughts away  
Need a place to hide  
It's thrown in my face everyday  
Guess that's the price I have to pay  
For what's inside my mind  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
Little things tempt me everyday  
Contemplating's how I like to play  
Better not cross that line  
What's this in my head I didn't say  
It's something I can't throw away  
What's inside my mind  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive  
  
I bide my time  
I'm intertwined  
I'm falling in this place  
I thought I left behind x2  
  
I bide my time  
I'm intertwined  
I'm falling in this place  
I thought I left behind  
(Feeling so alive)  
(Feeling so alive)  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive

Favorite flag is rebel.

Little peanut.

Had your mother, your mother had your brother, it's just too bad your  
Father's mad, your mother's now your lover.  
Come on hillbilly, can your horse do a fuckin' wheelie?  
You love it down  
South in the fall, you sure do got a purdy mouth.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I love you!  
And I want you!  
And I'll suck you!  
And I'll fuck you!  
And I'll butt-fuck you!  
And I'll eat you!  
And I'll lick your little dick, motherfucker.  
Say what? Say what?

Pick me up  
Been bleeding too long  
Right here, right now  
I'll stop it some how  
  
I will make it go away  
Can't be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
  
Shut me off  
I am ready,  
Heart stops  
I stand alone  
Can't be on my own  
  
I will make it go away  
Can't be here no more  
Seems this is the only way  
I will soon be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
These feelings will be gone  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
  
Am I going to leave this place?  
What is it I'm hanging from?  
Is there nothing more to come? (am I gonna leave this place?)  
Is it always black in space?  
Am I going to take it's place?  
Am I going to leave this race? (Am I going to leave this race?)  
I guess god's up in this place?  
What is it that I've become?  
Is there something more to come? (more to come)  
  
Now I see the times they change  
Leaving doesn't seems so strange  
I am hoping I can find  
Where to leave my hurt behind  
All this shit I seem to take  
All alone I seem to break  
I have lived the best I can  
Does this make me not a man?  
Does this make me not a man?

Daddy's flown across the ocean  
Leaving just a memory  
A snapshot in the family album  
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?  
Daddy, whatcha leave behind for me?  
All in all it was just a brick in the wall  
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall  
  
We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teachers  
Leave those kids alone  
All in all it's just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
  
We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teachers  
Leave those kids alone  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
  
I don't need no arms around me  
I don't need no drugs to calm me  
I have seen the writing on the wall  
Don't think I need anything at all  
No, don't think I'll need anything at all  
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall  
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall  
  
Goodbye cruel world  
I'm leaving you today  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye all you people  
There's nothing you can say  
To make me change my mind  
Goodbye

Cracked phone line  
Means nothing  
My brain's in fights and vain  
My breathing  
So shallow  
It helps to curb the pain  
  
What's outside?  
Sneaks inside  
How we contaminate  
This warzone of my soul  
I underestimate  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
  
The pills they, quit working  
They take more than they give  
Emotions on flat line  
It's all that I can give  
  
The rising  
The falling  
My mind keeps tricking me  
It throws me a life raft  
Then leaves me out at sea  
  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
  
I've never really thought about it that much  
It's only ever violence that's in my touch  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way  
Appears, appears, appears  
I am built this way

I know what you're feeling,  
I know everything in this world surrounds me,  
I feel you're breathing,  
I feel you're screaming,  
I feel I can't go no where in this world without leaving.  
  
My mind plays tricks on me,

Are you ready to die?  
All I do is give,  
Am I wasting my time?  
  
I am ready to live.  
I am ready to die.  
All I do is give,

All I do is give.  
All I do is give.  
All I do is give.

So you've seen I've gotten this far.  
Please give me some place to worry.  
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away.  
Life sometimes pisses me off.  
It's never a good trip for me  
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away.  
Night! So I play.  
  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some patience, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.  
Is there something wrong with me?  
Once in my life I'd like to be really set free.  
  
Let me be me.  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some guidance, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
  
Take me away.  
Taken away.  
Take me away.  
Taken away.  
  
Something I get, I got to get home  
Run, run, run, run, run, run running home  
Where is my home  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some patience, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?  
  
Night! So I play.  
Give me a sign this is day.  
Give me some guidance, so I pray.  
It's time to die. Is that what I want?

So I think you are a fool  
Hanging on my every word  
It's getting ugly  
So I'm ugly  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
So I thought you disappeared  
Being alone is what you fear  
Are you lonely?  
Yes lonely  
  
Tear me from your heart  
Tearing me apart  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping, revolting  
All that shit that's who you are  
Hoping, and scolding, revolving  
Peel it back, reveal the scar  
Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
The time is coming  
God is saying  
You're really happy  
What a game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and you're to blame  
The time is coming  
You've gone insane  
You're feeling happy  
You've won the game  
The time is coming  
A bed of flames  
Your life is over and you're to blame  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling  
Everything that goes this far  
Joking and hoping, revolting  
All that shit that's who you are  
Hoping, and scolding, revolving  
Peel it back, reveal the scar  
Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are  
  
Rolling, and throwing, consoling

Loathing, exploding, controlling  
This is what you really are

I'm staring at a face  
I don't recognize  
Rotten and replaced  
Lifeless and benign  
You can never say  
That I didn't try  
I can not erase  
What's in my mind  
  
I'm the one to give to you  
I'm the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you  
  
My thoughts they interlace  
Been spun out for sometime  
I wander in this maze  
An act that is sublime  
You can never say  
That I didn't try  
I cannot erase  
What's in my mind  
  
I'm the one to give to you  
I'm the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you

Are you ready?!  
There's a place inside my mind, a place I like to hide  
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!  
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain  
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!  
  
Another place I find to escape the pain inside  
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!  
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain  
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!  
  
Deeper and deeper and deeper  
As I journey to live a life that seems to be a lost reality  
That I could never find a way to reach my inner self esteem is low  
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay  
If I don't find a way to sift through the grey that clouds my mind  
This time I look to see what's between the lines  
  
I can see, I can see, I'm going blind  
I'm blind!

It ain't fading  
Man I got to let it out  
Am I quitting?  
Screaming nothing ever comes out  
I keep feeling lost  
I'll never find my way out  
I'm not thanking them  
Unless the truth can pour out  
  
Give me some courage  
Beating me down the (?) sometime  
Are you laughing at my body?  
I hate and slide  
I hate and slide  
  
I take this time  
To let out what's inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish you'd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
My heart is breaking  
Man you really ripped it out  
You take pleasure watching as I claw my way out  
  
The hurt rising  
Soon it's going to tear my soul out  
It's not kosher feeling like I'm on my way out  
  
Give me some courage  
Beating me down the (?) sometime  
Are you laughing at my body?  
I hate and slide  
I hate and slide  
  
I'll take this time  
To let out what's inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish you'd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine  
Peeling your flesh like the way you've cut mine  
Do you feel happy you fucked up my mind  
You're going to pay this time  
  
I'll take this time  
To let out what's inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish you'd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride.  
And all this hate is bottled up inside  
  
I'll take this time  
To let out what's inside  
Cause I will panic  
Sometimes I wish you'd die  
Full of sorrow  
You may bestow my pride.  
And all this hate is bottled up inside

Day after day it's the same  
Why do we play these games?  
Reaching out for something true  
Questioning all that I do  
Gotta get back, gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Name of the game, feel the pain  
Look into my eyes and you'll see no pain  
Everything will come right back to you  
Everything you put me through  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
You know it's pulling me down  
  
Why do I feel so alone?  
So close, yet so far from home  
One thing I know I believe  
On until after they bleed  
Sin is through, sin is through  
Coming on to me while I'm coming on to you  
Never look away, never look away  
Cause once you slip you're out of my way  
Practice this one thing I say  
Never let this get away from me  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
I can't breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
You know it's pulling me down [x9]  
  
Never give up, never give up  
Never turn away or I'll be fucking you up [x2]  
  
Gotta get back, gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Feel the pain, feel the pain  
I don't need a mask to see your pain  
Sin is through, sin is through  
You're coming on to me while I'm coming on to you  
Never look away, never look away  
Once you slip you're out of my way  
  
I can't breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
You know it's pulling me down  
  
I can't breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My body's weakness  
I can't breathe  
Get out before it's too late  
  
You know it's pulling me down

Are you scared?  
  
Holding on to sacred places  
Holding on to what is found  
I'm looking forward to see their faces  
Flat on the ground, the horror profound  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Smashed on the ground in your own debris  
While choking on your blood from the sodomy  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery  
  
All the damage it just erases  
Mediocrity all around  
The grandiose disorder replaces  
Conditions of peace, is this my release?  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Smashed on the ground in your own debris  
While choking on your blood from the sodomy  
None of you people mean shit to me  
Sadistic little fucking fantasy  
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery  
  
(La la la)  
  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Burn the Obedient  
Now  
  
Walk the path of secrecy  
Used to heartless mockery  
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes  
Your misery

From the End Of Days Soundtrack  
You can see I fly  
Disguised evil attracting everybody  
You can watch me play  
Taste your juices from me all day  
  
You can see I tried this all for you  
You can see I dispise all of you  
You can see I'm trying something new  
You can see me fly  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometime, somewhere  
Deceit leads you no where  
You try so hard  
To be the (super star?)  
  
So come in with me  
Take your under sun light set you free  
Somewhere can't you see  
Going on this way  
Free you'll never be  
  
So you see I tried this all for you  
So you see I dispise all of you  
So you see I'm trying something new  
So you see me fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just take me away  
Take me away (Take me)  
Take me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me away...  
Take... me... away...

Yeah.  
  
I should have known it from the start what I was in for.  
She break a tin full,  
she copied, we exchanged some info.  
Called her on the tele, conversations were simple,  
ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo.  
And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames,  
Nimpho's in the park, just dancin' in the rain.  
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim,  
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins.  
  
So baby I ask you...  
What do you want from me?  
  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
  
Rest us, rest us from the pain, if I ask.  
Ashamed cos a game keep playin' me wrong.  
Promise not to ever sing a damn 'nother song,  
Until I realize who the fuck I am.  
  
A man out of sync with his own program,  
trying to find some kind of inner link.  
A man out of sync with his own program,  
trying to find some kind of inner link.  
  
So baby I ask you...  
Jonathan: What do you want from me?  
  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
  
Ahh yeah.  
  
She's the epitomy of sweet misery,  
The sweeter the stroke, the deeper the pain given.  
There's an angel, angle sex-driven.  
Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten.  
Fittin' like a glove, with abstract relations,  
Testin' all my patience, push comes to shove.  
Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love,  
Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above.  
  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.  
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt  
You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked.

Pain!  
Buried so fly away  
Enter my life of nothing  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Hanging so high always  
Burying my life so slowly  
  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
It opens my mind to feelings  
I can't face boredom without something  
  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
  
Me entering my head  
Feeling like I'm God  
With the world around me  
Can't you feel this pain?  
Reaming through my heart!  
Screaming through my veins!  
Nothing I can kill!  
Screaming a Lie! Lie! Lie!  
Can't you feel this My! Eyes! Out!  
Can't you take my heart away  
Take my heart, Goodbye  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!

Keep holding on  
When my brains tickin' like a bomb  
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me  
Sweet bitter words  
Unlike nothing I have heard  
Sing along Mocking bird  
You don't affect me  
  
That's right!  
Deliver it to my heart!  
Please strike!  
Be deliberate  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone  
Irate  
I'm coming undone  
Too late  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Choke, choke again  
I thought my demons were my friends  
Pity me in the end  
They're out to get me  
Since I was young  
I tasted sorrow on my tongue  
And this sweet chocolate gun does not protect me  
  
That's right!  
Trigger between my eyes  
Please strike!  
Make it quick now!  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone  
I'm irate  
I'm coming undone  
Too late  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate  
I'm coming undone  
What looks so strong, so delicate  
  
I'm trying to hold it together  
Head is lighter than a feather  
Looks like I'm not getting better  
Not getting better  
  
Wait  
I'm coming undone irate  
I'm coming undone too late  
I'm coming undone  
Wait  
I'm starting to suffocate  
And soon I anticipate

I can't bare to face what's growing in my head.  
Please get away from me.  
Take advantage of what I still guess you do.  
One day you'll pay for me.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
You just see me as something you throw around.  
You were there for me (there for me).  
Beating down to the ground yes it always seems.  
You take more from me (from me).  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
It's funny how we get started.  
They get their money from the things on you.  
They get your money and the girls and the fame.  
I only do it for the fun.  
  
That's my game.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.  
  
So I'm saying nothing.  
Each day taking that much more.  
As I'm screaming all my pain.  
You will be there counting.

Why can't you ever back down?  
Why can't you just shut your face?  
Oh God, the feelings I feel  
Would get me thrown in a cage.  
You're the one who's always screaming at me,  
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free.  
What the fuck more do you want me to be?  
Why must you do this to me?  
  
Run away, I can't stay.  
Lead the way, make them pay.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.  
  
You see the pain in my face  
While you keep putting me down.  
Inside the rage starts to build,  
You push me, I won't go down.  
You're the one who's always screaming at me,  
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free.  
What the fuck more do you want me to be?  
Why must you do this to me?  
  
Run away, I can't stay.  
Lead the way, make them pay.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.  
  
Could it really be the day, today?  
Could this really make the problems go away?  
I'm going to hurt just not in time.  
  
Right now  
I'm taking all I can now.  
Right now  
You've torn us all apart.  
Right now  
There is nothing you can do to stop me.  
Right now, right now, right now, right now,  
Right now, right now, right now, right now,  
Right.  
  
Counting on me,  
Always hoping I'll be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn you're never there for me.  
You sucked the life out of me,  
You hate everything you see.  
I can't take this anymore,  
I always stay when I should leave.

Mother please forgive me  
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering  
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you  
I'm your son  
  
Little child, looking so pretty  
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy  
Innocent child, looking so sweet  
A rape in my eyes and on your flesh I'll eat  
  
You've raped!  
I feel dirty  
It hurt!  
As a child  
Tied down!  
That's a good boy  
And fucked!  
Your own child  
I scream!  
No one hears me  
It hurt!  
I'm not a liar  
My God!  
Saw you watching  
Mommy why?!  
Your own child  
  
It's alright  
  
I didn't touch you there  
Mama said she didn't care  
I didn't touch you there  
That's why mama stopped and stared  
  
I fucking hate you! Motherfucker!  
Motherfucker! I fucking hate you! Fuck you!  
You son of a bitch, you fucking ruined my life!  
I wanted to die!  
I'm sick of it, mother fucker, oh oh  
Why'd you fuck'n do it to me?  
I hate you!  
I fuck'n hate you!  
I hate you!  
Why?!  
I hate you!

Come on, step inside, and you will realize  
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be  
What's your vision?  
You'll see, what do you expect of me?  
I can't live that lie  
Hate!  
  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
with your life's dead bodies everywhere  
You  
  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Let me strip the plain, let me not give in  
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies  
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me  
Let me live my life  
  
Hate!  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son, why?  
You make me feel like no one  
You want me to be, something I can never ever be!  
I sing my words, I thought that didn't  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Dead bodies everywhere!

Realize that I can never win  
Sometimes I feel like I have failed  
Inside where do I begin  
My mind is laughing at me  
  
Tell me why am I to blame on me  
Are we supposed to be the same, that's why  
I will never change this thing that's burning in me  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Sometimes I can never tell  
If I got something that remains  
That's why I just hang in grief  
Or this I just let me be  
  
Tell me why am I to blame on me  
Are we supposed to be the same, that's why  
I will never change this thing that's burning in me  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Betrayed,  
I feel so insane  
I really tried  
I did my time  
I did my time  
I did my time  
  
I did my time  
I did my time  
  
I am the one who chose my path  
I am the one who couldn't last  
I feel the life pulled from me  
I feel the anger changing me  
  
Oh god the anger changing me  
Oh god the anger changing me

The madness creeping up on me  
The pressure's building, I foresee  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day (x2)  
  
Misery often misleads  
It creates things we can not see  
Excessive thoughts unbound  
Distorting reality  
  
Slowly escaping  
This carnage in making  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day (x4)  
  
Hello  
Are you there?  
How come?  
Won't you listen?  
I really don't care (x2)  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
Nothing will be the same  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day

Keep knocking.  
No one's there.  
Pouring down.  
Near be felt.  
I'm out here by myself.  
All alone.  
Ready to blow my head off.  
I hurt so bad inside.  
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.  
It stays the same.  
I just want to laugh again.  
  
Keep hoping.  
Nothing to spare.  
So my life.  
Isn't quite there.  
Feel like a whore.  
A dirty whore.  
Such a whore.  
Dirty.  
  
I'm out here by myself.  
All alone.  
Ready to blow my head off.  
I hurt so bad inside.  
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.  
It stays the same.  
I just want to laugh again.  
  
Into you.  
You dirty little fuck.  
Dirty little fuck.  
You dirty little fuck.  
Dirty little fuck.  
You dirty little fuck (I will take it).  
Dirty little fuck (I will take it).  
You dirty little fuck (I will take it).  
Dirty little fuck (I will take it).  
You dirty little fuck.  
  
I'm out here, by myself.  
All alone.  
Ready to blow my head off.  
I hurt so bad inside.  
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.  
It stays the same.  
I just want to laugh again

I hide, only to defy you  
Take away the only love inside you  
I see your face through everyone  
Inside I've just begun!  
You think I'm out to scare you  
I'm only up to prepare you for when you stop and turn around  
Your body's going down!  
  
You're gonna waste your time,  
Your life will soon be mine,  
You're definitely one of a kind, and  
You're suffering 'cause of me - it's divine  
  
Tell me why you never liked me  
Tell me why it's that you fight me  
Pulled out and wait for the perfect time to take what's rightfully mine  
You think they're dumb to defy me  
You said you don't want to defy me  
You wait to dumb run anyone  
Oh well  
  
Fuck you!  
I'm fed up with you!  
I'm not as good as you?  
Fuck no, I'm better than you!  
Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game?!  
You try to say what you got  
We're ripping at your brain!

Walk away when you're angry  
Brace yourself, there's nothing to gain  
Old enough to know the outcome  
More blood, it's always the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
The God reserved a false alarm  
Aren't we cool and arent we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
Wait  
But you live, dont be cursing  
You mustn't take gods name in vain  
Wait  
Put your knife forward the curtain  
Impulsives, you must refrain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
So we carry on  
With this burden  
I can't remember anything  
I can't be certain  
  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on

Here I am different in this normal world  
Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset  
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads  
I am ugly.  
Please just go away  
I can see inside you fine  
This blessing in disguise  
Why you treat me this way?  
Make the hate stay  
A cell locked, I can never see no escape  
All the laughing, all the pain  
If you were me, what would you do?  
Nothing, probably.  
You'd just go on your way  
Fagot!  
  
I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it  
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it  
It keeps going on day after day, son  
You fake, if you don't want none  
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday  
Who gives a fuck right now I got something to say to all the people  
That think  
  
I'm strange and I should be out of here locked up in a cage  
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway  
You got this pretty-boy feeling like I'm enslaved to a world that  
Never appreciated shit  
You can suck my dick and fucking like it!  
Hear my gun, but he has a body mighty  
  
Any say, anyway, going to say, anyway, any say,  
Going away, going to say, anyway  
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl  
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world  
All my life, who am I?!  
  
I'm just a fagot!  
Fagot!  
I'm a fagot!  
Fagot!  
I'm not a fagot!  
(Or am I?)  
Fagot!  
You motherfucking queers!

Hey I'm feeling tired  
My time is gone today  
You flirt with suicide  
Sometimes that's ok  
Hear what others say  
I'm here standing hollow  
Falling away from me  
Falling away from me  
Day is here fading  
That's when I would say  
I flirt with suicide  
Sometimes kill the pain  
I can always say  
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'  
Falling away from me  
Falling away from me  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me, beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground  
  
(Falling away from me)  
It's spinning round and round  
(Falling away from me)  
It's lost and can't be found  
(Falling away from me)  
It's spinning round and round  
(Falling away from me)  
So down  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me, beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me, beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground  
  
Pressing me, they won't go away  
So I pray, go away  
  
It's falling away from me  
  
Beating me down  
Beating me, beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground  
Screaming so sound  
Beating me, beating me  
Down, down  
Into the ground

I'm over it  
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss  
Clouded by memories of the past  
At last, I see  
  
I hear it fading  
I can't speak it  
Or else you will dig my grave  
We fear them finding  
Always whining  
Take my hand now  
Be alive  
  
You see I cannot be forsaken  
Because I'm not the only one  
We walk amongst you  
Feeding, raping  
Must we hide from everyone  
  
I'm over it  
Why can't we be together  
Erase it  
Sleeping so long  
Taking up the mass  
At last, I see  
  
My fear is fading  
I can't speak it  
Or else you will dig my grave  
You fear them finding  
Always winding  
Take my hand now  
Be alive  
  
You see I cannot be forsaken  
Because I'm not the only one  
We walk amongst you  
Feeding, raping  
Must we hide from everyone  
  
You see I cannot be forsaken  
Because I'm not the only one  
We walk amongst you  
Feeding, raping  
Must we hide from everyone  
  
Everyone  
Everyone  
Everyone (fading out)

Oh my God! I'm feeling crazy man  
What could it be?  
As I walk into this place everyone's staring at me  
Somehow I feel I've got a fucked up disease  
As I part the seas  
Fingers come out pointing at me  
Do I make you laugh?  
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha  
Or funny queer?  
Bitch, get outta here  
Let me make myself clear  
I don't give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
Oh my god! This shit is crazy man  
Look at this scene as I watch these  
Stupid people act like they are machines  
They should really all drop their knees  
Oh, the jealousy that's the one thing I guarantee  
Do I make you laugh?  
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha  
Or funny queer shit? Get out of here  
Let me make myself clear  
I don't give a fuck  
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
  
What's with the hostility?  
Why is it so provoked?  
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy  
Feel that you're superior  
I feel your just plain absurd  
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred  
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me  
It just fuels the comedy

I am clearly broken  
And no one knows what to do  
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit so I bound them into you  
Itching is a pulse inside  
Creeping out to come alive  
It's just doing what it's gonna do  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]  
  
I can't wait to rip my eyes out and look at you  
Peace through pain is precious  
Especially when it's done by you  
  
Itching is a pulse inside  
Creeping out to come alive  
It's just doing what it's gonna do  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space  
Tortured by my memories  
Of what I left behind  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]  
  
Shut  
Up  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space  
Tortured by my memories  
Of what I left behind  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]

You came into my life  
Without a single thing  
I gave into your ways  
Which left me with nothing  
I've given empty smiles  
I've dealt with all your games  
I wish you'd bet right now  
I had to let you win  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
I scream without a sound  
How could you take away  
Everything that I was  
Made me a fuckin' slave  
Your face that I despise  
Your heart inside that's gray  
I came today to say  
You're fucked in every way  
  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry  
  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!  
  
In the sea of life you're just a minnow  
Live your life insecure  
Feel the pain of your needles  
As they shit into my mind  
You stole my life  
Without a sigh  
You sucked me dry

Hate, something, sometime, someway, something kick off the for me  
Something, inside  
I'll never ever follow  
So give me something that is for real  
I'll never ever follow  
  
Get your boogie on  
  
Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness  
Why? This shit inside  
Now everyone will follow  
So give me nothing just feel  
And now this shit will follow  
  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
  
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me  
I don't feel your deathly ways  
Each day I feel so hollow, inside I was beating me  
You will never see, so come dance with me  
  
Dance with me  
Rumbiddieboo  
Rum bum dee dumb dee bum diddie doo  
Lie!  
  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
God begs me, the more I see the light, who wants to see?  
God told me, I've already got the light, oh I say  
  
Got the life  
  
Got the life

hide inside my head  
i cant stand all the things they said, made me crazy  
born into hate never to appreciate  
me or you or things i should do  
  
was i ever innocent  
little boy lost inside his self  
dont know where i can hide  
but inside  
who will free me?  
  
take it all away  
blinded from another day  
sparks fly in my closed eyes  
as i hide from the demons inside  
where will i run tomorrow?  
will i soon have footsteps to follow?  
can you tell me where is my soul?  
guess thats the devils toll  
  
was i ever innocent  
little boy lost inside his self  
dont know where i can hide  
but inside  
who will free me?  
  
you dont know who i am  
you dont know where ive been  
so dont act like you do  
cause you dont ever want to know the truth

Do you really want to see?  
I don't think I can take this anymore  
You are fucking naive and I am nothing  
I'm disgusting and so much more  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial I've been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Do you really want to see the  
Torment hatred of this world  
Hand in a book and I believed it  
All it brought me was pain and more  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial I've been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial I've I been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
I believe, I believe  
  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Lies I told you  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial I've been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
  
I believe  
I never meant to hurt you  
I believe  
I never meant to betray you  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to hurt you

Am I asleep?  
Or have I died  
(wanting peace)  
We fall in space  
(wanting peace)  
We can't look down,  
Death may come,  
(something takes a hold of me)  
Peace I have found  
(something takes a hold of me)  
I want to say my whole life,  
Am I asleep?  
We fall down.  
We come to this place  
Falling through time,  
Living a hollow life,  
Always we're taking  
Waiting for signs,  
Hollow lives  
Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?  
Search in vane?  
Asking why?  
All alone?  
Where is god?  
Looking down?  
We don't know? [Repeat x2]  
We fall in space  
We can't look down  
Death may come.  
Peace I have found

This sunny Sunday  
Is a good day to go  
Guess you want me to stay  
Well let me know  
And I hate to say  
It's been a waste of time  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
  
[Chorus]  
Why, Why, Why  
Hushabye  
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?  
Why, Why, Why  
Hushabye  
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?  
  
You say you'd love to  
But you've lost what's left to do  
Almost decided to stay because of you  
And I'm here today to exchange your dreams  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why, why  
What you hanging up for?  
What you doing that for?  
What you breakin' up for?  
Why, hushabye  
  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
Soothing Sunday is a good day to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hushabye  
Why, why, why I  
What you breaking up for?  
Why, why  
Hushabye

[Repeat: x10]  
Your messiah was never mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Drops of blood drip off your medals  
Representing all our tears  
in a ring of burning metal  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
?  
To define the what and why  
People travel across this earth  
Over water, land, and sky  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
Your messiah was never mine  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Purity unlike no other  
Offers help to those who need it  
Don't forget care to the brother  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
Little lady at home  
Writing out a check to send  
It's all the money that she owns  
She believes the world might end  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
Your messiah was never mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!

What you gonna do and what you gonna feel when suddenly I slip away?  
Almost am a ghost of who I use to be, yesterday  
How you going to touch and how will you collect the beauty when it turns to
dust?  
Everything we make, the cells we generate are both of us  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
Hold you in my arms, I'll hold you in my gaze, singing with my dying breath  
Underneath this earth I'd resurrect your soul and nothing less  
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void an ocean wouldn't hold the love  
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will forget me  
I will protect you [x9]  
  
[Chorus]  
Please be aware that I am you  
Nothing could be more certain  
This ain't the time, the place, for us to understand this life  
  
This ain't the time, this ain't the place [x4]  
  
This ain't the time, this ain't the place [x3]  
  
I will protect you [x5]

All right stop  
Collaborate and listen  
Ice is back, I got a brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop?  
Yo--I don't know  
Turn off the lights and I'll glow  
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.  
  
Too cold, Too cold (x3) Too cold  
  
Don't you be talkin that shit (x6)  
  
Dance  
Bum rush the speaker that booms  
I'm killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly, when I play a dope melody  
Anything less that the best is a felony  
Love it or leave it  
You better gain way  
You better hit bull's eye  
The kid don't play  
If there was a problem  
Yo, I'll solve it  
Check out the hook while my dj revolves it  
  
Ice Ice Baby (4X)  
  
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet  
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it  
My town, that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed  
This is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and you want to step with this  
Dj plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast  
Other dj's say, "Damn"  
If my rhyme was a drug  
I'd sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice  
If there was a problem  
Yo--I'll solve it!  
Check out the hook while dj revolves it.  
  
Ice Ice Baby (x4)  
  
Too fuckin cold  
  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold  
Ice Ice baby too cold too cold  
Ice Ice Baby too cold too cold

We are the pain  
We are the shame  
We've gone insane  
Inside where no ones around  
  
I am to blame, for everything  
I like this game, that you all  
make me play  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We are estranged  
We are deranged  
I can't explain  
How you all break me apart  
  
I am to blame, for everything  
I like this game, that you all  
make me play  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We wait, we hate  
We try to get away  
Mistake my pain  
It has been lead astray  
I'm Looking around, I drop to the ground  
Why does it have to end this way  
  
Feeling numb, so long  
Oh God it's just everything  
It's everything  
Now I pray for all of them to go away!  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down

Maybe I'm insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe I'm the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
Tell me where to start  
Think I'm at the end  
Right now feeling pain  
Make it go away  
  
Maybe I'm to blame  
Maybe I'm a liar  
Maybe we're the same  
Nothing can start the fire  
I can't feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon I'll fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
I'm looking back and they are mine  
  
I'm hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
I'm trying to find a better way  
But I'm trapped  
Can't get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly  
  
Maybe I'm insane  
Walking on a wire  
Maybe I'm the same  
Nothing to take me higher  
I can't feel my heart  
But I feel the shame  
Nothing left to say  
Soon I'll fade away  
  
These places all I ever think about is lost in time  
These faces haunting me  
I'm looking back and they are mine  
  
I'm hiding from the things they say  
Doing time and lead astray  
Thinking back to times of yesterday  
I could fly  
  
I'm trying to find a better way  
But I'm trapped  
Can't get away  
All I think is about yesterday  
I could fly

I like the way you're so fucked up  
Naked and wearing no makeup  
I watch your pulse beneath your skin  
Sometimes I wish I could crawl in  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
I like the way your ''ribs'' contract  
When you are lying on your back  
The ''bruises you internalize'' eternalize  
The thoughts behind those crazy eyes  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
  
Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art  
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you  
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard  
  
I drink the milk that's in your breast  
I wouldn't even mind your shit  
I put my tounge inside your ear  
I'm gonna eat you up right here  
  
I don't care what you talk like  
I don't care how you dress  
I don't care 'bout your facial features  
I couldn't care less  
I don't need conversation  
I've got nothing to say  
I know what you're about  
I want you  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out

What's it gonna be today?  
Keep chipping at my soul  
And why must it disobey?  
The only thing I loathe  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!  
  
Have I been lead astray?  
Blaming the righteous  
What do you think they'd say?  
Attacking the altar  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!  
I'm done  
  
I'm done with faceless feelings  
I'm done with anything  
I'm done trying to support you  
and sacrificing everything  
  
Everything, everything!  
  
How many times a day must I die?  
Nothing's gonna work today  
I'm killing time  
Looking all around to find a way  
It's all wrong  
Knowing that my demon won  
I'm done!

I shred your bullshit poetry  
Yes it's me again  
I wreck your positivity  
Yes it's me again  
  
I fuck it to watch it bleed  
I kick it to make it scream  
I am the alternate choice to some straight life of mercy  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again  
  
I rip your throat out on a whim  
Yes it's me again  
I only ask for everything  
Yes it's me again  
I squeeze it to feel it breathe  
I smash it to fuel this need  
I am the antidote for  
Whatever sickness you feed  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again  
  
Little ms. fucker don't move an inch  
Y'all dumb suckers can't take the heat  
Your blood rushing from head to feet  
This is what I stand for  
  
All your choices that's done to man  
All you fuckers know who I am  
I'm the living proof that you can  
Turn around and say "it's me again"  
It's me again  
  
Fuck  
Fuck  
Fuck  
Fuck  
  
You see beauty, I see pain  
You see sky and I see acid rain  
  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again, it's me again (it's me again)  
It's me again

'Twas the night before Christmas  
When all through the house  
Everybody was stoned  
Even the mouse  
Man from the whore house  
And me from jail  
I just settled down  
To get a piece of her tail  
When all of a sudden  
I heard such a clatter  
I tripped on my dick  
And busted my bladder  
I went downstairs  
And what did I see?  
A fat little red fagget  
Hangin' from a tree  
He stuffed the stockings  
With reefers and beer  
And a big fat hairy dick  
For the family queer  
That's the end of my story  
Funny wasn't it, ya see?  
She didn't even  
She didn't see my thing behind ya  
Leave ya for this private eye  
I was there to give 'em near to my  
Zima zima mommy fah  
I'm gonna say this  
Hope it don't offend ya  
Came to the grizma  
Give 'em a taste of me  
Give 'em a little excitement to the damn monkey  
Your monkey can stay with me  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Chevy took my brain  
Same old motherfucker, sucked my dick that day  
He will never zima zima  
Never, never not that day  
I'm really sick of all this excitement  
Yeah, but he thinks he's better than me  
Uma zooma nooga dunga  
You can suck my dick all day  
One, two, three, four  
Santa can suck my dick all day  

You simply defy, I cannot even look to the sky,  
we try it single filed, take on me, and it's my denial,  
I cannot ever find, something safe, not done on the fly,  
I cannot live this way, floor and me will kick the P.A  
  
You want to play with me  
I'm really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
I'm gonna rock your world  
  
You say everything is fine, I cannot compete with the skies,  
my sing has crossed the line, come in me,  
I fly through the sky, I can not ever find,  
you and me will make all the lines, oh, if they could see the plague,  
no one would want to be me  
  
You want to play with me  
I'm really gonna rock your world  
You want to comfort me  
I'm gonna rock your world  
  
So I fly  
Take me  
I cannot fly  
Most people hate me  
To fly away from this pain  
Please take away  
Please take away my P.A

Lalalalalala

Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Lock him up real tight  
Throw away the key and then  
Turn off all the lights  
  
First we're going to set some bait  
Inside a nasty trap and wait  
When he comes a-sniffing  
We will snap the trap and close the gate  
  
Wait, I've got a better plan  
To catch this big red lobster man  
We'll pop him in a boiling pot  
And when he's done we'll butter him up  
  
Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Throw him in a pot  
Leave him there for ninety years  
Then see if he talks  
  
But Mr. Ogey Bogey Man  
Can take the holding over then  
He'll be so pleased, I do declare  
That he will cook him rare  
  
I say that we take a canon  
Aim it at his door and then  
Knock three times, and when he answers  
Sandy Claws will be no more  
  
Your so stupid now  
If blow him up to smithereens  
We may loose some pieces  
And then Jack will be  
  
Kidnap the Sandy Claws  
Tie him in a bag  
Throw him in the ocean then  
See what makes him sad  
  
Because Mr. Ogey Bogey

Disgraced  
Expendable, we are not really real  
A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to it's knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
I'm not terrified anymore  
There's nothing left but open sores  
  
Disengaged  
Relinquish the reality, I've known  
I'm feeling like I'm alienated from my own and  
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to it's knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
I'm not terrified anymore  
There's nothing left but open sores  
  
Spewing bile atrocities  
Bringing existence to it's knees  
I will manifest my sins and  
I will kill mercy within  
Immersed in this hypnotic spell  
Influenced by the hate that swells  
I'm not terrified anymore  
There's nothing left but open sores  
  
Nothing left but open sores

Living life, don't you cry  
My life, pain is God  
Many nights, painful thoughts occur  
Yell at me again, I'm numb  
In denial, I tried to be your friend  
I tried to be a good boy  
All I see, a hate deep inside  
Startle me, someone save me  
Now these memories fill my heart  
They bury me  
All I want to do is kill you  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
  
Looking back, I was never ever right, you were my step mom  
who always wanted me out of your sight  
I would come walkin' in and I'd say hello but you'd slap me  
And you'd make some fucked up comment about my clothes, but I tried to let it
pass  
But the pictures in my head were with you with a knife up your ass  
Laying dead, so I popped some more caps in your ass now your son is not so fun  
Mother fucking bitch don't you ever try to play me!  
You make me lie, it hurt so  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
(You are not my real mother, I'll beat and stab and fuck her)  
  
Wish you were dead now  
Now, right now  
How can I cry over someone I never loved?  
How can I cry over someone I never loved?  
Never loved  
Never loved

Birds are circling above  
They've come back to a waiting level  
Why don't they fly away?  
  
Surely they have gangs by now  
There is no gun to shoot them down  
And still they stay  
For what they say  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be killing them with lies  
I'll be fighting for my life  
Killing them with thoughts  
They can never get enough  
Killing them all because we're killing every single thing  
It's a trained response  
  
Birds are circling above  
They've come back to a waiting level  
Sold the game  
It bears my name  
  
I have worshiped some false Gods  
And run to them like I have not thought to  
Cry my shame  
It burned a flame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We are present to raise them to die  
To die  
We are present to raise them to die  
We are present to raise them to die  
  
Somebody told me once  
Beat them until there's nothing  
Get used to it  
Next thing the line is gone  
  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going down?  
Are we going?

Some deny and search for things it never come around  
Do I feel like a fool?  
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared  
And I owe this all to you  
  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking  
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing  
  
[Chorus]  
What do I have to do?  
Why can't this hurt be through?  
I'm going head onto  
Something I know I will fail  
Why can't this kiss be true?  
Why won't you please let me through  
I don't understand why you always push me away  
  
Last thing I will like to do before it go away  
Is cry there next to you  
Cry and talk about the good all days and where they've gone  
And now how much I hate you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel the blood drip off my body as it goes right there  
  
I'm not, now  
What am I now?  
What am I now?  
What am I now?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't understand why you always push me away  
  
Why you always push me away? [x8]

Once more the pain is thrown my way  
Can't she stay away  
Every single time  
She's fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
I'm trapped inside some cage  
While she sits and smiles  
Layla  
Layla  
Once more [incomprehensible] face  
Why am I the one to blame  
Every single time  
She's screwing up my mind  
A pest in a locked up cage  
In your life born and aged  
Why can't I stand up and just say "good bye"  
Layla  
Layla  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage  
Once more pain is thrown my way  
Can't she stay away  
Every single time  
She's fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
Trapped inside some cage  
Life's not meant this way!  
Layla  
Layla  
Inside I'm afraid  
Afraid of who I am  
Can't you even feel?  
You've taken who I am  
I have fought to find a way  
I am afraid  
To feel who I am  
Fuck!  
Layla  
Layla  
That's why I cry  
This lie I drown  

All the lying and cheating will surely bite you  
Dishonesty tears you apart and will eat you  
All the anger and pain and the suffering and the shame  
And the voices in your brain will surely haunt you  
  
Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
All the anger, the pain and the suffering, and the shame  
And the voices in your brain will really haunt you  
  
Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
Now we waste our lives away  
Letting guilt lead the way  
  
I'm such a stupid fuck  
Listening to my head and not my gut  
Constantly thinking and thinking and thinking  
And thinking and thinking and thinking  
  
Now we waste our lives away  
Letting guilt lead the way  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through  
  
I tell you one thing which leads to another thing  
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings  
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything  
When this happens I can't break through

Run away to no where  
Too chicken shit to face  
I'm gonna go there  
The fear I cannot taste  
You think you got me  
You're gonna tumble down  
Keep coming for me  
I'll drop you on the ground  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, my fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
  
You're gonna feel how  
I really am with you  
You're going no where  
Don't really know what to do  
It's going to go on  
Until you run away  
You can't control me  
You best do in my way  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Let's do this now  
  
Don't you know that  
You can touch me  
Don't you know that  
You can bring me down  
Oh my life would be so easy now  
If you haven't stepped across that line  
Line! Line!  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now

Let's go!  
  
What's the problem  
Why can't you relax?  
Inside hating on everything, that makes me mad  
Love is scary and love is to blame  
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame  
Because I'm ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
Ova' you  
  
Let's go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away  
  
The solution I try to reveal  
But the question is how can you really be healed?  
Hate is scary and hate is to blame  
God, I need you and that is a shame  
Because I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Let's go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away  
  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
Gotta get away  
Can't, can't get away  
  
Lets go!  
  
I'm taking over  
I won't be lead astray  
Life's doesn't last long  
I gotta get away

My brother, you love her  
But don't give up your instincts  
Hang onto you know what  
They'll be gone fast as you blink  
They're trained to seduce you  
Suck you dry quick as they can  
They tried to reduce you  
Now you're barely a man  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
Hey you  
You're saying that she's all that you desire  
Liar  
Hey you  
You think you can throw water on this fire  
Liar  
  
It's not wrong to let go  
And let the woman ride you  
For fuck sake, don't lose touch  
With the dog that's inside you  
She wanted what you had  
You bet she smelt the spore  
Don't give up, fuck her up  
One more time, slam that door  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
(Scat)  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you

I would like to search inside for all of the things that you will hide  
What's the problem?  
Can't you seem to set loose these problems that haunt and taunt you  
I smile, but you're afraid  
You run, while you're so in pain  
Do you ever see (it from) outside your fears?  
  
Thinking about your life  
Thinking about your inner fears  
I would like to search inside for all of the things that you will hide  
What's the problem?  
  
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you  
I want you to see the life you have disguised  
The world of things that hurt you  
For all these useless lies  
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside  
  
Once I'd took you in  
I'd throw you out instead  
I try, you win  
My life is ripping your heart out and distorting my pain!

Ugh  
Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?  
Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Oh Sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time  
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
See it before my eyes  
Why!  
Go out that way  
  
Looking all the time, at your face so blind  
Feeling uptight, always the same fight  
Hey man, now decide, go ahead take your time  
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine  
Wait!  
You cannot see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
The pain in which I could not feel  
  
Hey man, look inside, know you'll need your own life  
Remember me, guy? That thorn in your spine  
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine  
Remember me, guy? The thorn in your spine  
Wait!  
You can't even see my side  
Why!  
Play yourself out that way  
Why!  
You and me always hate  
Wait!  
Weren't you my friend?  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend  
Wait! You were my friend

Feelings you see  
Are so hard to believe  
All the chaos I have in my heart  
Devils I make and the love can relate  
All the solace inside tears me up  
  
Take me away.  
Set me on fire.  
There's no other way.  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
We've been deceived.  
Its so easy for me.  
Cause' the loathing I've had from the start.  
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes.  
As I'm down on my knees torn apart.  
  
Take me away.  
Set me on fire  
There's no other way  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
Where do I run?  
Where do I hide?  
Give me a reason to end my life  
  
Where do I run?  
Where do I hide?  
Give me a reason to get out alive  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what are we doing now?  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now  
  
Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain  
So what am I doing now? (what a am I doing now?)  
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained  
I'm so lost and lonely now

Love on the rocks  
Ain't no surprise  
Just pour me a drink bitch, and I'll tell you some lies  
Got nothing to lose, so you just sing the blues, all the time  
  
I gave you my heart, gave you my soul  
You left me alone here, with nothing to hold  
Yesterday's gone, now all I want, is a smile  
  
At first they say they want you  
They really need you  
Suddenly you find you' re out there, walking in the storm  
And when they know they have you, then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You got to leave, just get away  
  
We all know the song...  
  
Need what you need, you can say what you want much you can do when the feeling
is gone  
Baby blue skies above, but it's cold, when your love's on the rocks  
  
At first they say they want you  
They really need you  
Suddenly you find you' re out there, walking in the storm  
And when they know they have you, then they really have you  
Nothing you can do or say  
You got to leave, just get away  
  
We all know the song...  
  
Love on the rocks  
Ain't no big surprise  
Just pour me a drink bitch, and I'll cover your eyes  
Yesterday's gone, and now all I want, is a smile

Mother  
You're holding my heart, screaming  
Motherfucker  
That left me broken, bleeding  
Son of  
The man you loved and left for  
The son of a bitch  
Who tried to show me death's door  
  
Oh  
  
Everything's eliminated  
Everything is dedicated  
To the meaningless stuff i've hated  
Everything was overrated  
  
Love song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here  
  
Ascend  
Obituary's rain down  
It's our fate  
We're lying naked face down  
  
Oh  
  
All together decapitated  
Can you see me grab ?  
Living with the dead god dammit  
All together being dismantled  
  
Love song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I'm used to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here (dying here)  
  
Don't bring me daffodil's  
Bring a boquet of pills  
Straight through like radium  
Cracked through the cranium  
Protect me when you can  
Respect me when i am DYING  
  
A song for the dear departed  
Head stone for the broken hearted  
I was to kill, for flowers to steal  
Head trip for the mortal earth bound  
One sip of the blood that i've found  
Lying here  
I'm dying here

It's easy I walk the circle I come down long ago  
But somehow I get lost each time  
Feeding this song that deepens inside that never ends  
The voice within eats me up inside  
  
1 I love hurting you  
2 I love your pain  
3 Lets get together and play this sin ours game  
4 is for the torture and  
5 is for the shame  
Cause ever time you want it I get off on this game  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
And I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
  
Golding I plant the seed inside your head right away  
Watch it grow, destroying your insides  
Pleading to comfort you with my sadistic ways  
I watch the tears fall, I crack a smile  
  
1 I love hurting you  
2 I love your pain  
3 Lets get together and play this sin ours game  
4 is for the torture and  
5 is for the shame  
'cause ever time you want it I get off on this game  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
And I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
  
I look at you and start to crack start to crack  
I give it to you take it back, take it back  
This lullaby is all you have, all you have  
Sadistic pleasure I attack, I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
I attack  
  
You wanted to play the coldness follows  
This isn't a game your life full swallow  
I can't help to smile at your pain  
You wanted to play but I already won  
I already won  
I already won

Laying by my precious  
Not long ago  
Hiding behind the shadows  
Of your broken soul  
Why is it always you and something you can never have?  
Why did you you try to tell me?  
How could you be this way  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
There you are my precious  
With your broken soul  
  
Forever my crotch take control  
Why is it  
You fuck up something you have always had  
Why'd you try to tell me  
How could you be so cold?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
Here I am, just a man  
Feeling the pain, gives me life  
Relieving us is my plan  
  
I'd anything to see through your eyes  
Just to see through your lies  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Can't you feel the pain?  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain

I said, "I smoke.... ever now and then"  
But when I really need one I gotta have one  
Just dieing, trade tricks  
Yeah, so  
To the 69 of the double deuce  
You said something about, "It's on"  
You see, that's all  
What does this thing do, ah there it goes  
Where are you going?  
I'm right here  
What are you doing?  
I'll do black and white trip  
Aha  
Yo gotta get 'em x skin on the black and white  
Yeah, of course  
See what it is, it's like an in between thing  
I didn't know, where, where is, where is the switch?  
Like, I'm not black, I'm not white  
Where is the switch?  
I'm kind, you know. Where is what switch?  
The black and white switch  
Oh you gotta get it fixed up? Right over here  
See, this is dust, every, over here is dust  
Danny, what up? Is that your lover?  
Yeah  
Really?  
I love B and B que's  
So...  
The reason I don't barbeque on 'em on Wednesday, because he fucking, fucking
falls in the grill.  
?? Little Beaner??  
What was that?  
Little fucking tooth.  
Carlos  
Carlos?  
Hey now, you can do it on command?  
You know as well as you do you can come whenever you want  
Tacos  
I'm the one who gave taco his name. You know that?  
I said, you believe that, I said  
"We had that barbeque", and he goes  
"Oh, you wanna go to taco"

And along came something sacred  
I never knew what I found  
The demons dance around, elated  
They're hurting me  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Falling awake in a nightmare  
Images of horror abound  
Thought I stumbled upon salvation  
Hell I found  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown  
  
Well, I'll never be the same  
It's the greatest lie ever told  
No, I'll never be the same  
I sold my soul  
  
I put my wall up each day  
You tear it down  
I hide in my space  
The space you found  
And one of these days  
I'll come unbound  
The feelings I hate  
Will finally drown

Don't wanna be sly and defile you  
Desecrate my mind and rely on you  
I just wanna break this crown  
But it's hard when I'm so run down  
  
And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life, I made  
Everything's wrong every time  
Pushing on I can't escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Holding on I'm lost in a haze  
Fighting life to the end of my days  
  
Don't wanna be rude but I have to  
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through  
I just need to look around  
See that life that has come unbound  
  
And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal  
Got to bring myself back from the dead  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life I made  
Everything's wrong every time  
Pushing on I can't escape  
Everything that comes my way  
Is haunting me taking its sweet time  
  
Sometimes, I hate, the life I made

Always just coming in here,  
Starts the game  
Why can't this puzzle be solved  
Each time it happens it's  
  
Always the same  
I look down and then start to bawl  
And all I see it burned my eyes  
Burning all inside  
  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
  
Always this teasing  
Sometimes I lose faith  
Where is my strength to hold on?  
Facing existence how can I relate?  
  
Do I stand clear or move on?  
And all I see it burned my eyes  
Burning all inside  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
One more time.  
  
Falling through this space in time  
Buried in this hurt of mine  
Falling slowly like a dream  
Falling through a world unseen  
  
Why can I not break this spell?  
I'm in darkness, is this hell?  
Falling towards this hole I see  
This is how it has to be.  
  
Caught in the corners of my mind  
Beginning over one more time  
Taking me over (taking all that's mine)  
One more time.  
  
One more time.  
One more time.  
One more time.

What were you thinking?  
I guess I'll never know  
See your eyes blinking, pupils begin to grow  
Killing you softly  
Pulling you in  
Making your mind up of whats sick or a sin  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
What you been taking  
It makes you talk real slow  
How come I'm thinking you'd be the last to know (you'd be the last to know)  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now

Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now

Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,

You breathe in but can't breathe out.

I'm facing the light  
But fading to black  
I'm offering peace  
As I'm stabed in the back  
  
Yet I'm feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet  
I'm waiting to watch it  
I'm waiting to see  
Is this my overture? Or obituary?  
  
I'm holding the torch  
But melting my fists  
I'm first in the line  
Yet last on the list  
  
Yet I'm feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet  
I'm waiting to watch it  
I'm waiting to see  
Is this my overture? Or obituary?  
  
Or obituary!  
  
I tryed not to choke you (No!)  
But now you're dead (No!)  
I'm most uncertain (No!)  
Should I feel regret? (No!)  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet

I tryed not to choke you!  
  
Is this my overture? Or obituery?

Help me, I am breaking  
And my heart is barely beating  
And the demons they are creeping around  
  
Take me, I am sinking  
And my clothes are barely breathing  
As the angels put me into the ground  
  
And everybody's peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
Slam me, I am shaking  
And my guts are really aching  
And the demons, they're laughing out loud  
  
Spare me, I am fading  
And my will is dissipating  
As the angels put me into the ground  
  
And everybody's peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
My mind is debating  
These creatures I'm making  
This medicines sedating  
The power embracing  
The fall I'm facing  
My feelings I'm hating  
Reality is failing  
This is degrading...2.45  
  
And everybody's peeking  
No one makes a sound  
The shadows are deceiving  
Paranoid and aroused  
  
Im facing my felling  
I'm hatting reality is failing  
This is degrading

Everybody's an Enemy  
Telling me lies and it's killing me  
Why they all want to get rid of me  
Everybody's my enemy  
Several try to disguise the devil in them  
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm  
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them  
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling  
Like my dick does when watching naked women  
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television  
  
Trust nobody  
I don't know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of y'all  
'cause everybody is an enemy  
'cause everybody is an enemy  
  
Watching my own back  
Strapped in chrome, to my homies  
Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at?  
'cause to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites  
With benzene, amen  
Look at the trash they biting  
The life in times is kinda weaker  
Like the time and life of the sandman  
On Apollo theater  
Imagine that another black with a hook  
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage  
I'm in raged  
  
Trust nobody  
I don't know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of y'all  
'cause everybody is an enemy  
'cause everybody is an enemy  
  
You fill your lies around me  
And you think you've won  
You feel you can control me  
With the things you've done  
  
You think that you can take me  
You think that you can play me  
You're going to start to hate me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
I feel that you disgraced me  
  
Trust nobody  
I don't know who to call a friend  
They all just pretend to be  
Fuck Everybody this is to all of y'all  
'cause everybody is an enemy  
'cause everybody is an enemy

Overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins, (fuck)  
In an hour i'll be ok  
I pray this pain will go away permanently someday  
I've seen more than...

I've seen this on my own (great)  
This song is a,  
Poem to myself,  
It helps me to live...  
In case of fire,  
Break the glass, (fuck)  
And move on into your own... Your own...  
Reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my veins,  
I hope you'll be ok someday,  
So I can say that you moved on in the right way...  
We've seen this and  
We've breathed this and  
We've lived this on our own... (your own)

Well look at this  
I see clearly now  
Look at this  
I can feel it now  
Happiness  
Is seldom found  
Pop the pill  
I'm so damn happy now  
  
Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today  
  
Well look at this

Feeling things crawl on me  
I need my fix today  
This is way beyond me  
I can't live without you today  
You today, you today  
  
I don't give out anything around me  
Even all the love that surrounds me  
Make me, even me  
I don't give out anything  
I do this to shut off the voice  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
I don't give out anything

I can, in every way  
Distinct the pain I feel inside  
It comes to me  
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind  
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?  
It runs away  
It's so predictable  
I can, in every way  
Feel the strength that tingles up inside  
Too blind to see emptiness and sorrow of their lives  
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties  
  
You ax me  
It's so predictable  
I'm gonna try  
I'm gonna die  
I'm gonna try  
  
Another day  
silence overwhelms my mind  
Who is to say  
if I have the time all wide?  
Should I pray  
for all the hate to go away?  
Another day  
I can never break free  
You wait for me  
I call out to you  
Another day  
I'll live forever!

So, so loud  
Wait, but I don't realize.  
How? why? legs  
Broke. the pain between her thighs.  
I see your pretty face,  
Smashed against the bathroom floor!  
What a disgrace!  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
Skin, so cold.  
  
How could someone steal a life?  
Save, the blame.  
Wait, I got some shit to say.  
I see your pretty face,  
Smashed against the bathroom floor!  
What a disgrace!  
Who do I feel sorry for?  
Smashed and raped!

Who do I feel sorry for

Before you looked the other way.  
Must you keep glaring at me  
I know you look inside, and see what you made.

But now I'm your everything  
It's finding out ya own me  
Not all of your gloating.

I'm walking on a razor blade  
Careful not to cross the line  
Every little step I take, it's punishment time now  
I'm getting to the end of the blade  
Slipping to the other side  
Every little step I take, it's punishment time!  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
I'm hanging like a bat today  
Crucified by the sign  
Every little move I make, it's punishment time now  
I'm sleeping on a bed of nails  
They're breaking through one at a time  
Cause every little move I make  
The punishments mine  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
I give and don't get  
I try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget!  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind  
Losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind!

What the fuck?!  
I'm so dumb, therefore I can't relate.  
I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate.  
Really is it me, or is it fate?  
Give me peace, or release for fuck's sake.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
In the past I was known as a freak.  
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak.  
Save my ass, I got into this band,  
Never thought the band would pick on the man.  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
Reclaim my place  
  
Say it to my face.  
So I look around at all these stupid little faces.  
Something I can never slap, but I embrace.  
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be,  
You wanna fuck around, then come fuck with me.  
You think you can't relate?  
You'll never ever find.  
You think you feel my hate?  
Look at me and you will find  
My fate you always raped?  
I will always be the son.  
You want to fuck with me?  
Come on, fucking play!  
  
Now!  
  
You can feel it now or be stoned!  
Yes, you feel it come, right now!  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes, you feel it come, right now!  
You can feel it now or be stoned  
Yes, you feel it come, bow down!  
Bow down!  
  
Give him something to say.  
Something super fly, never play.  
All I hear is disgrace.  
Erase them all and reclaim my place.  
What the fuck?! So, what the fuck?

I'm feeling mean today  
Not lost, not blown away  
Just irritated and quite hated  
Self control breaks down  
Why's everything so tame  
I like my life insane  
I'm fabricating and debating  
Who I'm gonna kick around  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That excite you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
I'm feeling cold today  
Not hurt just fucked away  
I'm devastated and frustrated  
God I feel so bound  
So why I'd feel the need  
I think it's time to bleed  
I'm gonna cut myself and  
Watch the blood hit the ground  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That live beside you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
You open your mouth again  
I swear I'm gonna break it  
You open your mouth again,  
By god I cannot take it  
  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up  
  
Right now  
Can't find a way  
To get across the hate  
When I see you  
  
Right now  
I feel it scratch inside  
I want to slash and beat you  
  
Right now  
I rip apart the things inside  
That live beside you  
  
Right now  
I can't control myself  
But I fucking hate you!  
  
I fuckin' hate you [Repeat x8]

What's your lie?  
Warm glance, a fake smile.  
Eyes meet, your mind runs wild.  
This game you play I like in a way.  
  
You expect to grab a child (grab a child)  
You think I'm innocent not wild.  
Take me let's see how much I'm tamed.  
  
Everybody listen while I think of all I know,  
How to live for sure - body wall into my precious soul.  
I'll show you fears, pleasure pain is my control.  
Let your body lay in there, warm flesh to your fear.  
  
Warm lips, a big smile.  
Hatred runs through your insides.  
This game you play - intimidation each day.  
  
You think it's all a lie (all a lie)  
They want to destroy your life.  
Anger twisted your life into pain  
  
I wish I could take control.  
I wish I could let go.  
I wish I could break this mould.  
Inside I'm so fucking cold.  
  
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming on you... (x4)  
Warm glance, a fake smile.  
Eyes meet, your mind runs wild.  
This game you play I like in a way.  
  
You expect to grab a child (grab a child)  
You think I'm innocent not wild.  
Take me - let's see how much I'm tamed.  
  
Everybody listen while I become all I know.  
How to live for sure - body wall into my precious soul.  
I'll show you fears, pleasure pain is my control.  
Let your body lay in there, warm flesh to your fear.  
  
I wish I could lose control.  
I wish I could let go.  
I wish I could break this mould  
Inside I'm so fuckin' cold.  
  
Weapons inside so the truth unfolds.  
I am done.  
That was so fun.  
This one's real.  
How'd it feel?  
  
What's comin', what's comin', what's comin' on you? [Repeat: x 4]  
  
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' on you... [Repeat: x 4]

Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away.  
I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay.  
I feel so lost within, pressured, I'm headed for that day.  
Just one thought in my head, really.  
Do I need this fame?  
  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?  
  
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame.  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle  
  
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle  
  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
Like some god damn fucking freak!

I'm an animal  
I'm the victim  
I'm the answer to your prayers  
I'm a witness  
I'm a witch hunt  
I'm the monster under stairs  
I'm the ghost that's in the mirror  
I'm everything that you fear  
I'm the rip tide  
I'm the soul shock  
I'm the voice that's in your head  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing  
  
I'm the hunted  
I'm the predator  
I'm the answer to the riddle  
I'm the off beat  
I'm the head fuck  
I'm the way that's left of the middle  
I'm the player  
I'm denying  
I'm the one whose not addicted  
I'm the logic to the fuck up  
I'm the broken one who fixed it  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing  
  
I'm just a child  
With a tear in it's eyes  
I am holding this gift  
That is broken  
What do I have left now?  
  
I've seen it all  
Still can't taste it  
Smashed to the wall  
Brought me to my knee  
I've done it all  
Fucked up wasted  
Still in my blood  
Now inside I'm seeing

Ring around the rosies  
Pocket full of posies  
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down  
Ring around the rosies  
Pocket full of posies  
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down  
Nursery rhymes are said, verses in my head  
Into my childhood they're spoon fed  
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real  
Look at the pages that cause all this evil  
  
One, two, buckle my shoe  
Three, four, shut the door  
Five, six, pick up sticks  
Seven, eight, lay them straight  
London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down  
London bridge is falling down, my fair lady  
Nursery rhymes are said, verses in my head  
Into my childhood they're spoon fed  
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real  
Look at the pages that cause all this evil  
  
Nick-nack paddywack, give a dog a bone, this old man came rolling home  
  
Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow  
Baa baa black sheep have you any wool?  
Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow  
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full  
Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow  
Mary had a little lamb!  
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full (white trash crone)  
  
Ring around the rosies

In the deepest part of me  
Like an unknown memory  
I was never meant to find  
Little seed of purity  
And you don't belong to me  
Still I'm blinded by its light  
DON'T TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT!  
  
Does anybody know bout love  
Does anybody care bout God  
If you're with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If you're with me sing sorrow  
  
When the stars don't ever heal  
Do you fear you'll never feel?  
What it is to be at peace  
YOU'RE CRAVING A RELEASE!  
  
Does anybody know bout love  
Does anybody care bout God  
If you're with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If you're with me sing sorrow  
  
I don't understand here  
Why God would do me this way.  
I lived a life  
Was always good  
The one thing I need to take away  
  
TO TAKE WAY  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
just take away  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
one thing to take away  
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)  
one thing to take away  
AWAY AWAY  
  
It took away my world  
all it left was pain  
and all this time was for nothing  
  
Does anybody know about love  
Does anybody care about God  
If you're with me sing sorrow  
  
Penny for your thoughts I fear  
we need a little help round here  
If you're with me sing sorrow

Came to see him, for,  
You only might find.  
Gone take my lay,  
For you and I will find.  
Fronting my face,  
I cannot ever find.  
Places I care for,  
Nothing in my mind.  
Bring me not far enough.  
All lurking you'll find.  
Placing not far,  
You're every single mind.  
So fine can only,  
For you and me will find.  
Basis all for me,  
Can you leave my mind.  
Bracing my fall,  
My every single place.  
Your love travelled far,  
Some laying with my fates.  
Place some never far,  
You're everything away.  
You say I'm a love,  
And be mine every way.  
  
(Inside)  
  
Under the sand,  
Through the land,  
Find all I can,  
And form a clan,  
That teaches to laugh.  
Tears the past.  
Laughs at the rest.  
Teach the best.  
Defeats the rest.  
Forms the test,  
We passed all the tests.  
  
(Evil in my mind)

Walking, waiting  
Alone without a care  
Hoping and hating  
The things I can't bare  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up  
Well did you, well did you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I see hell in your eyes  
Taken in by surprise  
Touching you makes me feel alive  
Touching you makes me die inside  
  
Walking, waiting  
Alone without a care  
Hoping and hating  
The things I can't bare  
Did ya think it's cool to walk right up  
And take my life and fuck it  
Well did you  
  
I hate you!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat]  
  
I've slept so long without you  
It's tearing me apart too  
How did you get this far  
Playing games with this old heart  
I've killed a million petty souls  
But I couldn't kill you  
I've slept so long with out you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]

So this is love..  
  
First I give you all my love and now whats up  
So i'll tell you what it feels like this time  
I put my whole life and soul on the rocks  
Trying to get jealous is just another bad experience  
Fuck, I wish a girl could love me too for once  
You say "hey, you want to try something different"  
Now I see your feels weren't always just for one man  
Ya got my heart now tell me what ya plan do with it  
Ya say you never loved me like that, now you full of shit  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)  
Well I feel fascist when I say bitch  
But I thought that bitch was liking it when she sucked my dick  
I didn't see that this was not any good for me  
Fuck you, just open your eyes and see  
I want to tell you so bad but I can't find my lips  
Every time I give you my heart I can feel it rip  
You got my heart tell me what ya plan do with it  
You say you never loved me like that now you full of shit  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)  
  
For love, but not be loved  
For the push, and I've been shoved  
For the truth, and that's a belief  
For the gift, I will never recieve (x3)  
  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)

I can't stand to let you win  
I'm just watching you  
And I don't know what to do  
Feeling like a fool inside  
Feeling all the love you hide  
Thought you were my friend  
Seems it never ends  
  
I need somebody, someone  
Can somebody help me?  
All I need is some pain  
Not just for me  
  
Giving you with this and that  
Giving gave nothing back  
It's all related to  
All the things I do  
Feeling like a fool inside  
Seeing all the things you tried  
I am nothing  
  
I need somebody, someone  
Can somebody help me?  
All I need is some pain  
Not just for me  
  
I look, I sign  
I need someone  
Inside to help me out  
With what  
I'm trying  
I'm crying  
I'm frying  
In a pile of  
Shit  
I'm dying  
I'm dying  
  
I'm dying  
  
I need somebody, someone, somebody, somebody, someone  
I need somebody, someone, somebody, somebody, someone  
Someone

Fuck yes  
Whew  
Always I'm locked in my head  
Know the pain, you don't know what I have had  
By now, I'm so for sure  
Right now, I am yours  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh Hell no)  
  
It came unknown to me  
Paranoid is controlling all of me  
Somehow turned so pure  
Right now, shit, I'm yours  
  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh hell no)  
Was it me? (I swallow)  
Forget me (I don't know)  
  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
Oh hell no  
This thing I follow  
The place I'm too scared to fucking go  
A freak that I'm sure  
A freak that is yours  
  
My sorrow (I swallow)  
Follow me (Oh hell no)  
Was it me? (I swallow)  
Forget me (I don't know)  
I swallow  
I swallow  
Freak  
  
[Repeat: x16]  
Punk ass sissy, I'm a freak

You fell away,  
What more can I say?  
The feelings evolved,  
I wont let it out,  
I can't replace  
Your screaming face  
Feeling the sickness inside  
  
Why won't you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
So many words,  
Can't discribe my face  
This feelings evolved  
So soon to break out  
I can't relate  
To a happy state  
Feeling the blood run inside  
  
Why won't you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine,  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?  
Keep me down to what you think I should be  
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry  
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily  
(I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
Why is everything so fucking hard for me? (I will not die)  
  
Why wont you die?  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine  
  
Why would you die  
Your blood in mine  
We'll be fine  
Then your body will be mine

Well I wish there was someone  
Well I wish there was someone  
To love me  
  
When I used to be someone  
And I knew there was someone  
That loved me  
  
As I sit here frozen alone  
Even ghosts get tired and go home  
As they crawl back under the stars  
  
And I wish there was something  
Please tell me theres something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can  
It's just saturated loneliness  
  
Does the silence get lonely?  
Does the silence get lonely?  
Who knows?  
I've been hearing it tell me  
I've been hearing it tell me  
Go home  
  
Cause the freaks are playing tonight  
They packed up and turned out the lights  
  
And I wish there was something  
Please tell me theres something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can  
It's just saturated loneliness  
  
And the bath waters cold  
And this life's getting old  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
And I wish I could feel it  
Abduct it, corrupt it  
But I never can  
  
I never can  
  
Never can, never can, never can

You chose to take  
From the past  
You want a game  
That's built to last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You chose to take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend  
  
You wanna lay  
In the past  
You'll do anything  
To make your pain last  
  
Cause love without affection  
Is hate without the pain  
Life is a connection  
Separate from the brain  
  
You just take  
From the past  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything even you my friend

I can't live with all your lies again  
I can't trust anything with you my friend  
  
Can't you see the pain in my eyes?  
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?  
I can't live with all your lies again  
Is this the end?

I must look away  
I must find a way  
You know there is a line!  
Don't try to take what's mine!  
I feel it bottled up inside!  
This hate and all this pride!  
Can't you let me have some of it?

Must that man stay?

We all know the chosen toys, candy girls, and pretty boys  
Make up that face to win the race  
Life's a bitch in this town  
Suck my dick in this town  
  
This town is our town  
It is so glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
Change our mind like we said before  
We are dreamers, we are whores.  
Discarded scars like worn out cars.  
Litter the streets of this town  
Litter the streets in this town  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So mother fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'd live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
Break it down boys  
  
Human waste in the house  
Human waste in the house  
Human waste in the house  
  
Here we fucking go!  
  
This town is our town  
So fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town is our town  
So mother fucking glamorous  
I'll bet you'll live here if you could  
And be one of us  
  
This town  
This town  
This town  
This town

Going through the pages of my fantasies  
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down  
I want to see you try to take a swing at me  
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny?  
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
Come and fill the pages of my fantasies  
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown  
I want to kill and rape you the way you raped me  
And I'll pull the trigger  
And you're down, down, down  
  
Why are you trying to make fun of me?  
You think it's funny?  
What the fuck you think it's doing to me?  
You take your turn lashing out at me  
I want you crying when you're dirty in the front of me  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
  
All my friends are gone, they died (gonna take you down)  
They all screamed, and cried (gonna take you down)  
  
I got my monkey, got my monkey back against the wall  
Gonna take you down  
  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming  
All of my hate cannot be found  
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming  
So you can try to tear me down  
Beat me to the ground  
I will see you screaming

Flesh wound, flesh wound  
With medication it will fade  
Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray  
Full of hate  
Don't you love how I pray?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't let them throw me away  
Ah!  
Keep me and I'll be okay  
Ah!  
?  
Ah!  
Don't let them throw me away  
Ah!  
Don't let them throw me away  
  
Screwed up, used up  
Crumble lying on the floor  
Fucked up, shut up  
All you did back then was thought  
I'm really weak  
Missing parts  
Incomplete  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me up into the light  
Fix the cracks and fix them right  
Keep the pieces in the drawer  
Keep them there for ever more  
Wake a million thoughts someday  
Recycle this shit in someway  
And all that I have to say  
Don't let them throw me away  
  
[Chorus]

How did it start?  
Well, I don't know.  
I just feel the craving.  
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.  
And it's just there for the taking.  
These little girls they make me feel so goddamn  
Exhilarated.  
I feel them up, I can't give it up.  
The pain that I'm just erasing.  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?  
I don't know why it hurts me.  
All I want to do is get with you.  
And make the pain go away.  
Why do I have a conscience?  
All it does is fuck with me.  
Why do I have this torment?  
All I want to do is fuck it away.  
  
I tell my lies and I despise.  
Every second I'm with you.  
So I run away and you still stay.  
So what the fuck is with you.  
  
Your feelings I can't help but rape them.  
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.  
My heart inside is constantly hating.  
I'm sorry I just throw you away.  
  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.  
I just throw you away.

And who says you're right

But you're bent out of oh right  
Suck my dick

Sometimes things might make me oh oh it makes me mad

I had some Red Dog, you hand over it  
  
Twist Twist Twist

Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister  
Listening to your twisted transistor  
Hold it between your legs  
Turn it up, turn it up  
The wind is coming through  
Can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
A lonely life where no one understands you  
But don't give up because the music do  
Music do!

Hang on you

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it  
The world it can eat you if you let it  
And as your tears fall on  
Your dress, your dress  
But when she's coming through  
You're in a mess  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too

Just let me be  
Between you and them things!  
  
Because the music do  
And then it its reaching  
Inside you forever preaching  
Fuck you too  
Your screams will whisper  
Hang on you  
Twisted transistor

Sometimes things get in the way  
My thoughts I cannot convey  
It's all pointing straight at you  
We hate loving everyday  
Our lives twirled in every way  
I give it all back to you  
  
I can't help this going down  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
  
Sometimes things don't go away  
In turn you just run away  
It's all coming back for you  
Betrayed, life is in decay  
Your thoughts you cannot obey  
Right now, what cha gonna do?  
  
I can't help this going down  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
  
We do, we do, we do, we do,  
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do  
  
I hear the calling of the helpless stranger  
He's all alone and no one hears his anger  
I feel his pain every time I'm here with you  
With you  
All the heartache and the fucked up insults  
I find you begging on your knees, I figured  
This is how it's supposed to be with you  
With you  
  
I can't wait for your life to be broken down  
I gave you hate  
  
Ah!  
  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
That's what we do  
I can't take this  
All my life is wreckless  
All our lives our dangerous  
But we fake our way through  
  
That's what we do

Spinning inside rotting away  
Something inside of me has been taken away  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It won't get better now  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?  
  
Hopeless inside alone as I wait  
Brewing inside of me enduring this hate  
Feeling my heart breaking in vain  
It won't get better now  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?  
  
The stress is rising and I can't seem to get away from you  
You're always trying and the lying always shines right through  
My God I hate this  
Always take shit  
Can I let this go on?  
Why can't I break this  
I just take this  
As this goes on and on  
  
End  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
When will this end?  
  
I can't seem to get away  
I feel I'm here so you can play  
With my head  
There's nothing I can say  
I keep feeling like I'm to blame  
When will this end?

Now dis one dedicated to de man dem call MacGyver (bo!)  
And all double-oh-seven James Bond man 'e from de area (gunshot, gunshot)  
Maximum respect to de man dem call Ice Cube (bo! bo!)  
And a bust a deuce-deuce or trey-eight bout to get WICKED!  
  
One, two, three and I come with the wicked  
style and you know that I'm from, the wicked  
crew, act like you knew  
Cause I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo, kick it  
Wicked, rhymes, picket, signs  
While me and the Mob gotta trunk fulla 9's  
Play ya and I'll slay ya  
I got thug-made dough by the ha-ir  
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must  
to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust  
Lookin for the one that did it  
but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it  
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills  
and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills  
Sittin at the pad just chillin  
cause Larry Wilkins just got two million, oh what a feelin  
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill  
and I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal  
Like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ass get ???  
Kick it cause I get wicked  
  
Won't say nuttin, just listen  
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison  
Come my way and get served  
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb  
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin  
Never seen with a happy grin  
Show the fat foul cause I'm down  
Take a look around  
and all you see is big black boots steppin  
Use my steel toe as a weapon  
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to  
label this nigga, tape with the sticker  
Kickin out girls that's nicety  
Yo, I gotta body count like Ice-T  
From here to New York  
I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork  
Swine, pig, dick  
Listen to the flow of a so-called negro  
who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett  
Dig it cause I get wicked  
  
People wanna know how come  
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm  
Ready to bring that noise  
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys  
April 29th was power to the people  
and we might just see a sequel  
cos police got equal pay  
A horse is a pig that don't fly straight  
Doin Darryl Gates but is Willie Williams  
down with the pilgrims  
Just a super slave  
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave  
I'm wicked enough to board this  
Cos now it's on to the fullest  
Gorilla straight from the mist  
But I don't miss when it comes to this  
Bring the yellow tape  
The white cape, cause I'm so straight  
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it  
Bigot, cause I get wicked  

I'm falling in this pit of sorrow  
I really don't care anyway  
Happiness I'm looking to borrow  
Even four last seconds okay  
I'm starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow  
So I'll just do my best anyway.  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today.  
  
I'm starting to break my devotion  
What does that mean anyway?  
Running into signs interwoven  
So much that it gets in my way  
I'm starting to feel so so hollow  
Fill me up then go on your way  
I doubt I'll be leasing tomorrow  
So I'll just do my best anyway.  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today  
  
Hold me now  
I've been knocking down  
Killing all these waves of shame.  
Hold me down  
Feeling not so sound  
Wish I wasn't born today.
