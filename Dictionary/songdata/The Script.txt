I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing  
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in  
'Cause I got time while she got freedom  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even  
  
Her best days will be some of my worst  
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first  
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no  
  
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you,  
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces  
  
They say bad things happen for a reason  
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding  
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving  
And when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, no  
  
What am I gonna to do when the best part of me was always you,  
And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces, yeah,  
I'm falling to pieces  
(One still in love while the other ones leaving)  
I'm falling to pieces  
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)  
  
Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain  
You took your suitcase, I took the blame  
Now I'm try'na make sense of what little remains ooh  
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name  
  
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing  
Just prayed to a god that I don't believe in  
'Cause I got time while she got freedom  
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break  
No it don't break  
No it don't breakeven no  
  
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you and  
What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK  
(Oh glad your okay now)  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
I'm falling to pieces  
(One still in love while the other ones leaving)  
I'm falling to pieces yeah  
('Cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)  
  
Oh it don't breakeven no  
Oh it don't breakeven no  
Oh it don't breakeven no

This time he's gonna wear an iron suit  
This time she's gonna fix her heart and make it bullet proof  
He says he's gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit  
She says never never bite more than you can chew  
But this time he's not gonna be another could've been  
This time she's gonna get real, love the skin she's in  
She says a winner never quits, quitters never win  
She said this time that she is built to face anything  
This time he's gonna step for who he is  
This time she's gonna live to work, she's not working to live  
He says just because you say it's true, it don't mean it is  
She says it seems too good to be true, well then it probably is  
This time he's hell bent yeah he's heaven bound  
This time she's gonna pick herself up no more breaking down  
He says he's gonna turn the wheel, turn this shit around  
She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
This time he's gonna make it to the aftermath  
This time she's gonna raise her head choose the righteous path  
He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh  
She said better to have and not need, than to need and not have  
No matter what the cause it's better to have loved and lost  
Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?  
Yeah the higher they are the bigger they fall  
You have to choose something cuz you can't have it all  
No, he's not gonna be the last to the finish line  
She said even losers get lucky sometimes  
He says it's gonna get better like a fine wine  
She says it's harder to smell the roses when the sun don't shine  
This time he's gonna find another way  
This time she's gonna take you to the good ol'days with no... gracing  
Only warm embraces with the two little sweet angels with dirty faces  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground  
It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound  
  
Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,  
Anything you've learned it's all programmed, all programmed  
Every break, every burn, every toss, every turn, every sin,  
Everything we've learned it's all programmed, all programmed  
  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow  
When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow  
It's all I've got  
Yeah when you hit the ground

I'm in the boot of a car breathing air through a hole  
She's driving me down to the river  
She'll watch over me in the tears in her eyes  
Couldn't dig my own grave any deeper  
She's pushing me blindfolded down to my knees  
But her finger still shakes on the trigger  
She's untying my hands though I gave her the rope  
This is so much harder to leave her, leave her, leave her  
  
When you're forgiven but you can't forget  
Feels like you're drowning but you still got breath  
And we've been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there ain't no getting out of this mess  
No there ain't no getting out  
There ain't no getting out  
There ain't no getting out of this mess  
  
Now she's showing me mercy as much as she can  
She's letting me live with my demons  
See her washing her hands as she's walking away  
Oh but still she looks back, she looks back  
But she's leaving, she's leaving  
  
When you're forgiven but you can't forget  
Feels like you're drowning but you still got breath  
And we've been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there ain't no getting out of this mess  
No there ain't no getting out  
There ain't no getting out  
There ain't no getting out of this mess  
No there ain't no getting out  
No there ain't no getting out of this mess  
  
What's done is done  
Can't resurrect the setting sun  
What's done is done  
Oh you can't reverse the bullet from a gun  
What's done is done  
Can't resurrect the setting sun  
What's done is done  
Oh you can't reverse the bullet from a gun  
  
When you're forgiven but you can't forget  
Feels like you're drowning but you still got breath  
And we've been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there ain't no getting out of this mess  
When you're forgiven but you can't forget  
Feels like you're drowning but you still got breath  
And we've been tryna lay this ghost to rest  
Oh but there ain't no getting

She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart  
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar  
And we don't know how we got into this mad situation  
Only doing things out of frustration  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
She needs me now but I can't seem to find a time  
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line  
And we don't know how we got into this mess it's a gods test  
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah  
We're smiling but we're close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting  
For the first time  
  
She's in line at the dole with her head held high  
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride  
But we both know how we're gonna make it work when it hurts  
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt  
  
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard  
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while yeah  
Smiling but we're close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting  
For the first time  
  
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine  
Sit talking up all night  
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah  
We're smiling but we're close to tears  
Even after all these years  
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting  
For the first time  
For the first time  
Oh, for the first time  
Yeah, for the first time  
Just now got the feeling that we're meeting  
For the first time  
  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah they're making us crazy  
Don't give up on me baby  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah they're making us crazy  
Don't give up on me baby  
  
Oh these times are hard

Don't give up on me baby  
  
Oh these times are hard  
Yeah they're making us crazy  
Don't give up on me baby

To your brother, to your sister, to your misses, to your mister.  
To your friends, to your foes, give the love around and back around it goes.  
It all comes from the top and it spreads right round  
Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down  
To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids  
Now watchin' mamma cry  
And they pick it up, cause they learn everything  
Life has a funny way of going in a ring,  
End up growing up in trouble with the law  
Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore  
Now it seems that every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation  
Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation  
That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears,
innovation  
It starts with us, it starts with us.  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, it starts by giving love to your brother,  
Giving love to your sister,  
Giving love to your misses,  
Love to your mister  
Giving love to your friends,  
Love to your foes,  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Round it goes, round it goes,  
Round it goes goes goes  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes  
Oh we're all just folks working in a wheel  
Spinning all around life's cruel battlefield  
Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,  
Watch it wash away  
I bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away  
Flutter from a butterfly forms a storm  
Over half a million people die  
Oh we don't care because we're all desensitized  
We don't realize we're putting all this shit before our children's eyes  
Now every brand new generation  
Have all been growing up with cracks in their foundation  
We're tryna fill a holes of a whole damn nation  
That's lost it's trust (that lost it's trust)  
We gotta change before the train leaves the station  
And realize the revolution ain't a revelation  
It takes blood, sweat, tears, innovation  
It starts with us, it starts with us.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)  
Give the love around and back around it goes (around it goes)  
Love to your friends (around it goes)  
To your foes (around it goes)  
Give the love around, back around it goes  
See the thing about Karma is she loves a bit of drama, yeah  
Loves to hunt you down and pay ya back for the things you did  
Before you turn a positive to a negative  
Better pray before you know exactly who the fuck you're dealing with  
This is not a dress rehearsal, let me tell you kid  
Whatever you put out there is coming back again  
Years may burn (ohh)  
Tables gonna turn  
Karma's coming back around  
Either way you're gonna learn  
To give love to your neighbor, love to yourself  
It don't matter bout your status  
Man your health is your wealth  
We can all point a finger but there's four pointing back at yourself  
I'll be the bigger man now  
Give a little help  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes (x2)  
Give the love around back around it goes  
Around it goes (x4)  
Give the love around back around it goes

You knocked me sideways  
When you said that you were leaving.  
You knocked me over  
When you cried and told the truth.  
And you left me speechless  
The secrets you've been keeping  
You're running now, but someone's chasing you  
And you bought a ticket  
But you don't know where you're going  
And you won't tell me  
For fear I'll follow soon  
And you're tryin' to save me  
From your past of bad decisions  
But my decision's always gonna be  
To follow you (To follow you)  
  
Never gonna stop 'til the clock stops tickin'  
Never gonna quit 'til my leg starts kickin'  
I will follow you and we'll both go missin' (Yeah)  
No I'm never givin' up 'til my heart stops beatin'  
Never lettin' go 'til my arm stops breathing  
I will follow you and we'll both go missin' (Yeah)  
No I, And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
  
I woke up this morning  
To a kiss just like a whisper  
And it takes to kiss  
When I knew that you were gone  
And you left the motel  
When you're headin' off on nowhere  
But the lady on the door said  
You haven't left that long, long, no  
  
No I, And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
  
I still watch as she's runnin' away  
So she was born to live this way  
Bad man's gonna take her away,take her away, yeah  
I still watch as she's runnin' away  
So she was born to live this way  
I'll never let a bad man take you away,take you away  
So I'll  
  
And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We got everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box

Standing in the hall of fame

Neither one of us is getting out of here alive  
Both of us are stranded and we won't make it back inside  
The whole world is blowing away  
We just watch it pass us by  
Yeah, it swept up both our  
Feet when we meet in the northern sky  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
You're like the wind, I'm like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
We're heading towards each other at 150 miles an hour  
Knocking us off course with the force once you feel the power  
We're tryin'a get away, tryin'a clear the path  
From everything we buried in the aftermath  
Swell like a super cell, raging getting louder and louder  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
You're like the wind I'm like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
On my own I'm just another cold rainy day  
Waiting for the wind to come along and take me away  
But she's just a breeze on a sunny day  
Unless the two of us together  
Man, we're blown away  
  
Like thunder and lightning go in the one  
Together we make the perfect storm  
You're like the wind I'm like the rain  
Together we both make hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
Hurricanes  
  
Away hurricanes away hurricanes

(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
It was February 14 Valentine's Day  
The roses came but they took you away  
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm  
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone  
  
And I'll never get to show you these songs  
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on  
I see you standing there next to Mom  
Both singing along, yeah on and on  
  
And there are days when I'm losing my faith  
Because the man wasn't good he was great  
He'd say "Music was the home for your pain"  
And explained I was young, he would say  
  
Take that rage, put it on a page  
Take that page to the stage  
Blow the roof off the place  
I'm trying to make you proud  
Do everything you did  
I hope you're up there with God saying "That's my kid!"  
  
[Chorus]  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
If you could see me now would you recognize me?  
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?  
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face  
Put your hand on my heart that was cold  
As the day you were taken away  
  
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day  
Right now, I wish I could hear you say  
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch  
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must  
  
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me  
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it  
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom  
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son  
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out  
So if you get a second to look down on me now  
  
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
Oh, oh  
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?  
Would you love me a loser or winner?  
Oh, oh  
When I see my face in the mirror  
We look so alike that it makes me shiver  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Yeah I'm just missing you now  
  
I still look for your face in the crowd  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow  
Oh if you could see me now  
(Oh if you could see me now)  
  
If you could see, you could see me now (x2)

If you're standing with your suitcase  
But you can't step on the train  
Everything's the way that you left it  
I still haven't slept yet  
  
And if you're covering your face now  
But you just can't hide the pain  
Still setting two plates on the counter but eating without you  
  
If the truth is you're a liar  
Then just say that you're okay  
I'm sleeping on your side of the bed  
Goin' out of my head now  
  
And if you're out there tryna move on  
But something pulls you back again  
I'm sitting here tryna persuade you like you're in the same room  
  
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder  
And I wish you could still give me a hard time  
And I wish I could still wish it was over  
But even if wishing is a waste of time  
Even if I never cross your mind  
  
I'll leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back now  
Oh if you ever come back, if you ever come back  
  
Now they say I'm wasting my time  
'Cause you're never comin' home  
But they used to say the world was flat  
But how wrong was that now?  
  
And by leavin' my door open  
I'm riskin' everything I own  
There's nothing I can lose in a break-in that you haven't taken  
  
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder  
And I wish you can still give me a hard time  
And I wish I could still wish it was over  
But even if wishing is a waste of time  
Even if I never cross your mind  
  
I'll leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back now  
Oh, if you ever come back, if you ever come back  
  
If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss  
I know you're out there somewhere so just remember this  
If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss  
Oh just remember this, oh just remember this  
  
I'll leave the door on the latch  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back  
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back now  
Oh, if you ever come back, if you ever come back  
  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
And it will be just like you were never gone  
If you ever come back, if you ever come back now

[Repeat: x2]  
If you see my friend,  
Doesn't matter where or when,  
Tell me if you see Kay,  
Tell me if you see Kay.  
  
She said I won the battle but I lost the war,  
And now my head is sore,  
And if I try sail back in,  
Shes gon' push me from the shore,  
Now I won't ever get the time of day,  
No way, no way, no  
Now for what I said,  
But for what I didn't say [Repeat: x2]  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see kay  
Will you tell her that I love her  
If you see kay  
Let her know I want her back  
If she listens  
Say I'm missing everything about her  
Make sure you say, I'm sweet FA  
Without her  
If you see kay  
  
She got me saying sorry through the door,  
She don't care anymore,  
She says its too late now,  
Should have thought of this before,  
But I ain't gonna take this as defeat,  
No way No way no,  
Cos I'm gonna shout it out to everyone,  
Everyone I meet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I'm sitting here in disbelief,  
At how it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave,  
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs,  
They say you love someone enough you gotta set them free,  
She said that was born to leave this town behind,  
Knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied,  
Saying its time to cut the ties,  
Time to say goodbye, So she left  
But she never never left my, never never left my mind  
  
[Chorus]

You touch these tired eyes of mine  
And map my face out line by line  
And somehow growing old feels fine  
I listen close for I'm not smart  
You wrap your thoughts in works of art  
And they're hanging on the walls of my heart  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
And though I may not look like much  
I'm yours  
And though my edges may be rough  
And never feel I'm quite enough  
It may not seem like very much  
But I'm yours  
  
You healed these scars over time  
Embraced my soul  
You loved my mind  
You're the only angel in my life  
The day news came my best friend died  
My knees went weak and you saw me cry  
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
And though I may not look like much  
I'm yours  
And though my edges may be rough  
And never feel I'm quite enough  
It may not seem like very much  
But I'm yours  
  
I may not have the softest touch  
I may not say the words as such  
I know I don't fit in that much  
But I'm yours

Give me highs, give me lows,  
Give me thorns with my rose  
I want everything  
When you laugh, when you cry,  
If you're sober or high,  
I want everything  
  
Give me love or hate,  
You can bend me 'til I break  
Give me fire, give me rain,  
I want joy with my pain  
I want your fears, your hopes,  
The whole kaleidoscope  
  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, oh oh ooh yeah  
  
Give me nothing, give me faith,  
I want give with my take,  
I want everything  
Give me life, give me death,  
Or your biggest regrets,  
I want everything  
  
Show me your fears, show me your scars,  
I'll take whatever's left of your heart  
Give me heaven, give me hell,  
All the dreams you try to sell,  
I want your fears, your hopes,  
The while kaleidoscope  
  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, oh oh ooh yeah  
  
Without you it's shadows, the night's black pitch,  
When there's a hundred thousand light bulbs but there ain't no switch  
Living in darkness, fearin' the night,  
Oh what a feeling when I see that light  
  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you, oh oh ooh yeah

When's the day you start again  
And when the hell does you'll get over it begin  
I'm looking hard in the mirror  
But I don't fit my skin  
It's too much to take  
It's too hard to break me  
From the cell I'm in  
  
Oh, from this moment on  
I'm changing the way I feel, yeah  
From this moment on  
It's time to get real  
  
'Cause I still don't know how to act  
Don't know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
'Cause you're long gone  
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
But you're long gone, you moved on  
  
So how'd you pick the pieces up, yeah  
I'm barely used to saying me instead of us  
The elephant in the room keeps scaring off the guests  
It gets under my skin to see you with him  
And it's not me that you're with  
  
Oh from this moment on  
I'm changing the way I feel yeah  
From this moment on  
It's time to get real  
  
'Cause I still don't know how to act  
Don't know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
'Cause you're long gone  
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
But you're long gone, you moved on  
  
No, I can't keep thinking that you're coming back  
No  
'Cause I got no business knowing where you're at  
No  
And it's gonna be hard, yeah  
'Cause I have to wanna heal yeah  
And its gonna be hard, yeah  
The way I feel that I have to get real  
  
I still don't know how to act  
Don't know what to say  
Still wear the scars like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
But you're long gone  
But I still don't know where to start, still finding my way  
Still talk about you like it was yesterday  
But you're long gone and moved on  
But you're long gone, you moved on  
  
But you're long gone, you moved on  
But you're long gone, you moved on

[Instrumental]  
  
[Verse 1]  
It's in the eyes of the children  
As they leave for the very first time  
And it's in the heart of a soldier  
As he takes a bullet on the front line  
It's in the face of a mother  
As she takes the force of the blow  
And it's in the hands of the father (yea)  
As he works his fingers to the bone yea  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm standing under a white flag oh  
Can you see me? oh  
Can you see me? Oh  
I'm standing for everything we have oh  
Can you hear me? oh  
Can you hear me?  
  
[Chorus]  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this, this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this, this is love  
  
This is love....  
This is love....  
This is love...  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's in the soul of a city  
What it does after it crumbles and burns  
And it's in the blood of a hero  
To know where he goes  
He may never return eh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm standing under a white flag oh  
Can you see me? oh  
Can you see me? Oh  
I'm standing for everything we have oh  
Can you hear me? oh  
Can you hear me?  
  
[Chorus]  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this, this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this, this is love  
  
[Bridge]  
This is love...  
This is love...  
  
This is love...  
This is love...  
  
This is love...  
This is love...  
  
This is love...  
This is love...  
  
If you could be anyone that you wanted to be  
With anyone that you wanted to be with  
Doing anything that you wanted to do,  
What would it be and who would be with you?  
Time flies but you're the pilot  
It moves real fast but you're the driver  
You may crash and burn sometimes  
  
[Chorus]  
This is why we do it  
This is worth the pain  
This is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
This is where the heart lies  
This is from above  
Love is this, this is love  
Love is why we do it  
Love is worth the pain  
Love is why we fall down  
To get back up again  
Love is where the heart lies  
Love is from above  
Love is this, this is love

Am I better off dead?  
Am I better off a quitter?  
They say I'm better off now  
Then I ever was with her  
As they take me to my local down the street  
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet  
  
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her  
But after one too many I know that I'm never  
Only they can see where this is gonna end  
But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense  
  
[Chorus]  
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down  
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town  
I'm swearing if I go there now  
I can change her mind turn it all around  
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words  
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred  
Dialed her number and confessed to her  
I'm still in love but all I heard  
Was nothing  
  
So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences  
I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses  
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door  
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said nothing  
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing  
Oh, I got nothing  
Oh, I got nothing  
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing  
  
Oh, sometimes love's intoxicating  
Oh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking  
When you realize there's no one waiting  
  
Am I better off dead?  
Am I better off a quitter?  
They say I'm better off now  
Than I ever was with her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She said nothing  
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing  
Oh, I got nothing  
I got nothing  
I wanted words but all I heard was nothing  
Oh I got nothing  
  
I got nothing  
I got nothing  
I got nothing

It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
But you know you had it coming  
You know you had it coming  
  
Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming  
So we keep running and running  
  
Now I'm looking up the bible trying to find a Loophole  
Ye I'm living for revival, dying for a new soul  
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home  
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
It's been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Now I'm running for the light in the tunnel but it's just the train  
Ye I'm looking for the right type of pleasure but all I find is pain  
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home  
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo  
  
It's been a long time coming  
Ye it's been a long time coming  
It's been a long time coming  
Been so long but I gotta Shine my Rusty halo  
  
Everyone's running from something but we don't know when it's coming  
So we keep running and running

You've read the books, you've watched the shows  
What's the best way, no one knows  
  
Meditate, yea, hypnotized  
Anything to take it from your mind  
But it won't go  
You're doing all these things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
You had the drink, you take a toke  
Watch the past go up in smoke  
You fake a smile, ya, lie and say  
You're better now than ever and your life's okay  
But it's not, no  
  
You're doing all these things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
  
You tell your friends, yea strangers too  
Anyone who will throw an arm around you  
Tarot cards, gems and stones  
Believing all the shit's gonna heal your soul  
Well it's not, whoa  
  
You're only doing things out of desperation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
  
Oh no there's no starting over  
Without finding closure  
You take them back no hesitation  
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation  
  
Oh no there's no starting over  
Without finding closure  
You take them back no hesitation  
That's how you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation  
  
First, you think the worst is a broken heart  
What's gonna kill you is the second part  
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle  
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself  
Fifth, you see them out with someone else  
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little  
  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
You're going through six degrees of separation  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self  
Oh no there ain't no helping, to remember one's self

All the life, she has seen  
All the meaner side of me  
They took away the prophet's dream  
For a profit on the street  
Now she's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
All his life, he's been told  
He'll be nothing when he's old  
All the kicks and all the blows  
He will never let it show  
Cause he's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
[Verse 2]  
All the hurt, all the lies, all the tears that they cry  
When the moment is just right  
You'll see fire in their eyes, because he's stronger than you know  
A heart of steel starts to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power  
  
[Bridge]  
She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow  
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode  
  
She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul  
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control  
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow  
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode  
  
[Chorus]  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly

When you've fighting for it all your life  
You've been working every day and night  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly  
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)  
  
Oh yeah! Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!  
  
When you've been fighting for it all your life  
You've been struggling to make things right  
That's a how a superhero learns to fly

Going back to the corner where I first saw you,  
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move,  
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand,  
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am,  
Some try to hand me money they don't understand,  
I'm not, broke I'm just a broken hearted man,  
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do,  
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you  
  
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,  
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet,  
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.  
  
So I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
Policeman says son you can't stay here,  
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,  
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,  
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.  
  
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,  
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet,  
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.  
  
So I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
People talk about the guy  
Who's waiting on a girl  
  
There are no holes in his shoes  
But a big hole in his world  
  
And maybe I'll get famous as man who can't be moved,  
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,  
And you'll come running to the corner  
'Cause you'll know it's just for you  
  
I'm the man who can't be moved  
I'm the man who can't be moved  
  
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,  
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,  
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet,  
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.  
  
So I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
I'm not moving  
I'm not moving  
  
Going back to the corner where I first saw you,  
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag not I'm not gonna move.

I don't know why she's with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her, by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
But now I've broken away  
Somehow instead she forgave me  
She said a woman's got to do what she's got to do  
Even if it means she denied herself the truth  
'Cause when you're in too deep you wake up when it's too late,  
You've fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
  
She's standing in the heart of darkness  
Saying I know you got a soul even though you're heartless  
How could any woman in their right mind be so blind,  
To find something this safe  
Instead of walking with me she should have walked away  
  
She finds color in the darkest places  
She finds beauty in the saddest of faces  
For such a clued in, headstrong city girl  
Could've had the world but she's fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
(Oh, yeah)  
But still she stays  
(Oh, yeah)  
  
I don't know why she's with me  
I only brought her trouble since the day she met me  
If I was her, by now I would have left me  
I would have walked away  
  
But you've fallen in love in the worst way  
And if you don't go now then you'll stay  
'Cause I'll never let you leave, never let you breathe  
'Cause if you're looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain't me  
  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
So walk away  
(walk away)  
Walk away, oh  
Save yourself from the heartache, oh  
Go now before it's too late  
But still she stays  
  
(Yeah)  
But still she stays, eh  
I'm saying walk away  
Yeah  
I'm saying walk away  
(Save yourself from the heartache, go now before it's too late)  
But still she stays  
Still she stays  
Yeah, she stays  
She stays
