I packed my bags - in the land of rags  
'Cause I don't believe in them dimmo drags  
Don't want to vote for the left wing - don't want to vote for the right  
I gotta have both-to make me fly  
  
Just a whitey from Blighty - heading out west  
Got my little green card an' my bulletproof vest  
Goin' to old tube city - where the buzz is the best  
On down the line (down the line) down the line (down the line)  
  
Well I was born (on the line) an' I was raised (on the line)  
I was schooled (on the line) an' I was fazed (on the line)  
An' I was used (on the line) an' I was dazed (on the line)  
Just had to split (off the line) 'cause I was crazed (off the line)  
  
An' I remember all the good times - me 'n Miller enjoyed  
Up and down the M1 in some luminous yo-yo toy  
But the future has to change - and to change I've got to destroy  
Oh look out Lennon here I come - land ahoy-hoy-hoy  
  
All American Alien Boy All American Alien Boy  
Don't look down put your feet on the ground don't drown in the big aquarium  
Don't walk slow - put on a big show - shove your meat down vegetarians  
Don't get slugged, get mugged, get bugged, or they'll sling you in the jug  
Shove you under some rug, give you some drug - pull out the plug and then...  
  
And they're telling me this hamburger's cheaper than the other  
An' this television's cheaper than the other  
And they're selling me hotdogs cheaper than the other  
An' these pizzas cheaper than the other  
And I don't understand all this - I'm just an All American Alien Boy  
  
An' they're telling me rifles are shot in Connecticut  
They're telling me pistols are shot in Westchester  
You can get a Saturday Night Special on Flatbush, on the Bowery, or the Bronx  
  
Or on 42nd Street - And I don't understand all this - being an All American
Alien Boy  
I've got sodium nitrate rotting in my guts  
My head's full of ulcers I got lungs full of butts  
My heart wants a transplant - it thinks that I'm nuts  
My luggage won't open - my eyes won't shut  
An' I'm beginning to dig all this - being an All American Alien Boy  
  
And your women are always right (alright)  
They always know so much more  
'Cause the women came from heaven  
An' the men came outta some store  
An' they don't know who they are and they don't know what they're for  
  
I'm an All American Alien Boy - look out Mary Tyler Moore  
All American Alien Boy  
  
Ten Bears, Two Bears, Standing Bear, Plenty Bear,  
Old Bear, Brave Bear, Hollow Horn Bear  
Silver Knife, Spotted Tail, Yellow Hand, Red Cloud,  
Red Fox, Red Horse, Black Kettle,  
White Ghost, White Bull, White Thunder, White Hog,  
Hold on a minute gotta frog in my throat  
Cochise, Alchise, Roman Nose, Geronimo - hold on a minute - more to go  
Sitting Bull, Tall Bull, Crazy Horse and Short Bull,  
Low Dog, Red Dog, Yellow Wolf, Low Wolf  
Loco, Victorio, Chato, Little Crow, Dead Eyes, Jak, Taza an' Colorow  
My mouth's exploding that's enough of this noise  
I guess we're all - All American Alien Boys.

Forgot my six-string razor, hit the sky  
Half way to memphis fore I realized  
Well I rang the information, my axe was cold  
They said she rides the train to oreoles  
  
Now its a mighty long way down the dusty trail  
And the sun burns hot on the cold steel rails  
N I look like a bum n I crawl like a snail  
All the way from memphis  
  
Well I got to oreoles ya know, it took a month  
And there was my guitar, electric junk.  
Some spade said rock n' rollers, you're all the same.  
Man that's your instrument. I felt so ashamed.  
  
Now its a mighty long way down rock n' roll  
Through the Bradford cities and the oreoles  
N you look like a star but you're still on the dole  
All the way from memphis  
  
Yeah its a mighty long way down rock n' roll  
From the Liverpool docks to the Hollywood bowl  
N you climb up the mountains n you fall down the holes  
All the way from memphis  
  
Yeah its a mighty long way down rock n'roll  
As your name gets hot so your heart grows cold  
N you gotta stay young man, you can never be old  
All the way from memphis  
  
Yeah its a mighty long way down rock n' roll  
Through the Bradford cities and the oreoles  
N you look like a star but you're really out on parole!  
All the way from memphis

(ian hunter)  
One more town on the merry-go-round  
One more room with no view  
One more punk eatin' nothing but junk  
Trin' to make a phone call to you  
Well maybe I'll never, get myself together  
But something's in the back of my mid  
It only takes one call-you can laugh at 'em all  
You're never too small to hit the big time  
One more slob feeling sick as a dog  
After one more night on the booze  
One more dive more dead that alive  
Tryin' to get my message through  
Now, maybe I'll never get my self together  
Maybe it's the end of the line  
But I'm having a ball-bouncin' off the walls  
You're never too small to hit the big time  
You're never too small, you're never too small  
You're never to small to hit the big time  
They can make you crawl, they can make you fall  
But you're never to small to hit the big time  
You're never too small, you're never to small  
You're never too small to hit the big time  
If you're fat, if you're bald it don't matter at all  
'cause you're never to small-I said you're never to small  
To hit the big time (yes indeed)  
(the big time(- limousines)  
(the big time)-you can have it all  
(the big time)- I say you're never too small  
One more crowd shoutin'-turn it up loud  
One more rose at my feet  
One more ring from that cute little thing  
One more reason to cheat  
Well, maybe I'll never get myself together  
Maybe it's the end of the line...  

Genocidal tendencies are silly to extreme  
After all you're still quite small you don't know where you've been  
You was only swearing yesterday  
Oh you want to win the world away  
But now you got nothing to say-ay-ay  
Boy you're getting out of hand  
You've got to make a stand  
So put the coke away  
Boy you got the do the show  
Got to let the people know  
You got the strength to stay  
  
I can see you run  
I can see you hide  
Oh your heart is aching  
Lost in a dream of what might have been  
You're the guide  
You're the number one  
And your knees are shaking  
Stand and deliver in an endless dream  
  
Schizophrenic, photogenic, aggravates me so  
Only yes-men  
Have a guess man  
Watch the spirit go  
Batman zips the monster as he bleeds  
And gets up on the buzz he needs  
And a kid on the street just reads  
And reads, and reads, and reads  
And reads, and reads, and reads  
  
Boy it's them hard case city blues  
Cagney is the news  
Does the giant ring a bell  
Boy it's the Hudson East river cruise  
It's the Empire State buffoons  
Oh you know the story well  
  
Do you have to run  
Do you have to hide  
There's a new tomorrow  
Yes you're a mess  
But you're more than less  
When this battles won  
You can look inside  
Oh you did not borrow  
Yes you're the best  
But you still can't rest  
You know, you know  
  
The carnival is closed  
Your street's alive with ghosts  
But a friend says don't look back  
Don't look back, don't look round  
Your vision is your fate  
Through long electric nights  
When a woman helps you write  
Na na na, na na na  
Na  
Na na na, na na na  
  
Cheer up mate, put the dramas in the past  
See you did not have to fast  
Euphemism lasts and lasts and lasts  
And lasts, and lasts, and lasts  
And lasts, and lasts  
Boy if you've got an axe to grind  
Be thankful for this time  
For it gives you what you need  
Boy you've got an eighty-eight to play  
It'll tell you what to say  
It'll tell you when to breathe  
  
Boy take a turnpike heading West  
Turn the people on to Beau Geste  
'Cause that's what you did the best  
Boy play the pipes 'til they're old and worn  
Sing the words 'til they fall forlorn  
Like the pieces of a jigsaw jet  
Boy don't let the Earth get in your face  
Its a middle-aged displace  
Its the middle ages snide  
  
Boy we're a million miles away  
And to think its so insane  
Take a chance on a one way ride  
Boy shoot a rocket clean out of your mind  
Oh these people ain't your kind  
No they ain't your kind at all  
  
Boy shoot a rocket clean out of your brain  
No these people ain't the same  
You can hear another call  
Boy the other book starts with no  
They don't show us how to grow  
They only show us how to win  
  
Boy the secret's in the bicycle shed  
Ain't no answers now they're dead  
To seek is a mortal sin  
Hey you know boy let your madness be the clue

Green lights on Broadway  
All the magic seems to say  
Come and ride with me baby you know  
It's got to be the greatest show on Broadway  
Out here on the streets they say  
You can see your life in one day  
I long I long I long I long I long to hear every single street singer  
Oh what a mood that feeling brings  
You can capture life in a jar  
Chances are that you'll find out on Broadway  
Who you really are  
  
Sitting in a lonely room  
Staring through the evening gloom  
She'll never make the grade on Broadway  
She'll never spend exciting nights  
Surrounded by a maze of lights  
And stars that line the streets on Broadway  
  
Broadway  
When the neon lights are shining bright  
She knows she's going to make it someday  
Broadway  
You can hear the music of the night  
She knows that she will  
Broadway  
When the neon lights are shining bright  
Oh I know she's going to make it some day  
Broadway  
You can hear the music of the night  
I know that she will  
I said  
Broadway  
Oh how I love you how I love you  
Broadway  
How I love you how I love you  
Broadway  
It's your show I know I know  
But chances are you'll find out on Broadway  
Who you really are

Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home  
If I had one wish, I wish I could  
Go back to my old neighborhood  
Where the good folks, they all love you as their own  
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house  
Knock on the door and they'd all sing out  
"Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home"  
I'd sing their praises long and loud  
'Cause they're all my folks and I'm mighty proud  
Of the little old town back home where I was born  
I wish that I could hear them say  
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way  
"Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home"  
Well, they don't lock their doors at night  
'Cause they all know they're a doin' right  
And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own  
If I'd go back to hear them pray  
In the little pine church, they all would say  
"Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home"  
Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

China, china, the evening's moving in  
See you, soon now, the boat moves with the wind  
China, china, I can see the harbour lights  
Light your, fire, we'll be warm tonight  
  
China, china, the thoughts drift from the sea  
I'm dreaming, of you, wear your dress for me  
China, china, the oceans on the wheel(? )  
The seagulls flying lower now  
China I can feel you by my side  
Across the bay, across the tyne  
Can you hear me say  
  
China, china, wear your hair down low  
Lady, lady, you're frozen to the bone  
China, china, the catch was good today  
The oilskins clinging to my back  
And the lantern gently sways  
  
Oh don't you cry, the kids to bed  
Didn't mean the things I said  
  
China, china, the years go rolling by  
Laughter, sorrow, I will not make you cry  
China, china, think before you speak  
Always remember the ocean hauls as deep  
And if I'm tired of feeling low  
Don't let me sleep, you know  
  
China, china, the men are on the quay  
Drinking, smoking, talking quietly  
The water's calmer now  
All my work is done  
So china, see ya.

All this energy callin' me  
Back where it comes from  
It's such a crude attitude  
It's back where it belongs  
  
All the little kids goin' up on the skits go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Jumpin' Jane Jean, and moonin' James Dean go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
  
Momma knows, but she don't care,she's got her worries too  
Seven kids, and a phony affair, and the rent is due  
  
All the little chicks with the crimson lips go  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Livin' in sin with a safety pin goin'  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
  
I got some records from World War II  
I play 'em just like me grand dad do  
  
He was a rocker, and I am too  
Now Cleveland rocks, Now Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!  
Cleveland rocks!  
OHIO  

I used to see you on the avenue  
You were the girl that let me follow you  
You used to hang out in the alleyway  
You sewed a button on my shirt one day  
  
I asked around til I found your name  
Then underneath the arches in the pourin' rain  
I said you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way  
  
Do you want to, do you want to, do you want to dance  
Take a chance baby, take a chance  
I'll be with you every step of the way  
I'll even show you how to strut someday  
  
Ain't got a girl 'n' it's a cryin' shame  
I can't figure out who's to blame  
I want you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way  
  
I know, things gettin' better  
I know, it's gonna be o.k.  
So don't go, I ain't gonna let ya  
I want to be with you, every step of the way  
  
So take a walk down the avenue  
Just you 'n' me baby, me 'n' you  
Remember that night in the alleyway  
You know something, you still look the same  
  
This world is a mean old world  
It don't mean nothin' without you girl  
I want you (yeah you)  
I want you, every step of the way

Some folk leave you courage  
Some folk leave you hope  
Why am I out here hangin'  
Like a fool on the end of my rope?  
Some folk leave you wisdom  
Some folk throw you signs  
You can never be sure what went on before  
Life is just a matter of time  
Pictures of you, clouding my view  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to make some sense of it all  
Maybe it's a sign of weakness  
But that's where my footsteps fall  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to hold on to your dreams  
You never got what you wanted  
So I never got what I need  
I'm following in your footsteps  
'cause that's where your footsteps lead  
Someone must have left me anger  
Someone must have given me hate  
Or why would I stand here shakin'  
When there's so many chances to take?  
Pictures of you, climb into view  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to make some sense of it all  
Well, maybe it's a sign of weakness  
But that's where my footsteps fall  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Watchin' my children grow  
They'll be following in my footsteps  
Takin' it down the road  
We're following in your footsteps  
'cause that's where your footsteps go  
We're following in your footsteps  
Takin' it down the road  
We're following in your footsteps, yeah  
'cause that's where your footsteps go  

The kids are ok  
They're telling you now  
But you're letting them down  
Cause you just don't know how  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
I'm spinning in space  
I'm laughing away  
Your so pathetic  
I can just hear them say  
It's like a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
See hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
Get near it  
It's a golden opportunity  
  
We reckon they're rats  
Now see how they run  
My house is so common  
And we're dumb we're so dumb  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
Scream all you suckers  
Scream all you can  
I'm losing my bluff  
It's a scam its a scam  
And it's a golden opportunity  
  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
It's like a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it hear it  
It's like a golden opportunity  
Alright!  
You better hear it hear it  
Hear it hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
Hear it  
Hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
It's a golden opportunity  
You better hear it  
You better hear it  
It's a golden opportunity

(honest john plain)  
It's cold outside - it looks like rain  
To make matters worse, I missed me last train  
Now I was thinking she'd show me a bed  
To my surprise got shown the door instead  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
She said she wants a fella with a gti  
Always home on time, steak and kidney pie  
She made it quite pretty, it was plain to see  
There's no place here for a rocker like me  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Girls like peggy-sue, maggie-may and sheena too  
Where have all the good girls gone?  
Girls like my dear old mum, who never stopped me having fun  
Where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Where've they gone?  
Where have all the good (3) girls gone? (2)  
So she throws me out in the pouring rain  
Girls like that give girls a bad name  
Why can't I find a girl just like betty d.  
With an hourglass figure like norma jean  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?  
Where 've they gone?  

Lost in the middle of nowhere  
As cold as a stone in the sky  
Regretting the mistakes that I made  
When I was a young boy  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
  
Lookin' for an answer that I ain't found yet  
A twinkle in a blind's man eye  
Lookin' for the light at the end of the tunnel  
Looking for a reason why  
  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
Where's my guiding light  
Where's my guiding light  
  
I know you're out there  
I know you're out there  
I know you're out there  
Guiding Light  
  
Somewhere in the darkest night  
  
I swear on the cover of the King James Bible  
I'm never gonna let you go  
You're my idol, you're my survival  
I just want you to know  
  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
  
I been searchin'  
I been searchin'  
I been searchin'  
One day I will find my guiding light  
  
And we'll shoot for the moon together  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe

How much more can i take  
You're draggin' me down  
Holding me under  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take

These clothes have a way  
Of changin' what i'm feelin'  
I try and i try but i can't put 'em on  
  
I sit here alone  
Wait by the telephone line  
How much more can i take  
I'm jealous as hell  
Mixed up 'n mean as well  
How much more can i take  
  
How much more can i take  
I know she'd like to break  
Those stones over my body.  
You fill my eyes  
But you don't fill the hunger  
How much more can i take

I was a cold, cold room.  
No one lived in me.  
I was an empty tune.  
Lovers came to view  
'n' they looked all around.  
But they couldn't see nothin',  
Nothin but the ground, they really put me down  
And then someone broke  
Inside of me  
And i found myself learnin'  
How to fight free.  
  
And it feels so good  
When i can turn to you  
'n' look you straight in the eye,  
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over and over, over again.  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i got you up my brain  
Over, over, over again.  
  
You know it hurts so bad  
When you have to say  
You ain't got nobody  
And then one day  
It makes you feel so good  
When i can turn to you  
And look you straight in the eye,  
Say i need you, need you, oh i need you  
I need your love, baby,  
I need your love, i want to hear your name  
Over and over, over again.  
I need your love,  
Oh how i need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over, over, over again, yeah.  
I need your love, baby  
I need your love, i gotta hear your name  
Over, over, over again.

I fell in love with a working girl  
We both grew up in a working world  
Julie Christie jaw full 'o' them pearly whites  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
She never bought herself the finest clothes  
She couldn't care less about buttons and bows  
She says what counts is what's inside  
It's just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
There ain't no makeup, not a trace  
She can cut you off and put you in your place  
Her bark has gotta be worse than her bite  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
It's West Side Story  
Only two lovers could tell  
When you walked in the room  
Everything stopped  
It's inevitable  
Inevitable  
  
I fell in love with a working girl  
It works for me 'n' it works for her  
When we get it on lightning strikes  
It's just the way you look tonight  
  
It's just the way you look tonight  
You got the face of an angel  
I can feel your halo burnin' bright  
Just the way you look tonight

(ian hunter)  
  
I love your sulky eyes,  
I love your raven hair.  
I often fantasize  
A beautiful affair,  
A broken paradise  
'cause you don't even care.  
I love your sultry smile,  
I love to see you dance.  
Sometimes it drives me wild  
To know I've got no chance.  
Your boyfriend doesn't see  
You're flirting, teasing me.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Sometimes I'll act ok,  
Sometimes I'll try and hide.  
But when you look at me,  
I fall apart inside.  
Across a broken sea  
You took me for a ride.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Other lovers go home  
And I'm left here alone  
With my heart in my hand.  
I just can't understand  
Why you treat me this way.  
I just got to say.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
Why don't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone?  
Won't you leave me alone,  
Leave me alone.  
  
(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Why don't you leave me,  
Leave me alone, oh)

There's a wango-tango  
At the peppermint inn  
I'm gonna be there  
Shakin' my thing  
Be bop a lula  
Little Peggy Sue  
We both got company  
Don't know what to do  
But that's alright  
Yeah that's OK  
In the middle of the night  
Here's Lisa  
  
[Chorus]  
Lisa likes rock 'n' roll,  
She plays it every day.  
Down by the drugstore  
Everybody ??  
She turnin' on the radio,  
She's shootin' up the stereo,  
Puttin' on a video,  
She's sayin' let's go let's go  
  
Lisa won't marry me,  
She says she's only four.  
Her mum don't like me,  
She says I'm too mature.  
Down at the disco,  
I go solo  
And the girls don't want to know,  
I've been too slow.  
And that's alright,  
And that's OK,  
In the middle of the night.  
Here's Lisa.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you see her  
You wish you could ?? her.  
Ain't no one can beat her.  
She goes yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah,

(mick, I've got a...)  
There must be one million stories in new york city, the naked city, and this
is one of 'em  
I live out on the island, and I got problems  
My mom don't like me, cause she says I know sultan(? )  
Sitting in the cark park, in my old buick skylark  
Getting high, getting high,  
Getting high on the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Oh it ain't easy, when you gotta survive  
Keep on giving death, just to survive  
Oh get out into the car park, sitting in my own buick skylark in the dark  
Oh, 'n I'll listen to the eight track  
Oh, I'll listen to the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Oh, listen to the eight track  
Yeah, can't wind it back  
Listen to the eight track  
In between the seats, in the cracks  
Listen to the eight track  
Oh sometimes I get a woman in here  
And I put on bruce springsteen's new double album  
And then, just when everything's getting hot  
I start turning the volume right down low  
Baby, let me snuggle right next to you  
You turned to me sweetly, you know what she said,  
She said, turn up the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track  
Oh listen to the eight track, ain't no winding it back  
Listen to the eight track  
Listen to the eight track  
Listen to the eight track  
There must have been about a million stories in new york city, the naked city,
and this has been one of them!  

Once upon a time  
Somewhere in the back of my mind  
I fell in love with you  
But then  
Everything went wrong  
I couldn't even write a song  
There was nothing to look forward to  
I don't go out very much  
I'm always home on my own  
Baby, I was just too blind to see  
I wanted to conquer the world  
But the world had a mind of its own  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you away too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
So sing and all the world will shine  
Somewhere in this nursery rhyme  
A happy ending lies  
For all the lovers with the lonely eyes  
Easy come, easy go  
This is just to let you know  
Baby, I apologize  
How could I turn away love?  
How could I turn into stone?  
How could I turn my back on you?  
I wanted to be a success  
But success ever leaves you alone  
Maybe I tried a little too hard  
Maybe I pushed you way too far  
Got a room in your heart for a lonely heart  
Got a room in your heart for two  
It might be nice  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart  
Living in a heart with you

Take a thousand pin-up girls to stepney to bombay  
Take me to fancy restaurants to be amongst the whole milay  
And all the blue-eyed gals of 6 foot 3  
Are gonna leave you broken down on your knees  
Cause in the golden locks and their fluttering lashes  
You say, "I told you", all day long  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Just when you thought it was safe to get it on  
Watch out for their teeth boys you never trust a blonde  
  
I been dreaming of clinches  
With scene stealing wenches  
And stars of hollywood and Vine  
Too many goofs and ham-fisted moves and blaming it on the wine  
Now your best bet's, a hung lovin' brunette  
Make it quick boys cause I ain't got long  
And turn your back on the girl in black  
You never trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
Forget all that stuff about ad-men, like my own father  
My daddy said, "rocky, don't even trust your mom"!  
  
They all queue in line, they wanna see me hung, drawn and quartered  
Sure as anight on the moon shine, a recipe for leaving me slaughtered  
So beware of the smell and the lies they all tell  
One line from a fair blues song  
I'm telling you mate, when the hour gets late  
You cannot trust a blonde  
  
Never (never) trust a blonde  
Yeah, never (never) trust a blonde  
You think you can hide behind peroxide, then you got it wrong, so wrong  
Watch out for their teeth boys, never trust a blonde  
  
Here comes another, never trust a blonde  
She could be a mother, never trust a blonde  
Even in China, they never trust a blonde  
She minght be a blinder, never trust a blonde  
Never, ever rush 'em, never trust a blonde  
It's best if I crush 'em, never trust a blonde  
One more for good luck, never trust a blonde  
Squeeze in another, never trust a blonde

I can smile on a warm summer day  
I can laugh, I can listen to the children play  
But I'm going to miss the killer with the kiss  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
It?s going to rain, hope it don't rain on you  
There's going to be a lot of pain before this thing is through  
If Jesus was alive, he'd be standing on the M5  
Holding up a neon sign screaming  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, so many people can't see  
They think that love is blind but it ain't free  
There's a line, so many people have crossed and now  
Their love is lost, say, "Goodbye", my funny valentine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
I can run just as far as my eyes can see  
And I'm free, yeah, just as free as I want to be  
But I won't ever forget that crazy little planet  
He was a friend of mine  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time, now is the time  
Now is the time  

Sometimes you realize  
That there is an end to life.  
Yesterday I heard them say  
A hero's blown away.  
And it's so hard to lose  
Someone who's close to you.  
Oh me, I did not see  
The danger every day.  
But music's something in the air,  
So he can play it anywhere.  
Old records never die.  
  
Get you're healing from a song,  
Just when everything goes wrong.  
Play it right  
Through the night  
Till morning brings you light.  
And if some folk laugh at you  
Let 'em all laugh they never knew.  
Oh all those scenes, to me it seems  
Some folk never dream.  
??, I feel a force  
Rebel with some other cause.  
Old records never die.  
  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
You can see it in their eyes.  
Old records never die.  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
??  
Old records never die.  
I can hear you  
And I know why  
Old records never die.

Well the times gettin' hard for you little girl  
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over god's world  
You don't remember when you got your last meal  
And you forgot just how a woman feels  
You didn't know what rock n' roll was  
Until you met a drummer on a greyhound bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line  
  
Well in the middle of the night  
On the open road  
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold  
You're gettin' tired baby, you're lookin' kinda beat  
The music of the street, drive you off your feet  
You didn't know how rock n' roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group  
Half-way home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep  
All the blood on my hand and my les paul heat  
I can't leave you home cos you're runnin' around  
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town  
  
You didn't know that rock n' roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned  
You got the rhythm, you got the speed  
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
I didn't know ya got a rock n' roll record  
Until a saw your picture on another guy's jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
And look at you now, well it's dark as it's dumb  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe

In the heat of the Indian summer  
Out along the Appalachian way  
You can hear the sound of the overnight angels  
As they pray  
Charged by the light of some mariners lantern  
Spitting out a cold but triangular spray  
Can't you hear the screams of the overnight angels  
As they play  
  
Talking to the spirits through a silver curtain  
Reaching out beyond the length of the light  
You can catch a glimpse of an overnight angel  
As he shines  
Dancing through the toys of the dead and the living  
Laughing at the poets changing their rhymes  
Can't you feel the pulse of the overnight angels  
Beating time  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the overnight angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the overnight angels angels angels  
  
Children of the junkies led the revolution  
Push yourselves over get yourselves there  
Someone throw their arms round the overnight angels  
Cause they care  
Angels don't need no phony religion  
Throw them out along with the ethnic nowheres  
They will never speak to the overnight angels  
They can only stare  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the overnight angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the overnight angels angels angels angels  
  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels  
Can you hear us can you hear us  
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels Angels  
  
Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Angels Angels Angels Angels  
Overnight Angels  
Overnight Angels  
Talking about  
The Overnight Angels

Billy said this town is dying,  
It's dying just to be like me.  
He was fighting everything in sight,  
Died when he was 23.  
I used to meet him down at his cafe,  
He had one eye on the door  
And the other on the writing on the wall.  
He'd get restless and angry and we'd all laugh  
'cause we weren't really scared,  
We was his friends, he wouldn't hurt us at all  
And all he'd say was rain, rain, rain  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.  
We gotta leave this town.  
  
And glover was a dancer,  
Imitating eddie cochran by the jukebox.  
In the corner of the room  
'till he was lost.  
Barry 'n me, we used to escape, playing i go ape  
Wearing italian clothes drinking cider talking in the rain  
Hey babe, come over here, let me buy you a beer, what's your name,  
She said "boy, it doesn't really matter, don't you see?  
You ain't what i want, you ain't what i need,  
You ain't what i fancy, you ain't what i dream of 'n i'd silently leave  
?? you're ugly.  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain.  
I gotta leave this place.  
  
My history is a cop-out  
Somewhere in the dark i got scared 'cause i knew i was gonna loose.  
You know that feeling you get in your guts, all that frustration when you know  
You're going nuts.  
You gotta make a move.  
There was billy and glover and pacer and taylor and valerie and barry  
I remember what he said about that town.  
He said "i went to london once, came back,  
Wiped the tears from my eyes, looked out the window,  
And it was still pouring down,  
More of that rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain,  
Rain, rain, rain."  
I'm gonna get a train,  
Never coming back again.  
'cause if i did it would be the same.  
Boy, you really messed up my brain.  
  
All of that rain rain rain,  
Rain rain rain  
Rain rain rain  
Rain rain rain  
  
Take your washing off the line.  
Take your washing off the line.  
Take your washing off the line.  
Take the washing off the line.  
  
It's gonna rain.  
It's gonna rain.

He searched through his love like a thief on the run  
He searched through his face - to see the guilt water run  
But he's fresh out of tears and nobody has come  
And justice has got to be done  
  
Oh moon in the city stay open and clear  
For his vision ain't good and his mind's disappeared  
"get along mother nature" they spat at your son  
So justice has got to be done  
  
And beauty is lying alone in the park  
Her friend has gone bowling in the alleys so dark  
Where's her knight in white armor who rides a chrome ford  
Justice would seem to be bored  
Justice would seem to be bored  
  
A knife full of life penetrated the bait  
While he thinks 'o the sister and the mother that he hates  
And he thinks he'll get off ''cause he's sick, and stoned  
And justice was made to be honed  
And justice was made to be honed  
  
And his lawyer is smiling one hell of a smile  
'n he's lying all the lies - of the lies in exile  
While she's dying of grief he's defending his brief  
And justice would seem to be cheap  
And justice would seem to be cheap  
  
Well I've searched through the falling, and I searched through the failed  
I've searched through the jury - the judge and the jailed  
But sleeping beauty is dead no use pricking her thumb  
And justice has got to be done  
  
Justice just is - justice just is - justice just is - not!

In 1935, I was living in paradise, I had a friend up in Cicero  
We used to go out to the track, we'd knock a few whiskeys back  
I'd lose my shirt and then I would lose my way home  
I was driving my Stutz Black Hawk through Justice in the dark  
When suddenly the blood froze in my veins  
She was standing by the road in an incandescent glow  
My heart stood still, my foot slammed on the brakes  
She said, "Please, please would you dignify my wish?  
I'm trying to get to Heaven, could you tell me where that is?"  
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white  
I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary  
I was trembling like a leaf, I was scared beyond belief  
After all my conscience ain't that clear  
I used to work for Mickey Finn, I did the numbers for Big Jim  
Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here  
I said, "Please, please, I would dignify your wish  
But when it comes to Heaven, I'm just a little bit amateurish  
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white  
I cheated time with Resurrection Mary  
And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time, I felt something  
Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air  
For the first time in my life, and I said, "Mary, go to the light  
It's gonna be alright"  
I got down on my knees, I said, "Sweet Mary, please dignify  
These wishes before you run", will you tell him I've reformed?  
Will you tell him I'm reborn? She closed her eyes  
And then she spoke in tongues  
I said, "Please, please, tell me what he said", she said  
"You must die the day before the devil knows you're dead"  
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white  
I waved goodbye on a wild Chicago night  

Waiting on an elevator, in a hotel out in California  
Smog clouds up in the windows, but there is a plaque up on the wall  
That tells of the Agoras, people who were here long before us  
Before the covered wagons, before they lost it all  
  
They were hunters, they were fishermen und they often fought each other  
But one small tribe was different, their leader was a peaceful man  
They were weavers, they were painters, trading pelts for pretty colours  
Protected by the warriors for the beauty in their hands  
Roll back the years, roll back the years, to the river of tears  
  
The chief he had a daughter, she was young and she was beautiful  
He said, "Go into the forest, get some berries for the dye  
But make your way back quickly, for the old bear's getting hungry  
I don't want you out there, when the sun falls from the sky"  
  
Her basket filled with berries, she headed back toward the village  
  
When a mighty roar erupted, she ran und hid inside a hollow tree  
Shadows were getting longer, the forest was getting colder  
And the chief began to panic, where could his daughter be?  
Lost in the years, lost in the years, on the river of tears  
  
In the camp the fires were dying when the old chief started crying  
Soon all the tribe were crying, the ground grew wet beneath their feet  
And the tears they turned to water and the water became a river  
And the river flowed like an arrow, to the foot of a hollow tree  
  
And the girl looked out in wonder, as she saw the water falling  
She knew it was her father and she swam to his canoe  
And all the tribe stopped crying, and the river started subsiding  
Into the hill of the Agoras, and so the legend grew  
Roll back the years, roll back the years  
Roll back the years, to the river of tears  
I wish all the world was healing

Doctor, doctor, am I alright?  
I keep on stayin' up - all through the night  
Smokin', drinkin', watchin' t.v. 'til the light  
  
It's been a long time since I slept  
All I seem to think about is what I ain't yet  
I'm seeing double  
  
Doctor, doctor, am I in need?  
Seems like there's somethin' wrong with me  
Underneath this stone lies a different guy  
  
My head says yeah - my body says no  
I can't seem to get up - I can't seem to go  
  
I'm seeing double  
In the middle of my life - it's just a little strange  
All those people - they're alright - if they'd stop messin' with my brain  
  
I remember when the world was new  
Doctor, doctor, what can you do?  
  
I'm tired of runnin' - give me something to slow down  
Ain't been to bed in over a week  
I can't catch up son sleep - it's playing hide 'n' seek  
I'm seeing double

Where do you go when you've somewhere to run  
But the time isn't right and there's things to be done  
And you're trapped half-way up, you don't want to go back  
So you keep going on - compromising the lack  
  
And you see the green fields as you travel on by  
And you look at the things you'd forgotten to try  
And you wish you were young and you wish you were old  
For the songs always sung and the stories been told  
  
And you thought you were different but what did it mean  
For you tricked yourself trying - life's still unseen  
As it is, as it was, as it always will be  
Will you find out at all what it is to be free  
  
See it never was easy to live with a head  
So I kept to the back room and I live there instead  
What comes from the front-room is only for "Friends"  
I have a bay window but that's where it ends  
  
And it's here I see pictures and my madness is clear  
And there's no longer logic so therefore no fear  
And I'm almost dead with uncontrollable light  
Sometimes when I've written a song - it's alright...

Her life gets smaller in his eyes  
And he wonders if he thinks he should cry  
Oh mother the colour's gone and left your hair  
And he wonders if he thinks he should care  
She told him how to play a guitar  
She told him how to be a star  
But mother were you really there  
  
My friend don't speak he's such a mixed up boy  
I wonder if she sold him his toys  
A kiss on the cheek a conversation decoy  
In his cute little corduroys  
Oh she taught him how to win the game  
She taught him everything is your name  
Oh mother did you have to destroy  
Mother if you really cared  
You'd talk to him cry for him  
All you every did was dream  
All you ever said was be cool be cool be cool  
And I think you made a mess of his life  
And I think he made a mess of your life  
And I think it made a mess of my life  
  
Mother if you really cared  
You'd talk to him cry for him  
All you every did was dream  
All you ever said was be cool be cool be cool  
And I think you made a mess of her life  
And I think she made a mess of your life  
And I think it made a mess of my life  
I think you made a mess of my life  
I think you made a mess of my life

(ian hunter)  
  
We walked to the sea, just my father and me  
And the dogs played around on the sand.  
Winter cold cut the air, hanging still everywhere  
Dressed in gray did he say hold my hand?  
I said love's easier when it's far away  
We sat and watched the distant lights.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
And we smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night.  
  
There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky.  
There's another that rides far behind.  
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide  
Ways apart as we drift on through time.  
He said it's harder now you're far away  
We only read you when you write.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We both smile when we say it's alright.  
We're still here, oh it's just that we're out of sight  
Like those ships that pass in the night.  
  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
We're two ships that pass in the night  
  
(repeat and fade)

You're just a stranger in the past  
Just another mug that could never last  
You came up slow but you burned out fast (didn't ya)  
  
It ain't Silver Needles on the run  
No it ain't Silver Needles on the run  
It ain't Silver Needles on the run  
Shh you make me feel so bad  
  
You thought you was the only one that got messed up  
Me 'n all the others never had it so rough  
Well how come you're dead and I'm still stood up  
  
Well it ain't Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
No it ain't Silver Needles on the run  
Oh I remember....  
  
All your plans were made on some PR floor  
'N all your bags were packed, they never reached the door.  
Out ordering (?) your thought exchange  
All your brains were acting strange  
You never lied in dreams before  
There must be more to life than getting sore  
  
(What do you think?)  
I seen in some music paper that you was gone  
And I went right out and wrote you a farewell song  
Boy, they had you dead before you was born  
And it's a shame - you were such a great mover  
  
But it ain't Silver Needles on the run  
No it ain't Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
Silver Needles on the run  
(Next)

Well, I lay underneath an ageless sky  
I watched the universe breathing  
There's more going on up there than meets the eye  
Give me something to believe in  
Which way's in and which way's out  
Every step is misleading  
Well, which way is up which way is down?  
You gotta have something to believe in  
Oh, let me dream, let me dream  
I spend my whole life dreaming  
I've been lucky but I'm still mean  
You gotta have something to believe in  
I didn't mean to hurt the people I hurt  
I was full of fear and loathing  
I wasn't up to much but I was all I had to go on  
Couldn't find nothing to believe in  
I don't like all them man made religions  
They all need a little spiritual healing  
They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture  
But we all need something to believe in  
So you believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now  
Gotta have something to believe in  
Well, I lay underneath a royal throne  
The gaudy paint was peeling  
Half an inch deep and twice as cheap  
Oh, give me something to believe in  
Fat Fred always packing lead  
On the corner dealing  
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days  
Give me something to believe in  
Now people worship what they see  
Looks can be deceiving  
Violence rages in abandoned hearts  
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in  
The chill chill is a bitter pill  
When it comes to leaving  
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here  
When you ain't got nothing to believe in  
Just woke up in Sarajevo city  
I watched all those mothers screaming  
Kids getting shot and for what and for what?  
Give me something to believe in  
Now there's fire outside, mud that slides  
Earthquakes shake the region  
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America  
They ain't got nothing to believe in  
For every seed of knowledge found  
For every grain of reason  
For every shred of decency  
There's something to believe in  
Now I lay me down to rest  
In the silence of the evening  
And the moon road shines from here to eternity  
I've got something to believe in  
You believe what you want to believe  
Just stay true to your feelings  
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another  
I've got something to believe in  

There's a place in the city they call the Archway  
Where we rented three rooms for a dollar a day  
and I worked semi-skilled at the capstans for years  
And my wife was a good woman but the love disappeared  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I found me a band, I went out on tour  
So the kids wouldn't know I was with them no more  
When they said, "Where's me dad?" She'd say, "He's a star!"  
Oh if only stars knew what fools they all are.  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage goes down they're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope they can cope with the damage I've done  
I got a new contract, I got a new life  
No more capstans for me and I've got a new wife  
Sometimes she gets angry, says she wants a family  
Then that nightmare returns like a ghost haunting me  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
When a marriage breaks up you're the loneliest ones  
Sons and Daughters, Daughters and Sons  
How I hope you all cope with the damage we done

Well I finally found you out  
All through your mess of dreams  
You won't make it to the night  
And your standing in my light  
You know you've been bad for me  
You ain't got the weight to hate  
But you ain't no pretty sight  
And your standing in my light  
  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light (yeah)  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Now when your old man beats the drums  
Gotta run run run that's dumb  
A little less ego A little more fight  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
Things go bad and the risks get high  
Sweeping dead bodies 'cross an open sky  
You took my pictures from your walls  
Ain't gonna trade with the pain of the New York Dolls  
  
Move over cause your standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause your standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause you standin' in my  
(Move over cause your standin' in my)  
Move over cause you standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
Yeah, alright  
Move over cause your standing in my light  
  
I wish you luck on your very last chance  
Cause I knew you blew it at the song and dance  
You froze my feelings, but that's alright  
And your standing in my light

(Ian Hunter)  
  
Way back in the 50's - you never said a wrong word  
People were clean - people were mean  
Children should be seen, but children should be not heard  
You learned to keep your mouth shut - you did what you were told  
But then one day the radio played the sound that we'd all been waiting for  
The whole of our lives 'n'  
  
I still love Rock 'n' Roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along, singin' the song  
It's the only way - I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up in the morning - put the kettle on the stove  
Tommy Steele croons a Guy Mitchell tune  
I never felt more like singin' the blues - but if I had to choose  
You know I still love rock 'n' roll  
I still love rock 'n' roll (let me hear ya)  
  
I never been to Lubbock, Texas or Memphis, Tennessee  
I never washed dishes in Macon, Georgia  
I wasn't half as good and I wasn't half as pretty as you  
But I still got the feelings - embedded in my soul  
A rebel armada - Kettering, Granada  
It ain't my fault that I never grew up - I got bitten by your bug  
And I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock  
  
I know what you're thinkin' - it's a little bit strange to you  
I know what you're thinkin' - cause I'm thinkin' the same way too  
But oh those two little four letter words - they're all you need to know  
Cause when it all comes down to it - I don't like the sound of it  
When you mess around with it - I'm still in it for the thrill of it  
I know you tried to kill it but  
  
I still love rock 'n' roll - I play it every day  
Hummin' along - singin' the songs  
It's the only way I know how to say what's on my mind  
  
I get up every morning - I put the coffee on the stove  
The computer's gone - the turntable's on  
I can't believe it's 2001 - God, I must be knockin' on  
But I still love rock 'n' roll, I still love rock 'n' roll,

They say that some people never grow up  
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love  
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams  
If life is real then so is my imagination  
All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?  
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?  
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back  
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain  
They say you can never go back  
What if my love's still the same?  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same  
When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on  
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong  
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on  
And on, and on it goes  
I can't pretend imaginary friends are better  
All I know is people change, people change, people change  
They say I'm supposed to forget and go on  
What if my love's still the same? Still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
Still the same, still the same, still the same  
(Oh, baby, now)  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  
What if your love, what if your love is still the same  

She dresses in leather  
She isn't too together  
She looks then she lowers her eyes at me  
  
She smokes cigarettes  
She likes to get wet  
And she's about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock 'n' roll  
She got the cutest figure  
I think it's gettin' bigger  
She's about, hangin' out, over me  
  
She feels just right  
In the middle of the night  
'N' she's about a woman as a woman can be I said  
  
That girl is rock 'n' roll

How ya doin', all right?  
I-I-I spy with my little eye  
Something beginning with you  
Drool, drool, drool, nearly fell off me stool  
I hope you fancy me too  
Now I don't wanna set the world on fire  
Any old iron, any old iron will do

Smarm, smarm, smarm, I turned up me charm  
I think I'm on a promise  
(He thinks he's on a promise)  
Some say yes and some say no  
And my old man says "Mind, how you go"  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
If you can't take a joke, well, sod ya  
(Oh)  
I'm a dysfunctional chap  
And they call me the Artful Dodger  
Chat, chat, chat, it's back to the flat  
I strum my little Spanish guitar  
Gloat, gloat, gloat, she said and I'll quote  
"You can take down my particulars"  
(Take down her particulars)  
It's a funny old life if you weaken, innit?  
You gonna have a laugh, yeah, you've gotta give it  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
Look out for PC Plodger  
If a job's worth doin', it's worth doin' well  
And they call me the Artful Dodger  
(Get on your bike)  
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
If you can't take a joke well, sod ya  
(Oh)

And I'm doin' all right  
Yes, I'm doin' all right

Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, you don't know your mind  
It says hi, you walk straight by  
Missing person, you can't take  
A look in your book 'cause it makes you shake  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, you don't ever change  
Same mistakes, again and again  
You're so shallow, you try to get  
Your feet in your mouth but they never get wet  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
I gave you love, I gave you love, I gave you love  
What's the matter, ain't that enough?  
I gave you love, I gave you love  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
You're so clever, you can see  
I've known all along you were hassling me  
Tell those faces on your head  
As far as I'm concerned, you're dead  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
I gave you love, I gave you love, I gave you love  
What's the matter, honey, ain't that enough?  
I gave you love, I gave you love  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor  
She just hears what she wants to fill  
She can't help it, the girl can't help it  
Destroys her brain, she's out of touch  
Just what do you do that's worth so much  
She had to run, know what I mean?  
You and your convenient dream  
Did she hurt, you bet she hurt  
She left me naked, she just lost her shirt  
Ain't no letter of revenge  
Every line has got to end  
You're just one woman I can't depend  
See you later, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
Traitor, traitor, traitor, traitor  
...  

Little flame tormented soul  
Tried to get lost in all that rock and roll  
Came crashing through here like some hurricane  
Too much, too soon for you little flame  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water, don't try  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Oh, but for the grace of God, go, I  
Little flame caught that savage sound  
He liked to turn it upside down  
Well, I think I know what you were talking about  
I'm just so sorry that your flame went out  
Fun with no conscience, tracks with no tears  
The rich get richer and the devil's got no fears  
Sounds his call, political lies  
There ain't no virtue without sacrifice  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on water  
You can't walk on  
You can't walk on  
You can't walk on  

It's such a small town rodeo  
Such famous people here, with nowhere to go  
Well it don't get to me, i think it's the pits  
I got no friends, i want to split.  
  
The daily papers seek a desperate face  
The television cameras join in the chase  
It's much fun interviewing urban decay  
I grab the microphone away  
  
(dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no!  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
  
Hey rock and roll feel the holes in my brain  
I promise you i'll never come here again  
It's all so sad, what a waste of a night  
Cause nothing's wrong, but nothing's right (hey)  
  
So don't get along, out of my way  
I'm not a robot, i've got something to say  
It's such a joke, are you ready to go  
Here comes that beat again, oh oh oh oh  
  
(dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no! (dance) no!  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of here  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
We gotta get out of, we gotta get out  
We gotta get out of here right now  
[repeat while ellen speaks]  
  
(oh please i don't want to go home yet  
Come on, can't you do anything i want to do?  
Lets dance, come on please, just once for me  
I never get to do anything like this  
You're such a drag, you know that?  
Everything for you, everything for you, nothing for me, right  
What are we gonna do? go home and watch the super bowl  
Re-runs of the mohammed ali uh marlene dietrich fight, what?  
There must be somebody here who wants to dance with me  
There must be a lot of people here who would like to dance with me, you know  
That?  
Come on, one, two, three, four - i'll jump right up and do the bump(?), come
on  
  
Listen this place gets really good, this place gets really.....  
I heard that the that the the spoon comes down and the moon comes down and  
The stars and all sorts of great stuff happens in a little while).

Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
  
Sweet woman what's your name?  
You smell as fresh as the rain  
Instead of leaving you came  
Let me feel your hair  
  
A light shines in your eyes  
The hungry years are so nice  
Shadows shake in the lamplight  
No writer could explain  
  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo, yeah!  
  
Please share my bed and I swear  
That I won't touch you nowhere  
Just need your warmth and your care  
Don't want to mess around  
  
And when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
But there's a song in the air  
And it knows that you're there  
'Cause it's making me share  
You with my life  
I know I know I know that  
I want to weave you in words  
Want to paint you in verse  
Want to leave you in someone else's dreams  
It seems the only way, Hey!  
I can thank you, thank you baby  
  
Some people say that we're sinners  
Some people say that we're winners  
We make good gossip at dinners  
They try to pin us down  
  
But when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
We'll be on my way  
[Repeat]
