Remember when you felt it first?  
The bitter taste of love  
The hand that reached inside your purse  
The fist inside the glove  
Remember how it felt to be  
The only one who cared  
You peeked behind the open door  
The bride is always bared  
  
You always knew this day would come  
You lie in bed alone  
The TV flickers silently  
A dream in every home (early mixes exist in which Gary sings 'A dream without
a home')  
  
Remember when you felt it first?  
When you played kiss and tell  
The moment that the arrow pierced  
The pearl inside the shell  
Remember how good it felt to be?  
To really come alive  
You peeked behind the open door  
The secrets of the hive

She's got friends in high places, her picture's in vogue  
She's seen at the races and walking the dog  
She swallows the camera, she follows the press  
She covers the angles, she's dressed for success  
  
She don't bring me water  
She don't give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude  
  
Her mood swings are violent, it can't be denied  
She kisses the bridegroom and disses the bride  
Godfather's baby who gets every wish  
She drinks with the family, she's taking the fifth  
  
She don't bring me water  
She don't give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude

She's fuddled my fancy, she's muddled me good  
I've taken to drinking, and given up food  
I'm buying an island, somewhere in the sun  
I'll hide from the natives, live only on rum  
  
I'm selling my memoirs, I'm writing it down  
If no one will pay me I'll burn down the town  
I'll rent out an aircraft and print on the sky  
If God likes my story then maybe he'll buy  
  
I'm buying a ticket for places unknown  
It's only a one-way: I'm not coming home  
She's swallowed my secret, and taken my name  
To follow my footsteps and knobble me lame

All hands on deck, we've run a float,  
I heard the Captain cry.  
Explore the ship, replace the cook,  
Let no one leave alive.  
Across the straits, around the horn,  
How far can sailors fly?  
A twisted path, our tortured course,  
And no one left alive.  
  
We sailed for parts unknown to man,  
Where ships come home to die.  
No lofty peak, nor fortress bold,  
Could match our captain's eye.  
Upon the seventh seasick day,  
We made our port of call.  
A sand so white, and sea so blue,  
No mortal place at all.  
  
We fired the guns, and burned the mast,  
And rowed from ship to shore.  
The captain cried, we sailors wept,  
Our tears were tears of joy!  
Now many moons and many Junes,  
Have passed since we made land.  
A Salty Dog, the seaman's log,  
Your witness, my own hand.

Bought a souvenir in London  
Got to hide it from my mom  
Can't declare it at the Customs  
But I'll have to take it home  
Tried to keep it confidential  
But the news is leaking out  
Got a souvenir in London  
There's a lot of it about  
  
Yes, I found a bit of London  
I'd like to lose it quick  
Got to show it to my doctor  
Cause it isn't going to shrink  
Want to keep it confidential  
But the truth is leaking out  
Got a souvenir in London  
There's a lot of it about

We skipped the light fandango  
Turned cartwheels cross the floor  
I was feeling kinda seasick  
But the crowd called out for more  
The room was humming harder  
As the ceiling flew away  
When we called out for another drink  
The waiter brought a tray  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said, there is no reason  
And the truth is plain to see.  
But I wandered through my playing cards  
And would not let her be  
One of sixteen vestal virgins  
Who were leaving for the coast  
And although my eyes were open  
They might have just as well've been closed  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said, I'm home on shore leave,  
Though in truth we were at sea  
So I took her by the looking glass  
And forced her to agree  
Saying, you must be the mermaid  
Who took Neptune for a ride.  
But she smiled at me so sadly  
That my anger straightway died  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
If music be the food of love  
Then laughter is its queen  
And likewise if behind is in front  
Then dirt in truth is clean  
My mouth by then like cardboard  
Seemed to slip straight through my head  
So we crash-dived straightway quickly  
And attacked the ocean bed  
  
[Chorus]  
And so it was that later  
As the miller told his tale  
That her face, at first just ghostly,  
Turned a whiter shade of pale

About to die, the crowds applaud you  
About to die, they'll resurrect you  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the savior's son  
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down  
  
About to die, the crowds reward you  
About to die, their cheers ignore you  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the chosen one  
No candle burned with fire enough to tear that city down  
  
About to die, the crowds applaud me  
About to die, they'll resurrect me  
Light a candle up in kingdom come  
Light the way for the savior's son  
A candle burning bright enough to tear the city down

Who will search for holy grail  
Past the edge beyond the veil  
Who will come beyond the light  
Far from reach beyond all sight  
  
Who will share this bitter cup  
Let the wild dogs tear them up  
Let the cold winds blow them down  
Drive them deep beneath the ground  
  
Who will live in darkest night  
Dankest gloom and quietest quiet  
Buried deep beneath the ground  
Far from any human sound  
  
Who will search for treasure trove  
Scour the seas and scale the globe  
Past the peaks beyond the heights  
Far most reaches furthest sights  
  
Who will share this bitter cup  
Let the wild dogs tear them up  
Let the cold winds blow them down  
Drive them deep beneath the ground

Some say they will and some say they won't  
Some say they do and some say they don't  
Some say they shall and some say they shan't  
And some say they can and some say they can't  
  
All in all it's all the same  
But call me if there's any change  
  
Some say there's nothing and some say there's lots  
Some say they've started while some say they've stopped  
Some say they're going and some say they've been  
Yes, some say they're looking and some say they've seen  
  
All in all it's all the same  
But call me if there's any change

They tell us that we're savages  
Who haven't got a hope  
We're burning in the furnaces,  
We're choking at the smoke  
They say we haven't got a choice,  
Refuse to recognize our voice  
Yet they enjoy commissions  
From the proceeds of the joke  
  
Those Butterfly Boys  
At play with their toys  
Stinging like bees  
Itching like fleas  
Butterfly Boys  
You got the toys  
You got the breeze  
We caught the freeze  
Butterfly Boys give us a break  
We got the groceries you got the cake  
  
They tell us that we're savages  
Who cannot understand  
We're sailing on a sinking ship,  
We're swimming in the sand  
They put their fingers in their ears,  
Refuse to recognize our fears  
And fly off to Jamaica  
When we call them underhand

Outside the gates of Cerdes sits the two-pronged unicorn  
Who plays at relaxation time a rhinestone flugelhorn  
Whilst mermaids lace carnations into wreaths for ailing whales  
And Neptune dances hornpipes while Salome sheds her veils  
  
Phallus Phil tries peddling his pewter painted pot  
But Sousa Sam can only hear the screams of Peep the sot  
Who only sips his creme de menthe from terra cotta cups  
And exhales menthol scented breath whilst spewing verbiage up  
  
Down technical blind alleys live the wraiths of former dreams  
And Greeps who often crossed them are no longer what they seem  
And even Christian Scientists can but display marble plaques  
Which only retell legends whilst my eyes reach out for facts  
  
Yeah, my eyes reach out for facts

Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company  
And like some angel's haloed brow  
You reek of purity  
I see your armor plated breast  
Has long since lost its sheen  
And in your death mask face  
There are no signs which can be seen  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador a vulture sits, upon your silver sheath  
And in your rusty scabbard now, the sand has taken seed  
And though your jewel-encrusted blade  
Has not been plundered still  
The sea has washed across your face  
And taken of its fill  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador there is no time, I must pay my respect  
And though I came to jeer at you  
I leave now with regret  
And as the gloom begins to fall  
I see there is no aureole  
Though you came with sword held high  
You did not conquer, only die  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind

I've been out of weeks for ages  
I've been on and off the train.  
I've been losing sheep  
And counting sleep  
And I've drunk too much again  
But I'll take another cup  
Even though it dry me up  
Ooh, though I know that I should pass  
I will take another glass  
  
The cellar is empty, the cupboard is bare,  
I'm joining the church and taking to prayer  
The landlord's complaining  
'Cause the rent is outstanding  
And Old Mother Hubbard's ran off with the chair  
Though I know it's time to stop  
I will take another drop  
Though I know I'm very sick  
I will take just one more sip  
  
Come on Captain, punch my ticket  
Call my mother's name  
I once heard  
That a fly can't bird  
But I drunk too much again  
Though I've really drunk a lot  
I will take another shot  
Though I know it's a time to pass  
I will take just one more glass

Ooh I need your love babe  
Guess you know it's true  
Hope you need my love babe  
Just like I need you  
Hold me love me  
Hold me love me  
I ain't got nothing but love babe  
Eight days a week  
  
Love you every day girl  
Always on my mind  
One thing I can say girl  
Love you all the time  
Hold me love me  
Hold me love me  
I ain't got nothing but love babe  
Eight days a week  
  
Eight days a week I love you  
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care

This war we are waging is already lost  
The cause for the fighting has long been a ghost  
Malice and habit have now won the day  
The honours we fought for are lost in the fray  
  
Standards and bugles are trod in the dust  
Wounds have burst open, and corridors rust  
Once proud and truthful, now humbled and bent  
Fires which burnt brightly, now energies spent  
  
Let down the curtain, and exit the play  
The crowds have gone home and the cast sailed away  
Our flowers and feathers as scarring as weapons  
Our poems and letters have turned to deceptions

He fell from grace and hit the ground  
They tried in vain to bring him round  
No one saw him make the fall  
They couldn't understand at all  
  
His fall from grace was swift and straight  
The doctors didn't hesitate  
What he had they were not sure  
He didn't have a temperature  
  
His fall from grace was swift and sure  
The doctors said they knew no cure.  
They felt and poked and pushed his pulse  
He couldn't understand at all  
  
He fell from grace and hit the ground  
He fell into the sea and drowned  
They saw him struggling from the harbor  
They saw him wave as he went under

In praise of fruit I wrote this song  
Because of fruit my heart is strong  
Who could estimate its worth?  
Fruit's the finest food on earth  
  
Fresh fruit, juice and seeds  
Please don't touch, please don't squeeze  
Fresh fruit, juice and pulp  
Like to gulp the whole lot up  
  
Here's another point of view  
Fruit is good for doggies too  
Rover wags his tail with glee  
When he gets his vitamin C  
  
Have you caught a touch of flu  
And you can't think what to do  
Famous doctors all agree  
fruit's the safest remedy  
  
Fresh fruit Good and sweet  
Makes you want to give up meat  
Fresh fruit, ripe and firm  
Makes them squealing taste-buds squirm.

Your multilingual business friend  
Has packed her bags and fled  
Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays  
And the lipsticked unmade bed  
The mirror on reflection  
Has climbed back upon the wall  
For the floor she found descended  
And the ceiling was too tall  
  
Your trouser cuffs are dirty  
And your shoes are laced up wrong  
You'd better take off your homburg  
'Cause your overcoat is too long  
  
The town clock in the market square  
Stands waiting for the hour  
When its hands they both turn backwards  
And on meeting will devour  
Both themselves and also any fool  
Who dares to tell the time  
And the sun and moon will shatter  
And the signposts cease to sign

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more  
I keep forgetting that you told me that you  
Didn't want me around anymore  
But these stupid old feet  
Just head for your street  
Like they've done so many times before  
And this stubborn old fist  
At the end of my wrist  
Keeps knocking on your front door  
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more  
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more  
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights  
Ant those heartbreaking things that you said  
Though it's plain as can be  
You're finished with me  
I can't believe our love is dead  
Though I know in my heart  
We've drifted apart  
I just can't get it through my head  

In the autumn of my madness when my hair is turning grey  
For the milk has finally curdled and I've nothing left to say  
When all my thoughts are spoken (save my last departing birds)  
Bring all my friends unto me and I'll strangle them with words  
In the autumn of my madness which in coming won't be long  
For the nights are now much darker and the daylight's not so strong  
And the things which I believed in are no longer quite enough  
For the knowing is much harder and the going's getting rough  
  

Tell you how the story stands  
I'm a victim in your hands  
Got me pleading on my bended knees  
That's the way the picture reads  
It's a horror show  
It's a body blow  
And it's gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Well give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Into the flood  
  
Now you've made a big mistake  
Spoiled the icing on the wedding cake  
Killed the goose that laid the golden egg  
This time babe you're going to have to beg  
It's a crying shame  
It's a dying flame  
And it's gone too far  
  
Tell me a reason  
Give me a sign  
Somebody somewhere  
Throw me a line  
Somebody down there  
Looking for blood  
Off with the horses  
Yeah, into the flood  
  
So you pulled the perfect crime  
Turned the water into wine  
  
Got me on my bended knees  
Now's the time to make me squeeze  
  
Came in from the freezing cold  
Turned the glitter into gold (from the barbican)  
  
It's a bloody mess  
It's a body-blow  
And it's gone too far

I opened my eyes this morning and I wasn't at home in bed  
There was four angels standing round me, I thought "I must be dead"  
Well, I opened my eyes this morning, thought "I must be dead"  
Four angels standing round me, and the room was painted red  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah  
  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
Four angels standing round me an it wasn't no social call  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
I got down on my knees praying Lord, but it didn't do no good at all  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah

Jostle, hassle, elbow bustle  
In a swirling rainbow tussle  
Caught and frozen, broken sheen  
Now unites for one brief scene  
  
Lonely in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope  
  
Confused faces change their places  
Take up stances, exchange glances  
Lost in multicolored hues  
There is no whole which I can choose  
  
Lonely in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope  
  
In one face, one moment's fusion  
Realize the new illusion  
Clutching fingers break the puzzle  
Jostle, hassle, elbow bustle  
  
Still out in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope

You and me got a chance to make things right  
The writing... The writing's on the wall  
You and me got a chance to turn things 'round  
We got no time... The future's slipping  
Through our hands  
  
Learn to fly  
Where eagles only dare to try  
We're on the wing  
We dare to win  
We see the future and we're gonna make it  
Learn to live  
You know you got so much to give  
It's in the air  
It's everywhere  
We got a vision and we're gonna claim it  
  
You and me we can't turn back at all  
The die is cast... (You know) the deal is done  
You and me we knew this day would come  
And now it's here... the journey's just begun  
  
Learn to fly  
Where eagles only dare to try  
We're on the wing  
We dare to win  
We see the future and we're gonna make it  
Learn to live  
You know you got so much to give  
It's in the air  
It's everywhere  
We got a vision and we're gonna claim it

Weird goings-on at the county jail  
Prisoners reading the sheriff's mail  
He's strapped down to a swivel chair  
Trying to swivel right out of there  
Pin-striped sweet's in cell 15  
Convinced his self it's all a dream  
He's got a pet black tabby cat  
That carries a gun and wears a stetson hat  
The door flies open, in strides geek  
Looking like the front page of newsweek  
He says to lou in a voice of glee,  
'what's the matter, ain't you glad to see me? '  
Lou's on the floor 'cause he can't stand up  
As green as a leaf in a tea-cup  
When on to geek's back jumps a stetson-hatted cat  
Which breaks geek's neck like he was a rat  
Long gone geek!  

Tulips lips oh Luskus Delph  
Your baking breath breeds body 'x'  
With silken measures try to gauge  
The inside sweetness of your cave  
  
Peach preserve your simmering jewel  
Hid away like orphans' gruel  
Help me find the widow's crack  
Make me stick like sealing wax  
  
Almonds eyes my Turkish pearl  
Burn me up sweet oyster girl  
Shove me in your steaming vat  
Make me split like chicken fat

The bell on my door rang this morning  
From the kitchen I called who's that there  
Through the letter box came a grappling hook  
Which grappled me right out of my chair  
Stretched out on the floor I lay helpless  
Of my limbs I had lost all command  
When into my ear in stilling fear  
Said a voice "I am Monsieur R. Monde"  
Monsieur are. Monde you are not  
That's an incredible thing to say  
Why I personally attended his funeral  
Which was twelve months to this very day  
A rat flew down from the ceiling  
Alighted upon my right ear  
Said if Monsieur are. Monde is safe under the sod  
Then why are you shaking with fear  
My name is not Scrooge I said faintly  
And from ghosts I have nothing to fear  
But if you are are. Monde returned from the dead  
Then what are you wanting here  
From nowhere I heard a mad cackle  
From nowhere a voice to me cried  
"Stop calling me Monsieur are. Monde, you fool  
My name's Jeckyll and you're Mr. Hyde

It seems as clear as yesterday  
We saw it in a dream  
But dream became insanity  
An awful gaping scream  
  
So sad to see such emptiness  
So sad to see such tears  
And heaped up leaves of bitterness  
Turned mouldy down the years  
  
Nothing but the truth  
Common words in use  
Hard to find excuse  
Harder than the truth  
  
Like Icarus we flew too high  
We flew too near the sun  
They caught us in that awful glare  
Our hapless throats were strung  
But just before the final stroke  
They took us victims of the rope  
And cast us far beyond the deep  
To lie in never ending sleep  
  
It seems as clear as yesterday  
They cast us in the deep  
We lie in darkest night for good  
Never ending sleep  
  
A never ending bitter gloom  
Whose darkness seldom clears  
A God forsaken emptiness  
Which fills our hearts with tears

Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
I couldn't believe it, but it's true  
Twenty-six, and now she's dead  
I wish that I could have died instead  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
Did you see how thin and pale she grew?  
So much suffering, could not hide  
Endless heartache 'til she died  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
Strike me dead, for making it true  
Strike me dead, for letting it go  
Nothing that I didn't know  
  
Did you hear what happened to Jenny Drew?  
I couldn't believe it, but it's true  
Twenty-six, and now she's dead  
I wish that I could have died instead

We'll raise our toast to pleasures past  
They came so quick and went so fast  
Idle boasts, crazy ghosts  
We'll make our toast and drain the glass  
We're know we're out of favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
Well time may heal, and absence mend  
We'll raise our glass to absent friends  
[ere] they dwell we wish them well  
To those we wronged we'll make amends  
We're know we're out of favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we keep one eye on the past  
  
It's time to change and start anew  
To leave our home for pastures new  
Where we go, ah, we won't know  
It's something that we got to do  
We're don't expect no favour  
We can't expect no saviour  
We're looking to the future but we'll keep one eye on the past

Good to get your message  
So you're coming back home again  
Just can't wait to see you  
No need to explain  
A friend of mine told me  
That you've found yourself a new man  
I'm feelin' really good for you  
Hope you understand  
I've still got your picture  
I'm sure you know  
We had something special  
Where did it go?  
  
One more time  
Let's remember how good it felt  
One more time  
Remember what we meant  
One more time  
Can't help wondering where it went  
One more time  
Just one more time  
  
I wonder if you finished  
Workin' on that book  
Maybe I could come 'round sometime  
'n take a look  
A friend of mine told me  
That you've changed your hair  
They say you're really different now  
I remember how you were  
I've still got your picture  
I'm sure you know  
We had something special  
Where did it go?  
  
One more time  
Let's remember how good it felt  
One more time  
Remember what we meant  
One more time  
Can't help wondering where it went  
One more time  
Just one more time

While horsemen ride across the green  
And Snow White still remains unseen.  
Pegasus, the winged horse,  
Relays his messages by Morse.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.  
  
While Handel plays his melody  
Doctors cause uncertainty  
And though I know the lifeguard's brave  
There is no one for him to save.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.  
  
Cock Robin views his frozen feet  
And wraps them in a winding sheet  
And calls out for his favourite drink  
The Persian that's as warm as mink.  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain.

Rings around the crescent moon  
Passions rise from basement rooms  
Fountains play and worlds collide  
We gently swing and sway from side to side  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
Star-crossed lovers they spoon and swim  
The laughing gods they just reel them in  
Hostages they're tempting fate  
See them wait down on the line to take the bait  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
The simple stuff we build our dreams upon  
Waxing, waning, now it's almost gone  
Passion plays the sweetest tune  
These velvet days are gone far too soon  
  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore  
  
We spend our nights on silken sheets  
We play for gold but not for keeps  
Dancers in perpetual motion  
Slip an' sliding across the floor  
Ships our on a moonlit ocean  
Sailin' t'ward a distant shore

Wash yourself and see your sorrow, make every pitcher clean  
Take a mop to swab the floor and destroy the evil dream  
Counting houses full of lead, the evil eye on high  
The streets awash with blood and pus, the new moon's in the sky  
God's aloft, the winds are raging  
God's aloft, the winds are cold  
  
After leaving I was weeping, count it out in tolls  
Watch the book, the page is turning, how the tale unfolds  
Inside every cancered specter  
Inside-outside find your own  
God's aloft, the winds are raging, God's aloft, the winds are cold

I sat me down to write a simple story  
Which maybe in the end became a song  
In trying to find the words which might begin it  
I found these were the thoughts I brought along  
  
At first I took my weight to be an anchor  
And gathered up my fears to guide me round  
But then I clearly saw my own delusion  
And found my struggles further bogged me down  
  
In starting out I thought to go exploring  
And set my foot upon the nearest road  
In vain I looked to find the promised turning  
But only saw how far I was from home  
  
In searching I forsook the paths of learning  
And sought instead to find some pirate's gold  
In fighting I did hurt those dearest to me  
And still no hidden truths could I unfold  
  
I sat me down to write a simple story  
Which maybe in the end became a song  
The words have all been writ by one before me  
We're taking turns in trying to pass them on  
Oh, we're taking turns in trying to pass them on

Sceptic at the feast in ashes  
Huntsman at the voyeurs ball  
Funeral Parlour-Guests invited  
Mourning poorly worn by all  
Old and mouldy words of passion  
Savage Rose destroyed them all  
Wrote her fate in Neon captions  
Slender sender made me crawl  
Playmate of the mouth expected  
Passionata bless the small  
Baby sandwich soaped for comfort  
Slipp'ry Sliding Ten Feet Tall  
(Gary Brooker-Keith Reid)  
  

She wandered through the garden fence  
And said, 'I've brought at great expense  
A potion guaranteed to bring  
Relief from all your suffering'  
And though I said, 'You don't exist'  
She grasped me firmly by the wrist  
And threw me down upon my back  
And strapped me to her torture rack  
  
And, without further argument  
I found my mind was also bent  
Upon a course so devious  
It only made my torment worse  
  
She said, 'I see you cannot speak  
Is it your voice that is too weak?  
Is it your tongue that is to blame?  
Maybe you cannot speak for shame  
Or has your brain been idle too  
And now it will not think for you?'  
I hastened to make my reply  
But found that I could only lie  
  
And like a fool I believed myself  
And thought I was somebody else  
But she could see what I was then  
And left me on my own again

While standing at the junction on 42nd Street  
I idly kick a pebble lying near my feet  
I hear a weird noise, take a look up and down  
The cause of the commotion is right there on the ground  
Imagine my surprise, thought I'd left it at home  
But there's no doubt about it, it's my own tombstone  
  
I went into a shop, and bought a loaf of bread  
I sank my teeth into it, thought I'd bust my head  
I dashed to the dentist, said, 'I've got an awful pain!'  
The man looks in my mouth and screams, 'This boy is insane!'  
Imagine my surprise, thought I'd left it at home  
But there's a lump in my mouth of my own tombstone  
  
I went to see a movie, got the only empty seat  
I tried to stretch out in it, something blocking my feet  
Finally the lights came up, and I could clearly see  
A slab of engraved marble, just staring up at me  
Imagine my surprise, thought I'd left it at home  
But there's no doubt I'm sitting on my own tombstone

In the centre of the storm  
Something magic being born  
When the world is torn apart  
By the beating of a heart  
Like a dam about to burst  
Like a drunkard's crazy thirst  
In the centre of the storm  
Something magic being born  
It's the dark hours of the soul  
When the nightmares take their toll  
When the shadows come to mock  
Against the ticking of the clock  
When the demons of the night  
Come like vultures for their bite  
In the dark hours of the soul  
When the nightmares take their toll  
It's the dawning of the day  
Night-time's panic swept away  
When the clouds which seemed so dark  
Are exchanged for morning's lark  
When the stars which burnt so bright  
Are exchanged for morning light  
In the dawning of the day  
Nightime's panic swept away  

I'll bathe my eyes in a river of salt  
I'll grow myself right up to the sky  
I'll sing in the forest, tear down the trees  
I'll foul all the fountains and trample the leaves  
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door  
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more  
  
I'll put a blight in the orchard  
I'll run wild through the fields  
I'll waylay your daughter and kidnap your wife  
Savage her sexless and burn out her eyes  
I'll blacken your Christmas and piss on your door  
You'll cry out for mercy, but still there'll be more

I was standing on the mountain top staring at the sun  
I was trying to act the hero's part not fooling anyone  
I was living for the moment but the moment never came  
Taking notes and stealing quotes, trying to make a name  
My time's been taken with taking my time  
By making my mind up to make up my mind  
I was living in the country: I was trying not to freeze  
I was working on the cabbage plants, chopping down the trees  
I was learning how to cook the goose and how to milk the cow  
Taking out the dog for walks, teaching him how to bow  
My time's been taken with taking my time  
I'm making my mind up to make up my mind  

The Devil came from Kansas. Where he went to I can't say  
Though I teach I'm not a preacher, and I aim to stay that way  
There's a monkey riding on my back, been there for some time  
He says he knows me very well but he's no friend of mine  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
There's no need to scrape and squeeze  
And don't beg for silver paper  
When I'm trying to sell you cheese  
  
The Devil came from Kansas. Where he went to I can't say  
If you really are my brother then you'd better start to pray  
For the sins of those departed and the ones about to go  
There's a dark cloud just above us, don't tell me 'cause I know  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
There's no need to scrape and squeeze  
And don't beg for silver paper  
When I'm trying to sell you cheese  
  
No I never came from Kansas, don't forget to thank the cook  
Which reminds me of my duty: I was lost and now I look  
For the turning and the signpost and the road which takes you down  
To that pool inside the forest in whose waters I shall drown  
  
I am not a humble pilgrim  
There's no need to scrape and squeeze  
And don't beg for silver paper  
When I'm trying to sell you cheese

It's the final throw  
The final blow  
Break or bust  
We must make our thrust  
Lose or win  
We can't give in  
Right or wrong  
We must go on  
There's no time for doubt  
We must fight it out  
Lose or win  
We can't give in  
Gain or blow  
We must take our throw  
Place or show  
We can't let go, we won't let go.  
It's the final throw  
The final blow  
Faith or doubt  
We must cast them out.  
Lose or win,  
We can't give in  
Break or bust  
It's the final thrust  
There's no time for doubt  
We must fight it out  
Lose or win  
We can't give in  
Gain or blow  
We must take our throw  
Place or show  
We can't let go, we won't let go.  

(G. Brooker K. Reid C. Thompson)  
When you're out in the dark  
Nothing to believe in  
And you can't find a way back home  
There's a man with a secret  
There's a visionary sister  
Who knows what's right or wrong?  
Little by little I turn to the light  
And one day I'll be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one  
When the wind blows cold  
And you lose your resistance  
Slipping down on the darkest side  
You can push too hard  
You can run too fast  
Don't get lost in the looking glass  
Little by little the wheel turns around  
And one day I'll be satisfied  
Like the hand that rocks the cradle  
I gotta be gentle and strong  
The hand that rocks the cradle  
Gonna be the lucky one

Oh the idol, Oh the idol  
  
They knew the monster's every trick  
They knew his secrets every stitch  
All of it had been a game  
Nothing but a charlatan  
Perhaps there was a chance of coming through  
It even seemed that he might think it too  
But he could see no point in diving in  
He knew that he would neither sink nor swim  
  
And so they found he'd nothing left to say  
Just another idol turned to clay  
  
It seemed to them he must know what to do  
They knew that only he could pull them through  
They thought that he would make a plan  
He'd work it out, he'd understand  
Like drowning men they clutched at every straw  
They knew that he had saved them all before  
But he could see no point in diving in  
He knew that he would neither sink nor swim

There was trouble in the air  
Just a subtle hint of danger  
And a woman dressed in black  
Out lookin' for a stranger  
Well she took me to her room  
Where she offered me a wager  
She promised me the moon  
So I took a chance  
  
Yes I played the King of Hearts  
Put my cards out on the table  
I thought the odds were in my favor  
But she laid the Ace of Spades  
An' I wound up where I started  
The King of Hearts no more  
But the King of the Broken-hearted  
  
She cut the deck one more  
By the light of thirteen candles  
She said,

A question of judgment decided in haste  
A case of malfunction an error of taste  
A moment of madness occasioned by stress  
A classic misjudgment a God-awful mess  
  
The moment of panic preceding the crash  
The sickening terror the defeating smash  
A loud wail of sirens descend on the scene  
The camera dissolves a crescendo of screams  
  
The memory's imprinted like some dreadful sore  
The fearful reminder: the mark of the claw  
  
A question of judgment concerned in the case  
The method of access regarding the place  
The possible motive the absence of blood  
The theories unanswered regarding the thud  
  
The outcome was certain the jury was hung  
Their verdict resolved by ruling of thumb  
The judgment was mercy: they tendered the plea  
The judge raised his hand and the prisoner was free

When you knew that I had given all the kindness that I had  
Did you think that it might be time to stop?  
When you knew that I was through  
That I'd done all I could do  
Did you really have to milk the final drop?  
Not content with my mistake  
You behaved just like a snake  
And you left me for a wasp without a sting  
Tell all my friends back home  
That I did it on my own  
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling  
  
When you knew that I had given all the kindness that I had  
Did you feel you had to break that lonely vow?  
When you knew that I was through  
That I'd done all I could do  
Did you really have to sow that final plough?  
Not content with my mistake, you behaved just like a snake  
And you left me for a wasp without a sting  
Tell all the folks back home that he did it on his own  
And that to their well-worn cares they should cling

One into one won't go  
Two out of three don't know  
Time and tide in man's affairs  
Trouble always comes in pairs  
Wonder where the picture went?  
What we got ain't worth a cent  
What we got ain't worth a damn  
Someone's screwed the master plan  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
It's a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what we're told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again  
  
Bite the bullet in the dust  
Got to take their word on thrust  
No use counting down your prayers  
All God's children running scared  
No use howling at the moon  
Planet Earth is going soon  
Starving children stand on line  
Living now on borrowed time  
  
The pursuit of happiness  
It's a common goal  
The pursuit of happiness  
Doing what we're told  
The pursuit of happiness  
To the very end  
It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again

We were young, we were brave, we were true, we were strong  
Far away the bombs an' the buildings explodin'  
there was no way out  
It was black, it was white, we had so much to say  
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade away  
  
We had our hopes, we had our dreams, we were young, we were old  
We saw our future self-destructing: there were roles that we played  
Some were good, some were bad: there was so much to say  
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade away

They seek us in this unquiet zone  
They chase us on from hole to hole  
They hunt us down like carrion crows  
They search us out like frightened moles  
This surely is a dreadful war  
An awful waste of guts and gore  
An awful waste of human life  
This senseless, bloody, bitter strife  
We huddled close against the ground  
Scared to make the slightest sound  
And all around the great guns boom  
The constant march of pending doom  

Into a great tree a small worm did go  
It wormed its way inwards and soon it did grow  
The tree was unhappy but what could it do?  
It stood there in silence: the worm grew and grew  
The tree was unhappy but what could it say  
The worm kept on growing the tree sank away  
The worm was so greedy it ate more each day  
And each day it ate more the tree shrank away  
The worm was so loathsome it felt no disgrace  
The birds had been silenced the sun shunned that place  
And all of the forest grew fearful to see  
What terrible fate lay in store for the tree  
The worm grew so monstrous its greed knew no bounds  
The smell was so awful if poisoned the ground  
And all of the creatures that lived in the wood  
Were sickened and starving the worm spoiled their food  
The birds would not sing and the sun could not shine  
The forest lay dirty and blackened with grime  
Now down in the forest a young man went riding  
He passed by the great tree and saw it was dying  
The leaves and the bark were all rotten and rife  
The tree had been poisoned and drained for its life  
He stripped of a piece of the bark of the tree  
And straight'way he know what the right cure should be  
The man built a fire and chopped down the tree  
The worm started screaming it could not break free  
It trashed and it lashed but it could net break loose  
Trapped in that tree like a thief in a noose  
The worm burst asunder a vile smelling crust  
He hacked it to pieces and burnt it to dust  
The forest seemed clearer and peacful at last  
Like after a storm when the rainclouds have passed  
And although the great tree was fallen and dead  
They knew from the ashes a new life would spread  
Yes although the great tree had fallen and died  
They knew from the ashes a new one would thrive  
Now years may have passed since the tale I have told  
Yet the truth of this story does still seem to hold  
Although from a great tree a small worm may grow  
That eats it with poison and tortures its soul  
The worm can be killed yet the tree be not dead  
For from the roots of the elder a new life will spread

We'll hoist a hand, becalmed upon a troubled sea  
'Make haste to your funeral, ' cries the Valkyrie  
We'll hoist a hand or drown amidst this stormy sea  
'Here lies a coffin, ' cries the cemetery, it calls to me  
And all for nothing quite in vain was hope forever tossed  
No thoughts explained, no moments gained, no hope forever lost  
One moment's space, one moment's final fall from grace  
Burnt by fire, blind in sight, lost in ire  
  
We'll hoist a hand, becalmed upon a troubled sea  
I fear a mighty wave is threatening me  
We'll hoist a hand, or drown amidst this stormy sea  
'Come follow after, ' cry the humble, 'You will surely see...'  
But still for nothing quite in vain was hope forever tossed  
No moments gained, no thoughts explained, no hope forever lost  
One moment's space, one moment's final fall from grace  
Burnt by fire, blind in sight, lost in ire

Drank a little too much wine last night  
Drank a little too much wine last night  
Got myself into one hell of a fight  
Drank a little too much wine last night  
  
Had a few too many nights without sleep last week  
Had a few too many nights without sleep last week  
Got myself on the edge of one hell of a losing streak  
Had a few too many nights without sleep last week  
  
Got to be a bit more straight these days  
Got to be a bit more straight these days  
This old dog has to learn some new ways  
Got to be a bit more straight these days

There's you, you're sleeping over there  
Whilst me I'm sitting here  
With so much sea between us  
I can't make it much more clear  
There'll be no time for crying  
We won't make it more than six  
I could change my plea to guilty  
But I don't think it would stick  
Still those other ratings far too easy to despise  
You've said so much in silence now I truly am disguised  
  
Let him who fears his heart alone  
Stand up and make a speech  
For him perhaps an emperor's throne  
If he could only speak  
Far too few and far to follow  
For shame I'll heed the cry  
Be with me when I need a drink  
Be with me when I die  
Still those other ratings far too easy to despise  
You've said so much in silence now indeed I am disguised

She took all the pleasure and none of the pain  
All of the credit and none of the blame  
I came home to an empty flat  
She'd left me a note and taken the cat  
  
The cord that they knotted to keep us apart  
Could never be broken: it was tied to my heart  
She grew thin and I grew fat  
She left me and that was that  
  
I'm thinking of renting a villa in France  
A French girl has offered to give me a chance  
Or maybe I'll take an excursion to Spain  
And buy a revolver and blow out my brains

'Twas tea-time at the circus: King Jimi, he was there  
Through hoops he skipped, high wires he tripped, and all the while the glare  
Of the aching, baking spotlight beat down upon his cloak  
And though the crowd clapped furiously they could not see the joke  
  
'Twas tea-time at the circus, though some might not agree  
As jugglers danced, and horses pranced and clowns clowned endlessly  
But trunk to tail the elephants quite silent, never spoke  
And though the crowd clapped desperately they could not see the joke

Typewriter torment, dreadful disease  
Caught it the first day I touched the keys  
You wear down your fingers and churn out your pap  
It eats up your life like a dose of the clap  
Typewriter torment it tortures me still  
If only my doctor could see that I'm ill  
Typewriter fever it harries me still  
If only my doctor would give me a pill  
Typewriter fever gives birth to a flood  
It sweeps through your body and curdles your blood  
You curse and discurse but you're damned for all time  
The moment your fingers give birth to a rhyme  
Typewriter fever it harries me still  
If only my doctor would give me a pill  
Typewriter fever I'm worn to a stub  
I've dumped my thesaurus and pulled out the plug  
I'm rending my ribbon and bending my spool  
Don't bother rewinding: I'm done with it all  
But why can't my doctor just say that I'm ill?  
Typewriter fever is paying his bill.  

Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
Ain't gonna burn up no more flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
To think that i could be so wrong  
To be so sick and still go on  
The way i drink it's been too long  
Don't see much point in carrying on  
I'm gonna lose these drinking blues  
  
I'm gonna find a girl to make me choose  
Between lovin' her and drinking booze  
I'm gonna lose these drinking blues  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
I'm tired of burning in the flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train

I'm going downstairs to be a poet  
Got a great idea: gonna write a sonnet  
A verse or two of fearless prose  
A priceless quip to gild the rose  
I'll make my fortune overnight  
My work will set the world alight  
Just a line is all I need  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a word to start me out.  
The rest will come without a doubt  
I'm going downstairs to write a book  
Got a great idea's gonna really cook  
A rattling good yarn with an ironic twist  
A riveting ending that's not to be missed  
Makesure the presses are ready to steam  
This book is a scorcher, a publisher's dream  
Just the first part's all I need  
The rest will come with lightning speed  
Just a line to set the stage.  
My pen will dance across the page  
I'm going downstairs to write a play  
Got a great idea gonna make it pay  
This serious drama won't be understood  
The critics will love it and say that it's good  
"at last a new writer, a true nouvelle vague"  
In no time at all I'll be king of the stage  
Just a story's all I need.  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a line to start me out .  
The rest will come without a doubt
