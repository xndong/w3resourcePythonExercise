Iii. Discovery  
Words by Neil Peart, Music by Alex Lifeson  
  
... "Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was  
Hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the  
Dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in  
My hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was  
Beautiful"...  
... "I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn  
The keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the  
Wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious  
Sounds, and soon my own music! How different it could  
Be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the  
Priests about it! ... "  
  
What can this strange device be?  
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound  
It's got wires that vibrate and give music  
What can this thing be that I found?  
  
See how it sings like a sad heart  
And joyously screams out its pain  
Sounds that build high like a mountain  
Or notes that fall gently like rain  
  
I can't wait to share this new wonder  
The people will all see its light  
Let them all make their own music  
The Priests praise my name on this night

When they turn the pages of history  
When these days have passed long ago  
Will they read of us with sadness  
For the seeds that we let grow  
We turned our gaze  
From the castles in the distance  
Eyes cast down  
On the path of least resistance  
  
Cities full of hatred  
Fear and lies  
Withered hearts  
And cruel, tormented eyes  
Scheming demons  
Dressed in kingly guise  
Beating down the multitude  
And scoffing at the wise  
  
The hypocrites are slandering  
The sacred halls of truth  
Ancient nobles showering  
Their bitterness on youth  
Can't we find  
The minds that made us strong  
Can't we learn  
To feel what's right and wrong  
  
Cities full of hatred  
Fear and lies  
Withered hearts  
And cruel, tormented eyes  
Scheming demons  
Dressed in kingly guise  
Beating down the multitude  
And scoffing at the wise  
Can't we raise our eyes  
And make a start  
Can't we find the minds  
To lead us closer to the heart

Weapons of mass distraction are used by politicians and conspiracy theorists  
Within their reach  
The entire solar system withstanding geographical combat  
Annihilation is one source of political free speech  
In a world of nuclear devastation, doom and deteonation  
In a world of curiosity beyond the imagination  
Every man and woman decides to hide the conspiracy behind global armageddon  
When the entire planet prepares for destruction  
Connecting their minds with others through telepathy  
In the common sense of human curiosity  
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
People use their super-human powers to discover the dark and dangerous world  
Of hypothetical secrets  
In most cases, sometimes he or she confess why they regret  
In my opinion, gubernatorial fear is far from over  
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest self-destructive endeavor  
More and more human beings make connections  
And it's part of an all-out worldwide chain reaction  
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before it's too late  
One year from now, the entire world's about to detonate  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
  
All nations will self-destruct, according to research scientists  
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist  
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire  
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire  
Stare at the anti-terrorsts standing higher  
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand  
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand  
Find one or more anti-terrorism activist fighting for freedom  
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here, there and everywhere

Know your place in life is where you want to be  
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me  
Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round  
Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down  
  
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind  
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind  
We marvel after those who sought  
New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,  
Wonders in the world they wrought  
  
Live for yourself, there's no one else  
More worth living for  
Begging hands and bleeding hearts will  
Only cry out for more  
  
Well, I know they've always told you  
Selfishness was wrong  
Yet it was for me, not you, I  
Came to write this song

The snakes and arrows a child is heir to  
Are enough to leave a thousand cuts  
We build our defenses, a place of safety  
And leave the darker places unexplored  
  
Sometimes the fortress is too strong  
Or the love is too weak  
What should have been our armor  
Becomes a sharp and angry sword  
  
Our better natures seek elevation  
A refuge for the coming night  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
No one  
  
We hold beliefs as a consolation  
A way to take us out of ourselves  
Meditation or medication  
A comfort or a promised reward  
  
Sometimes the spirit is too strong  
Or the flesh is too weak  
Sometimes the need is just too great  
For the solace we seek  
The suit of shining armor  
Becomes a keen and bloody sword  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
  
A refuge for the coming night  
A future of eternal light  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
No one  
  
Confused alarms of struggle and flight  
Blood is drained of color  
By the flashes of artillery light  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
The battle flags are flown  
At the feet of a god unknown  
No one gets to their heaven...  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
  
Sometimes the damage is too great  
Or the will is too weak  
What should have been our armor  
Becomes a sharp and burning sword  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
Oh, a refuge for the coming night  
A future of eternal light  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight  
No one  
  
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

I've got a livin' that's rough, a future that's tough  
You know what I mean  
Blankers and boasters, all the bluffers and posers  
I'm not into that scene  
  
You can tell me that I got no class  
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last  
Don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll  
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll  
  
Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk  
I'm funny that way  
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far  
But I'll try anyway  
I just like to please, don't like to tease  
I'm easy like that  
Don't like long rests, I must confess  
I'm an impatient cat  
  
I do the best that I can  
I'm just what I am  
I do the best I can  
Well, I know what I am  
  
Rock and rollin's a scream, makin' millions my dream  
Well, I do that a lot  
I'll just give it a try, won't let good times pass me by  
They're all I've got

To live between a rock and a hard place  
In between time  
Cruising in prime time  
Soaking up the cathode rays  
  
To live between the wars in our time  
Living in real time  
Holding the good time  
Holding on to yesterdays  
  
[Chorus:]  
You know how that rabbit feels  
Going under your speeding wheels  
Bright images flashing by  
Like windshields towards a fly  
Frozen in the fatal climb  
But the wheels of time  
Just pass you by  
Wheels can take you around  
Wheels can cut you down  
  
We can go from boom to bust  
From dreams to a bowl of dust  
We can fall from rockets' red glare  
Down to "Brother can you spare..."  
Another war  
Another wasteland  
And another lost generation  
  
It slips between your hands like water  
This living in real time  
A dizzying lifetime  
Reeling by on celluloid  
  
Struck between the eyes  
By the big-time world  
Walking uneasy streets  
Hiding beneath the sheets  
Got to try and fill the void  
  
[Chorus]

If we burn our wings  
Flying too close to the sun  
If the moment of glory  
Is over before it's begun  
If the dream is won  
Though everything is lost  
We will pay the price,  
But we will not count the cost  
  
When the dust has cleared  
And victory denied  
A summit too lofty  
River a little too wide  
If we keep our pride  
Though paradise is lost  
We will pay the price,  
But we will not count the cost  
  
And if the music stops  
There's only the sound of the rain  
All the hope and glory  
All the sacrifice in vain  
And if love remains  
Though everything is lost  
We will pay the price,  
But we will not count the cost

I. At the Tobes of Hades  
The Tobes of Hades  
Lit by flickering torchlight  
The Netherworld is gathered in the glare  
Prince By-Tor takes the cavern  
To the north light  
The sign of Eth is rising in the air  
By-Tor, knight of darkness,  
Centurion of evil  
Devil's prince  
  
II. Across the Styx  
Across the River Styx  
Out of the lamplight  
His nemesis is waiting at the gate  
The Snow Dog, ermine glowing  
In the damp night  
Coal-black eyes shimmering with hate  
By-Tor and the Snow Dog  
Square for battle  
Let the fray begin  
  
III. Of the Battle  
  
Instrumental  
  
IV. Epilogue  
The battle's over  
And the dust is clearing  
Disciples of the Snow Dog sound the knell  
Rejoicing echoes  
As the dawn is nearing  
By-Tor in defeat  
Retreats to Hell  
Snow Dog is victorious  
The land of the Overworld  
Is saved again

In a world lit only by fire  
Long train of flares under piercing stars  
I stand watching the steamliners roll by  
  
The caravan thunders onward  
To the distant dream of the city  
The caravan carries me onward  
On my way at last  
On my way at last  
  
I can't stop thinking big  
I can't stop thinking big  
  
On a road lit only by fire  
Going where I want, instead of where I should  
I peer out at the passing shadows  
Carried through the night into the city  
Where a young man has a chance of making good  
A chance to break from the past  
The caravan thunders onward  
Stars winking through the canvas hood  
On my way at last

Under the gaze of the angels  
A spectacle like he's never seen  
Spinning lights and faces  
Demon music and gypsy queens  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate, a game of chance  
  
How I prayed just to get away  
To carry me anywhere  
Sometimes the angels punish us  
By answering our prayers  
By answering our prayers  
  
A face of naked evil  
Turns the young boy's blood to ice  
The deadly confrontation  
Such a dangerous device  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate, a game of chance  
  
Shout to warn the crowd  
Accusations ringing loud  
A ticking box, in the hand of the innocent  
The angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent  
  
How I prayed just to get away  
To carry me anywhere  
Sometimes the angels punish us  
By answering our prayers  
By answering our prayers  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate, a game of chance

You can roll that stone  
To the top of the hill  
Drag your ball and chain  
Behind you  
  
You can carry that weight  
With an iron will  
Or let the pain remain  
Behind you  
  
Chip away the stone  
(Sisyphus)  
Chip away the stone  
Make the burden lighter  
If you must roll that rock alone  
  
You can drive those wheels  
To the end of the road  
You will still find the past right  
Behind you  
  
The weight of the load  
Try to put the sins of the past night  
Behind you  
  
Carve away the stone  
(Sisyhpus)  
Carve away the stone  
Make a graven image  
With some features of your own  
  
You call roll the stone  
To the top of the hill  
You can carry that weight  
With an iron will  
You can drive those wheels  
To the end of the road  
You can try to deny  
The weight of the load  
  
Roll away the stone  
(Sisyhpus)  
Roll away the stone  
If you could just move yours  
I could get working on my own

It's not the heat  
It's the inhumanity  
Plugged into the sweat of a summer street  
Machine gun images pass  
Like malice through the looking glass  
  
The slackjaw gaze  
Of true profanity  
Feels more like surrender than defeat  
If culture is the curse of the thinking class  
If culture is the curse of the thinking class  
  
Ceiling unlimited  
World so wide  
Turn and turn again  
  
Feeling unlimited  
Still unsatisfied  
Changes never end  
  
The vacant laugh  
Of true insanity  
Dressed up in the mask of Tragedy  
Programmed for the guts and glands  
Of idle minds and idle hands  
  
I rest my case -  
Or at least my vanity  
Dressed up in the mask of Comedy  
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man  
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man  
  
Ceiling unlimited  
Windows open wide  
Look and look again  
  
Feeling unlimited  
Eyes on the prize  
Changes never end  
  
Winding like an ancient river  
The time is now again  
  
Hope is like an endless river  
The time is now again

Signals transmitted  
Message received  
Reaction making impact  
Invisibly  
  
Elemental telepathy  
Exchange of energy  
Reaction making contact  
Mysteriously  
  
Eye to I  
Reaction burning hotter  
Two to one  
Reflection on the water  
H to O  
No flow without the other  
Oh but how  
Do they make contact  
With one another?  
  
Electricity? Biology?  
Seems to me it's Chemistry  
  
Emotion transmitted  
Emotion received  
Music in the abstract  
Positively  
  
Elemental empathy  
A change of synergy  
Music making contact  
Naturally  
  
One, two, three  
Add without subtraction  
Sound on sound  
Multiplied reaction  
H to O  
No flow without the other  
Oh but how  
Do we make contact  
With one another?

A modest man from mandrake  
Travelled rich to the city  
He had a need to discover  
A use for his newly-found wealth  
  
Because he was human  
Because he had goodness  
Because he was moral  
They called him insane  
  
Delusions of grandeur  
Visions of splendour  
A manic depressive  
He walks in the rain  
  
Eyes wide open  
Heart undefended  
Innocence untarnished  
  
Cinderella man  
Doing what you can  
They can't understand  
What it means  
  
Cinderella man  
Hang on to your plans  
Try as they might  
They cannot steal your dreams  
  
In the betrayal of his love he awakened  
To face a world of cold reality  
And a look in the eyes of the hungry  
Awakened him to what he could do  
  
He held up his riches  
To challenge the hungry  
Purposeful motion  
For one so insane  
  
They tried to fight him  
Just couldn't beat him  
This manic depressive  
Who walks in the rain

A boy alone, and so far from home  
Endless rooftops from my window  
I felt the gloom of empty rooms  
On rainy afternoons  
  
Sometimes, in confusion  
I felt so lost and disillusioned  
Innocence gave me confidence  
To go up against reality  
  
All the same  
We take our chances  
Laughed at by Time  
Tricked by Circumstances  
Plus ca change  
Plus c'est la meme chose  
The more that things change  
The more they stay the same  
  
Now I've gained some understanding  
Of the only world that we see  
Things that I once dreamed of  
Have become reality  
  
These walls that still surround me  
Still contain the same old me  
Just one more who's searching for  
A world that ought to be

I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
Asked the Lord above, have mercy now, save poor Bob if you please  
  
Standin' at the crossroads, tried to flag a ride  
Whee-hee, I tried to flag a ride  
Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by  
  
Standin' at the crossroads, risin' sun goin' down  
Standin' at the crossroads baby, the risin' sun goin' down  
I believe to my soul now, po' Bob is sinkin' down  
  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willie Brown  
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willie Brown  
That I got the crossroad blues this mornin', Lord, baby I'm sinkin' down  
  
I went to the crossroad, mama, I looked east and west  
I went to the crossroad, babe, I looked east and west  
Lord, I didn't have no sweet woman, ooh well, babe, in my distress

It is the fire that lights itself  
But it burns with a restless flame  
The arrow on a moving target  
The archer must be sure of his aim  
  
It is the engine that drives itself  
But it chooses the uphill climb  
A bearing on magnetic north  
Growing farther away all the time  
Can't stop - moving  
Can't stop - moving  
Can't stop  
  
You may be right  
It's all a waste of time  
I guess that's just a chance  
I'm prepared to take  
A danger I'm prepared to face  
Cut to the chase  
  
It is the rocket that ignites itself  
And launches its way to the stars  
A driver on a busy freeway  
Racing the oblivious cars  
  
It's the motor of the western world  
Spinning off to every extreme  
Pure as a lover's desire  
Evil as a murderer's dream  
  
Young enough not to care too much  
About the way things used to be  
I'm young enough to remember the future  
The past has no claim on me  
  
I'm old enough not to care too much  
About what you think of me  
But I'm young enough to remember the future  
And the way things ought to be  
  
What kind of difference  
Can on person make?  
Cut to the chase

In the constellation of Cygnus  
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force  
The Black Hole  
Of Cygnus X-1  
  
Six Stars of the Northern Cross  
In mourning for their sister's loss  
In a final flash of glory  
Nevermore to grace the night...  
  
1  
Invisible  
To telescopic eye  
Infinity  
The star that would not die  
  
All who dare  
To cross her course  
Are swallowed by  
A fearsome force  
  
Through the void  
To be destroyed  
Or is there something more?  
Atomized, at the core  
Or through the Astral Door,  
To soar...  
  
2  
I set a course just east of Lyra  
And northwest of Pegasus  
Flew into the light of Deneb  
Sailed across the Milky Way  
  
On my ship, the 'Rocinante'  
Wheeling through the galaxies,  
Headed for the heart of Cygnus  
Headlong into mystery  
  
The x-ray is her siren song  
My ship cannot resist her long  
Nearer to my deadly goal  
Until the Black Hole,  
Gains control...  
  
3  
Spinning, whirling,  
Still descending  
Like a spiral sea,  
Unending  
  
Sound and fury  
Drowns my heart  
Every nerve  
Is torn apart...  
  
To be continued...

When our weary world was young  
The struggle of the ancients first began  
The Gods of love and reason  
Sought alone to rule the fate of man  
  
They battled through the ages  
But still neither force would yield  
The people were divided  
Every soul a battlefield  
Every soul a battlefield  
  
I bring truth and understanding  
I bring wit and wisdom fair  
Precious gifts beyond compare  
  
We can build a world of wonder  
I can make you all aware  
I will find you food and shelter  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storm  
  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform  
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise  
  
But one day the streets fell silent  
Yet they knew not what was wrong  
They urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong  
  
The wise men were consulted  
And the bridge of death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus  
To find out what they had lost  
  
I bring love to give you solace  
In the darkness of the night  
In the heart's eternal light  
  
You need only trust your feelings  
Only love can steer you right  
  
I bring laughter, I bring music  
I bring joy and I bring tears  
I will soothe your primal fears  
  
Throw off those chains of reason  
And your prison disappears  
  
The cities were abandoned  
And the forests echoed song  
They danced and lived as brothers  
They knew love could not be wrong  
  
Food and wine they had aplenty  
And they slept beneath the stars  
The people were contented  
And the Gods watched from afar  
  
But the winter fell upon them  
And it caught them unprepared  
Bringing wolves and cold starvation  
And the hearts of men despaired  
  
The universe divided  
As the heart and mind collided  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years  
In a cloud of doubts and fears  
Their world was torn asunder  
Into hollow hemispheres  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other  
Most just followed one another  
Lost aimless like their brothers  
For their hearts were so unclear  
And the truth could not appear  
Their spirits were divided  
Into blinded hemispheres  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light  
My Rocinante sailed by night  
On her final flight  
  
To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force  
We set our course  
Spiraled through that timeless space  
To this immortal race  
  
I have memory and awareness  
But I have no shape or form  
As a disembodied spirit  
I am dead and yet unborn  
I have passed into Olympus  
As was told in tales of old  
To the city of immortals  
Marble white and purest gold  
  
I see the Gods in battle rage on high  
Thunderbolts across the sky  
I cannot move, I cannot hide  
I feel a silent scream begin inside  
  
Then all at once the chaos ceased  
A stillness fell, a sudden peace  
The warriors felt my silent cry  
And stayed their struggle mystified  
  
Apollo was astonished  
Dionysus thought me mad  
But they heard my story further  
And they wondered and were sad  
  
Looking down from Olympus  
On a world of doubt and fear  
It's surface splintered  
Into sorry hemispheres  
  
They sat a while in silence  
Then they turned at last to me  
(We will call you Cygnus)  
(The God of balance you shall be)  
  
We can walk our road together  
If our goals are all the same  
We can run alone and free  
If we pursue a different aim  
  
Let the truth of love be lighted  
Let the love of truth shine clear sensibility  
Armed with sense and liberty  
With the heart and mind united  
In a single, perfect, sphere

His world is under observation  
We monitor his station  
Under faces and the places  
Where he traces points of view  
  
He picks up scraps of conversation  
Radio and radiation  
From the dancers and romancers  
With the answers, but no clue  
  
He'd love to spend the night in Zion  
He's been a long while in Babylon  
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on  
To a tropic isle of Avalon  
  
His world is under anesthetic  
Subdivided and synthetic  
His reliance on the giants  
In the science of the day  
  
He picks up scraps of information  
He's adept at adaptation  
Cause for strangers and arrangers  
Constant change is here to stay  
  
He's got a force field and a flexible plan  
He's got a date with fate in a black sedan  
He plays fast forward for as long as he can  
But he won't need a bed  
He's a digital man

An ill wind comes arising  
Across the cities of the plain  
There's no swimming in the heavy water  
No singing in the acid rain  
Red alert  
Red alert  
  
It's so hard to stay together  
Passing through revolving doors  
We need someone to talk to  
And someone to sweep the floors  
Incomplete  
Incomplete  
  
[Chorus:]  
The world weighs on my shoulders  
But what am I to do?  
You sometimes drive me crazy  
But I worry about you  
I know it makes no difference  
To what you're going through  
But I see the tip of the iceberg  
And I worry about you...  
  
Cruising under your radar  
Watching from satellites  
Take a page from the red book  
Keep them in your sights  
Red alert  
Red alert  
  
Left and rights of passage  
Black and whites of youth  
Who can face the knowledge  
That the truth is not the truth?  
Obsolete  
Absolute  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Absalom, Absalom, Absalom

In a dog's life  
A year is really more like seven  
And all too soon a canine  
Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven  
  
It seems to me  
As we make our own few circles 'round the sun  
We get it backwards  
And our seven years go by like one  
  
Dog years...It's the season of the itch  
Dog years...With every scratch it reappears  
  
In the dog days  
People look to Sirius  
Dogs cry for the moon  
But these connections are mysterious  
  
It seems to me  
While it's true that every dog will have his day  
When all the bones are buried  
There is barely time to go outside and play  
  
Dog years...It's the season of the itch  
Dog years...With every scratch it reappears  
Dog years...For every sad son of a bitch  
Dog years...With his tail between his ears  
  
I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos  
Or a span of geological time  
Than be living in these dog years  
  
In a dog's brain  
A constant buzz of low-level static  
One sniff at the hydrant  
And the answer is automatic  
  
It seems to me  
As well make our own few circles 'round the block  
We've lost our senses  
For the higher-level static of talk

Where would you rather be?  
Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I was drifting for half the night  
Anxious and restless,  
Pressed down by the darkness  
Bound up and wound up so tight  
So many decisions, a million revisions  
Caught between and light...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
World of polished steel  
Gears and iron chains  
Turn the grinding wheel  
I run between the shadows  
Some are phantoms, some are real  
  
Where would you rather be?  
Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
The doubt and the fear  
I know would all disappear  
Anywhere but here  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I heard voices behind the door  
The known and the nameless,  
Familiar and faceless  
My angels and my demons at war  
Which one will lose - depends on what I choose  
Or maybe which voice I ignore...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
Streets of cold desire  
My precious sense of honor  
Just a shield of rusty wire  
I hold against the chaos  
And the cross of holy fire  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
So easy to deceive  
My precious sense of rightness  
Is sometimes so naive  
So that which I imagine  
Is that which I believe  
  
On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright  
Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness  
I knew which direction was right  
The case had been tried by the jury inside  
The choice between darkness and light...

Driven up and down in circles  
Skidding down a road of black ice  
Staring in and out storm windows  
Driven to a fool's paradise  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven to the margin of error  
Driven to the edge of control  
Driven to the margin of terror  
Driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole  
  
Driven day and night in circles  
Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves  
Stealing in and out back alleys  
Driven to another den of thieves  
  
But it's my turn to drive  
  
Driven in --- Driven to the edge  
Driven out --- On the thin end of the wedge  
Driven off --- By things I've never seen  
Driven on --- By the road to somewhere I've never been  
  
It's my turn to drive  
  
The road unwinds towards me  
What was there is gone  
The road unwinds before me  
And I go riding on

On certain nights  
When the angles are right  
And the moon is a slender crescent  
  
It's circle shows  
In a ghostly glow  
Of earthly luminescence  
  
Earthshine  
A beacon in the night  
I can raise my eyes to  
Earthshine  
Earthshine  
A jewel out of reach  
Form a dream to rise to  
Earthshine  
  
Floating high  
In the evening sky  
I see my faint reflection  
  
Pale facsimile  
Like what others see  
When they look in my direction  
  
Earthshine  
Stretching out your hand  
Full of starlit diamonds  
Earthshine  
  
Reflected light  
To another's sight  
And the moon tells a lover's story  
  
My borrowed face  
And my third-hand grace  
Only reflect your glory  
  
You're still out of reach  
Form a dream to rise to  
Earthshine

When we lift the covers from our feelings  
We expose our insecure spots  
Trust is just as rare as devotion  
Forgive us our cynical thoughts  
If we need too much attention  
  
Not content with being cool  
We must throw ourselves wide open  
And start acting like a fool  
If we need too much approval  
Then the cuts can seem too cruel  
  
Right to the heart of the matter  
Right to the beautiful part  
Illusions are painfully shattered  
Right where discovery starts  
In the secret wells of emotion  
Buried deep in our hearts  
  
It's true that love can change us  
But never quite enough  
Sometimes we are too tender  
Sometimes we're too tough  
If we get too much attention  
  
It gets hard to overrule  
So often fragile power turns  
To scorn and ridicule  
Sometimes our big splashes  
Are just ripples in the pool  
Feelings run high

We are secrets to each other  
Each one's life a novel  
No-one else has read  
Even joined in bonds of love  
We're linked to one another  
By such slender threads  
  
We are planets to each other  
Drifting in our orbits  
To a brief eclipse  
Each of us a world apart  
Alone and yet together  
Like two passing ships  
  
Just between us  
I think it's time for us to recognize  
The differences we sometimes feared to show  
Just between us  
I think it's time for us to realize  
The spaces in between  
Leave room  
For you and I to grow  
  
We are strangers to each other  
Full of sliding panels  
An illusion show  
Acting well-rehearsed routines  
Or playing from the heart?  
It's hard for one to know  
  
We are islands to each other  
Building hopeful bridges  
On the troubled sea  
Some are burned or swept away  
Some we would not choose  
But we're not always free

You turn my head  
I spin my wheels  
Running on empty  
You know how that feels  
  
I'm on a roll now  
Or is it a slide?  
Can't be too careful  
With that dangerous pride  
If I could only reach that dial inside  
And turn it up  
  
Face up or you can only back down  
Face up hit the target, or you better hit the ground  
Face up there's still time to turn the game around  
Face up turn it up or turn that wild card down  
Turn it up  
  
Don't complain  
Don't explain  
I don't think my new resolve  
Can stand the strain  
  
I'm in a groove now  
Or is it a rut?  
I need some feedback  
But all the lines are cut  
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut  
And turn it up  
  
You get all squeezed up inside  
Like the days were carved in stone  
You get all wired up inside  
And it's bad to be alone  
  
You can go out, you can take a ride  
And when you get out on your own  
You get all smoothed out inside  
And it's good to be alone  
Turn it up

I've got my own moral compass to steer by  
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky  
And all the preaching voices  
Empty vessels of dreams so loud  
As they move among the crowd  
Fools and thieves are well disguised  
In the temple and marketplace  
In the temple and marketplace  
  
Like a stone in the river  
Against the floods of spring  
I will quietly resist  
I will quietly resist  
  
Like the willows in the wind  
Or the cliffs along the ocean  
I will quietly resist  
I will quietly resist  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't have faith in faith  
I don't believe in belief  
You can call me faithless  
You can call me faithless  
I still cling to hope  
And I believe in love  
And that's faith enough for me  
And that's faith enough for me  
  
I've got my own spirit level for balance  
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down  
And all the shouting voices  
Try to throw me off my course  
Some by sermon, some by force  
Fools and thieves are dangerous  
In the temple and marketplace  
In the temple and marketplace  
  
Like a forest bows to winter  
Beneath the deep white silence  
I will quietly resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a flower in the desert  
That only blooms at night  
I will quietly resist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And that's faith enough for me

Pariah dogs and wandering madmen  
Barking at strangers and speaking in tongues  
The ebb and flow of tidal fortune  
Electrical changes are charging up the young  
  
[Bridge:]  
It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit  
It's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it  
You can almost feel the current flowing  
You can almost see the circuits blowing  
  
[Chorus:]  
One day I feel I'm on top of the world  
And the next it's falling in on me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel  
And the next it's rolling over me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
  
Whirlwind life of faith and betrayal  
Rise in anger, fall back and repeat  
Slow degrees on the dark horizon  
Full moon rising lays silver at your feet  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit  
You can almost see the circle growing  
You can almost feel the planets glowing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I fly through a crack in the sky  
And the next it's falling in on me  
I can get back on  
I can get back on  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
I can get back on  
I can get back on

Yeah, oh yeah!  
Ooh, said I,  
I'm coming out to get you  
Ooh, sit down  
I'm coming out to find you  
Ooh, yeah. Ooh yeah  
Finding my way!  
  
I've been gone so long  
I've lost count of the years  
Well, I sang some sad songs,  
Oh yes, and cried some bad tears  
  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, whoa  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, yeah  
  
I'm running,  
Finding my way back home  
Oh yeah!  
  
Yeah, oh yeah!  
Ooh, said I,  
I'm coming back to look for you  
Ooh, sit down  
I'm going by the back door  
Ooh, yeah. Ooh yeah  
Finding my way!  
  
You've done me no right,  
But you've done me some wrong  
Left me lonely each night  
While I sing my sad song  
  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, whoa  
Look out! I'm coming  
Whoa, yeah  
  
I'm running,  
Finding my way back home  
I'm coming  
Ooh, babe, I said I'm running  
Whoa, babe, I said I'm coming  
To get you, mama  
Said I'm running  
  
Ooh, babe, I said I'm coming  
For you, babe  
I said I'm running  
Ooh yes, babe, I said I'm coming  
To get you, babe. I said I'm coming  
Ooh, yeah  
  
I'm finding,  
I'm finding my way back home  
Well, I've had it for now,  
Living on the road  
Ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah  
  
Finding my way!

Why try? I know why  
The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone  
Clear head, new life ahead  
It's time I was king now -- not just one more pawn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend  
  
Moon rise, thoughtful eyes  
Staring back at me from the window beside  
No fright or hindsight  
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend  
  
Start a new chapter  
Find what I'm after  
It's changing every day  
The change of a season  
Is enough of a reason  
To want to get away  
Quiet and pensive  
My thoughts apprehensive  
The hours drift away  
Leaving my homeland  
Playing a lone hand  
My life begins today  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fly by night, away from here  
Change my life again  
Fly by night, goodbye my dear  
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

There's something happening here  
What it is ain't exactly clear  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
There's battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong  
Young people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
  
I think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
What a field-day for the heat  
A thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
  
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
You step out of line, the man come and take you away  
  
We better stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, now, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down

Tough times demand tough talk  
Demand tough hearts demand tough songs  
Demand --  
  
We can rise and fall like empires  
Flow in and out like the tide  
Be vain and smart, humble and dumb  
We can hit and miss like pride  
  
We can circle around like hurricanes  
Dance and dream like lovers  
Attack the day like birds of prey  
Or scavengers under cover  
  
Look in --  
To the eye of the storm  
Look out --  
For the force without form  
Look around --  
At the sight and the sound  
Look in look out look around --  
  
We can move with savage grace  
To the rhythms of the night  
Cool and remote like dancing girls  
In the heat of the beat and the lights  
  
We can wear the rose of romance  
An air of joie de vivre  
Too-tender hearts upon our sleeves  
Or skin as thick as thieves'  
  
Rising falling at force ten  
We twist the world and ride the wind  
  
Look in --  
Look the storm in the eye  
Look out --  
To the sea and the sky  
Look around --  
At the sight and the sound  
Look in look out look around

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Greeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids hunch  
This is santa's big scene  
And above all the bustle you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day

There are those who think that life  
Has nothing left to chance  
With a host of holy horrors  
To direct our aimless dance  
  
A planet of playthings  
We dance on the strings  
Of powers we cannot perceive  
"The stars aren't aligned,  
Or the gods are malign"  
Blame is better to give than receive  
  
You can choose a ready guide  
In some celestial voice  
If you choose not to decide  
You still have made a choice  
  
You can choose from phantom fears  
And kindness that can kill  
I will choose a path that's clear  
I will choose free will  
  
There are those who think that  
They've been dealt a losing hand  
The cards were stacked against them,  
They weren't born in Lotus-Land  
  
All preordained  
A prisoner in chains  
A victim of venomous fate  
Kicked in the face  
You can't pray for a place  
In heaven's unearthly estate  
  
Each of us  
A cell of awareness  
Imperfect and incomplete  
Genetic blends  
With uncertain ends  
On a fortune hunt  
That's far too fleet

The best we can agree on  
Is it could have been worse  
What happened to your old  
Benevolent universe?  
You know, the one with stars  
That revolved around you  
Beaming down full of promises  
To bring good news  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
  
The worst thing about it all  
Is that you've never been right  
And I'm still not really sure  
What started that fight  
But I still get this feeling  
There's more trouble ahead  
So never mind the bad news  
Let's have the good news instead  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words...  
  
Some would said they never fear a thing  
Well, I do (Well, I do)  
And I'm afraid enough for both of us  
For me and you (me and you)  
Time, if nothing else, will do its worst  
So do me that favor  
And tell me the good news first  
The good news first  
  
You used to feel that way  
The saddest words you could ever say  
But I know you'll remember that day  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
And the most beautiful words I could ever say  
The most beautiful words I could ever say

A hundred thousand years  
A hundred thousand miles of track  
A hundred thousand tears  
Hundred thousand souls  
You can't give back  
  
When the dark subsides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Face to face  
Eloquent stories  
Of what could have been  
  
A hundred thousand dreams  
A hundred thousand beams of light  
A hundred thousand schemes  
Gods in the heavens can't get it right  
  
When the dark subsides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
Integrity falls shy  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Place to place  
Elegant story  
Of what could have been  
  
When the truth hides  
Integrity falls shy  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
When the truth hides  
An eternity goes by  
On the fault line  
Between then and now  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Face to face  
Elegant story Of what could have been  
  
Grace to grace  
Immaculate vision  
Of what should have been  
  
Grace to grace

Half the world hates  
What half the world does every day  
Half the world waits  
While half gets on with it anyway  
  
Half the world lives  
Half the world makes  
Half the world gives  
While the other half takes  
  
Half the world is  
Half the world was  
Half the world thinks  
While the other half does  
  
Half the world talks  
With half a mind on what they say  
Half the world walks  
With half a mind to run away  
  
Half the world lies  
Half the world learns  
Half the world flies  
As half the world turns  
  
Half the world cries  
Half the world laughs  
Half the world tries  
To be the other half  
  
Half of us divided Like a torn-up photograph, Half of us are  
Trying To reach the other half  
  
Half the world cares  
While half the world is wasting the day  
Half the world shares  
While half the world is stealing away

Hand over fist  
Paper around the stone  
Scissors cut the paper  
Cut the paper to the bone  
Hand over fist  
Paper around the stone  
Scissors cut the paper  
And the rock must stand alone  
  
I could disappear into the crowd  
But not if I keep my head in the clouds  
I could walk away so proud  
It's easy enough if you don't laugh too loud  
  
I thought I was okay alone  
Wait for the postman and the telephone  
Lost in a world of my own  
I thought I could run alone  
Thought I could run through the night alone  
  
Hand over hand  
Doesn't seem so much  
Hand over hand  
Is the strength of the common touch  
  
You talk as we walk along  
You never imagined I could be so wrong  
Humming your favorite song  
You know I've hated that song for so long  
  
How can we ever agree?  
Like the rest of the world  
We grow farther apart  
I swear you don't listen to me  
Holding my hand to my heart  
Holding my fist to my racing heart  
  
Take a walk outside myself  
In some exotic land  
Greet a passing stranger  
Feel the strength in his hand  
Feel the world expand  
  
I feel my spirit resist  
But I open up my fist  
Lay hand over hand over  
Hand over fist

All the journeys of this great adventure  
It didn't always feel that way  
I wouldn't trade them because I made them  
The best I could, and that's enough to say  
  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
All the highlights of that headlong flight  
Holding on with all my might  
To what I felt back then  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
All the treasures, the gold and glory  
It didn't always feel that way  
I don't regret it - I'll never forget it  
I wouldn't trade tomorrow for today  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
The days were dark  
And the nights were bright  
I would never trade tomorrow for today  
  
All the highlights of that headlong flight  
Holding on with all my might  
Some days were dark  
I wish that I could live it all again  
Some nights were bright  
I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again  
  
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels  
Steer the airship right across the stars  
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to steal  
Oh I wish that I could...  
  
Oh I wish that I could live it all again

I said I played this song  
So many times before  
That the melody keeps repeating  
Growing new ideas  
Flowing chords and notes  
Like a mountain river bleeding  
  
Well, I say as I look back  
And all the thoughts I've had  
They reflect just what I'm learning  
Yes, you know that the hardest part  
Yes, I say it is to stay on top  
On top of a world forever churning  
  
Well, you say you can laugh  
But I can see that your eyes are glass  
Well, do you see, can't you see, what I'm feeling?  
Yes, I've seen your face before  
Why, I've seen it everywhere  
Showing up to me without a scent revealing  
  
Well, I said will it ever change?  
Will it stay the same?  
I'd surely like to know before it's over  
Well, I said I played some  
I said it won't be long  
Won't be long before I stop and play it over  
  
Oh, oh I've, I've seen your face before  
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?  
Oh, oh I've, I've been in one place too long  
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?

When the waters rose  
In the darkness  
In the wake of the endless flood  
It flowed into our memory  
It flowed into our blood  
  
When something broke the surface  
Just to see the starry dome  
We still feel that relation  
When the water takes us home  
In the flying spray of the ocean  
The water takes you home  
  
Springing from the weight  
Of the mountains  
Like the heart of the earth  
Would burst  
Flowing out from marble fountains  
In the dreams of a desert thirst  
  
Something swam through  
The jungles  
Where the mighty rivers roam  
Something breaks the silence  
When the water takes you home  
I hear the wordless voices  
When the water takes me home  
  
Waves that crash on the shoreline  
Torrents of tropical rain  
Streaming down  
Beyond our memory  
Streaming down inside our veins  
  
When something left the ocean  
To crawl high above the foam  
We still feel that elation  
When the water takes us home  
In a driving rain of redemption  
The water takes me home...

He sleeps with a chain saw  
Got eyes like an outlaw  
He takes a two smoke walk  
He don't like to talk  
  
And he don't like change  
And he don't like change  
You may think he's deranged  
But he'd rather be home,  
Home.. Home on the strange  
  
He's a Canadian Icon  
He sleeps with his clothes on  
He likes to work with his hands  
He's an apolitical man  
  
And he don't like change  
And he don't like change  
You may think he's deranged  
But he'd rather be home  
Home.. Home on the strange  
  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
One in a lifetime  
One in a world  
  
He sleeps with a chain saw  
He sings fa fa fa fa fa  
He likes to work with his hands  
He's an apolitical man  
  
And he don't like change  
And he don't like change  
You may think he's deranged  
But he'd rather be home  
Home.. Home on the strange  
  
And he don't like change  
And he don't like change  
You may think he's deranged  
But he'd rather be home  
Home.. Home on the strange

I looked in the mirror today  
My eyes just didn't seem so bright  
I've lost a few more hairs  
I think I'm going bald  
I think I'm going bald!  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
We would sit and talk of dreams all night  
Dreams of youth  
And simple truths  
Now we're so involved  
So involved with life  
  
Walk down vanity fair  
Memory lane everywhere  
Wall Street shuffles there  
Dressed in flowing hair  
  
The wire!  
  
Once we loved the flowers  
Now we ask the price of the land  
Once we would take water  
But now it must be wine  
Now we've been  
And now we've seen What price, peace of mind  
Take a piece of my mind  
  
My life is slipping away  
I'm aging every day  
But even when I'm grey  
I'll still be grey my way

"I bring truth and understanding,  
I bring wit and wisdom fair,  
Precious gifts beyond compare.  
We can build a world of wonder,  
I can make you all aware.  
I will find you food and shelter,  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storms.  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform. "  
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise.  
But one day the streets fell silent,  
Yet they knew not what was wrong.  
The urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong.  
The wise men were consulted,  
And the Bridge of Death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus,  
To find out what they had lost.

Well, I can see what you mean  
It just takes me longer  
And I can feel what you feel  
It just makes you stronger  
  
I know, I know, I know  
Oh, the feeling grows  
I see, I see, I see  
It's got to be  
You can take me for a little while  
You can take me, you can make me smile  
In the end  
  
Well, I can do what you do  
You just do it better  
And I can cry like you cry  
It just makes me sadder  
  
Well, I can shine like you shine  
It doesn't make me brighter  
But if I think like you think  
It don't make my load much lighter

The Universe divided  
As the Heart and Mind collided,  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years.  
In a cloud of doubts and fears,  
Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres.  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other.  
Most just followed one another,  
Lost and aimless like their brothers,  
For their hearts were so unclear,  
And the truth could not appear.  
Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres.  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light.  
My Rocinante' sailed by night  
On her final flight.  
To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force  
We set our course.  
Spiralled through that timeless space  
To this immortal place.

A world of difference  
A world so out of touch  
Overwhelmed by everything  
But wanting more so much  
  
Call it blind frustration  
Call it blind man's bluff  
Call each other names  
Your voices rude,  
Your voices rough  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's cool to be so tough  
  
Handle with kid gloves  
Handle with kid gloves  
Then you learn the lessons  
Taught in school won't be enough  
Put on your kid gloves  
Put on your kid gloves  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's cool to be so tough  
  
A world of indifference  
Heads and hearts too full  
Careless of the consequence  
Of constant push and pull  
  
Anger got bare knuckles  
Anger play the fool  
Anger wear a crown of thorns  
Reverse the golden rule  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's tough to be so cool  
  
Handle with kid gloves  
Handle with kid gloves  
Then you learn the weapons  
And the ways of hard-knock school  
Put on your kid gloves  
Put on your kid gloves  
Then you learn the lesson  
That it's tough to be so cool

If we're so much the same like I always hear  
Why such different fortunes and fates?  
Some of us live in a cloud of fear  
Some live behind iron gates  
  
Why such different fortunes and fates?  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
Some live behind iron gates  
While others see only the worst  
  
[Chorus:]  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
While others only see the worst  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
Somethings can never be changed  
Such a lot of pain on this earth  
It's somehow so badly arranged  
  
Somethings can never be changed  
Some reasons will never come clear  
It's somehow so badly arranged  
If we're so much the same like I always hear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some are blessed and some are cursed  
The golden one or scarred from birth  
While others only see the worst  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
Such a lot of pain on the earth  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Such a lot of pain  
Such a lot of pain  
Such a lot of pain on the earth

Sweet memories flashing very quickly by  
Reminding me giving me a reason why  
I know that my goal is more than a thought  
I'll be there when I teach what I've been taught  
  
You know we've told you before  
But you didn't hear us then  
So you still question why  
You didn't listen again  
  
Sweet memories I never thought it would be like this  
Reminding me just how close I came to missing  
I know that this is the way for me to go  
You'll be there when you know what I know

Living on a lighted stage  
Approaches the unreal  
For those who think and feel  
In touch with some reality  
Beyond the gilded cage  
  
Cast in this unlikely role,  
Ill-equipped to act  
With insufficient tact  
One must put up barriers  
To keep oneself intact  
  
Living in the limelight  
The universal dream  
For those who wish to seem  
  
Those who wish to be  
Must put aside the alienation  
Get on with the fascination  
The real relation  
The underlying theme  
  
Living in a fish eye lens  
Caught in the camera eye  
I have no heart to lie  
I can't pretend a stranger  
Is a long-awaited friend  
  
All the world's indeed a stage  
And we are merely players  
Performers and portrayer  
Each another's audience  
Outside the gilded cage  
  
Living in the limelight  
The universal dream  
For those who wish to seem  
  
Those who wish to be  
Must put aside the alienation  
Get on with the fascination  
The real relation  
The underlying theme

The dancer slows her frantic pace  
In pain and desperation  
Her aching limbs and downcast face  
Aglow with perspiration  
  
Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire  
With just the briefest pause  
The flooding through her memory  
The echoes of old applause  
  
She limps across the floor  
And closes her bedroom door  
The writer stares with glassy eyes  
  
Defies the empty page  
His beard is white, his face is lined  
And streaked with tears of rage  
  
Thirty years ago, how the words would flow  
With passion and precision  
But now his mind is dark and dulled  
By sickness and indecision  
And he stares out the kitchen door  
Where the sun will rise no more  
  
Some are born to move the world  
To live their fantasies  
But most of us just dream about  
The things we'd like to be  
  
Sadder still to watch it die  
Than never to have known it  
For you -- the blind who once could see  
The bell tolls for thee

There's a time for feelin' as good as we can  
The time is now, and there's no stoppin' us  
There's a time for livin' as high as we can  
Behind us you will only see our dust  
  
You know we're havin' good days  
And we hope they're gonna last  
Our future still looks brighter than our past  
We feel no need to worry  
No reason to be sad  
Our mem'ries remind us, maybe road life's not so bad  
  
Just keep smilin', move onward ev'ry day  
And try to keep our thoughts away from home  
We're trav'lin' around, no time to settle down  
And satisfy our wanderlust to roam  
  
Well from sea to shining sea, and a hundred points between  
Still we go on diggin' ev'ry show  
The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand  
Till morning when it's time for us to go

It's not how fast you can go  
The force goes into the flow  
If you pick up the beat  
You can forget about the heat  
More than just survival  
More than just a flash  
More than just a dotted line  
More than just a dash  
  
It's a test of ultimate will  
The heartbreak climb uphill  
Got to pick up the pace  
If you want to stay in the race  
More than just blind ambition  
More than just simple greed  
More than just a finish line  
Must feed this burning need  
In the long run...  
  
From first to last  
The peak is never passed  
Something always fires the light  
That gets in your eyes  
One moment's high  
And glory rolls on by  
Like a streak of lightning  
That flashes and fades  
In the summer sky  
  
Your meters may overload  
You can rest at the side of the road  
You can miss a stride  
But nobody gets a free ride  
More than high performance  
More than just a spark  
More than just the bottom line  
Or a lucky shot in the dark  
In the long run...  
  
You can do a lot in a lifetime  
If you don't burn out too fast  
You can make the most of the distance  
First you need endurance  
First you've got to last...

[Marc Live]  
Woo! Ohhh.. Yeah.. Sink in  
Brand new.. Marc Live... Let's go!  
Rush, let's work, rush  
Rush, yo.. Rush  
Yo, check, check, yo  
  
Rush - jump all hot, jump off the whole top  
Jump off the roof 90 proof, listen  
Break up the floor, break up mad tours  
Shake up the state, shake like it's earthquake  
Break up the cake, break 'til it's daybreak  
Shut down the block, pay off corrupt cop  
Set up shop, set off the whole block  
It's all good, yo it's all hood listen  
Stop it - I know this shit sound mad good  
It's supposed to, niggaz I told you  
Chickens I told you, you brand new  
It's a, new me yo it's not you, you old news  
Take off the top, blow past the hot spot  
Everybody look, get chicks took  
Hit the lick quick, get the bricks quick  
The chain so sick, rims so thick, c'mon!  
  
[Chorus - repeat 2X]  
Rush - it's the cars, the clothes, the dough  
Rush - it's the bar, the clubs, the 'dro  
Rush - it's the girls, the diamonds, the blow  
Rush - it's the street, it's gangsta, so heat  
  
[Marc Live]  
Rush - okay, yo I'ma make sense of it (tell 'em)  
The rush, the overload, overdose, fuck it  
It's over most fuck it, so go 'head with it  
People love the scene, it's all cream  
It's all flash, it all costs, it's all green  
It's all ching, it's the whole thing, the tv's  
Rims so mean, and so extreme  
Buy the bar out, and ride out with the best thing  
See me at the next thing, text ring  
It's head trauma, bad drama, they need body armor  
The streets is monster, the streets is Tonka  
Watch your truck, you might get stuck  
You might not wake up, wear the make-up  
You fake and shook, you won't get off the hook  
We takin dough right from off of your books  
Your whole label break up, you out of cake, wake up  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[unknown girl]  
(Rush) Okay, we got money, we got Manolos

It's every day, it's not [?] baby  
You know how we do  
  
[Marc Live]  
Rush - blow up the street, blow off the mad heat  
Blow down the doors, it goes down mad raw  
It's too real, go get steel  
Stop all beef, snatch off the new piece  
Walk down the street, pass to my man Pete  
Go by Jacob and split all the cake up  
All in a day's work, go get paid work  
We made for it, break laws, rush for it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rush

Where the air's not clean  
Where the water's glowing green  
Where the dogs are mean  
  
I'm Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to suburbia  
You don't have to cut the lawn  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
I've got a feeling that you're going love what  
You'll find  
  
Where we're on T.V.  
Where the money grows on trees  
Where the beer is free  
  
Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to Utopia  
We'll wave before we're gone  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I hear the beat of an anxious heart  
I feel the heat... it's time for us to start  
Time for us to start  
  
I'm moving to Bohemia  
Where the literature's obscene  
Bathing in Euphoria  
Where the naked truth is on the screen  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
I've got a feeling that...  
You're going love what you'll find  
  
You're going love what you'll find

Oh, hello, Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason  
For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season  
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'  
I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on  
  
I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter  
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her  
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better  
She said you're strange, but don't change, and I let her  
  
In a while, will the smile on my face turn to plaster  
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster  
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster  
Is it strange I should change I don't know, why don't you ask her [4x]

One man standing on the plains of Abraham  
Watching the damaged sunrise  
One man standing near the edge of a quiet breakdown  
  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till your paranoia calms down  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till you're tied up and your spell bound  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk, but I haven't got too much to say  
I don't mean to be so Nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start running you keep on running  
Till your muscles start to break down  
Once you start falling you keep on falling  
Till you hit the cold cold ground  
  
I watch TV - What do you want from me?  
I watch TV - What do you want from me?  
  
Just between the ice ages anyway  
I want to talk, I haven't got enough to say  
I don't mean to be so nihilistic  
Forgive me if I seem to be too realistic  
  
Once you start hiding you keep on hiding  
Till you feel you're safe and sound  
Once you start watching you keep on watching  
Till you're tied up and you're spell bound  
  
I watch the sea, it helps to anchor me  
I watch the sea, I saw it on TV

So many things I think about  
When I look far away  
Things I know -- things I wonder  
Things I'd like to say  
The more we think we know about  
The greater the unknown  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are not alone  
  
Mystic rhythms -- capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Mysteries of night escape the light of day  
Mystic rhythms -- under northern lights  
Primitive things stir  
The hearts of everyone  
  
We sometimes catch a window  
A glimpse of what's beyond  
Was it just imagination  
Stringing us along?  
More things than are dreamed about  
Unseen and unexplained  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are entertained  
  
Mystic rhythms -- capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Nature seems to spin  
A supernatural way  
Mystic rhythms -- under city lights  
Or a canopy of stars  
We feel the powers  
And we wonder what they are  
We feel the push and pull  
Of restless rhythms from afar

Tide pools  
When the ebbing tide retreats  
Along the rocky shoreline  
It leaves a trail of tidal pools  
In a short-lived galaxy  
Each microcosmic planet  
A complete society  
  
A simple kind mirror  
To reflect upon our own  
All the busy little creatures  
Chasing out their destinies  
Living in their pools  
They soon forget about the sea...  
  
Wheels within wheels  
In a spiral array  
A pattern so grand  
And complex  
Time after time  
We lose sight of the way  
Our causes can't see  
Their effects  
  
Hyperspace  
A quantum leap forward  
In time and in space  
The universe learned to expand  
  
The mess and the magic  
Triumphant and tragic  
A mechanized world, out of hand  
  
Computerized clinic  
For superior cynics  
Who dance to a synthetic band  
  
In their own image  
Their world is fashioned,  
No wonder they don't understand  
  
Wheels within wheels  
In a spiral array  
A pattern so grand  
And complex  
Time after time  
We lose sight of the way  
Our causes can't see  
Their effects  
  
Permanent Waves  
Science, like Nature  
Must also be tamed  
With a view towards its preservation  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely serve us well  
  
Art as expression,  
Not as market campaigns  
Will still capture our imaginations  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely help us along  
  
The most endangered species,  
The honest man  
Will still survive annihilation  
Forming a world,  
State of integrity  
Sensitive, open, and strong  
  
Wave after wave  
Will flow with the tide  
And bury the world as it does  
Tide after tide  
Will flow and recede  
Leaving life to go on  
As it was...

I'm running here  
I'm running there  
I'm looking for a girl  
Cause there's nothing I need  
There's nothing I want more  
In the whole wide world  
  
Well, I need it quick  
And I need it now  
Before I start to fade away  
That's why I'm searching  
That's why I'm looking  
Each and every day  
  
Oh, I need some love  
I said I need some love!  
Oh yes, I need some love  
This feeling I can't rise above  
Yeah, yeah!  
  
Well I been hustling here,  
I been hustling there  
I been searching for about a week  
And I started feeling  
This strange sensation  
My knees are starting getting weak  
  
Well I need what keeps  
A young man alive,  
I'm saying I need it now  
I'm gonna get the message  
Across to you  
Someway, somehow  
  
Oh, I need some love  
I said I need some love!  
Oh yes, I need some love  
This feeling I can't rise above  
Oh, yeah yeah!

You just don't get it  
What it is...well, you're not really sure  
You move like you're walking on this ice  
Talking like you're still insecure  
  
Time is a spiral, space is a curve  
I know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Waiting for rescue, and I know you just  
Don't get it  
You just don't get it  
  
Neurotica...Exotica  
It's just Erotica...Hypnotic  
It's just Psychotic...Chaotic  
It's just Exotica...Neurotica  
  
You just don't get it  
Baby, don't you ask yourself why?  
If you don't like the answer, forget it  
You know I hate to see you cry  
  
Fortune is random... Fate shoots from the hip  
I know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip  
Life is a diamond you turn into dust  
Looking for trust, and I know that you just  
Don't get it  
You just don't get it  
  
Snap!  
Hide in your shell, let the world go to hell  
It's like Russian roulette to you  
Snap!  
Sweat running cold, you can't face growing old  
It's a personal threat to you  
Snap!  
The world is a cage for your impotent rage  
But don't let it get to you  
Snap!

He's a rebel and a runner  
He's a signal turning green  
He's a restless young romantic  
Wants to run the big machine  
  
He's got a problem with his poisons  
But you know he'll find a cure  
He's cleaning up the systems  
To keep his nature pure  
  
Learning to match the beat of the old world man  
Learning to catch the heat of the third world man  
  
He's got to make his own mistakes  
And learn to mend the mess he makes  
He's old enough to know what's right  
And young enough not to choose it  
He's noble enough to win the world  
But weak enough to lose it  
  
He's a new world man  
  
He's a radio receiver  
Tuned to factories and farms  
He's a writer and ranger and a young boy bearing arms  
He's got a problem with his powers  
His weapons on patrol  
He's got to walk a fine line  
And keep his self control  
  
Trying to save the day for the old world man  
Trying to pave the way for the third world man  
  
He's not concerned with yesterday  
He knows constant change is here today  
He's noble enough to know what's right  
But weak enough not to choose it  
He's wise enough to win the world  
But fool enough to lose it  
  
He's a new world man  
  
Learning to match the beat of the old world man  
He's learning to catch the heat of the third world man  
  
He's a new world man [Repeat x 3]

I knew he was different, in his sexuality  
I went to his parties, as a straight minority  
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity  
He only introduced me to a wider reality  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that he was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But he's nobody's  
  
Hero - saves a drowning child  
Cures a wasting disease  
Hero - lands the crippled airplane  
Solves great mysteries  
  
Hero - not the handsome actor  
Who plays a hero's role  
Hero - not the glamor girl  
Who'd love to sell her soul  
If anybody's buying  
Nobody's hero  
  
I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family  
All their lives were shattered  
In a nightmare of brutality  
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony  
Try to hold some faith  
In the goodness of humanity  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that she was gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
But she's nobody's  
  
Hero - the voice of reason  
Against the howling mob  
Hero - the pride of purpose  
In the unrewarding job  
  
Hero - not the champion player  
Who plays the perfect game  
Not the glamor boy  
Who loves to sell his name  
Everybody's buying  
Nobody's hero  
  
As the years went by, we drifted apart  
When I heard that you were gone  
I felt a shadow cross my heart  
  
Hero

It's not a place, it's a yearning  
It's not a race, it's a journey  
It's not an act, it's attraction  
It's not a style, it's an action  
  
It's a dream for the waking  
It's a flower touched by flame  
It's a gift for the giving  
It's a power with a hundred names  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly mocking  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
It's a hand, that rocks the cradle  
It's a motion, that swings the sky  
It's method on the edge of madness  
It's a balance on the edge of a knife  
It's a smile on the edge of sadness  
It's a dance on the edge of life  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration  
The breath of love is electricity  
Maybe time is bird in flight  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Here we come out of the cradle  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking  
  
Endlessly rocking  
(Endlessly rocking, endlessly rocking)  
  
Endlessly rocking  
Endlessly rocking

The whiteness of confusion  
Is unfolding from my mind  
I stare around in wonder  
Have I left my life behind?  
  
I catch the scent of ambergris  
And turn my head, surprised  
My gaze is caught and held and I  
Am helpless, mesmerized  
  
Panacea, liquid grace  
Oh let me touch your fragile face  
Enchantment falls around me  
And I know I cannot leave  
Here's a meaning for my life  
  
A shelter from the storm  
Pacify my troubles with  
Her body, soft and warm  
Naked in our unity  
A smile for every tear  
  
Gentle hands that promise me  
Comfort through the years  
Yet I know I must be gone  
Before the light of dawn  
  
Panacea, passion pure  
I can't resist your gentle lure  
My heart will lie beside you  
And my wandering body grieves

A wave toward the clearing the sky  
  
All this time we're talking and sharing our Rational View  
A billion other voices are spreading other news  
All this time we're living and trying to understand  
Why a billion other choices are making their demands  
  
Talk of a Peaceable Kingdom  
Talk of a time without fear  
The ones we wish would listen  
Are never going to hear  
  
Justice against The Hanged Man  
Knight of Wands against the hour  
Swords against the kingdom  
Time against The Tower  
  
All this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards  
While a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards  
All this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn  
While a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn  
  
Dream of a Peaceable Kingdom  
Dream of a time without war  
The ones we wish would hear us  
Have heard it all before  
  
A wave toward the clearing sky  
A wave toward the clearing sky  
  
The Hermit against The Lovers  
Or the Devil against the Fool  
Swords against the kingdom  
The Wheel against the rules  
  
All this time we're burning like bonfires in the dark  
A billion other blazes are shooting off their sparks  
Every spark a drifting ember of desire  
To fall upon the earth and spark another fire  
  
A homeward angel on the fly  
A wave toward the clearing sky

Basic elemental  
Instinct to survive  
Stirs the higher passions  
Thrill to be alive  
  
Alternating currents  
In a tidewater surge  
Rational resistance  
To an unwise urge  
Anything can happen  
  
From the point of conception  
To the moment of truth  
At the point of surrender  
To the burden of proof  
  
From the point of ignition  
To the final drive  
The point of the journey  
Is not to arrive  
Anything can happen  
  
Basic temperamental  
Filters on our eyes  
Alter our perceptions  
Lenses polarize  
  
Alternating currents  
Force a show of hands  
Rational responses  
Force a change of plans  
Anything can happen  
  
From a point on the compass  
To magnetic north  
The point of the needle  
Moving back and forth  
  
From the point of entry  
Until the candle is burned  
The point of departure  
Is not to return  
Anything can happen  
  
I set the wheels in motion  
Turn up all the machines  
Activate the programs  
And run behind the scene  
  
I set the clouds in motion  
Turn up light and sound  
Activate the window  
And watch the world go round  
  
Anything can happen

My uncle has a country place  
That no one knows about  
He says it used to be a farm  
Before the Motor Law  
And now on Sundays I elude the eyes  
And hop the turbine freight  
To far outside the wire where my  
White-haired uncle waits  
  
Jump to the ground as the turbo slows  
To cross the borderline  
Run like the wind as excitement shivers  
Up and down my spine  
But down in his barn  
My uncle preserved for me  
An old machine  
For fifty-odd years  
To keep it as new  
Has been his dearest dream  
  
I strip away the old debris  
That hides a shining car  
A brilliant Red Barchetta  
From a better vanished time  
We'll fire up the willing engine  
Responding with a roar  
Tires spitting gravel  
I commit my weekly crime  
  
Wind  
In my hair  
Shifting and drifting  
Mechanical music  
Adrenaline surge  
  
Well-oiled leather  
Hot metal and oil  
The scented country air  
  
Sunlight on chrome  
The blur of the landscape  
Every nerve aware  
  
Suddenly ahead of me  
Across the mountainside  
A gleaming alloy air-car  
Shoots towards me two lanes wide  
Oh, I spin around with shrieking tires  
To run the deadly race  
Go screaming through the valley  
As another joins the chase  
  
Ride like the wind  
Straining the limits  
Of machine and man  
Laughing out loud with fear and hope  
I've got a desperate plan  
  
At the one-lane bridge  
I leave the giants stranded  
At the riverside  
Race back to the farm  
To dream with my uncle  
At the fireside

I see red  
And it hurts my head  
Guess it must be something  
That I read  
  
It's the color of your heartbeat  
A rising summer sun  
The battle lost or won  
The flash to fashion  
And the pulse to passion  
Feels red  
Inside my head  
And truth is often bitter  
Left unsaid  
Said red red  
Thinking about the overhead  
The underfed  
  
Couldn't we talk about something else instead?  
  
We've got mars on the horizon  
Says the national midnight star  
(it's true)  
What you believe is what you are  
A pair of dancing shoes  
The soviets are the blues  
The reds  
Under your bed  
Lying in the darkness  
Dead ahead  
  
And the mercury is rising  
Barometer starts to fall  
You know it gets to us all  
The pain that is learning  
And the rain that is burning  
Feel red  
Still...go ahead  
You see black and white  
And I see red  
Red  
(not blue)

All that we can do is just survive  
All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive  
  
Ragged lines of ragged grey  
Skeletons, they shuffle away  
Shouting guards and smoking guns  
Will cut down the unlucky ones  
  
I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed  
A wound that will not heal  
A heart that cannot feel  
Hoping that the horror will recede  
Hoping that tomorrow we'll all be freed  
  
Sickness to insanity  
Prayer to profanity  
Days and weeks and months go by  
Don't feel the hunger  
Too weak to cry  
  
I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate  
Are the liberators here?  
Do I hope or do I fear?  
For my father and my brother, it's too late  
But I must help my mother stand up straight  
  
Are we the last ones left alive?  
Are we the only human beings to survive?

Nature has some new plague  
To run in our streets  
History some new wrinkle  
We are doomed to repeat  
  
Fugitives at the bedroom door  
Lovers pause to find an open store  
Rain is burning on the forest floor  
And the red tide kisses the shore  
  
This is not a false alarm  
This is not a test  
  
Stay out of the sun  
It only burns my skin  
Sky full of poison  
And the atmosphere's too thin  
  
Bless the sun, the rain no more  
River running like an open sore  
Black wind falling to the ocean floor  
And the red tide washes ashore  
  
This is not a false alarm  
This is not a test  
Nowhere we can fly away  
Nowhere we can rest  
The party is disrupted by  
An uninvited guest  
  
Deadline approaches  
For the weary land  
It used to be something  
But we let it run down in our hands  
  
Too late for debate, too bad to ignore  
Quiet rebellion leads to open war  
Bring a sea-change to the factory floor  
As the red tide covers the shore  
  
Now is the time to turn the tide  
Now is the time to fight  
Let us not go gently  
To the endless winter night  
  
Now is the time to make the time  
While hope is still in sight  
Let us not go gently  
To the endless winter night

Well, you can stake that claim,  
Good work is the key to good fortune  
Winners take that praise  
Losers seldom take that blame  
If they don't take that game  
And sometimes the winner takes nothing  
We draw our own designs  
But fortune has to make that frame  
  
We go out in the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
That's the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Why are we here?  
Because we're here  
Roll the bones  
Why does it happen?  
Because it happens  
Roll the bones  
  
Faith is cold as ice,  
Why are little ones born only to suffer  
For the want of immunity  
Or a bowl of rice?  
Well, who would hold a price  
On the heads of the innocent children  
If there's some immortal power  
To control the dice?  
  
We come into the world and take our chances  
Fate is just the weight of circumstances  
That's the way that lady luck dances  
Roll the bones  
  
Jack, relax.  
Get busy with the facts.  
No zodiacs or almanacs,  
No maniacs in polyester slacks.  
Just the facts.  
Gonna kick some Gluteus max.  
It's a parallax, you dig?  
You move around  
The small gets big. It's a rig.  
It's action, reaction,  
Random interaction.  
So who's afraid  
Of a little abstraction?  
Can't get no satisfaction  
From the facts?  
You better run, homeboy,  
A fact's a fact  
From Nome to Rome, boy.  
  
What's the deal? Spin the wheel.  
If the dice are hot, take a shot.  
Play your cards. Show us what you got,  
What you're holding.  
If the cards are cold,  
Don't go folding.  
Lady Luck is golden,  
She favors the bold. That's cold.  
Stop throwing stones,  
The night has a thousand saxophones.  
So get out there and rock,  
And roll the bones.  
Get busy!

Nothing blooms  
In a loveless room  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
Who's the fool  
Where apathy rules?  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If there's no defiance  
It remains insane  
If it's all compliance  
It's a runaway train  
  
Nothing so cruel  
When malevolence rules  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
There is no defence  
Against pointed arrogance  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
It can be surprising  
When you lose the shame  
And the sun starts rising  
Another day to tame  
  
If your heart is aching  
Just remove the shame  
You've got to want it  
  
Give your soul a shaking  
And refuse the blame  
You've got to want it  
  
Who's the fool  
Where apathy rules?  
You've got to want it  
You've got to want it  
  
If you don't want it  
It remains the same  
It's a heart of darkness  
That wants to play that game  
If there's no defiance  
It remains insane  
If it's all compliance  
It's a runaway train

I've stood upon my mountaintop  
And shouted at the sky  
Walked above the pavement  
With my sense amplified  
I get this feeling  
  
All my nerves are naked wires  
Tender to the touch  
Sometimes super-sensitive  
But who can care too much?  
I get this feeling  
  
Scars of pleasure  
Scars of pain  
Atmospheric changes  
Make them sensitive again  
  
Each emotional injury  
Leaves behind its mark  
Sometimes they come tumbling out  
Like shadows in the dark  
I get this feeling  
  
When I think about all I have seen  
And all I'll never see  
When I think about the people  
Who have opened up to me  
I get this feeling  
  
Snow falls deep around my house  
And holds the winter light  
I've heard the lions hunting  
In the Serengeti night  
I get this feeling  
  
Forests turned to factories  
And river, sea, and sky  
Hungry child in the desert  
And the flies that cloud her eyes  
I get this feeling  
  
Pleasure leaves a fingerprint  
As surely as mortal pain  
In memories they resonate  
And echo back again

The way out  
Is the way in  
The way out  
Is the way in...  
  
Out of touch  
With the weather and the wind direction  
With the sunrise  
And the phases of the moon  
Out of touch  
With life in the land of the loving  
With the living night  
And the darkness at high noon  
  
You can never break the chain  
There is never love without pain  
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
Out of sync  
With the rhythm of my own reactions  
With the things that last  
And the things that come apart  
Out of sync  
With love in the land of the living  
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart  
  
There is never love without pain  
Life is a power that remains

When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man  
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a jam  
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone  
You can throw me if you want to 'cause I'm a bone and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!  
  
If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes  
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized  
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way  
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go  
  
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!  
One...Two...Three...Four!

A man can lose his past, in a country like this ? Wandering aimless ?  
Parched and nameless ?  
A Man could lose his way, in a country like this ? Canyons and cactus ?  
Endless and trackless  
  
Searching through grim eternity  
Sculptured by prehistoric sea ?  
  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
Stories that fired my imagination  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
A splendid mirage in this desolation  
Seven Cities of Gold ?  
Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations  
Glitter in the sun like a revelation  
Distant as a comet or a constellation  
  
A man can lose himself, in a country like this  
Rewrite the story ?  
Recapture the glory ?  
A man could lose his life, in a country like this ? Sunblind and friendless ?  
Frozen and endless ?  
The nights grow longer, the father I go  
  
Wake to aching cold, and a deep Sahara of snow ?  
That gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate  
  
A long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate

How many times do you hear it?  
It goes on all day long  
Everyone knows everything  
And no one's ever wrong  
Until later  
  
Who can you believe?  
It's hard to play it safe  
But apart from a few good friends  
We don't take anything on faith  
Until later  
  
Show don't tell  
Show me don't tell me  
You've figured out the score  
Show me don't tell me  
I've heard it all before  
Show me don't tell me  
I don't care what you say  
Show me don't tell me  
  
You can twist perceptions  
Reality won't budge  
You can raise objections  
I will be the judge  
And the jury  
  
I'll give it due reflection  
Watching from the fence  
Give the jury direction  
Based on the evidence  
I, the jury  
  
Show me don't tell me  
Hey, order in the court  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's try to keep it short  
Show me don't tell me  
Enough of your demands  
Show me don't tell me  
Witness take the stand  
Show me don't tell me  
  
Show me don't tell me  
Hey, order in the court  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's try to keep it short  
Show me don't tell me  
I don't care what you say  
Show me don't tell me  
Let's see exhibit A

Meant to tell you  
Tell you from the start  
Meant to show you  
What's inside this shallow heart  
But I could not find the words  
Worthy enough to say  
  
I slipped along the way  
I slipped along the way  
  
Tried to be there  
Be there when you fall  
Tried to make you feel big  
When life makes you feel small  
But I could not find the steps  
Quickly enough to take  
  
I slipped along the way  
I slipped along the way  
  
Want to change things  
Want to clear the air  
Fix the things around us  
So badly in need of repair  
But I might not have the sense  
Sense enough to change  
  
I slipped along the way

Waiting for the winds of change  
To sweep the clouds away  
Waiting for the rainbow's end  
To cast its gold your way  
Countless ways  
You pass the days  
  
Waiting for someone to call  
And turn your world around  
Looking for an answer to  
The question you have found  
Looking for  
An open door  
  
You don't get something for nothing  
You don't get freedom for free  
You won't get wise  
With the sleep still in your eyes  
No matter what your dreams might be  
  
What you own is your own kingdom  
What you do is your own glory  
What you love is your own power  
What you live is your own story  
In your head is the answer  
Let it guide you along  
Let your heart be the anchor  
And the beat of your own song

As the waves crash in  
On the western shore  
The wind blows fierce from the east  
Wave tops torn into flying spindrift, spindrift  
  
As the waves crash in  
On the western shore  
It makes me feel uneasy  
The spray that's torn away  
Is an image of the way I feel  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Ooo-ooo, oh  
  
As sun goes down  
On the western shore  
The wind blows hard from the east  
It whips the sand into a flying spindrift, spindrift  
As the sun goes down  
On the western shore  
It makes me feel uneasy  
In the hot dry rasp of the devil winds  
Who cares what a fool believes?  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Words that fly against the wind and waves  
  
A little closer to you  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me?  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Ooo-ooo, oh  
  
What am I supposed to do?  
Where are the words that will make you see  
What I believe is true?  
  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?

Trust to your instincts  
If it's safely restrained  
Lightning reactions  
Must be carefully trained  
  
Heat of the moment  
Curse of the young  
Spit out your anger  
Don't swallow your tongue  
  
Stick it out  
  
Don't swallow the poison  
Spit it out  
Don't swallow your pride  
Stick it out  
Don't swallow your anger  
Spit it out  
Don't swallow the lies  
  
Natural reflex  
Pendulum swing  
You might be too dizzy  
To do the right thing  
  
Trial under fire  
Ultimate proof  
Moment of crisis  
Don't swallow the truth  
  
Stick it out  
  
Each time we bathe our reactions  
In artificial light  
Each time we alter the focus  
To make the wrong moves seem right  
  
You get so used to deception  
You make yourself a nervous wreck  
You get so used to surrender  
Running back to cover your neck  
  
Stick it out

Trick of the light  
Or just  
A loss of perspective  
Flaw in the grand plan  
Just  
The way it is  
  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It...  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
Lost in an abstract thought  
Dazed and distracted  
Winded yet still I'm caught  
With a fragment of doubt  
Slowed by reflection  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But I've got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirit's released  
But I've got to get there  
  
It's just confusion  
An illusion  
Easily overdone  
Here comes resolution  
Absolution  
  
It's not an illusion  
Not a fiction  
Easily overcome  
Here comes revolution  
Absolution  
  
Trick of the light  
Or just  
Too much perspective  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still

Sprawling on the fringes of the city  
In geometric order  
An insulated border  
In between the bright lights  
And the far unlit unknown  
  
Growing up it all seems so one-sided  
Opinions all provided  
The future pre-decided  
Detached and subdivided  
In the mass production zone  
  
Nowhere is the dreamer  
Or the misfit so alone  
  
Subdivisions  
In the high school halls  
In the shopping malls  
Conform or be cast out  
Subdivisions  
In the basement bars  
In the backs of cars  
Be cool or be cast out  
Any escape might help to smooth  
The unattractive truth  
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe  
The restless dreams of youth  
  
Drawn like moths we drift into the city  
The timeless old attraction  
Cruising for the action  
Lit up like a firefly  
Just to feel the living night  
  
Some will sell their dreams for small desires  
Or lose the race to rats  
Get caught in ticking traps  
And start to dream of somewhere  
To relax their restless flight  
  
Somewhere out of a memory  
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

Well, I'm gonna raise a fuss  
I'm gonna raise a holler  
About a working all summer  
Just to try to earn a dollar  
Well, time I called my baby  
Try to get a date  
My boss says, no dice son  
You gotta work late  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
  
Oh, well my Mom and Poppa told me, son  
You gotta make some money  
If you want to use the car  
To go ridin' next Sunday  
Well I didn't go to work  
Told the boss I was sick  
Well you can't use the car  
Cause you didn't work a lick  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
  
I'm gonna take two weeks  
Gonna have a fine vacation  
I'm gonna take my problem  
To the United Nations  
Well I called my congressman  
And he said, whoa  
I'd like to help you son  
But you're too young to vote  
Sometimes I wonder  
What I'm a gonna do  
But there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues

Packaged like a rebel or a hero  
Target mass appeal  
To make an audience feel  
He really means it  
  
Package the illusion of persona  
Careful to conceal  
The fact that she's only too real  
She's got to screen it  
  
Hit you in a soft place  
A melody so sweet  
A strong and simple beat  
That you can dance to  
  
Watch his every move

Orchestrate illusions  
Superconductor

Hoping you'll believe  
Designing to deceive  
That's entertainment  
  
He can put a target on the market  
Bask in your applause  
Reality withdraws  
Now he believes it  
  
The role becomes the actor  
She's addicted to applause  
The stage a world because  
She never leaves it  
  
Hit you in a soft place  
With sentimental ease  
They know the fantasies  
That you romance to  
  
Watch her every move

Superconductor

That's entertainment...

High on the sacred mountain  
Up the seven thousand stairs  
In the golden light of autumn  
There was magic in the air  
  
Clouds surrounded the summit  
The wind blew strong and cold  
Among the silent temples  
And the writing carved in gold  
Somewhere in my instincts  
The primitive took hold  
  
I stood at the top of the mountain  
And China sang to me  
In the peaceful haze of harvest time  
A song of eternity  
  
If you raise your hands to heaven  
You will live a hundred years  
I stood there like a mystic  
Lost in the atmosphere  
  
The clouds were suddenly parted  
For a moment I could see  
The patterns of the landscape  
Reaching to the eastern sea  
I looked upon a presence  
Spanning forty centuries  
  
I thought of time and distance  
The hardships of history  
I heard the hope and the hunger  
When China sang to me

Well, I'm looking at you  
And I'm wondering what you're gonna do  
Looks like you got no friends  
No one to stick with you till the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you think you're all right,  
And now you're lonely every night  
Well, you need a friend  
Someone on whom you can always depend  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you need some advice  
Well, let me put it to you nice  
I said you need a friend  
Someone who'll stick with you to the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good

All of the seasons  
And all of the days  
All of the reasons  
Why I've felt this way  
So long  
So long  
  
Then lost in that feeling  
I looked in your eyes  
I noticed emotion  
And that you had cried  
For me  
I can see  
  
What would touch me deeper  
Tears that fall from eyes  
That only cry?  
Would it touch you deeper  
Than tears that fall from eyes  
That know why?  
  
A lifetime of questions  
Tears on your cheek  
I tasted the answers  
And my body was weak  
For you  
The truth

I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth  
Like the Chinese call the country of their birth  
We all figure that our homes are set above  
Other people than the ones we know and love  
In every place with a name  
They play the same territorial game  
Hiding behind the lines  
Sending up warning signs  
  
The whole wide world  
An endless universe  
Yet we keep looking through  
The eyeglass in reverse  
Don't feed the people  
But we feed the machines  
Can't really feel  
What international means  
In different circles  
We keep holding our ground  
Indifferent circles  
We keep spinning round and round  
  
We see so many tribes -- overrun and undermined  
While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind  
Better people -- better food -- and better beer  
Why move around the world when Eden was so near?  
The bosses get talking so tough  
And if that wasn't evil enough  
We get the drunken and passionate pride  
Of the citizens along for the ride  
  
They shoot without shame  
In the name of a piece of dirt  
For a change of accent  
Or the color of your shirt  
Better the pride that resides  
In a citizen of the world  
Than the pride that divides  
When a colorful rag is unfurled

[Chorus:]  
Here we go, vertigo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
Here we go, in slo-mo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
  
Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen  
Camera curves over caved-in cop cars  
Bleacher-creatures, would-be desperados  
Clutch at plausible deniability  
Don't touch that dial,  
We're in denial  
Until the showcase trial on TV  
  
Some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news  
Miles of yellow tape, silhouetted chalk lines  
Tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs  
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity  
Don't change that station  
It's Gangster Nation  
Now crime's in syndication on TV  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some kind of drama live on satellite  
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom  
Nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets  
Clutching at the straws of respectability  
Can't do the time?  
Don't do the crime  
And wind up in the perp. walk on TV

The angels' share  
The secrets of their universe  
It's seldom fair  
Partly blessing, partly curse  
  
All those things we cannot know  
We dream, we hypothesize  
Maybe these are secrets shared by those  
Watching from the sky  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face  
  
The angels' share  
All the human mysteries  
There is no prayer  
To the thieves of celestial history  
  
The myth of perfect reason  
We're forgotten at birth  
It's a kind of clandestine conspiracy  
A seraphin joke of eternity  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face  
  
All those things we cannot know  
We dream, we hypothesize  
Maybe these are secrets shared by those  
Watching from the side  
  
If we are only members of the human race  
No supernatural beings from a supernatural place  
If you can't solve the problem Come and tell me to my face

Big money goes around the world  
Big money underground  
Big money got a mighty voice  
Big money make no sound  
Big money pull a million strings  
Big money hold the prize  
Big money weave a mighty web  
Big money draw the flies  
  
Sometimes pushing people around  
Sometimes pulling out the rug  
Sometimes pushing all the buttons  
Sometimes pulling out the plug  
It's the power and the glory  
It's a war in paradise  
It's a Cinderella story  
On a tumble of the dice  
  
Big money goes around the world  
Big money take a cruise  
Big money leave a mighty wake  
Big money leave a bruise  
Big money make a million dreams  
Big money spin big deals  
Big money make a mighty head  
Big money spin big wheels  
  
Sometimes building ivory towers  
Sometimes knocking castles down  
Sometimes building you a stairway  
Lock you underground  
It's that old-time religion  
It's the kingdom they would rule  
It's the fool on television  
Getting paid to play the fool  
  
Big money goes around the world  
Big money give and take  
Big money done a power of good  
Big money make mistakes  
Big money got a heavy hand  
Big money take control  
Big money got a mean streak  
Big money got no soul...

Well, I was only a kid, didn't know enough to be afraid  
Playing the game, but not the way the big boys played  
Nothing to lose, maybe I had something to trade  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well, I was only a kid, on a holy crusade  
I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made  
Take no chances on paradise delayed  
So I do a slow fade  
  
Playing for time  
Don't want to wait for heaven  
Looking for love  
For an angel to forgive my sins  
Playing with fire  
Chasing something new to believe in  
Looking for love  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance  
Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance  
I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance  
Going for broke, going for another chance  
Hoping for heaven, hoping for a fine romance  
If I do the right dance  
  
Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith  
Taking your chances you'll have the right answers  
When the final judgment begins  
  
Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate  
Life redirected in ways unexpected  
Sometimes the odd number wins  
The way the big wheel spins

One humanoid escapee  
One android on the run  
Seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun  
  
Trying to change its program  
Trying to change the mode -- crack the code  
Images conflicting into data overload  
  
[Chorus]  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one  
SOS  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one  
In distress  
One-zero-zero-one-zero-zero  
  
Memory banks unloading  
Bytes break into bits  
Unit One's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits  
  
Guidance systems break down  
A struggle to exist  
To resist  
A pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It replays each of the days  
A hundred years of routines  
Bows its head and prays  
To the mother of all machines

In this one of many possible worlds, all for the best, or some bizarre test?  
It is what it is - and whatever  
Time is still the infinite jest  
  
The arrow files when you dream, the hours tick away - the cells tick away  
The Watchmaker keeps to his schemes  
The hours tick away - they tick away  
  
The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect  
So hard to earn, so easily burned  
In the fullness of time  
A garden to nurture and protect  
  
In the rise and the set of the sun  
'Til the stars go spinning - spinning 'round the night  
It is what it is - and forever  
Each moment a memory in flight  
  
The arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away - the cells tick away  
The Watchmaker has time up his sleeve  
The hours tick away - they tick away  
  
The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect  
The way you live, the gifts that you give  
In the fullness of time  
It's the only return that you expect  
  
The future disappears into memory  
With only a moment between  
Forever dwells in that moment  
Hope is what remains to be seen

Proud swagger out of the schoolyard  
Waiting for the world's applause  
Rebel without a conscience  
Martyr without a cause  
  
Static on your frequency  
Electrical storm in your veins  
Raging at unreachable glory  
Straining at invisible chains  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Can't face life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be  
  
All of us get lost in the darkness  
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars  
All of us do time in the gutter  
Dreamers turn to look at the cars  
Turn around and turn around and turn around  
Turn around and walk the razor's edge  
Don't turn your back  
And slam the door on me  
  
It's not as if this barricade  
Blocks the only road  
It's not as if you're all alone  
In wanting to explode  
  
Someone set a bad example  
Made surrender seem all right  
The act of a noble warrior  
Who lost the will to fight  
  
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge  
Staring down into a heartless sea  
Done with life on a razor's edge  
Nothings what you thought it would be  
  
No hero in your tragedy  
No daring in your escape  
No salutes for your surrender  
Nothing noble in your fate  
Christ, what have you done?

Love is born with lightning bolts  
Electro-magnetic force  
Burning skin and fireworks  
A storm on a raging course  
  
Like a force of nature,  
Love can fade with the stars at dawn  
Sometimes it takes all your strength  
Just to keep holding on  
At the speed of love  
A radiance that travels  
At the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
Love is born with solar flares  
From two magnetic poles  
It moves towards a higher plane  
Where two halves make two wholes  
  
Like a force of nature,  
Love shines in many forms  
One night we are bathed in light  
One day carried away in the storms  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
We don't have to talk  
We don't even have to touch  
I can feel your presence  
In the silence that we share  
Got to keep moving  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
Got to keep on shining  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you

Begin the day  
With a friendly voice  
A companion, unobtrusive  
Plays that song that's so elusive  
And the magic music makes your morning mood  
  
Off on your way  
Hit the open road  
There is magic at your fingers  
For the spirit ever lingers  
Undemanding contact  
In your happy solitude  
  
Invisible airwaves  
Crackle with life  
Bright antennae bristle  
With the energy  
Emotional feedback  
On a timeless wavelength  
Bearing a gift beyond price,  
Almost free  
  
All this machinery  
Making modern music  
Can still be open-hearted  
Not so coldly charted  
It's really just a question  
Of your honesty  
  
One likes to believe  
In the freedom of music  
But glittering prizes  
And endless compromises  
Shatter the illusion  
Of integrity  
  
For the words of the profits  
Were written on the studio wall,  
Concert hall,  
Echoes with the sounds, of salesmen

Like the fly on the wheel who says  
'What a lot of dust we're raising'  
Are you under the illusion  
That you're part of this scheme?  
Seems like a lifetime ago  
You could look with pride  
On your world of dreams  
What is the meaning of this?  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do?  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said  
And the stars look down  
Like the rat in a maze who says  
'Watch me choose my own direction'  
Are you under the illusion  
The path is winding your way?  
Are you surprised by confusion  
When it leads you astray?  
Have you lived a lifetime today...  
Or do you feel like you just got carried away?  
What is the meaning of this?  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do?  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said?  
And the stars look down  
Something you'd like me to do?  
And the stars look down

And the meek shall inherit the earth...  
  
We've taken care of everything  
The words you read, the songs you sing  
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes  
It's one for all, all for one  
We work together, common sons  
Never need to wonder how or why  
  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
Our great computers  
Fill the hallowed halls  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
All the gifts of life  
Are held within our walls  
  
Look around this world we made  
Equality of stock in trade  
Come and join the brotherhood of man  
Oh what a nice contented world  
Let the banners be unfurled  
Hold the red star proudly high in hand  
  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
Our great computers  
Fill the hallowed halls  
We are the priests  
Of the Temples of Syrinx  
All the gifts of life  
Are held within our walls

There is unrest in the forest  
There is trouble with the trees  
For the Maples want more sunlight  
And the Oaks ignore their pleas  
  
The trouble with the maples  
(And they're quite convinced they're right)  
They say the oaks are just too lofty  
And they grab up all the light  
But the oaks can't help their feelings  
If they like the way they're made  
And they wonder why the maples  
Can't be happy in their shade?  
  
There is trouble in the forest  
And the creatures all have fled  
As the maples scream 'Oppression!'  
And the oaks, just shake their heads  
  
So the maples formed a union  
And demanded equal rights  
'The oaks are just too greedy  
We will make them give us light'  
Now there's no more oak oppression  
For they passed a noble law  
And the trees are all kept equal  
By hatchet,  
Axe,  
And saw

A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you  
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you  
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies  
Take it off, he's got three eyes  
Truth is false and logic lost  
Now the fourth dimension is crossed  
  
You have entered the Twilight Zone  
Beyond this world strange things are known  
Use the key, unlock the door  
See what your fate might have in store  
Come explore your dreams' creation  
Enter this world of imagination  
  
You wake up lost in an empty town  
Wondering why no one else is around  
Look up to see a giant boy  
You've just become his brand new toy  
No escape, no place to hide  
Here where time and space collide

The breaker's war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of a hurricane,  
Oh, we struggle in vain  
A hellish night, a ghostly light,  
Appears through the driving rain,  
Salvation in the human chain  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you  
  
Driven to the ground,  
With that awful sound  
Drowned by the cheer from the shore,  
Oh, we wonder what for  
  
The people swarm,  
through the darkening storm,  
Gather everything they can score,  
Turn their backs when there's no more  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew,  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know that sometimes the truth is contrary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
The brink of war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of an icy grave,  
In the teeth of an icy grave  
  
Whoah, the human chain leaves a bloody stain,  
Washed away in the pounding waves,  
Washed away in the pounding waves  
  
All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
you thought you knew,  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry,  
striking out like a bull from a balloon,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew

Time and motion  
Wind and sun and rain  
Days connect like boxcars in a train  
  
Fill them up with precious cargo  
Squeeze in all that you can find  
Spontaneous elation  
And the long-enduring kind  
  
Time and motion  
Flesh and blood and fire  
Lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire  
  
Spin a thread of precious contact  
Squeeze in all that you can find  
Spontaneous relations  
And the long-enduring kind  
  
The mighty ocean  
Dances with the moon  
The silent forest  
Echoes with the loon  
  
Time and motion  
Live and love and dream  
Eyes connect like interstellar beams  
  
Superman in super nature  
Needs all the comfort he can find  
Spontaneous emotion  
And the long enduring kind

I turn my back to the wind  
To catch my breath  
Before I start off again  
Driven on without a moment to spend  
To pass an evening  
With a drink and a friend.  
  
I let my skin get too thin  
I'd like to pause  
No matter what I pretend  
Like some pilgrim who learns to transcend  
Learns to live as if each step was the end.  
  
Time stand still  
I'm not looking back  
But I want to look around me now  
See more of the people  
And the places that surround me now.  
  
Freeze this moment  
A little bit longer  
Make each sensation  
A little bit stronger  
Experience slips away.  
  
I turn my face to the sun  
Close my eyes  
Let my defenses down  
All those wounds  
That I can't get unwound.  
  
I let my past go too fast  
No time to pause  
If I could slow it all down  
Like some captain  
Whose ship runs aground  
I can wait until the tide  
Comes around.  
  
Make each impression  
A little bit stronger  
Freeze this motion  
A little bit longer  
The innocence slips away.  
  
Summer's going fast  
Nights growing colder  
Children growing up  
Old friends growing older  
Experience slips away.

A modern day warrior  
Mean, mean stride  
Today's Tom Sawyer  
Mean, mean pride  
  
Though his mind is not for rent  
Don't put him down as arrogant  
His reserve a quiet defense  
Riding out the day's events  
The river  
  
What you say about his company  
Is what you say about society  
Catch the mist, catch the myth  
Catch the mystery, catch the drift  
  
The world is, the world is  
Love and life are deep  
Maybe as his skies are wide  
  
Today's Tom Sawyer  
He gets high on you  
And the space he invades  
He gets by on you  
  
No, his mind is not for rent  
To any God or government  
Always hopeful yet discontent  
He knows changes aren't permanent  
But change is  
  
What you say about his company  
Is what you say about society  
Catch the witness, catch the wit  
Catch the spirit, catch the spit  
  
The world is, the world is  
Love and life are deep  
Maybe as his eyes are wide  
  
Exit the warrior  
Today's Tom Sawyer  
He gets by on you  
And the energy you trade  
He gets right on to the friction of the day

I've got twelve disciples and a Buddha smile  
The Garden of Allah, Viking Valhalla  
A miracle once in a while  
  
I've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul  
Vishnu and Gaea Aztec and Maya  
Dance around my totem pole  
  
I believe in what I see  
I believe in what I hear  
I believe that what I'm feeling  
Changes how the world appears  
  
Angels and demons dancing in my head  
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed  
Media messiahs preying on my fears  
Pop culture prophets playing in my ears  
  
I've got celestial mechanics  
To synchronize my stars  
Seasonal migrations daily variations  
World of the unlikely and bizarre  
  
I've got idols and icons, unspoken holy vows  
Thoughts to keep well-hidden  
Sacred and forbidden  
Free to browse among the holy cows  
  
That's why I believe  
  
Angels and demons inside of me  
Saviors and Satan's all around me  
  
Sweet chariot, swing low, coming for me

Nothing can survive in a vacuum  
No one can exists all alone  
We pretend things only happen to strangers  
We've all got problems of our own  
  
It's enough to learn  
To share our pleasures  
We can't sooth pain with sympathy  
All that we can do is be reminded  
We shake our heads at the tragedy  
  
Every day we're standing  
In a time capsule  
Racing down a river from the past  
Every day we're standing  
In a wind tunnel  
Facing down the future coming fast  
  
It's just the age  
It's just a stage --  
We disengage --  
We turn the page...  
  
Looking at  
The long-range forecast  
Catching all the names in the news  
Checking out  
The state of the nation  
Learning the environmental blues  
  
Truth is after all a moving target  
Hairs to split,  
And pieces that don't fit How can anybody be enlightened?  
Truth is after all so poorly lit

Stratospheric traces of our transitory flight  
Trails of condensation held  
In narrow paths of white  
The sun is turning black  
The world is turning gray  
All the stars fade from the night  
The oceans drain away  
  
Horizon to horizon  
Memory written on the wind  
Fading away, like an hourglass, grain by grain  
Swept away like voices in a hurricane  
  
In a vapor trail  
  
Atmospheric phases make the transitory last  
Vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past  
Silence all the songbirds  
Stilled by the killing frost  
Forests burn to ashes  
Everything is lost  
  
Washed away like footprints in the rain  
  
In a vapor trail

Girl before the mirror  
Appraises her disguise  
Child become a mother  
Tries to fix her eyes  
No more of his excuses  
It has to be today  
She can keep her fantasy  
If she can get away  
  
Paint her name on a one-way street  
Painted cheeks with angry heat  
Wounded pride on painted eyes  
Paint the night with battle cries  
  
All puffed up with vanity  
We see what we want to see  
To the beautiful and the wise  
The mirror always lies  
  
Boy before the mirror  
Checks his camouflage  
Polishes his armor  
And the charger in the garage  
No more lame excuses  
It has to be tonight  
He can take the princess  
If he can take the fight  
  
Pound the drums with martial beat  
Pound the streets with marching feet  
Wounded pride, distorted eyes  
Paint the night with battle cries  
  
All puffed up with vanity  
We see what we want to see  
To the powerful and the wise  
The mirror always lies  
  
Boys and girls together  
Mistake conceit for pride  
Ambition for illusion  
Dreams for self-delusion  
Girls and boys together  
See what it is we lack  
Boys and girls together  
Let's paint the mirror black  
Paint it black

How many times  
Do we tire of all the little battles  
Threaten to call it quits  
Tempted to cut and run?  
How many times  
Do we weather out the stormy evenings  
Long to slam the front door  
Drive away into the setting sun?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Keep going on till dawn  
How many times must another line be drawn?  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we chaff against the repetition  
Straining against the faith  
Measured out in coffee breaks?  
How many times  
Do we swallow our ambition  
Long to give up the same old way  
Find another road to take?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep holding on so long  
'Cause there's a chance that we might not be so wrong  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we wonder if it's even worth it?  
There's got to be some other way  
Way to get me through the day  
  
[Chorus x2]

Well, I see you standin' there  
With your finger in the air  
Ev'rything we do  
You want to leave it up to you  
  
Who do you think you are?  
You think you are a star  
Try'n' to run the town  
Always try'n' to put us down  
  
Well, you think that you're right  
You think you're out of sight  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?  
  
Well, you say you've been try'n'  
You know that you're ly'n'  
I think you need some groovin'  
Who do you think you're foolin' now?  
  
Well, you better start changin'  
You life needs rearrangin'  
You better do some talkin'  
Or you better do some walkin' now  
  
Yeah, you think that you're right  
You think you're out of sight  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?  
  
I know what you're doing,  
All that you been doin' wrong  
I don't know what you're feelin'  
Oh, but you been feelin' long  
  
Well, you think that you're right  
Tell me something, mister  
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?

Draw a line  
Strong and clear  
Make it bend to your will  
All the lines  
In a face  
So hard to make stand still  
  
'Til the flaws disappear  
'Til what's wrong disappears  
'Til all that's wrong will  
Disappear  
  
Working at perfekt  
Got me down on my knees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
  
All the colours of the day  
Have somehow disappeared  
All the colours of the universe  
Are closer than they appear  
  
Are not as close as they appear  
Are not as close as they appear  
Not as close as they appear  
  
Nothing is perfekt  
Certainly not me  
Success to failure  
Is just a matter of degrees  
Working at perfekt  
Got me down on my knees  
  
But when it's right  
It's right as rain  
And when it's right  
There is no pain  
And when it's right  
You start again  
  
Working at perfekt  
Got you down on your knees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees  
Success to failure  
Just a matter of degrees

I get up at seven, yeah  
And I go to work at nine  
I got no time for livin'  
Yes, I'm workin' all the time  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess that's why they call me  
They call me the workin' man  
  
They call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am  
  
I get home at five o'clock  
And I take myself out a nice, cold beer  
Always seem to be wond'rin'  
Why there's nothin' goin' down here  
  
It seems to me  
I could live my life  
A lot better than I think I am  
I guess that's why they call me  
They call me the workin' man  
  
They call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am  
  
Well they call me the workin' man  
I guess that's what I am
