[P. Diddy)  
Uhh, yeah, you know what it is  
  
[Black Rob]  
Hey , back on the scene  
Ain't nuthin' changed  
Still doin' wild things  
Whippin' something mean  
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off  
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour  
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure  
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor  
Ain't nobody botherin' you  
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you  
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few  
Illegal aliens  
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans  
The top story, evening news  
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you  
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas, Duke is real  
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers  
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs  
That's cause my dogs ain't there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The more hits we make, more money to burn  
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned  
It don't matter who's hot, who's out  
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, I'm fresh off the plane  
Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain  
M-I-A  
Dom P., palm trees, 9O degrees  
Arm freeze, mom please, ain't nothin' but cheese  
Caribbean Sea, Malibu breeze  
Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens  
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please  
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans  
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me  
Pop bottles, models, be all on me  
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be  
Front on me and see where you all gon' be  
Six feet deep  
When the heat seek, niggas be misty  
From 155th to 11Oth Street  
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
See this is the part I like right here  
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor  
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses  
See man, hold on, I need to break it down  
Yeah  
One time like this  
  
Now would you clap your hands  
Your hands you clap  
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped  
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that  
But you never see me standing on the corner like that  
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted  
Never boosted, never shoplifted  
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'  
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting  
I rock Sean John everyday  
Boutiques from France to the USA  
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent  
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent  
Cause, I'm droppin' hits  
Daily  
You burn me?  
Really?  
Think Bad Boy been played a million times  
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes  
Damn, we still payed!  
  
We still payed!  
Yeah, we got it made!  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'  
We champagne poppin'  
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'  
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'  
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'  
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in  
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in  
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in  
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun  
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him  
Your man got a lot to learn  
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned  
One day you goin' actually learn  
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn  
I stay on my J-O-be  
Nigga, me, P. Diddy, B. are-O-be  
  
[P. Diddy]  
The fam baby, Bad Boy  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
Yeah, I want to dedicate this to everybody that been down with us  
From day one  
Shakin' them asses on the dance floor  
That's all we're tryin' to do  
Mo' money, no mo' problems  
2OO1, Bad Boy forever

[Puffy] (Mario)  
I've seen a lot of things in my life  
Alot of ups and downs  
Made a lot of mistakes  
No matter what, you've always been by my side  
You've always been my best friend  
You're the love of my life (Oh)  
You're everything to me (Oh)  
You never left my side (You're my best friend)  
I love you so much (Yes, you are)  
You're my best friend  
  
[Puffy]  
Since the beginning of time  
All you did was bless men  
Too young to understand but now you my best friend  
How could they doubt you, never think about you  
Don't they know nothing's possible without you  
  
Faith without fear that's how they raised me  
Words of man kill but never phase me  
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me  
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?  
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living  
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in  
Gotta be more than just to lust women  
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen  
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due  
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew  
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through  
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord  
  
1 - [Mario Winans]  
Lord, you mean the world to me  
Before I was born you chose me  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Even catch me when I'm falling  
You're the closest one to me  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole wide world to see  
That we've always been and we'll always be  
Best friends  
  
[Puffy]  
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far  
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star  
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight  
Then give it to you and let it shine bright  
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth  
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit  
Can't you see that He spread love for you  
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you  
Willies with mac millies know how you get down  
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town  
Just remember when you pray, God is love  
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs  
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him  
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him  
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him  
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Puffy]  
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed  
Been two and a half years since my world crashed  
I needed help, God gave me the power  
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour  
Looked me in the eyes and ask "What you doing unhappy?"  
"Don't you know why I'm here?" and started shooting at me  
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out  
Never wavered once, gave me no way out  
Your time to die, don't even stress the date  
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take  
I told him "I'm too much blessed with faith"  
"And living for Christ" and then he said "Manifest the great"  
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering  
Ground started to shake, everything trembling  
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands  
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on  
  
Repeat 1 While:  
  
[Puffy]  
You mean everything to me  
You've been with me from day one  
Even when I thought nobody was there  
You were there  
You're my best friend  
I love you like no other  
There is no feeling like this in the world  
If you can relate to what I'm feeling  
Put your hands in the air for me  
Let me see you  
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me  
Clap your hands, come on  
Thank you Jesus  
You always hear me when I'm calling  
Always catch me when I fall, yeah  
I surrender all to thee  
I want the whole world to see  
That you've always been, you'll always be  
My best friend  
I love you Jesus  
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses  
As I forgive those who trespass against me  
Thank you

[G. Dep]  
Yeah...  
Yeah, me and my man's and them  
We gon' blast off  
Bad Boy nigga, and we don't stop  
Come on to the top, blast off  
Yeah, yo  
  
Aiyyo, I take it up top for my peeps  
Cracks in they Jeeps, don't sleep till they 6 feet deep  
No 'lax' in my tracks they potent  
Fuck homicide, I'ma ride, keep smokin'  
I keep smokin' till the bullshit filter  
Like cigarettes, Dep came through, killed ya  
When I swerve hit nerves  
Number 1 contenders, I put 'em on injured reserve  
And everybody know what's golden, matter of fact platinum,  
?mores trap to mold in?  
Once I explode and I, burn up the road and  
Cruise around the globe, the cops thinkin' it's stolen  
Understand, the world's in my hand  
G. Dep in this scam, no stunt  
Bitch play the front  
And I'ma show you how to lay back do a buck while you puff on a sac  
Cause yo, I'm about to blast off -  
  
Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case  
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off  
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint  
Nigga, I'ma blast off  
Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo  
Nigga, I'ma blast off  
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone  
  
[Mark Curry]  
Yo, yo, uh  
Who's a nigga harder than me?  
On the boats, make it known how the slaughterin' be  
Damn, Curry ain't the shit? Put the name in your mouth  
Got it different? You ain't on what you talkin' about  
Bustin' off in her mouth, catch me  
I'm feelin' for whoever test me, pity for whoever second guess me  
Know how to ?manhand'? it's real as it get  
Feelin' my shit, straight through the cealin' with this  
Bet your block love it, find me only with the grimy  
Gutters of the street where my mind be  
Play the game, get you a 'zil'  
Forever, put you until, it fit me to kill  
Heat, got it with me still  
Flip the game over, see me, we be, untouched  
Out like your motherfuckin' guns bust, BLAOW  
Sure shot, hit again, spit it grim, anytime, anyplace  
Bitch, I'm about to-  
  
[G. Dep]  
Blast off, yo I get it poppin'  
When I rock, yo it's non-stoppin'  
Yo, I'm about to blast off  
See me at the show, when I rock everybody know  
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off  
Bottles gon' pop, cause when I rock, everybody rock  
Aiyyo, I'm about to blast off  
Straight to the top, cause everybody know this is hot  
  
[Loon]  
Aiyyo son, I'm about to blast off, like an astronaut  
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga blast the glock  
Niggas don't wanna see a nigga flash the rocks  
And pop up in the flashy drop - motherfuckers  
Niggas know me, Loon's a gunslinger  
Fuck fightin' a nigga, I'm usin' one finger  
Catch one of you rap cats in the 'Humdinger'  
Some niggas get shot, live and become singers  
Expect to die, I'd rather sit in a chair, electrified  
Than to stand here and testify  
But, other than that though, we never get caught  
We George Jefferson walk out of federal court  
We gettin' bread in New York, ain't better the sport  
So whatever you thought, you can use whatever support  
But, I think it's best you go 'head and just walk  
Or have the cops find traces of lead in your corpse  
Yo, I'm about to-  
  
[G. Dep]  
Blast off-  
Straight to the chase, cause everybody know what's the case  
Aiyyo, I'ma about to blast off  
Straight to the point, aiyyo, yo, light another joint  
Nigga, I'ma blast off  
Right to the top, aiyyo, no, I ain't gon stop yo  
Nigga, I'ma blast off  
Straight to the dome, you entered in the Bad Boy zone

Sometimes I try to figure out  
Just why  
Why you are the way you are  
You... You make it so hard for me to love you  
  
Hold up now  
Listen... I ain't gonna try to sit here and say I'm perfect  
You know  
I mean... I'm tryin' to do the best I can  
With my time here on earth  
You know... You know my mother  
Mama always say that I'd be somebody  
You know  
So you know, I figured that I might as well be great  
You know  
I mean, it's hard to understand how I am  
Some shit you just don't really need to be  
Mother fuckin' understanding though  
I mean God put me here for a reason  
And I'm here to let these mother fuckers know  
  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I'll show you the way  
  
A lot of people don't understand  
They'll understand one day though  
  
I just like to make people feel good  
I really feel I can do anything  
I really truly believe in God that way  
So much that I believe in myself  
I guess I'm kinda like my father  
You know, Who had a relentless spirit  
You know  
He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal  
You now nowadays  
A lot of these mother fuckers don't understand that  
They gonna have to handle it  
Yeah, you feel me  
  
I've come to claim my place  
And I ain't gonna stop  
I ain't gonna never stop  
I thank y'all for ridin' with me  
Thank y'all for rockin' with me  
Through this journey  
It's just begun  
And I wanna take the time to say  
Thank you  
  
Listen to everything he says  
I've come to claim my place  
  
I truly appreciate you  
And I love ya  
Ain't nothin' else to say

Got hits go back like Juice n Gin, yeah

Don't you stop it, don't you stop what you're doing  
You don't really wanna stop

You don't really wanna stop  
Eh eh  
  
Verse one: puff daddy  
  
Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon  
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars  
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours  
If it's not it's yours, we on the job  
Everybody eatin, everybody involved  
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap  
Bad boy stop what's the chance of that?  
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks  
And we don't have to answer to jack  
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers  
Pull up at the party, eight straight hummers  
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders  
Pop corks, we be the toast of new york  
And out west, we want y'all to understand  
All we wanna do is make you dance  
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot  
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse two: lil' kim  
  
When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough  
Fuck domino's, strictly dice  
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price  
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke  
While my pockets on re-up  
Y'all niggaz shit on e, what a pi-ty  
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me  
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple  
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies  
Drive a ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow  
He know, anything I touch I blow  
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow  
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a lexus too  
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you  
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone  
Lil' kim and puff daddy keep keepin it on  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse three: puff daddy  
  
Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road  
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow  
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home  
On the six-four, sittin on chrome  
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall  
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off  
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us  
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us  
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious  
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon  
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch  
Every single region, we own blocks  
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better  
Every single I drop, at least two are better  
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot  
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything we make is hot  
Thought I told you that we never stop  
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh  
Keep risin to the top, yeahhh  
(repeat above four lines over another chorus to fade)

Somebody said they saw you  
The person you were kissin' wasn't me  
And I would never ask you  
I just kept it to myself  
  
I don't wanna know  
If your playin' me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if your creepin'  
Please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
  
I think about it when I hold you  
When lookin' in your eyes I can't believe  
I don't need to know the truth  
Baby keep it to yourself  
  
I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin'  
Please don't let it show  
Oh baby I don't wanna know  
  
Does he touch you better then me  
Does he watch ya fall asleep  
Does he show you love this way  
And the things you do to me  
If your better off that way  
Baby all that I can say  
Is go on and do your thing and don't come back to me  
  
P diddy  
  
I know where your whereabouts  
Or how your movin'  
I know when you in the house  
Or when your cruising  
Its been proven  
My love you abusing  
I can't understand how a man got you chosen  
Undecided, I came and provided my undivided  
But you came and denied it  
Don't even try it  
I know when you lying  
Don't even do that  
I know why you crying  
I'm not applyin' no pressure  
Just wanna let you know  
That I don't wanna let you go  
And I don't wanna let you leave  
Can't say I didn't let you breathe  
Gave you extra cheese  
Put you in the S. You. V.  
You wanted ice so I made you freeze  
Made you hot like the west indies  
Now its time you invest in me  
Cause if not then it's best you leave  
Holla  
  
I don't wanna know  
If you're playin' me  
Keep it on the low  
Cause my heart can't take it anymore  
And if you're creepin'  
Please don't let it show  
Oh baby  
X3

Verse One: Demon  
My click is in it til it's over never sober  
Bustin over layin Elaine with the cane and the Rover  
Pray to Jehovah for the nigga with the Ruger  
The young Don the Heron mover  
You know my hustle I bring the fo' pound to the tussle  
Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle  
So chill 'causeo let me blow for my niggaz  
Runnin round get down like motherfuckin gorillas  
Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop  
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered  
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money  
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny  
Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give  
But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po  
Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa  
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same  
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the cane  
Papi know my face, so he don't expect it  
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it  
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him  
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him  
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept  
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth  
It's the D to the E, M to the O N  
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin  
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap  
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat  
Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine  
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine  
Chorus: Puff Daddy  
I be, that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit  
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit  
That nigga that you can't get along wit  
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit  
That nigga that you see in the videos  
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes  
That nigga that'll die for his main man  
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan  
Verse Two: Jadakiss  
Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?  
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get  
I'm only sizin you niggaz from the waist up  
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup  
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder  
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup  
Nobody badder, since the, baby Finster  
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter  
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips  
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip  
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip  
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb  
Blown the hall pearl wide bill long gone  
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?  
Worldwide while you simply thought where you lived at  
Chorus  
Verse Three: Sheek  
You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car  
Tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are  
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us  
Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish  
Bad Boys, and we all eat together  
When it go down, then we draw heat together  
Since I made the connection with the big man  
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land  
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped  
And what you call weight, I know cats who sniff that  
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?  
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin  
Anything to do with money you can count J in  
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin  
Cream of the crop, and we ain't never gonna stop  
Hittin you in your head with that butter from The Lox  
Chorus (fades)

Sometimes I don't think you motherfuckers  
Understand where I'm coming from  
Where I'm tryin' to get to  
Sometimes I hear voices  
I can't see it, can you see it?  
Turn the lights on  
Check this out  
  
Make money's the motto, staying desparados  
New chance of hitting the lotto  
Let's take it to the neck wit this bottle  
Get in the Eldorado  
And break from this bitch at full throttle  
You like fuckin' fashion models?  
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks  
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats  
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles  
And leave a nigga hurting on the block  
Sounding like when you gargle  
Them hero niggas that plot  
Them zero niggas get got  
And never get a chance to bust shot  
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot  
Then I'm on the run wit a gun smoking hot  
All around the world's where I go  
Places that only I know  
Goodfella not gunshotto  
And I'm tellin' niggas, make money's the motto  
Fuck the niggas that squable  
And I hit them back and fourteen hollow, take that  
  
I hear voices inside  
And I see crime, don't die  
And I need changes  
Oh, please, please, please  
Don't go Don't go  
  
I'm just trying to get my money, right  
Don't fuck wit my money  
I won't fuck wit your money  
If you fuck with my money  
I make you like one of them presidents  
Feel me?  
  
Representing my money for the love of my money  
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy  
Now don't miss it, if I catch them coming for me  
When I try to tell a dummy  
You took it like I was saying something funny  
Took it like my word wasn't shit, like I wasn't legit'  
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget  
That's something I'll never permit  
When I feel my eye twitch things happen  
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch  
Trying to keep things low-low  
They don't really know, though  
Bad Boy the motherfuckin' logo  
Stay on your toes  
They shouldn't get it mistaken  
Hope they don't think I'm faking  
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken  
You know the rule of thumb be  
Don't try to take nothing from me  
I rule it wit a street stay slummy  
Make money's the motto, fuck the niggas that squabble  
I know I might be hard for you to swallow  
Ya feel me?  
  
I hear voices inside  
And I see crime, don't die  
And I need changes  
Oh, please, please, please  
Don't go Don't go  
  
Sometimes I just feel like y'all don't understand  
Where I'm coming from, where I'm trying to get to  
Shit is really deep, my shit is deep  
  
They don't have a direct understanding of me  
Fuck what they planning for me  
I just won't accept the bullshit that they handing me  
Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me  
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me  
And all that negative shit pertaining to me  
What ya think I claiming to be  
A straight heart staying with me  
I can tell it's about to go down  
I told them, slow down before I send the low down  
And skip out of town  
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta  
The situation is serious and getting hotter  
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger  
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga  
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver  
Like I told them, just to let him know 'til' he figures out  
It's make money's the motto  
Something ya'll should follow  
And I don't got no time for the squabble  
Ya feel me?  
  
I hear voices inside  
And I see crime, don't die  
And I need changes  
Oh, please, please, please  
Don't go Don't go  
  
Sometimes you just get tired of shit  
Sometimes you just get fed up  
Don't hate me, hate yourself, motherfuckers  
Don't hate me, hate yourself  
Cause I ain't never gonna stop  
I ain't never gonna stop  
I'll make you feel me forever  
And ever and ever and ever  
That's just the way it is  
That's just the way it's gonna be

I thought I would just have to say  
I need to meet you I will await the day  
I hear your voice so hear me out  
I need to stand up and and take a shout  
And say to god I will pray  
That you will come back to me and stay  
And stay for the reasons I love you  
And you should know by now my love is true  
So don't ask me these simple things  
Ill give you my love and dimond rings  
If you can just come over and talk to me  
And no lovin if you want just walk wit me

Cause your face brings everyone grace  
And I wish you would never leave  
But no your gone I sit and plead  
To god that you will come back to me  
And we can live happily  
But that will never happen anytime  
But I say I love you and I wish you were mine

I hate funerals, I love life  
I hate when I see a whole bunch of people just crying in a funeral on some
fake shit  
They ain't really love a niggaare while he was there  
See, I'm a different type of niggaare, I wanna be honest with y'all  
I need the love now, if you all motherfuckers gonna be crying and be playing
thirty minute specials when I'm gone, an hour special that I'm gone  
Fuck that, love me while I'm here  
Love me while I'm here, I had to tell a bitch

'Cause all I see is haters and this money  
Got these niggers catching verbals and I tell you

Knocking at the door, I'm like a wizard, bitch, I tell you

I'm a rich niggaare, I don't get mad, I just get paid  
I don't catch feeling, s I catch flights, that's brick paper  
For one rider at bad boy, that's one side  
These killers with me, don't fuck around, they jump fast like all sides  
I'm about to keep up on the billy, bumping these bottles and willy  
I know they gonna hate when I'm high, but when it's all over they feel me  
If you want your love when I'm dead, you better off just trying to kill me  
'Cause I'm gonna ball on you, and I ain't talking about you, I hate all y'all
niggers  
Ten birkin from your man, hoe, I could buy that  
Last week I made a hundred mil', you should try that

I walk in the building, give love in the club  
Love in the streets, bitch, it's meek milly  
Them niggers was haters, I love what they was  
'Cause all of that hating was my motivation  
Now I got the paper and what what'y what

Living the life in the fucking eo  
Niggers that hate me still come to my shows  
Shorty ain't ready to fuck up my wrist, give a fuck about gold  
Straight to the money and back to the hood where they taking that money  
We package the good and we ring up the money

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show  
I lace the track you lock the flow  
So far from hanging on the block of dough  
Notorious they got to know that  
Life ain't always what it seem to be  
Words can't express what you mean to me  
And though you're gone  
We still a team  
Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams  
In the future can't wait to see  
If you'll open up the gates for me  
Reminisce sometime  
The night they took my friend  
Try to black it out but it plays again  
When it's weird feelin' it's really hard to conceal  
Can't imagine all the pain I feel  
Give everything to hear half your breath  
I know you still livin' your life after death  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
I'll be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
I'll be missing you  
  
It's kind of hard wit you not around  
Know you in heaven smilin' down  
Watchin' us while we pray for you  
Everyday we pray for you  
Till the day we meet again  
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend  
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed  
Strength I need to believe  
My thoughts big I just can't define  
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  
Bust in the 6  
Shop for new clothes and kicks  
You and me taking flicks  
Making hits stages they receive you on  
Still can't believe you're gone  
Give anything to hear half your breath  
I know you still livin' your life after death  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
I'll be missing you  
  
Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
I'll be missing you  
  
Somebody tell me why  
On that morning  
When this life is over  
I know  
I'll see your face  
  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every night I pray  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day  
Every time I pray

Thinking of the day  
When you went away  
What a life to take  
What a bond to break  
I'll be missing you  
  
Every step I take  
Every move I make  
Every single day

1 - Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't  
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't  
If I wanna floss, I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When you rolled up in the Escalade  
Saw that dub you gave to the valet  
Knew that it was game when you looked at me  
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling  
Saw you later in the corner booth  
Raising up a toast so I would notice you  
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know  
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control  
  
2 - All that matters is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yeah  
  
Repeat 1  
  
When I took a chance  
Thought you'd understand  
Baby credit cards aren't romance  
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours  
What I need from you is not available in stores  
Seen a side of you that I really feel  
You're doing way too much, never keep it real  
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road  
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?  
I've got to go  
  
Repeat 2  
  
Repeat 1  
  
A thing, a thing, a thing  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Puff Daddy]  
Yeah let's go baby  
Bad Boy  
Ayo ma' peep this  
My game's tight like the way your jeans fit  
Please believe it  
Yeah you independent I can see  
I'm glad you got your own dough  
You can spend that on me  
And why not, we can stack our dough  
And buy blocks  
If I got you got  
Watch, they hope we might slip  
But we keep a tight grip  
And make hits like this, holla!  
  
[Jennifer Lopez]  
You think the money that you make  
Can substitute the time you take  
To get the keys into my heart  
Think you can win my heart  
Don't know what's in my heart  
I think you need to take some time  
To show me that your love is true  
There's more than dollar signs in you  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt  
You always complainin'  
But I was makin' it worse  
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first  
It's time to explain  
My mind's been in reverse  
But now I think back  
When nobody cared  
And you was there  
Just to roll by your man  
And came back  
Even know what I did  
I realize and I'm aware  
I know what it is  
Put that on everything  
Girl you my everything  
I don't know where I'd breathe  
Cause you the air I be  
If lovin' is wrong  
Who could be right  
I wouldn't know what to do  
Without you in my life  
You're more to me than the world I pray  
The more nights for your heart to ache  
Right in the middle of the dawn of day  
I think of all the pain I caused  
And throw it away and say  
I need you in my life  
Can you feel it in your soul

[Chorus:]  
[Kelly]  
There's no way no way nowhere to go there's no way out  
There's no way no way nowhere to turn there's no way out  
  
[Puff talking over chorus]  
Yeah yeah uh huh no way out baby.  
You can't go nowhere ain't got nowhere to turn  
Yeah yeah ain't no way out.  
Ugh check this out  
  
[Verse 1 (Puff)]  
  
Ready to call it quits from all this shit  
Even resign from the niggas I been ballin' with  
I'm second guessing all this negative energy  
It's making me realize why niggas really envy me  
I feel no sympathy it's tight ill  
Plus I get slight chills when I write wills  
Tired of looking at these ugly niggas with ice grills  
No tellin' what I might feel about my glory  
2 sides to every story  
That's why I pray to God hoping that He reassure me  
The more the pain the more the game come with this territory  
I might dispose feelin' like my life been chose  
All I know in my life lotta ice and hoes  
When it's on  
My man there gat in his hand  
What you do when you got a master plan  
But half done ran  
Here's ya chance to prove you love 'em  
It's on and subbin'  
So hot it's feeling muggy. Really though.  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Puff over chorus]  
No matter how bad it gets. It could be worse. Ain't no way out  
I gotta live my life you know. You gave me the ends. No matter  
How bad it gets there ain't no way out no way out.  
  
[Verse 2 (Black Rob)]  
  
I feel like this approach me with beef ya done  
I shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun  
Man a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1  
Wind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh  
Despite the bullshit black still here  
Makin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's  
Via partaking flicks  
No matter what we have to  
Come strapped with our gats  
We don't want to  
But y'all make us act like that  
It's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you  
La Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do  
Man handle tracks that be laced by Nas  
Rolex watch security straight from the Mosque  
Yo I'm all on my own G who should I trust  
niggas bust B. I. G. Now it seems they want us  
It's like no matter what I do  
I can't escape it  
Ain't no going around it so  
I'ma be a man and just face it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3 (Puff)]  
  
It takes heart just to live in these streets  
You niggas lift the heat  
Take the bitter with the sweet  
They can't hurt me  
No more than they already did  
They killed Big in my heart he forever lives  
There's no way out  
Like you got Berrettas to my wig  
We were slugged then another blood  
Shed my ribs uhh  
Now the question is Will I survive?  
Nigga gotta make it home I gotta still provide  
And I get the vibe niggas wanna live to try  
Ain't no tellin' what this Bad Boy feel inside  
Blood hate the sweat pain be intensified  
I'm feelin' stranded as if I can't hitch a ride  
Now I tell my seed minimize the genocide  
Plus I'm dangerous so numb I feel painless  
And you know what you  
Tell them niggas who can't touch you  
You grab ya nuts and say muthafuck you!  
You invited got dones be indicted  
And if you kill me  
Me and Big reunited what nigga what nigga what nigga  
[Chorus over last line]

[Chorus]

Pimp tight! M-J-G  
Fin' to get up on the mic with a passion  
Get up on some pads Gwen, my chick get her ass in  
For the track, make my money  
Bring it on back to the middle of the floor  
I want the whole stack  
Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'  
My seed gotta grow  
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show  
What I mean is I go  
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor  
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping  
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women  
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing  
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen  
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda  
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder  
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under  
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer  
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping  
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n  
  
[Chorus: x2]

[Puff]  
Yeah ye ye yeah yeah Sting Bad Boy remix come on  
  
[Pras]  
Yo yo yo  
Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto  
Pour out the bottle blow out the candle  
Too broke to hold too shallow to handle  
Get all today you never promised tomorrow  
Yeah her moves remind me of kung fu flicks  
Thick lips that contradicts rules of the game  
She plays the politics  
Red light special red light district  
Put on ya make up body all made up  
Platinum played up Pearl Jam cut up  
Roxanne Roxanne you don't really have to  
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue  
She got the hots for the disco jocks  
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops  
Never get cool like to call it Glock  
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot  
  
Roxanne  
(Roxanne Roxanne)  
  
You don't have to put on the red light (ye ye ye yeah yeah)  
Those days are over  
You don't have to sell your body to the night (c'mon)(Roxanne Roxanne)  
Roxanne Roxanne  
Roxanne  
You don't have to wear that dress tonight (remix)  
Walk the streets for money  
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right (ye ye yeah)  
  
Verse Two:  
  
Yo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback  
Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac  
She steps in the room, don't know how to act  
Sweet in emergence, similar to Similac  
It was the hat  
Cats wanna be around her shine  
She wants to party, have a good time  
She feels kind of hot me feelin' feelin' fine  
Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine  
Bro making the streets she's the pimper's paradise  
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice  
She said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan  
Of the refugees down from the islands  
Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends  
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend  
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn  
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan  
  
I loved you since I knew you (I like this part, Roxanne Roxanne)  
I wouldn't talk down to you  
I have you to tell just how I feel (Roxanne Roxanne)  
I won't share you with another boy (Ye ye ye yeah yeah)  
I know my mind is made up (Roxanne Roxanne)  
So put away your makeup (Roxanne Roxanne)  
Told you once I wont tell you again  
It's a bad way (Ye ye yeah, yeah)  
  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne  
You don't have to put on the red light x2

I remember what you said to me, when you said it to me last night

When I woke up this morning to get some loving from you  
I turned to one side, to my suprise, I wasn't layin' next to you(mmmm)  
Why don't you get closed to me, I thought it was supposed to be

Why you handlin' me this way, what was it

[Verse 2]  
So I waited, and I waited, 'cause I knew you would come  
Hours 1, hour 2, hour, 3 hours, not at all  
If I'm dreaming, wake me up  
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough  
I can not see, how would you ever let this happen to me  
I still belive, that it was supposed to be  
Me and you, you and me, so complete  
So complete, so complete  
If you saying that you need to leave, then be a man about it  
and step to me, step to me, tell me please  
that without me it's so complete, so complete  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
[Verse 3]  
Won't you tell me right now what you want from me(what you want from me)  
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby(held it in, oh)  
Thought you where the one but, you just played me(you know you played me)  
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete, yeah  
  
Repeat Chorus (with different variations)

Please, give me the responce I need

Bad Boy remix  
Hit me baby  
  
Verse One: Puff Daddy, krs-One  
  
Hear the sound of my money machine  
See the 600 Benz see the chrome rims gleam  
See the teacher krs and the Puff Daddy  
See the young black and famous Rich like Matty  
With the power and the knowledge at our fingertips  
With a style make the ladies wanna lick they lips, shake they hips  
Shake they rumps, bass thump  
Believin they could fly by the way you jump, player, uhh  
Hip-Hop mayor, fat rhyme sayer  
From the Boogie Down to the Himilayas I'm  
  
Comentating (say what?) illustrating (yeah)  
Descriptions given, adjective expert (I hear you)  
Let's work, til your neck hurt (oooh)  
Like Bedwork I Rock Steady, you ain't really ready  
For the teacher, just when you thought you had me licked  
I come equipped with another hit, oh shit!  
(I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you)  
  
Chorus:  
  
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)  
Step into a world, where there's no one left  
But the very best, no mc can test  
  
Step into a world, where there's no one left  
But the very best, no mc can test  
  
Verse Two: Puff Daddy  
  
Politic with the teacher (c'mon) as the hits reach ya  
Puff Daddy and krs-One, double feature (that's right)

Have you stuck on stupid broke feelin crummy (ahah)

Killin You Softly wit my song  
Call from the heist, I know y'all better think twice (what?)  
About the still number one (uh-huh) South South Bronx (say what?)  
At the Latin Quarter, dancin witcha daughter (ooh!)  
You can't handle me, I keep it tight  
With my Bad Boy family, that's right  
  
Chorus:  
  
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)

Young black and educated, that's how we made it (oh yeah)  
Study and bring the money in, you can't fade it  
This scholar, gets the dollars  
While these other scholars just holler (remix)  
With no dinero, your zero (remix)  
You think I care what you whisper  
You got the wrong picture (remix)  
I'm chillin with G. Simone eatin dinner (haha)

High tech, you get the album or cassette (that's right)  
And don't forget, while you listenin, skills I flaunt it

Rock on, Bad Boy, remix, for eternity baby, bdp rock on rock on...

[Diddy]  
I need y'all to hear me out there  
Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh  
  
Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin  
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product  
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic  
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin my chronic  
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps  
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at  
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet  
Of the almighty, a God to the black child  
I told moms I would be somethin  
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin  
Listen up, I got a story to tell  
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell  
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire  
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire  
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong  
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone  
But nope, I hold my stance in stone  
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin  
Won't stop been the motto, feelin rich like I won the lotto  
It's almost like seein through the eyes of a crack child  
Dodgin crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip  
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages  
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush  
Thinkin back when my moms gave that first push  
Thank God for my life I came through the room  
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel  
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil  
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils  
I foiled your plans and made you aware  
And turned America's dream into a nightmare  
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers  
The first B. I., "Ready to Die" muh'fuckers  
So "Who Shot Ya," 9 to 5 muh'fuckers  
"Bad Boy for Life," is I muh'fuckers  
And it's back, better than it ever was  
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was  
So I deliver the truth uncut  
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up  
On top of the statue yellin "Who want what?"  
For the past ten years, the future is us  
(C'mon man) Eyes closed like I'm blowin reefer  
The preview is over, now enjoy the feature  
Niggaz  
  
I wanna thank y'all for believin in me for so long  
Thank y'all for ridin with a nigga  
As we continue on!  
You are now listenin to the sounds  
Of the world famous... You know my name  
You know my name

[Puff Daddy]  
See when we like to make you shake your ass, move your hips  
So we gonna do a little something like this  
Flipmode, Bad Boy  
Check this out  
  
Tell me how it feels, is it hot is not

Does it stay streeted go pop  
Checkin out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop  
Chartin number one, drinks in the sun  
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon  
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough  
Makin grandmas hit the floor, really though  
It's my thang my slang  
Rich motherfuckers gettin chicks at the  
Bringin my team to the joint wit Alan Iversan runnin on point  
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint

Gettin all up in they bitches

[Rampage]  
Aiyyo I'm on to the next level

Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil  
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o  
You never seen, cash money fiend  
A lot of cats wanna dream  
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian  
The way I eat my shrimp with steam  
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what  
Yo I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean  
Call me little rabcash, I get you for your stash  
Vip pass, ave all the gas, I make it last  
  
Chorus: Busta Rhymes

"Don't stop the body rock"

"Don't stop the body rock"  
  
[Mase]  
Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves  
Cause I'm smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes  
When I move to new Jerus, cause I like the cruise  
And my six double-o, blast weed, love the dough  
I'm that Goodfella, what the hella they can tell me  
Smoke my la la out in la, who's ready  
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy  
See angealan they winnin, a nigga need the chedda  
Cause I'm more in a broad way  
With all A's and platinum  
There been many things we touch  
Never had in finance so I never had to deduct shit 1. 8  
And every week I have to re-up  
So what, so what  
  
[Busta Rhymes]  
Aiyyo check out the way me and my niggas always be whippin shit  
The way that I display no flavor and do it so intricate  
Pidda and padda padda and pidda over with the shit  
You you you you you oh y'all niggaz be yappin to make me sick of it  
Hit you wit shit that y'all niggaz never ever forget  
Fuckin wit my niggaz just like you playin russian roulette  
Ooh me and my whole baton coming soon

And What I'm Saying Is  
All I Need Is For You To Understand  
How Beautiful She Is ( She Is )  
And All It Takes Is A Little Faith

Just A Little More Than I Can See

We'd Stay Together  
Only We Can Hustle Who Ever

To Fulfilled Our Fantasies  
Take Me By My Hand My Dear  
Promise Me You Won't Have No Fear

To move

It's talkin' through the melody

Are you ready to press play?

[Diddy]  
Nah they ain't ready

Y'all don't believe me yet?

(Mmm... Can't believe we doin this record)  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)  
  
[vocals get louder]  
We'll always love Big Poppa  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)  
We'll always love Big Poppa (Yeah)  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)  
  
I look in the clouds, hope you past the sun  
Hope you right next to God and he calling you Son  
Taking you in, Angels breaking you in  
This is heaven and no longer do you have to sin  
And may God bless your mom and your two children  
Your wife, your family and all your friends  
Everybody stay strong, the good die young  
Where we from it's all wrong, we all confused  
Never know what we have til what we have we lose  
Think Big, we just lost a very big jewel  
Hip-hop itself is at a pit-stop itself  
Seeing Big die I wish the shit would stop itself  
It hurts, you're probably too good for this earth  
Genius at his work  
Made dirty cats wanna get a clean shirt  
Pop Cristal and rock they ice work (word), go Big (go Big)  
Everybody wanted to know Big  
Made the rap biz, glitter like showbiz  
Ask anybody, who could flow Big  
All the cats shined, but you would glow Big  
Frank White lyrically, moved niggaz spiritually  
Made you wanna get a cup, fill it up with Hennessee  
Front in the club and light a dutch where the women be  
If you seen the show then I know you felt the energy  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 8X]  
  
Just to let y'all know, everything is all real  
But it's sad when a good fella catch a raw deal  
And pain is a part of life that we all feel  
Today this whole rap game is getting more ill  
It make me look back, to where he took rap  
Dude brought the East back, y'all better believe that  
He never had a warning, One More Chance  
Was right before him everybody must answer when God's callin  
I flew B's wit him, I blew trees wit him  
Couldn't wait to go on tour across seas wit him  
People seem to get lost and, blow things out of proportion  
Life is worth more than the coffin  
I need answers, and they better be the truth  
Hurts like a bad tooth, we losin mad youth  
Lyrically there'll never be no one above you  
And no matter how they judge you we always gonna love you  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 4X]  
  
Right now I know you missin it, smokin in peace  
After all this bullshit don't cease, huh Big  
Right now, you and Pac in harmony, probably huggin  
While everybody from Brooklyn to West coast is buggin  
All these gang wars, Big, show me a sign  
As for your son I'ma raise Shorty like he was mine (no doubt)  
It seems that the devil got his stinkin back whooped  
And we should pray for Jesus, and ask for forgiveness  
I can remember all the studio time, getting twisted  
Bottle after bottle, Bacardi Lime, I miss it  
We clicked like heels when we first met the  
Junior Ma-f-i-a and Big Po-ppa  
Nearly broke down four times writin this verse  
Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts  
But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at  
Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at  
But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite  
The only time you see your family is funeral night  
Christopher Wallace, Frank White, holdin it down  
I guess you with the real king in New York now  
For real  
  
We'll always love Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big) [repeat 6X]  
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa [repeat 2X]  
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)  
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa (We'll always love you Big)  
We'll always love Big Poppa, Big Poppa, Big Poppa...  
(We'll always love you Big)

It's a Hell Up in Harlem fuckit another day  
Another dollar wake up to the barking from the Rottweilers  
Pull the collars make em sit for the Godfather  
Then I holler to Justin my son run the water  
For the shower trust fund scholarship sure to give him power  
Baby momma call she pick him up in about an hour  
Now free to go free to blow with the calicos  
And the navajos it's just the way this player knows  
Anything goes, finally caught up with my nigga Sam Sam  
Picked me up, in the tan Lex Land  
Wanted breakfast down at Pan Pan's, what's your favorite dish?  
He ordered cheese eggs and grits, I had the swordfish  
What is this? Three niggaz dressed in black  
Roleys on they wrist, feathers in they hat  
One tapped me on my back, then pointed at my stack  
Put my finger on the trigger  
Then I asked him, "Whatchu want nigga?"  
Chorus: Puff Daddy  
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go  
Whatchu gonna do when you can't take no mo'  
You gonna cry like a bitch or take it nice and slow  
Whatchu gonna do when it's your turn to go  
(repeat 2X)  
Verse Two: Puff Daddy  
I pray to God that I'm dreamin, I know my family  
Wouldn't take it, when the doctor said, "He ain't make it"  
Mom Dukes cryin, baby mom full of grief  
How she gonna tell her son his daddy is deceased?  
Now she got beef with them bitches up the street  
All because I used to creep, with her girlfriend Sharese  
She knows, I keep the hoes, from nation, to nation  
On every radio station, Goodfellas in rotation, uhh  
That's why niggaz wanna twist my shit, flip my wig  
Attempt to murder me like Tommy Gills  
Before they draw, niggaz threw me to the floor  
Drill holes in my pocket, Sam launch the rocket  
They wanna rip my arms out the socket, fuckin heathens  
Love to see a nigga stop breathin  
I heard a voice sing out, "Ain't you Sean Puffy Combs?  
Here's your eulogy, meet you at the Crossroads"  
G'night Bone  
Chorus  
Verse Three: Puff Daddy  
Nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision  
Watching my life go down, like Christian  
Listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and Mac millis  
Spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game  
And deuce deuces can't stand the pain  
Little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard  
They just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka  
Blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers  
Three headed for my chest straight, the other two  
Came a little late, and just barely missed my face  
I'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars  
One of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars  
Shit, I'm just tryin to live, so I can raise my kid  
And own the world, bone all the girlie girls  
That's when I finally figured out  
That's that nigga David Arthur, Sharese baby father  
And I didn't even bother to ask no further questions  
No more confessions only suggestions  
I think Sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up  
From the rear, and Sam was the only nigga there  
Then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum  
Sam in the passenger seat, so I'm assumin them  
Niggaz didn't even get to peep  
Lil' Kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat  
Clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet  
Once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead  
They fled, and they waved, hot lead  
If I ain't duck, I'd be on my deathbed  
Sucker move, for that they don't get no props  
Lil' Kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots  
We in the block, no Land posters just old posters  
Of gangsta niggaz I see ghosts of gangsta figures  
I'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car  
Took me in the saloon and said, "Puffy, there you are"  
Them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots  
Washin dishes, I guess for goin out like bitches  
I smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth  
Happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt  
That night, I said a little prayer, me and Justin  
That's when I heard the bustin, yeah  
Chorus

[Intro:]  
Ladies and gentlemen  
We are gathered here today  
To join  
I see it, yeah  
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah  
One-two, one-two, in the place to be  
As you can see  
I am the crush groovin'  
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight  
The record breaking and the record making  
Yeah, yeah, turn this up  
  
From the states to over seas  
Every city in between I hit the scene  
Catch fire like kerosene  
Geting paid for more then a decade  
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the pd invasion  
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars  
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar  
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?  
No one important, just another nigga flossing  
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real  
You just a clone wit' a production deal  
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water  
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya  
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth  
Hottest niggas out  
Alot better, the shit's too strong  
I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long  
  
1 - [lil' kim]  
What you niggas want  
Wanna talk slick  
Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit  
Who you fucking wit'  
You and your weak clique  
Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit  
You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret  
Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with  
You can't run, you can't hide  
Bad boy 'till the day we die  
  
Tell they all like jordan in the fall  
On top of the hill like lauren, killing 'em soft'  
What you grillin' me for?  
Kept my name good, we from the same hood  
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood  
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me  
Wanna grind on me  
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me  
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping  
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching  
At all times, put it all on the line  
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares  
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust  
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust  
It get like that though, when you stack that dough  
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close  
So put up you guards, keep faith in god  
I promise y'all the world'll be ours  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Your games amaze, but a lot of ways, many choices  
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices  
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year  
So I listen back cause the street is missing that  
What a world we live in  
So cold I'm shivering, slipping  
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit  
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'  
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'  
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen  
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine  
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm  
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?  
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work  
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt  
In a verse I show the whole earth my work  
It got to get better because it can't get no worse  
  
Repeat 1  
Repeat 1

Yeah  
  
[1] - How many niggas that'll die for you  
How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you  
I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you  
Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you  
  
How many niggas that'll die for you  
How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you  
I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you  
Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you  
  
[Puff Daddy]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well, I'mma ride for you, would you ride for me?  
Well, I'mma die for you, would you die for me?  
Obviously, we all know you type of cats  
Let they man get struck, never strike back  
Stay in the street, seven days a week  
Shit get hot, you never blaze your heat  
Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet  
So I keep 'em on his toes, that way he never sleeps  
Bigger than the king and the Pope, sling no dope  
Call me anything but broke  
When it's on, I guarantee my team don't choke  
Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force  
And when I say we won't quit, believe this shit  
When I talk about a Benz, let you see the 6  
And when I'm talkin' to a ho, let you meet my bitch  
When Puff talk, you niggas take heed to this  
  
[Repeat 1]  
  
[Mase]  
Yo, if you down to act, we came to scrap  
We beef '89, still watch your back  
A nigga smack me, I'mma smack 'em back  
If it lead to the guns, then that be that  
And lately, niggas that snake me, just make me  
Wanna send 'em heat without ac  
Thinks I'm sweet, taste me  
How much you really want it?  
Enough to put a mil' on it or your deal on it?  
This year Cancun, guess who I'm going wit  
My own niggas, see I pay my own trip  
Make my own chips, I copped my own 6  
I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick  
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort  
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court  
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf  
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt  
Me, I always had, so I never go for self  
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt  
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down  
Kick your door down, surround the block  
Where you go now?  
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round  
Way I leave the furniture, think it was co-found  
Here's the low-down, messin' with Mase gotta go down  
What more could I say but hey, guess you niggas know now  
  
[Repeat 1]  
  
[Lil' Kim]  
Motherfuckin' right I'mma roll with my motherfuckin' dogs  
Bitches ain't around when it's time to go to war  
This shit here, nothing to fuck with  
I'm the same bitch all ya'll wanna try ya'll luck with  
Lil' Kim spread like syphilis  
You think I'm pussy?  
I dare you to stick your dick in this  
Chrome 4-4, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous  
Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission  
Like E. F. Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen  
So don't ya'll be mad at me, cuz I'm the Q to the B  
To the motherfuckin' E-E  
Copped my cd, now all ya'll wanna be me  
See me on the tv, beds will dip in 3-D  
Peep the cd, chromed out and phoned out  
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out  
I gets it on, money keep growin'  
Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone  
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone  
Like a splinter I enter  
So why should I throw my blows in those  
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles  
My nigga B. I. G, I'mma ride for  
But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for  
  
[Repeat 1]

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]  
Why did you have to be this way  
Baby all you had to say  
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be  
But you planned a great escape  
Bright and early before I wake  
We both knew we had to break  
You could of chose a better way  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]  
It was cold the way you left  
Still the pain is in my chest  
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me  
If you put away your pride  
And look deep into my eyes  
It would of been to your surprise  
That I got up to apologize  
But you were gone  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Break: Carl Thomas]  
Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone  
It's time to carry on  
I thought that you made me happy  
But it's this thing that's come between us girl  
At one time you were my world  
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away  
  
[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]  
(Uhh) I dreams filthy  
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey  
Huh, what a set up  
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off  
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off  
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land  
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies  
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up  
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin "Bastard!"  
Cryin, know my friends is lying  
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers  
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant  
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot  
Giving cats the opposite of diets  
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye  
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me  
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)  
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter  
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like  
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest  
Silencers so you can't hear it  
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me  
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still  
  
[Chorus By Carl Thomas 4x..music fades out]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be

[Intro: Faith Evans (P. Diddy)]  
Uh, uh-uh, (There's another one)  
What-what (And another one)  
This is the remix (There's another one) Ha ha  
I know it's not too ghetto (And another one, Bad Boy)  
I know it's not too ghetto  
Pedigree (Pedigree baby) I said I know it's not to ghetto  
Donaway (Faith, Faithfully, the remix)  
You better, check yourself respect yourself  
You better go for self because I flow for self  
  
[Verse 1: Faith Evans]  
I'll tell you why there's no love, simply you're not cool enough  
For what we had between us, don't you know you lost my trust  
People ask me where you've been (Where you've been)  
And I tell them were just friends (Tell them we're just friends)  
Cause it's so obvious that it's never gonna work for us  
No no oh no (No)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Played with my emotions (Played)  
You gets no devotion (And you gets no love, gets no love)  
You can't get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
(You gets no love from me)  
  
[Verse 2: Faith Evans]  
Tell you why we can't hook up (You gets no love)  
Cause I had about enough (You gets no love)  
Hearin all the lies you tell (You gets no love)  
Boy I thought I knew you well  
People think that your my man (People think that your my man)  
They don't even understand (They don't even understand)  
Just because I let you get some that don't make you the one  
We ain't even in love (You know you played with my....)  
  
[Chorus: Faith Evans]  
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion  
You gets no love, you can get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
  
([P. Diddy:] Yo! Faith let 'em know!!)  
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit  
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit  
I know y'all sick of this Bad Boy diva  
That blows and plus got flows ridiculous  
You better, rock my shit don't knock my shit  
Because I got the shit that make you cop my shit  
It's the chick from the bricks that got the hot shit  
Left you sick from the single now check the remix  
Boy you had a clue, thought we had a cool relationship  
But you couldn't handle it (You couldn't handle it)  
  
[Verse 3: G. Dep (P. Diddy)]  
Yo! At the end of the day what a playa 'gon do? (Badboy)  
You got love for me, It's how supposed to be  
Same love I'm a land on you (Come on)  
Right back at you it's only natural  
So what I'm gon' do? Me  
Everything love ain't always lovely  
Leave it all up to me, I'll be livin in luxury, sucker free  
Without no lies without no ties to those that patronize  
That's why I don't socialize  
I eat, shit, even sleep with open eyes  
Just, give me that gasoline  
I'll move in the jag few bags of green  
Couple ads in the magazine  
All freezy and I'm easy G Deezy one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Played with my emotions, you gets no devotion  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch  
You can't even be my friend, cause you gets no love again  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
  
[Outro:]  
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
You played with my emotions and you gets no devotion  
Can't even be my friend, and you gets no love again  
  
[Chorus: Faith Evans]  
Played with my emotions You gets no devotion  
You gets no love, you can get no love from me  
You can't even be my friend (Can't be my friend)  
And you gets no love again  
Whatever you do it will come back to you bitch
