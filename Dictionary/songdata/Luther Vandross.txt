Any day, you'll be gone, oh yeah  
Any day, you'll be gone  
  
Any day now  
I will hear you say goodbye my love  
Then you'll be on your way  
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown  
Any day now, I'll be all alone  
I know that, hey, I know that  
  
Any day now  
When the clock strikes go, you'll call it off  
And then my tears will flow  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now, love will let me down  
Cause you won't be around  
No baby now, yeah  
  
I know I shouldn't want to keep you  
If you don't want to stay  
Until you're gone forever  
I'll be holding on for dear life  
Holding you this way  
And I'm begging you to stay  
  
Any day now  
When your restless eyes meet someone new  
And to my sad surprise  
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town  
Any day now, I won't last for long  
Cause any day, you'll be gone  
Then any day, you'll be gone  
I know, I know that  
  
You'll be gone, you'll be gone, you'll be gone  
Yeah, mercy, any day now  
Any day, you'll be gone  
Mercy, yeah  
Any day, you'll be gone

I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my  
In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy  
Now all you need is a chance to try  
Any love  
  
In my heart there's a need to shout  
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out  
Are all those feelings that want to touch  
Any love?  
  
What a world for the lonely guy  
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind  
Can anybody tell me just where to find  
Any love, any love?  
  
Chorus:  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love, Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love, any love  
  
I know there's a love waiting  
To enter my life, enter my life  
  
Every day as I live  
I try to think positive  
I pray for someone good to come  
Any love  
  
Love is sweet and so divine  
And I can't wait for my love life to shine  
Can anybody tell me where I can find  
Any love, any love?  
  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love, Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love, any love  
  
I know there's someone waiting for me  
To enter my life, Come into my life  
  
Suddenly I'm up in clear blue skies  
Lonely tears start to fill my eyes  
I can weep, but I refuse to cry  
I've got to keep holding on  
  
To think love is strong  
To keep holding on  
  
Everyone needs a love no doubt  
Any love, Any love  
Everybody feels alone without  
Any love, any love  
  
And I know I know I know I know she'll come into my life  
Come into my life  

Anyone who ever loved  
Could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Anyone who ever dreamed  
Could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You, you couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Every time you go away  
I always say it's goodbye dear  
Loving you the way I do  
I take you back  
Without you, I'd die dear  
Knowing I love you so  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You, you couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like you've hurt me  
And be so untrue  
So what can I do  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in her arms  
And love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart  
And hurt me  
Like you hurt me  
And be so untrue  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would surely take me in her arms  
And, and always love me, and love me, love me  
Why won't you  
  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would surely take me  
Anyone would take me  
Why, why won't you  
No one's gonna love ya like I do  
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do  
Yeah  
No one  
No one, no one, no one, no one

Anywhere you say to be  
From the sky down to the ground  
If I hear you calling me  
I will never let you down  
What if I were far away  
Would the love fire still burn  
I want to know if you would be  
Still in love when I return  
  
Are you gonna love me  
I'm who I should be when you're loving me  
Are you gonna love me  
And give this love a chance ...would we dance  
  
I know the way you feel  
I shouldn't worry 'bout the future now  
It just gets in the way  
Don't want to make you sad  
Just want to know you're gonna love me  
When it's not a sunny day  
  
Are you gonna love me  
When the skies are grey and I'm far away  
Are you gonna love me  
If I have to go ...do you know  
  
Interlude:  
It's all about (You and me, you and me)  
Will you wait for me  
(It's all about love, love, love)  
About your love  
  
You were feeling kind of blue  
When the job took me away  
The reason that I'm calling you is  
I'll be coming back today  
  
Are you gonna love me  
Girl, it's been so long  
Is the feeling gone  
Are you gonna love me  
That's what I'm asking you  
Whatcha gonna do  
  
Repeat Interlude  
  
Are you gonna love me  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Will you wait for me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)

Are you gonna love me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)

Are you gonna love me, love me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Love me baby, love me baby  
Love me baby, love me baby  
  
Fade

I can hear you sighin'  
Sayin' you'll stay beside me  
Why must it be  
That you always creep  
Into my dreams  
  
On the beach we're sitting  
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'  
Why must it be  
That you always creep  
Into my dreams  
In my dreams  
  
When I'm sleep at night babaa  
I feel those moments of ecstasy  
When you sleep at night babaa  
I wonder do I creep into your dreams  
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy  
  
Oh, love is so amazing  
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah  
Guess you will be stayin'  
So let it be  
That you always creep  
Into my dreams  
In my dreams  
  
When I'm sleep at night babaa  
I feel those moments of ecstasy  
When you sleep at night babaa  
I wonder do I creep into your dreams  
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy  
  
Oh, love is so amazing  
Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah  
Guess you will be stayin'  
So let it be  
That you always creep  
Into my dreams  
In my dreams

Back when I was a child  
Before life removed all the innocence  
My father would lift me high  
And dance with my mother and me  
And then  
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep  
Then up the stairs he would carry me  
And I knew for sure  
I was loved  
  
If I could get another chance  
Another walk  
Another dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end  
How I'd love love love  
To dance with my father again  
  
When I and my mother  
Would disagree  
To get my way I would run  
From her to him  
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me  
yeah yeah  
Then finally make me do  
Just what my mama said  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he  
Would be gone from me  
  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step  
One final dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end  
Cause I'd love love love to  
Dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door  
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him  
I'd pray for her even more than me  
I'd pray for her even more than me  
  
I know I'm praying for much to much  
But could you send her  
The only man she loved  
I know you don't do it usually  
But Dear Lord  
She's dying to dance with my father again  
  
Every night I fall asleep  
And this is all I ever dream

I got your love  
You need to look no further  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
After my love  
You'll never need another  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I don't make no promises I can't keep  
And I promised myself that I'd love you forever  
How many times must I say that  
For you to understand the real thing  
  
Don't you know that I love you so  
Baby, don't you know  
Don't you know that  
I love you so, ooh, don't you know  
Don't you know that  
Oh  
  
Without a doubt  
You are my sweetest inspiration  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I'm always down  
For anything that you say  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I love you so, yeah  
I really love you, don't you know, yeah  
Don't you know that  
Alright, don't you know that  
  
I really, really do, yeah  
I'm really so in love with you, yeah  
Don't you know that  
Alright, ooh, yeah  
  
I used to doubt every girl that I'd meet  
I thought that nobody could knock me off my feet  
But you are the one who made my heart's bell ring  
And that's why I'm sure that this is the real thing, yeah  
  
Don't you know that I love  
Don't you know, ooh, ooh  
Oh, don't you know that I love  
Don't you know, oh, yeah  
Don't you know that I love you so  
Don't you know that  
I bet a million dollars that you know  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Ooh, don't you know that  
Don't you know I, don't you know I love you  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
I love you, I'm in love  
Ooh, ooh, I love  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know, don't you know  
That I love  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that

Tears on your pillow, that's evidence  
Crying all night, it don't make no sense  
Never know what to do, so the tears come out  
I used to wonder what this thing was about  
  
You're so sensitive  
So willing to give  
Girl, you're just a cutie, yeah, yeah  
But, everything hits your tender spot  
I think I see just what you've got  
  
Emotion eyes see what they wanna see  
They just won't let it be  
There's always something goin' on  
Emotion eyes, can't seem to be without  
Something to cry about  
They just get so emotional  
  
My, oh, mercy me, just what do you see?  
Nothing stops those tears from coming  
What's the matter chile, don't you ever smile?  
Watching you is really something  
  
You don't need to struggle with your badness  
'Cause you're the baddest girl there'll ever be  
You've got to learn to compromise  
You've got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you see with those  
  
You don't need to struggle with your badness  
You're just the baddest girl there'll ever be  
You've got to learn to compromise  
You've got to dry your weeping eyes  
Watch what you do with those  

My love  
There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's right  
My first love  
You're every breath I take  
You're every step I make  
  
And I  
I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)  
They tell me how much you care  
Oh, yes  
You'll always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
And forever  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
And I  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(No, you know I don't mind)  
And yes  
You mean the world to me  
I know I've found in you  
My endless love  
  
And love  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)  
Oh, yes  
You'd be the only one  
Cause no, I can't deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love (my love, my love)

Love, soft as an easy chair  
Love, fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
So you and I will make each night a first  
Everyday a beginning  
Sprits rise and their dance go unrehearsed  
They warm and excite us  
Cause we have the brightest love  
Two lights, two lights that shine as one  
Morning glory and a midnight sun  
Time we learned to sail above  
Time the world changed the meaning of  
Oh, ooh one love  
Ageless and ever,  
Evergreen.

What's your name?  
Girl what's your number?  
I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw you  
And I couldn't get you off my mind  
You reminded me of candy  
So you be my Mary Jane  
And I'll be your Sugar Daddy  
And we can make sweet love all the time  
  
I'd travel to the farthest star  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
'Cause sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar  
(Is the sweetness of your love)  
My rocket would only stop  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
And all I ever think about  
(Is the sweetness of your love)  
  
If you call for it, I'll deliver  
I'll bring you anything  
So fast it'll make you shiver  
Whatever it is, from A to Z  
Hey, let me prove that I can love you  
I'll do a dance for you  
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you  
Of whomever you dream, I wanna be  
  
I'd take my money out the bank  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
I'd buy you a great big diamond ring  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
'Cause Ooo baby, I'd do anything  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
  
I'd go ten rounds with Sugar Ray  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
And I'd eat my Wheaties everyday  
(For the sweetness of your love)  
BANG! ZOOM! And he would fly away  
(For the sweetness of your lovin')  
  
You could be lost in danger with a stranger  
Caught up in mystery  
A one night insanity, girl  
And quite an emotional tragedy it would be  
Then I'd come running just to save you  
I'd be your hero guy  
In a flash, in a minute I'd be there in no time  
And you'd be forever loving me  

It's the middle of the night  
And I can't sleep at all, I'm so uptight  
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time  
I've got so much on my mind hey  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
I think it's love, don't you agree?  
It's got to be, I don't feel better  
I know what I've got to do  
I've got to get next to you  
  
So I came here  
(For you to love)  
In the pouring rain  
(For you to love)  
And I know I'm ready  
(For you to love)  
I'll be the best I can  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause honey it's you I love  
Love, love yeah  
  
I start to wonder what is true?  
And I get so confused  
(What should I do?)  
You make me worry  
When you say you understand  
But that I can't be your man  
  
Something's gotta change your mind  
Now, if I get my love to you in time  
(Then you'll be mine)  
Ooh, I've got to get over  
Yes, that's what I've gotta do  
Look out 'cause I'm after you  
  
I came here  
(For you to love)  
In a hurricane  
(For you to love)  
Just to be ready  
(For you to love)  
I'll be the kind of man  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause honey it's you I love  
Love love love yeah  
Cause honey it's you I love yeah  
  
I wanted to see you  
I wanted to make your day  
I got myself ready  
To hear the words you would say  
Cause sometimes you talk to me so emotionally  
But then, you pull it back, baby  
Just let yourself love me  
  
I came here  
(For you to love)  
I took a train, my dear  
(For you to love)  
So, you know I'm ready  
(For you to love)  
I never doubt, never fear  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause oh honey it's you I love  
Cause oh honey it's you I love  
Love, love, yeah  
  
For you to love  
For you to love  
For you to love

I'm an ever rolling wheel  
Without a destination real  
And I'm an ever spinning top  
Whirling around 'till I drop  
  
[1] - Oh, but what am I to do  
My mind is in a whirlpool  
Give me a little hope  
One small thing to cling to  
  
[2] - You got me going in circles  
Oh, around and around I go  
Going in circles  
Oh, around and around I go  
I'm strung out over you  
  
I'm a faceless clock  
With timeless hopes that never stop  
When I feel that way  
You know my soul's at stake  
  
[Repeat 1]  
[Repeat 2]  
I'm strung out over you( I need you baby)  
Uuh, I need (I need you baby)  
Call me (I need you baby)  
I need baby, my baby, my baby  
My baby, my baby girl  
  
[Ad lib until fade]

[Chorus]  
I want you to believe in us  
Trust in your heart - I'm very real  
I want you to believe in me  
In time you'll know you're all  
I need  
  
I see that you're hurting  
And don't believe my words are true  
But, well, I'm truly certain  
With all my heart  
I'll never hurt you  
  
Take time to realize  
The whos, the whats, the wheres, and why's  
Don't have to compromise  
The love we feel we can't deny  
Yes  
It took me by surprise  
No, it didn't take me long  
Can't be long  
Feeling strong  
I want you for the long haul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see that you're open  
And that you wanna feel much more  
Well, I'm truly certain  
That my love will open the door  
To feelings to love  
And happiness  
To a life filled with wonder  
Never second guess  
That I want you and I love you  
Never wanted more  
You the one that I need  
And the one that I adore  
  
[Chorus]

Oh yeah, oh  
Oh yeah  
  
What good is the money  
When lately we've been missing each other  
Cause we've got work and kids, you know how it goes  
Monday through Friday, nine to five  
We spend most of the time chasing that dough  
  
But not tonight, we're gonna both get fly  
Call your momma, tell her come over  
So we can have quality time  
Cause it's been too long since I held you in my arms  
I can't wait no more, I'm ready to oooo  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
Tonight we gon' forget our worries  
Put the kids to bed  
I'm going out instead with you  
  
Steppin' out with you  
I'm steppin on out with you, darling  
  
Girl put that "celly" down  
Don't even peek at your pager now  
Just chill, relax, the kids will be cool  
Grab two more Cosmos, we ain't thinkin' about tomorrow  
We're in a club full of people  
But it feels just like me and you  
  
My baby's looking hot tonight  
Catching everybody's eye  
Look at them starin', but I ain't carin'  
Cause I know you're mine  
We should do this more often  
Got a fella feelin' kinda flossy  
I can't wait to make your body go ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you  
  
(You know how it goes)  
(Keep chasin' that dough)  
  
I'll ring the bell like I used to do  
Hold the door for you, let you through  
Take your hand and talk to you  
Make you know you're my star  
I'm gonna woo ya (yeah yeah)  
Say pretty words to ya (yeah yeah)  
Send chills right through ya (oh yeah)  
And remind you how loved you are  
  
You make me want to  
Do thangs, do thangs, them grown thangs  
Do thangs with you

(But The Problem Is, This Time It's Mine)  
  
So many times I've seen  
So many people's dreams  
Lost and washed away  
Out to the sea, yeah  
  
I said "No, not I"  
Pain would surely pass me by  
Happening to them, but not to me, yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oohhh  
Never used to worry about things like this  
(I wouldn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
Now I'm worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
Love would be all I'd need  
How naive could I be  
Trusting other people with my care, yeah  
  
Never thought I'd have to be  
One of love's casualties  
Up until now my belief was that love was fair  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oooh  
But I never worried 'bout things like this  
(I didn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
I keep worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
This time my heart's breaking  
This time my love's failing  
I'm trying hard not to be bitter now  
  
I never dreamed that the broken heart would be mine  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
You think it's love, but it never really is  
Never could imagine a thing like that (I wouldn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
Got me worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
This is mine, this is mine, yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
Never cared a doggone thing about that (I didn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
And the problem really is (This one is mine)  
See the whole thing is the heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine

Heaven knows I love you,

Couldn't live without you,  
look for me and I'll be there.  
  
But even though you're a joy to me,

Used to be amazing,  
used to make the world say "Wow."  
Heaven brought us together,  
That's how I know it'll all work out.  
  
We built our love on solid ground,  
and can't a thing ever bring us down.  
Back together like we wanted to,  
I'm so confused, my darling, remembering you.  
  
You're still the one on my mind,  
love is working overtime.  
I only dream about love and you.

Heaven knows I really try to love you.  
I try to love you, baby.  
This is love that you can't ignore,  
I never knew a girl like you before  
And heaven knows I couldn't love you more.  
  
This is so right, this is so right.  
This is so right because I love you,  
I really love you, baby.  
Back together like we wanted to

I only think about love and you.  
Talk to me, don't be shy,  
Heaven knows I really try to love you.

You're the one on my mind,  
got me working over time.

'cause I love you.  
Heaven knows and I know it can...  
  
  

When I look in your eyes  
There I see  
Just what you mean to me  
Here in my heart I believe  
Your love is all I'll ever need  
Holdin' you close through the night  
I need you, yeah  
  
One look in your eyes and there I see  
What happiness really means  
The love that we share makes life so sweet  
Together we'll always be  
This pledge of love feels so right  
And, ooh, I need you  
  
Here and now  
I promise to love faithfully [faithfully]  
You're all I need  
Here and now  
I vow to be one with thee [you and me], hey  
Your love is all [I need] I need  
  
Say, yeah, yeah  
  
When I look in your eyes, there I'll see  
All that a love should really be  
And I need you more and more each day  
Nothin' can take your love away  
More than I dare to dream  
I need you  
  
Here and now  
I promise to love faithfully [faithfully]  
You're all I need  
Here and now  
I vow to be one with thee [you and me], yeah  
Your love is all I need  
  
[Starting here] Ooh, and I'm starting now

[Starting now] Right now because I believe in your love  
So I'm glad to take the vow

Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah  
Love is all I need  
Ooh, ooh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh  
Hey, yeah  
Hey, yeah

Well by now you know I'm insatiable  
"Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah  
It's a miracle, you were right inside my head  
If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?  
It is not against the law, no baby  
I slave all through the week  
And I need my release  
I work hard so when I stop  
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it  
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it  
I hope you understand  
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no  
If I can't double up  
It's like I didn't get enough  
Call me greedy if you want, just do it  
But it's something that will never change  
I don't get no complaints  
They know it when they ring my bell  
That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
I declare the point to be  
Once is not enough for me  
Two time lovin' makes me smile  
One time love just ain't my style  
Repeat the love and I have found  
More the second time around  
It builds me up I love to love  
And if I can't hit it again  
It ain't natural  
Hit it again  
Don't care if I'm late  
The world just has to wait  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby  
Hit it again  
I loved it the first time  
Sent chills up through my spine  
Hit it again, hit it again, baby

(How)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(Oh, yeah)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
I'm doing all I can to try and understand  
Why my feelings faded away  
She's been nothin' but good to me  
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free  
I can't stay in this love, how do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(No)  
Nothing she did

How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
She pretends she cannot see  
The love is gone from me  
She carries on as if it is what it was before  
But I don't love her anymore  
I have to let her know  
That I must let her go  
I can't stay in this life  
How do I say goodbye  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(Oh, girl)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
Oh, I don't know what to do about it  
Gotta tell her, gotta tell her, gotta tell her  
Oh, there's no way to go around it  
I've got to tell her now but I don't know how  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
I just gotta tell you  
All the love we once had is through  
(Listen, listen, baby)  
(Listen closely, baby)  
(Closely)  
I don't wanna be with you anymore  
(Anymore)  
I can't stay, I can't stay  
(I can't stay)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before

How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her

Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
(I don't)  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't know)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  
I don't wanna be here anymore  
(I don't wanna be here)  
Nothing she did  
I just don't feel the way I did before  
How do I tell her  

How many times can we say goodbye  
Steven Goldman  
(album: busy body - 1983)  
  
Duet with Dionne Warwick  
  
Here we are so close to the end now  
Still holding on we try and pretend now  
Clinging to love we both know is dying  
We've tried and tried to find us a way out  
But darling our dreams have now all been played out  
Still we go on hopelessly trying  
  
Chorus:  
But how many times can we say goodbye  
Hos many times can we see love die  
How many times can we give it one more try  
Before we really say goodbye  
  
We're so in love but wrong for each other  
Each hurt that heals brings on another  
Both of us used and both of us using  
Darling it's time that we stop pretending  
There's just no way to rewrite our ending  
We're caught in this game  
And we know we're both losing  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
How many times can we break up and make up  
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up  
Just can't go on and on living a lie  
Though I'll always love you  
  
Repeat Chorus and Fade

Well, once again my love  
It's time for you to go  
No need to explain anything  
I know, I know, I know  
  
This is the end of the road  
It's the parting of the ways  
And there's not much left for us to say  
  
You keep telling me he's no good for you  
You said you were gonna change your lock  
You told me if he bothers you again, baby  
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock  
Put him away, baby  
Make him understand  
Tell him his game is over  
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder  
  
Whatever you're going through  
I can make it better  
No one should be making you feel like you do  
I can make it better  
Oh baby, baby  
Don't be a link in his chain  
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me  
Don't let him get in the way  
  
For every one time that he gives you pleasure  
Ten times he makes you wanna cry  
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby  
And wonder why in the world, oh why  
How in the world can you get any sleep  
Every one knows the way that he creeps  
It's time for the question baby  
What has he done for you lately, no  
  
Whenever you want me to  
I can make it better  
I just need this one chance to prove it to you  
I can make it better  
Ooo baby, baby  
Don't be a pawn in his game  
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go  
Or darling, it's just a shame  
  
Better for you is better for me  
Let's fall in love, I'll make you see  
Better for you is better for me, baby  
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see  
  
Never again will you hear a lie  
Never again will you wanna cry  
never, oh no, will there be a tear drop in your eye  
Stop all this madness in the name of love  
Tell him to leave ?cuz enough is enough  
Let him go baby, save your love for me  
Tell him you've found somebody  
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe  

One day I'll always remember  
Was when you walked into my life  
It was a very special night  
When we danced so close, so tender  
It gave my heart the second chance  
That I'd been waiting for  
  
But our love is falling  
All kinds of pressure has temptation calling  
It gives me fever  
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you  
I'm gonna stay till the last day  
Worry no more, what is love for?  
I hear love knocking honey  
Come on, let's open the door  
  
You know you've got me to love  
I can tell you that  
If you should ever need some love  
You just call me back  
I've been loving you from the start  
Let me tell you that  
And I'll keep loving you from my heart  
Sure can tell you that  
You've got so much to love  
  
Every time that we kiss  
I'm reminded it's you I miss  
I just love when we love like this  
I can tell you that  
Please forgive me if I pout  
But my world would turn inside out  
If on leaving me you insist  
Let me tell you that  
  
I start to hold you but you pull back,  
not much just a little  
I can't control you  
When you get so caught up in the middle  
First you say yes, then you say no  
Said you're gonna stay, now you're gonna go  
You know I'll tell you honey  
But I think you already know  
  
I can tell you this  
Anytime you go I really miss you  
Nothing to do, tired of my friends  
Won't you come back and love me again?  
So I can tell you that  
You've got me forever girl to love  

My friends told me all about it  
They said I had to see for myself  
But I never really cared  
Much about love  
I thought I could live without it  
Until I met this one girl  
And she was so fine  
I knew she was the one who could change my mind  
  
See, I used to be such a bad, bad boy  
And good times were my toy for joy  
That was all I was thinking of  
But I gave it up when I fell in love  
I used to know the party people around the world  
I gave it up when I found that girl  
And she's the one treats me good enough  
So I gave it up when I fell in love  
  
I thought I was justified  
To only see the world through my eyes  
And that it was a waste of time  
Talkin' 'bout love  
But it only took a little time  
To make me change my mind  
'Cause when she said goodbye  
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying  
  
Now, every night I dream about you and our new love  
All of my friends say oh I'm such a different guy  
And they wonder  
Oh, how they wonder  
  
I gave it up  
Sho 'nuff gave it up  
That was all I was thinking of  
But I gave it up when I fell in love

I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
  
Out of my head to say the things I said  
I didn't mean a word  
Think jealousy just took a hold of me  
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard  
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands  
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance  
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see  
I can't face the world if she don't love me  
  
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
When I walked away I cried (cried)  
And I really didn't mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)  
Really didn't mean it  
  
Dear one from me take my apology  
I need you back  
I promise I know o never let you go  
Is there a chance to see you baby  
(They talk about all) the love that we still share  
(From her emotion) I barely miss your happiness  
(You're missing and mourning) the way it used to be  
I know it's true but I don't believe  
  
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
When I walked away I cried (cried)  
And I really didn't mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)  
Really didn't mean it  
  
I want you back it can't be any other way  
I want you back and I've waited for the day  
I want you back I'm gonna be a little smarter  
I want you back I'm gonna try a little harder  
She's good She's fine and always on my mind  
I know our love will stand the test of time  
She's my girl and my best friend  
And I really didn't mean it  
Her love is love so fine and so for real  
I want the world to know the way I feel  
She's my girl and my best friend  
And I really didn't mean it  
Yeah... yeah.. ooh...  
  
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
When I walked away I cried (cried)  
And I really didn't mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)  
Really didn't mean it  

All of the band was on time for rehearsal  
And played everything just right  
Then came the news telling me not to worry  
The show is selling out tonight  
Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream  
And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream  
Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing "O" was done  
I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one  
  
I wanted your love  
Your love, your love, love, love, love, love  
  
So busy daydreaming 'bout you baby  
I didn't even hear the phone  
Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me  
They said, "we're so glad you're home!  
You just won a million dollars and a trip around the world?  
Better get yourself and forget about that girl  
They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too  
But all the money in the world could never take the place of you  
  
All over the city the lights were so pretty  
The holiday was filled with cheer  
The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'  
It was the special part of the year  
So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say "I do"  
Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasn't you  
We had told the world we were going to ring the wedding bell  
But when I really thought about it, I was really lying to myself  

I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Adore you, and want you so  
I'm just a no one  
With nothing to give you  
But Ooh, I love you  
  
She, she buys you diamonds  
Say they're bright, they are bright sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, boy, Ooo boy, hear what I say  
She could give you the world  
But she'll never love you the way  
That I love you, baby  
  
You can go any place you want  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with her  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
The window pane  
Oh Yeah, yeah  
  
I  
Who have nothing  
Nothing  
I  
Who have no one  
Must watch you  
I will watch you, baby  
Go passing by  
But you don't see me  
Wrapped in the arms of  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling it's I  
Who  
Really loves you, baby  
Really loves you, baby  
I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one  
  
I want to be the one that you just can't live without  
I want to be the one that you never feel no doubt  
I want to be the one that you let give you the lovin'  
But, I have nothing  
Nothing  
  
I want to be the one that you always want to be near  
I want to say the words that your body and soul need to hear  
I want to be the one that you let give you all the lovin'  
But I have nothing

I stood in line at the corner store  
And I heard these guys talk about this girl  
Hey, who gives them love anytime they want ...huh  
Then they said your name and how you carry on  
Your chain of fools is so long  
I thought our love was still on  
And so, oh what a fool I've been  
I thought I was your man and oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wonder who's there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who ...who's there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
(It's been so long)  
Since you've called me, yeah  
(I thought our love was strong)  
Just the way a love should be  
(And now that you're gone)  
I sit here and I wonder  
  
Bridge I:  
I've seen so many guys  
Take one look into your eyes  
And think they're in paradise  
  
There was less than love in the things that woman said  
Now, I wonder who put ideas in her head  
I'm still in shock 'cause when I went back there again  
She'd changed her lock and said, sorry you can't come in  
What a fool I've been ...lookout  
I thought I was your man and oh ooh  
  
I wonder who's there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who ...who's there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
(It's been so long)  
Since you've called me, yeah  
(I thought our love was strong)  
Just the way a love should be  
(And now that you've gone)  
I sit here and wonder  
  
Bridge II:  
I've seen so many guys  
Take that look into your eyes  
And think they're in paradise  
  
Repeat [Chorus:]  
  
Fade  
  
I don't wanna be in love if you don't love me  
And I love you so, I betcha that you don't know  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder  
  
And I wonder who thatcha got loving you  
And I wonder why you're with some other guy  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder  
  
Don't wanna be a fool for no one, you see  
And I want you so, I bet you don't even know  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder

I thought sometime alone  
Was what we really needed  
You said this time would hurt more than it helps  
But I couldn't see that  
I thought it was the end  
Of a beautiful story  
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)  
And I tried to find  
Out if this one thing is true  
That I'm nothing without you  
I know better now  
And I've had a change of heart  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself  
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah  
  
And then I met someone  
And thought she could replace you  
We got a long just fine  
We wasted time because she was not you  
We had a lot of fun  
Though we knew we were faking  
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies  
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true  
That I'm nothing without you  
I know better now  
And I've had a change of heart  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself  
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Who holds my heart  
  
I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you,  
I can only prove the things I say with time,  
Please be mine,  
  
I'd rather have bad times with(please be mine) you,  
Than good times with someone else(I know)  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm(anytime),  
Than safe and warm by myself(so sure baby)  
I'd rather have hard times to gether,  
Than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart(my heart)  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you(surely),  
Than good times with someone else(surely)  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm(oh yeah),  
Than safe and warm by myself(all by myself)  
I'd rather have hard times together,  
Than to have it easy apart(you know it)  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Whooo who holds my heart

I think sometimes I can read your mind  
When you make things up I can tell you lie  
I see the things that your man can't see  
And I wonder what kind of man is he  
The one who you say is your lover  
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers  
And who is there for you and loves you like no other  
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time  
If I didn't know better  
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again  
If I didn't know better  
I'd think we were in love  
Girl, do you want to tell me something  
Oh, oh, oh  
I could be wrong about the things you say  
But I don't rub up on my friends that way  
You tell me that you've always been a flirt  
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt  
But no, you insist it's harmless playin'  
It's just a part of who you are, that it's just your nature  
And that it's fine  
You know I'm a friend, it's really nothing  
You say that I'm just like a  
That I'm just like a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My idea of a friend is when you  
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun  
But my definition of love is different  
You touch and hold each other  
And you only want to be alone clinging to each other  
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are  
Well, I know it sounds crazy but  
  
[Chorus]

Let me hold you tight if only for one night,  
Let me keep you near to ease away your fear  
It would be so nice  
If only for one night.  
I won't tell a soul  
No one has to know  
If you want to be totally discreet  
I'll be at your side  
If only for one night.  
If only for one night  
Your eyes say things I never hear from you  
My knees are shaking too  
But I'm willing willing to go through  
I must be crazy,  
Standing in this space  
Well I'm feeling no disgrace for asking.  
Let me take you home  
To keep you safe and warm  
Till the early dawn warms up  
To the sun it would be so nice  
If only for one night

If this world were mine  
I would place at your feet  
All that I own  
You've been so good to me  
If this world were mine  
  
I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees  
And it'd be your love beside me  
That would be all I need  
If this world were mine  
I'd give you anything  
  
If this world were mine  
I would make you a king  
With wealth untold  
You could have anything  
If this world were mine  
  
I'd give you each day, so sunny and blue  
And if you wanted the moonlight  
I'd give you that too  
If this world were mine, oh baby  
I'd give you anything  
  
Oh baby, you're my inspiration  
And I feel so much sensation  
When I'm in your arms  
When you squeeze me  
  
Oh, the way that you do  
Oh, the way that you love me my  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, the way that you do  
Ooh, the way that you love me  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
You know I need you honey  
You know I need you baby  
Keep on loving me  
  
Lovin' me the way you do my lover  
I love the way that you, the way that you love me, baby  
Oh and I don't wanna let you go, wanna let you go  
Wanna let you go, my love, no  
  
You know the world, the world would be yours  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah hey  
Yes, it would, yes, it would  
The world would be yours baby, baby, ooh hoo  
It would be yours

Back to back and side to side  
There's only music on my mind  
Nothing to worry about but the beat  
I wanted you to come and dance with me  
But you wanted to stay home and watch TV  
Ahhh, but when I got there to my surprise  
There was another guy looking in your eyes  
  
I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight  
From right now 'til tomorrow night  
So if you promise to love only me and be by my side  
I'll let you slide  
  
Without a doubt tonight is the night  
That we gon' really roll when the time is right  
And we're gonna carry it into the dawn  
Oh, but where are you, where can you be?  
I've been waiting, it seems an eternity  
I took our favorite song from the record stack  
It was "Hey, Jimmy Mack"  
When are you coming back?  
  
Well I'm so disappointed you're gone tonight  
'Cause your love is the spice of my life  
But if you hurry back in the mornin'  
Then, alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
Up and down, pacing around, walking in my sleep  
'Cause you've got a promise to keep  
You've got to come back  
And love, love, love, love me right  
And, huh, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
I can't wait till tomorrow, baby  
Can't you come over tonight?  
I can't get to sleep my baby  
Come and rock my cradle left to right  
I tossed and turned and called you up  
But there wasn't anybody home  
It makes me sad, I need you bad  
But I guess I'm just gonna have to wait until tomorrow comes  
Slide, I knew it, I knew it.  
How could you do it?  
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
I'll let you slide  
Oh, how could you do it, how could you do it?  
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
I hired me a private eye  
To check up on your cool little alibis  
And what he discovered was woeful to me  
Baby, if you intend to stay with me  
Then you can't see the guys I know you see  
Come on, let's make up and promise to start anew  
Let's take the morning off, I've got some plans for you  
  
Making love by the moon can be mighty fine  
But when the sun rises, so do I  
So if you rock it to me in the morning  
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
Really missed you today, I was on the run  
So wake me up when the morning comes  
I think I'll dance to some music and groove on the party lights  
And let you slide tonight  
  
Get up, oooh, let's love baby  
Be my sugar and spice in the mornin'  
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight  
  
Get up, oooh, let's love baby  
It's really nice in the mornin'  
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight  

I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Won't you forgive me baby  
I'm only human baby  
Won't you forgive me for that?  
Won't you forgive me baby  
I'm only human baby  
Won't you forgive me for that?  
  
Your love can be so strong  
It makes it hard to give some back  
So I try and I try and I give and I give  
And I get so darn excited I can't relax  
Making me the human that I am  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
When we search for love  
We must be lucky, baby  
And it's because there are many people in the world  
Who think love is not that necessary  
I had you and I blew it all  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
And now I know for sure  
I must be lucky baby  
You chose me out of all the people in the world  
And I think love is very necessary  
You've forgiven me after all  
?Cause I let you know  
  
I'm only human baby  
Ain't I allowed to make mistakes  
You put your guilt on me  
And it's causing my poor heart to break, yeah  
Making me the human that I am  
  
Just like you, my love  
Just like you, my baby  
Just like you, my love  
Just like you, my baby  
If you forgive, if you forgive me too  

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
And to run where  
The brave dare not go  
To right the unrightable wrong  
And to love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
This is my quest  
To follow that star  
No matter how hopeless  
No matter how far  
To fight for the right  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march,  
March into hell  
For that heavenly cause  
And I know  
If I'll only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart  
Will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
And the world will be  
Better for this  
That one man, scorned  
And covered with scars,  
Still strove with his last  
Ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable,  
The unreachable,  
The unreachable star  
And I'll always dream  
The impossible dream  
Yes, and I'll reach  
The unreachable star

Another sad day, another lonely day  
For all we know some people only cry  
They have no good times, no poetry rhymes  
They don't know how or when or if or why  
Why the goodness never stays  
Or why love didn't come again today  
  
Isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble  
Isn't there someone who sees  
I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
I know you dream at night and lay your feelings down  
And you wish your life could be more like your dreams  
What a moonlit sound, your voice is not too loud  
But somehow I hear it coming through to me  
I pray you hang on to your dream  
And I hope it gives you all the love you need  
You need  
  
Isn't there someone who knows that you're hurting  
Is there someone to believe  
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
Don't you miss love, I know I often do  
That's why I'm pulling you closer to me  
But like anything you can't see  
It's just a little harder to believe  
  
Isn't there someone who loves you completely  
Isn't there someone like me  
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
I can be the someone that you need  

Lady, let me dry the rain drops from your beautiful hair  
That's all I ever want to do  
And darling let be the one you can always depend on  
You know I will never let you down  
Cause I, want to spend my whole life just hoping  
That I can please you, cause that's all I ever want to do  
Its all about you, its not about me  
There is no one more beautiful than you are to me  
Its all about you, its not about me  
And I am proud to know that you have me here by your side  
Cause its all about you, hey, hey  
Lady, I will be the sunshine that brighten up your way  
And it doesn't have to be a special day  
Please, let me take you to a sacred place where only lovers go  
Our own little hide away  
Cause I, want to spend my whole life just hoping  
That I can please you, cause that's all I ever want to do  
Its all about you, its not about me  
There is no one more beautiful than you are to me  
Its all about you, its not about me  
And I am proud to know that you have me here by your side  
Girl, I have search all over the world  
Trying to find that special girl  
But when I looked into you eyes  
I knew you were the one for me  
So now I am giving my life to you  
So what ever you want  
What ever you need  
I am willing and able to give  
(Repeat until fade)  
Its all about you, its not about me  
There is no one more beautiful than you are to me  
Its all about you, its not about me  
And I am proud to know that you have me here by your side

Didn't know 'til today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that you would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard for me to say why  
Kinda sad, kinda blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you were in my heart  
Though we were far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard for me to say why  

Something's goin' on, it's the middle of the night  
And my "esp" woke me up  
  
I know what's going on girl, you ain't been treating me right  
And your sweet talking ain't enough  
I know you're messing with at least two other guys  
You fooled me a long time but the kid is gettin' wise  
  
Don't hug me, don't kiss me, don't "love me down"  
Excuse me, but you see this love affair is?  
  
Over now  
(You did me bad)  
Over now  
It's over now  
(You treated me so bad)  
Over now  
(It's all over baby)  
  
I didn't know it when I walked into the house  
But you were on the telephone  
That's when I heard you tell him to come over tonight  
Said you were gonna be alone  
  
I heard you mention that I had some place to go  
You helped me pack my things, but it's you whose got to go  
  
You're busted! You must have fooled me for a while  
But honey, as they say "Hit the road!" It's all?  
  
You can go now, keep your voice down  
There's no need to fuss and shout  
Use the back door, I don't want no  
Nosy neighbors to see you checkin' out  
  
"Get out!"  
  
Bye baby, so long, it's been "Oh wow!"  
If you really loved me I wouldn't say it's?  

Strumming my pain with his fingers,  
Singing my life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Telling my whole life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song ...  
  
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.  
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.  
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.  
  
Strumming my pain with his fingers,  
Singing my life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Telling my whole life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song ...  
  
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,  
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.  
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on ...  
  
Strumming my pain with his fingers,  
Singing my life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Telling my whole life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song ...  
  
He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.  
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.  
But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.  
  
Strumming my pain with his fingers,  
Singing my life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Telling my whole life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song ...  
  
He was strumming, oh, he was singing my song.  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Killing me softly with his song,  
Telling my whole life with his words,  
Killing me softly with his song ...  
With his song ...

I see the way he treats you  
I feel the tears you cry  
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad  
There's nothin' I can do, baby  
'Cause your lover is my best friend  
And I guess that's where the story ends  
So I've gotta try to keep it inside  
You'll never be, never be mine  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
If it was my arms you were running to  
I'd give you love in these arms of mine  
If I was the one in your life  
  
If I could have just one wish  
I'd wish that you were mine  
I would hold you near, kiss away those tears  
I'd be so good to you, baby  
You're the one I want next to me  
But I guess that's just not meant to be  
He's there in your life, he's sharing your nights  
I'll never be, never be, never be right  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
I want to reach out and feel you beside me, beside me  
Right here, right now, right beside me baby, baby  
And take you in my arms right now  
And scream I love you right out loud  
And then someday I'll pray I'll find  
I'll find the strength to turn to you and say  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
If I was the one, if I was the one, the one  
If I was the one in your life

You talk about me as if I'm not there  
You don't even whisper 'cause you just don't care  
I stand there and listen to my life go by  
And at times I wonder why I even try  
  
Well I try because I like to finish what I start  
And I have faith it can get better tomorrow  
But it won't if you keep treating me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Say that you won't treat me  
The way you're treating me  
Say that you won't  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you don't even see  
Like I'm invisible  
  
You brag to your friends how much I must want ya  
You said I was someone you could do with or without  
You're so confident that I'd never leave you  
No wonder you're surprised that I am walking out  
  
Well, I have to leave no matter how sad it might be  
Because this hurt's become my reality  
And I won't let you keep on treating me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Say that you won't treat me  
The way you're treating me  
Say that you won't  
I see you but you just keep looking right through me  
Like someone you don't even see  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Well I finally got the nerve to move on  
'cause a fly kind of guy like me  
Surely deserves more, much more  
My new love can see what's inside of me  
And she told me to thank you  
For the good love that you blew, and oh  
  
I wish you could see the way she looks at me  
She don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly  
She don't hide me from her friends when we have company  
And she never ever makes me feel  
Like I'm invisible  
  
And after we lay here, she wants me to stay here  
I'm not just for making love then expected to leave  
I'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet  
And she'd never ever walk on by me  
Like I'm invisible  
  
Like I'm invisible

Learn to love and you learn to survive  
My mistake was thinking love wouldn't catch me  
It was the story of my life  
I awakened seeing with new eyes  
I begged forgiveness, but love wouldn't hear me  
Taught you to fear me, baby  
  
Love forgot we used to be just fine  
And love forgot about the tender times  
Love forgot to ask you if you'd want to give me  
Give me one more try  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Love can't love someone who breaks a vow  
But I was not myself, my heart wasn't in it  
I still loved you every minute  
I could fix it if you show me how  
You didn't hear it from somebody else, I told you  
Praying you'd let me hold you  
  
(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive  
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it  
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way  
Our poetry will ever rhyme  
I think love forgot this time  
  
But who would have ever known  
I'd ever be tempted, but I'm hopin'  
Love will show me what to do  
'cause if it was all so easy  
Then anybody else coulda shown me  
I don't understand how you wouldn't know  
I never even meant it  
  
(I can't believe) Did love forget this was the only time  
(Impossible) Did love forget I tried to set things right  
(It couldn't be) Did love forget to remember  
That regret lives in this heart of mine  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
(I can't believe) Love forgot the power to forgive  
(Impossible) And love forgot that we depend on it  
(It couldn't be) Love forgot that it's the only way  
That poetry will ever rhyme  
Maybe love forgot this time  
  
Did you forget this time  
Did you forget this time  
Don't forget me now  
Don't forget me now  
Did you forget somehow  
Did you forget somehow

I love it, love it  
When you touch on me  
And I love it, love it  
Can't be enough for me  
  
I just love it, love it  
When your love is strong  
You see I love it, love it  
The tight that you hold on  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in  
  
I can't believe it  
I don't never get excited  
So how in this world  
Could I end up so delighted?  
  
I'm just hooked on your love  
And I'm takin' it to the street  
And tell the world  
All about you  
  
Let me prove it  
I can do it  
Anything you can ever want it  
Hold on  
  
I don't see why not  
We can give it less than we got  
With our hearts on fire  
Love and desire  
It's gonna take it higher  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in  
  
Let me show you girl  
I wanna know you any way you could ever please  
Hold on  
  
I don't see how we could love endlessly  
With our hearts on fire  
Love and desire  
Will always take it to you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in

What are we saying?  
For what are we praying?  
Using the words we both wanna hear  
  
What are we doing?  
The whole thing is proving  
We're feeling the same way we always did  
  
So, here we go once again  
It's just like back when  
I clearly remember the way we were then  
So come back and love me again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I waited all this time for you  
But, you can't tell love what to do  
It's so hard but it's true  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me, again  
  
I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken  
But, if we take it slowly, it won't have to be  
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart  
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me  
  
Even as strong as I am  
I don't think I can  
Lost outside the world  
I don't know just where I stand  
So hurry back girl, and love the boy again  
  
I was the one who adored you  
And I'd wait a million years for you  
But, you can't tell love where to go  
This is one thing that we know  
You used to love me completely  
And I'd really love you to need me  
So darling, tell me you can find the way  
Find a way to love me again  
  
Find any way that you can, love me again  
Just think it over and then, love me again  

I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
  
The time is right, you hold me tight  
And love's got me high  
Please tell me, 'Yes' and don't say, 'No'  
Honey, not tonight  
  
Move a little close to me, you owe it to yourself  
And I will selfishly take a little for myself  
And it's because of you  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Yeah, yeah  
  
The time is right, turn down the lights  
And take my hand, ooh, ooh, yeah  
We'll take a flight and spend the night  
In wonderland  
  
And I need to have you next to me in more ways than one  
And I refuse to leave till I see the mornin' sun  
Creep through your window pane  
Because love won't let me wait  
Not another minute  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah  
  
And I need your love so desperately and only you can set me free  
When I make to you, we'll explode in ecstasy  
And I won't take the blame  
That love won't let me wait  
  
Love won't, no, no, no  
Love won't, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Love won't  
I said  
(Love won't let me wait)  
  
My baby  
My temperature's risin', ooh  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Not another minute  
(Love won't let me wait) Won't let me  
  
Baby, baby  
(I can't wait) I can't wait (I can't wait) I can't wait, I can't wait (I can't
wait)  
I can't wait, no, no, no, can't wait  
(Wait) No way, no way, no, no, no, no  
No way, no way, no, no  
(Doo,ooh,) Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,yeah  
(Wait) I cant wait not another minute  
Not another minute (I can't wait, I can't wait) I'll be there (I can't wait)
yes, I will  
I'll be there

When I wake up in the morning, love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something strange without a warning, love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I look at you  
And the world is all right with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When somebody else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be a lovely day (it's gonna be)  
It's gonna be today  
It's gonna be a lovely day  
Today I love the world and I love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be today  
A lovely day today  
It's gonna be today  
A lovely day today

Superman can fly high way up in the sky  
'Cause we believe he can  
So what we choose to believe can always work out fine  
It's all in the mind  
So think of a place and imagine a time  
And let's go be lovers  
  
Believing me, Ooo Wee baby  
Is believing right-oh yeah, and  
  
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl  
So make me a believer  
Wanna love you girl  
  
Ooo so near  
And forever keep you here  
Forget all about whatever we fear  
And let's just be lovers  
Loving and loving, oh love is the way  
To make me stay  
  
I know the way to persuade me over to your side  
And I am sure you can  
So if you get me to believe  
It all will work out fine  
'Cause you'll blow my mind  
So let's pick a place, a day, and a time  
And then we'll be lovers  
Loving and loving, oh love is the way  
To make me stay  

I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me  
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy  
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you  
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya  
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you  
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say "I love you"  
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in  
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in  
  
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you  
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop  
Oh my love, a million days in your arms  
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop  
Never too much, never too much  
Never too much, never too much  
  
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started  
I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted  
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'  
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'  
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?  
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler  
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'  
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning  
  
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you  
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop  
Oh my love, a million days in your arms  
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop  
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you is never  
A thousand kisses from you  
A thousand kisses from you is never to much  

Hey baby, what's your game?  
I ask you the question and the answer's still the same  
How can you go on day to day  
Without someone to care  
If I wanted to take that chance  
If I wanted to be your man  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you won't love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you won't love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you won't let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do?  
Hey there baby, you're not shy  
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...  
Every time I bring up love  
You run for cover  
Suppose I told you something that's true  
Suppose I told you that I want you  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you won't love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you won't love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you don't want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do?  
Heart feels empty, there's no one home  
Nights are longer when you're alone  
You tell me that you feel lonely  
But you won't love nobody  
You tell me that you got a big heart  
But you won't love no one  
You lie and you moan and you bitch and you groan  
But you won't let nobody in to love  
What am I gonna do?  
You tell me all the guys want you  
But you won't love nobody  
You keep your heart in seclusion  
And you won't love no one  
You game and you flirt and you talk a lot of dirt  
But you don't want nobody to love  
What are you gonna do?  

You found me when I was alone  
You held me and you made my heart your home  
I sit around and dream  
And there's no one else I see  
Cuz there's no one else for me  
I don't feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I don't let anyone tell me what to do  
How to love, who to love  
They don't know you like I know you  
This is so natural, it's hard to believe  
People all around me  
And there's no one else I see  
Cuz there's no one else for me  
I don't feel like crying  
  
I have no tears  
Cuz I have no reason to cry  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
  
I have the world, and I have no fears  
And I know where my happiness is  
Now that I've got you to care  
Now that you've got me forever  
Everything I don't want is gone  
And I know I can't live without your love  
  
All the things I wanted now  
Are starting to be true  
And all the dreams I ever dreamed  
Are coming now that I have you  
Love is on my mind  
And my heart's no longer blue  
Now that I have you  
Oh, now that I have you  
Now that I have you  

We shared a life, we shared a heart  
But what we united seems to be breaking apart  
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core  
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours  
  
I'll keep the same old things I had when we met  
And you'll keep what's yours ?cause that would only be fair  
But what about the heart that we both created together?  
  
[Chorus]  
We used to be the toast of the town  
We used to have the best love of all  
We had blue skies but they came falling down  
What happened to us  
  
You and I once were lovers  
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong  
So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong  
But I know with time things that start to mend  
  
So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again  
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been  
don't worry, I will start all over and then  
We will get back the heart that we both created together  
  
[CHORUS]  
  
Last night I cried but girl you were not here  
So it was just a big waste of tears  
But then I smiled, I heard your voice in my ear  
Tellin' me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning  
  
[Chorus]

One day I was cryin'  
'Cause I thought that  
Love was something that would  
Never come my way, no way  
  
That's when somebody told me  
Not to worry  
They said love would surely one day be my friend  
And I would never have to be without it again  
And it's because  
  
Once you know how  
You just never forget how to  
It may seem kinda crazy  
But it's a sho-nuff thing  
Been tested and found true  
Once you know how  
You just never forget  
How to love  
  
I'm in love  
Yes, I am, at last  
I can love  
Yeah  

I don't want to put no chains on you  
I just wanna be here lovin you  
Cause you touch me in a place  
That puts a smile right on my face  
But I don't wanna be holding you  
Baby only for an hour or two  
I want you with me  
In these arms for all eternity  
  
I don't mean to put you under pressure  
I just wanna spend some time together  
And baby if it's just for one night  
Then give me just one nite with you  
Every day of your life  
One kiss in the morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so right  
Everyday to have just one night  
With you, with you  
  
Hey hey love the things you say  
The way you move  
I'd love to stay here making love with you  
Cause your just so good to hold  
And you rap your arms around my soul  
So come on and take this heart of mine  
You can have it till the end of time  
I want you to be every single part of me  
  
I don't mean to put you under pressure  
I just wanna have your love for ever  
So baby if its just for one nite  
One nite  
Give me just one nite with you  
Everyday of your life  
One kiss every morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Give just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so right  
Everday to have just one night with you  
  
Baby give me your kisses for a lifetime  
Baby show me your smiling face each day  
Baby hold me in your arms forever  
Cause I need you by my side  
And I won't be satisfied  
  
Until you give me just one night with you  
Everyday of your life  
One kiss every morning  
After 100 kisses each night  
Give me just one night with you  
Just one night with you  
Everyday for all time  
It would be so nice  
Everyday to have just one night with you  
One night with you  
Give me one  
Give me just one night with you  
One night for all my life

I had known you for quite sometime,  
But the thought of love never crossed my mind.  
It seemed to be on the other side of the world.  
  
Too many times had I loved,  
And not cared at all about love.  
Just to have something to do.  
Then I saw a different you,  
And, oh, my.  
  
There's so many stories of love,  
All with the wonders of love.  
And so very sad I would be,  
'Cause none belonged to me.  
Could be it's all for the voice,  
So I finally let it rest.  
Sad but I thought that maybe  
Love wasn't meant for me...  
  
There was love.  
There was love.  
There was love,  
On the other  
Side of the world.  
  
So much love.  
So much love.  
So much love,  
On the other  
Side of the world.  
  
I had known you for quite sometime,  
And the thought of love never crossed my mind.  
It seemed to be on the other side  
Of the world.  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you, everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
Ain't it crazy how things can change your life?  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
Ain't it crazy how things can change your life?  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world...  
  
So crazy how things can change your life.  
Now that love is you everything is right,  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world.  
Of the world.  
Of the world.

At Christmas Eve, tomorrow's near  
I hope that love will bring you here, home for a while  
I'll make the best of what's for me  
But I would love you here to be holding me now  
  
How I wish that you and I and love could be close  
'Cause the holidays are when I need you most, so  
Another year, another chance  
A different song, a different dance  
For us to try  
  
Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)  
Please come home for Christmas (and stay)  
  
Good morning love, it's me again  
As Christmas day begins again, I think of you  
I know that time has passed us by  
I tell myself to stop but I still dream it's true  
  
How I dream that you and I and love could be one  
'Cause Christmas time should never be lonesome  
Remember when our love began  
You held my heart, I held you hand  
Ready to fly  
  
Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)  
Please come home for Christmas (and stay)

When I say goodbye it is never for long  
'Cause I know our love still lives on  
It will be again exactly like it was  
'Cause I believe in the power of love  
  
When you're close I can feel the power  
When it's love I can always tell  
Love for me is the best thing now  
It's something that I know so well  
  
Hold me closer and every minute  
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah  
Hold me tighter and take me higher  
And feel the fire of the power of love  
  
Did you know that your feelings show  
You thought your love was locked up inside  
But when your senses start to overload  
Love is something you should never hide  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone to try  
I promise you'll reach the sky  
One thing that we can't deny  
Is the power of love  
  
So close your eyes and you can feel it  
Comin' straight from above, it's the power of love  
You can't deny it, so don't even try it  
Let the feelin' sweep you off your feet  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone you see  
How much better the world could be  
For them and for you, for me  
With the power of love  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
My-my-my-my-my-my  
You've got to feel the power  
Yeah, yeah  
  
So listen up and you will hear it  
A symphony from above, it's the power of love  
So glad we've found it, now there's no way around it  
Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet  
  
You've got to believe in love  
It's a feeling that's next to none  
Can't stop until we are one  
With the power of love  
  
Tell everyone to try  
I promise you'll reach the sky  
One thing that you can't deny  
Is the power of love  
  
When we walk down the street  
We don't care who we see or who we meet  
Don't need to run, don't need to hide  
'Cause we've got something burning inside, yeah  
  
We've got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all, ooh...ooh...  
We've got love power  
And together we can't fall, sing it with  
  
We've got love (Love) power (Power)  
It's the greatest power of them all  
Oh, we've got love (Love) power (Power)  
And together we can't fall, and all the good  
  
(We've got love) Ooh, we've got love (Power), yes, we do  
(It's the greatest power of them all)  
(We've got love) Love-love-love (Power)  
(And together we can't fall) We'll never fall if we've got  
  
(We've got love) If we've got love (Power)  
(It's the greatest power of them all)  
(We've got love) Tell the world we got love (Power) tell the people about it  
(And together we can't fall) And it's all because we've got, we've got  
  
We've got love (Love) power (Power)  
Oh, it's the greatest power of them all and if you believe me  
We've got more love (Love) power (Power)  
And together we can't fall, I know, can't fall  
  
We can't fall (Love) when there's a love power (Power)  
'Cause it's the greatest power of them all

I can only speak for  
The things that I've been through  
So when it comes to our love  
I'll talk the whole night through  
About the love I've been missin'  
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'  
Don't you love me  
Can't we stay together  
  
Like when we used to be in love  
But now you've got your head on another cloud  
Girl, we had a good thing  
But now you've turned around  
Don't you care how this love we've had turns out  
  
Promise me you'll leave me never  
And that we'll be in love forever  
Promise me you'll leave me never  
And that we'll be in love forever  
  
We can work at our love  
And make it all brand-new  
If we stay together  
There's nothing we can't do  
Improve the lovin' is what I'm seeing  
Let's do it baby  
Don't fight the feeling  
Won't you love me  
Can't we stay together  

Through the mirror of my mind  
Time after time  
I see reflections of you and me  
  
Reflections of the way life used to be  
Reflections of the love you took from me  
  
I'm all alone now  
No love to shield me  
Trapped in a world that's  
A distorted reality.  
  
Happiness you took from me  
And left me alone  
With only memories.  
  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Through these tears that I'm crying  
Reflects the hurt I can't control  
Cause although you're gone  
I keep holding on  
To the happy times  
Ooh when you were mine  
  
AS I peer out through the window  
Of lost time  
Looking over my yesteryear  
And all this love I gave all in vain  
  
Chorus  
  
(all the love) All the love I've wasted  
(all those tears) All the tears that I've tasted  
(ooh ,ooh) All in vain  
(all in vain , till nothing remains)  
  
Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt  
That you have caused  
  
Everywhere I turn  
Seems like everything I see  
Reflects the love that used to be  
In you I put all my faith and trust  
And right before my eyes my world has turned to dust  
  
After all those nights I sat alone and wept  
Just a hand full of promises and all that's left of loving you  
  
Reflections of  
The way life used to be  
Reflections of  
The love you took from me  
In you I put all my faith and trust  
Right before my eyes my world was turned to dust  
Reflections of ( fade out)

It was early Sunday morning  
Everyone in the house was still asleep  
She made some toast and coffee  
Took a shower and made herself smell sweet  
She said, "I don't want a bus ride,  
I believe that the walk might help me think  
Got a heart kind of heavy  
I need some big hat and gloves, shoes and bag religion!"  
  
Religion  
That's my decision  
Some of that "make me feel better when I shout!!!" religion  
That's my decision  
  
Papa Henry was full of spice  
He was a man usually nice  
But something got into him last night  
Made him want to fuss and holler  
The entire house was in a sweat  
His bottle got broken and the floor got wet  
"Clean it up!" you could hear him scream  
Then he said, "I'm going out"  
I need religion  
  
Religion  
That's my decision  
Some of that "raise up the roof, 90 proof" religion  
That's my decision  
Religion  
It's my decision, oh yes it is  
That's my decision  
  
It's the story about a good family  
Who doesn't live anymore in good harmony  
They are people who love their daughter and son  
They try to give them religion  
  
Little Billy likes his best friend Jack  
How in the world could he be like that  
Mama and Henry wanna have that chat  
Boy, you need religion  
  
Little Betty, what'cha gonna do?  
There's a child growing inside of you  
You should've stopped and thought things through  
Little girl you need a vision of religion  
  
Religion  
And that's my decision  
Some of that "how'd I get on Ricky Lake" religion  
That's my decision  
Religion  
Get a little,  
Religion  
Get a little  
Religion  

If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff  
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice  
And believe me when I tell you  
  
This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life  
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)  
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)  
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)  
  
So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness  
Right in the middle  
Perfect love sounds real nice  
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine  
It was always up and down, in then out  
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about  
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time  
  
And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night  
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)  
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)  
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)  
  
It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the
groove  
Right in the middle  
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality  
That's why they say "Que sera, sera"  
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be  
  
Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:  
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)  
Not all sunshine, not all rain  
(You know that too much of a good thing is really no good)  
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)  
  
To let your good times roll, keep your self-control, there's a lot of soul  
Right in the middle

I hope you hear this 'cause I'm about to say it now  
Guess I'm to blame and it's just a shame  
Cause I had the chance to tell you what you meant  
But I lived my life thinking I had time  
And that in my mind I'd get to it  
  
Now you've gone away, not a single day goes by  
When I don't think about it  
Your spirit's all around, I can say it now  
I hope you hear this  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
So oh, I've got to tell everybody  
Don't make the same mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
It's alright to say I love you out loud  
And it's all good, so don't you keep it inside  
Let it out, do it today  
No no no, don't you wait  
Cause it just might be too late  
To say I love you  
  
Don't walk a mile inside my shoes  
Cause if you do, you're gonna regret it  
Don't take it lightly thinking they might be  
Here or there tomorrow  
  
Why you want to wait, communicate  
Don't assume that they already know  
How much, how much you're really feeling  
And you really, really love them  
  
Now it's a shame that I found out the hard way  
And it ain't the same  
Cause you never ever got to hear me say  
That I love you, 'cause I waited too late  
It's like I would tell anybody  
Don't make the same mistake like I did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Those three words make all the difference in the world  
You might wait and miss your chance  
So don't be scared to say what you're feeling  
You can't turn back the hands of time  
If you get the chance, do it right  
Let it out, say it now  
Say it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm ready  
Ready to shout it out, shout it out loud  
So ready  
Oh how I wish I could tell you right now  
But I waited too late  
So today I won't make the same mistake, no  
I won't do it, and if I get the chance I'll say it  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
It's alright

Hit the town in the cold of the night  
Looking 'round for the warmth of the light  
There was fog on the road  
So I guess no one saw me arriving  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign  
It said if you're alone  
You can make this your home  
If you want to, oww  
  
Searching, searching  
(For so long)  
Searching  
(Searching)  
Searching, searching  
(I just wanted to dance)  
Searching  
  
Stepped outta the night  
It was brighter inside  
Someone come and asked me my name  
Taken back by surprise  
When I saw with my eyes  
A girl in a love's disguise  
  
She said stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
Haven't got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister, stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
What I've got's hot stuff  
The night is ours  
  
Coffee glass that had fell from my hand  
Like a child couldn't quite understand  
What was I doin' there  
Far away from nowhere, on my own  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Just the light playing tricks with my mind  
Was she there in a crowd  
Was the music too loud, was I dreaming  
  
Searching, searching  
(For so long)  
Searching  
(I don't want romance)  
(I just want my chance, searching)  
Searching, searching  
(Yeah)  
Searching  
  
Just came by here by chance  
Only wanted to dance  
No news, no her, no, no, no one  
Taken back by surprise  
What's in front of my eyes  
This girl in a love's disguise  
  
She said stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
Haven't got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister, stop, stop, stop  
Get out your heart  
What I've got's hot stuff  
The night is ours

For love you pay the price  
You give it up, you sacrifice  
And if necessary you comprimise  
Sometimes it's bitter sweet  
You've got to try eight days a week  
To create a good enough love to keep  
You see hearts belong to fire  
So does her love  
She burns me up with desire  
  
My girl's love is right on time  
"Sweet" and "sweet and ever kind"  
She's so fine  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We don't fuss, we never fight  
'Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
It was out of my hands  
I did my best, please understand  
I was late for one of our evening plans  
Champagne, dinner for two  
With candlelight, she set the mood  
But there wasn't anything I could do  
  
But, she is so forgiving  
The one thing I know is  
It's off her love I'm living  
  
That girl's love is right on time  
"Sweeter than sweet" and "ever kind"  
She's so fine  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
Even when I come home late at night  
We don't fuss, we never fight  
'Cause the girl loves me to the line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
When I go out to play  
She doesn't mind if I'm a little bit late  
She knows I think about her face  
Till I get home  
Till I get back home  
What we gonna do tonight?  
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside  
So let's just love until we get things right  
And waste a whole lotta time  
I don't mind  
  
I tell her things she can't repeat  
Makes her little heart just skip a beat  
She blush a little bit  
And then I find  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
Even though our love is "C'est Si Bon"  
Sometimes I like to be alone  
Ring the girl on her private line  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
Go to work early, come back late  
Outta my head, can't concentrate  
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
She's better even than she used to be  
Loving her is no mystery  
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  
  
When I call her in the middle of the day  
She's busy at work, but it's okay  
But not too busy to give me time  
She doesn't, she doesn't  
She don't mind  

I had a lover  
Who did not love me back  
I did everything that a guy could do  
I couldn't do more than that  
I felt so helpless  
I thought things would never change  
Then I saw my girl  
walking down on the avenue one day  
I said, "I wanna talk to you"  
  
I wasn't afraid to cry  
Emotion was in my eyes  
She took me on a natural high  
When I said, "I love you girl of mine"  
And then she said, "I love you back"  
She loves me back  
  
I had a lover  
Who did not love me back  
I bought her candy canes and dolls and flowers  
And I took her to Coney Island  
Now, who could do more than that?  
It was a problem  
Until on that fateful day  
I saw my girl walking down on the avenue  
She said, "I wanna talk to you"  
  
She wasn't afraid to cry  
Emotion was in her eyes  
She took me on a natural high  
I said, "I love you girl of mine"  
And then she said, "I love you back"  
She loves me back  
  
I don't think our love's gonna lose  
There ain't no way  
I'm taking my time to convince her  
That love's here to stay, hey  
Love is here to stay because  
She loves me back  
  
We weren't afraid to cry  
Emotion was in our eyes  
She took me on a natural high  
I said, "I love you girl of mine"  
And then she said, "I love you back"  
She loves me back  

Why did you tell your girlfriend you were hanging with the boys  
She called me last night and I tried to cover for ya  
She asked if I liked the flick that we all went out to see  
I said, "ooo uh, it was nice"  
She said, "Don't you lie to me"  
You messed up you shoulda warned me first (she saw you)  
I'm sad to tell ya  
You shoulda told me 'cause you made it worse (she saw you) unlucky fella  
You better take that credit card (she saw you) to Cartier  
You better hope with all you got (she saw you)  
She feels like forgiving you today  
Too bad for you  
You were out there trying to be a player, now she's gone, it's true  
It's hard to feel that sorry for you  
She saw you, now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend  
She's convinced you took her heart  
And played with it like a toy  
And from what I heard, you just might need you a lawyer  
It's too late for feeling bad, you did not respect the girl  
You tried to play around  
And got caught with your pants down  
You can't escape from what you've done (she saw you) your time is up  
You're like a deer who's caught up in (she saw you) the headlights of love  
You can't be too proud to plead (she saw you) she's gonna make you pay  
Forgiveness is what you need (she saw you) she's too mad to let you get away  
Looks bad to me  
You were busy trying to be a player  
Now she's gone, breathe deep  
You can't be doing that creep, creep, creep, creep  
She saw you, now this is the end  
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend

She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
Not long ago I was,  
A sad and lonely boy,  
Did not know how to get better,  
  
Then heaven up above,  
Sent me a super love,  
And now I'm happy forever.  
  
No one wants to believe,  
I've got a perfect love,  
They say I'm just talking crazy,  
  
But I can prove it's true,  
If you'll allow me to,  
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady  
  
She's all that I could explore,  
She's more than a dream,  
She's my everything  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
She's a Superlady,  
She is, too much,  
Wish I could make her mine,  
  
What a superlady,  
a-ha, alright,  
She's so fine,  
  
Whoever thought I would,  
Be feeling half this good,  
The world for me is new place,  
  
I'll drink to happiness,  
Because our love's the best,  
The wine for me has a new taste,  
  
I'll let my lady know,  
I'll never let her go,  
Forever I'm gonna hold on,  
  
She said she feel's the same,  
Don't wanna play no game,  
Just wants our love to live on and on,  
  
Wish I could fly to the sky,  
And write out her name,  
  
Climb to the top of the world,  
And loudly exclaim,  
She's my everything  
(She's my everything)  
  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
I love (that superlady)  
  
She 's much, too much,  
she's got that super love  
She's much, too much for my heart  

SINCE I LOST MY BABY  
William Robinson, Jr and Warren Moore  
(album: Forever, For Always, For Love - 1982)  
  
  
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light  
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright  
But after I've been crying all night  
The sun is cold and the new day seems old  
Since I lost my baby  
Oh since I lost my baby  
  
The birds are singing and the children are playing  
There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying  
Not a sad word should a young heart be saying  
But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor  
Since I lost my baby (Since I lost my baby)  
Oh since I lost my baby  
My baby, my baby, my baby  
Next time I'll be kinder, to my baby  
Won't you please help me find her (I've got to find that girl)  
Someone just remind her (Someone just remind her x2)  
Of this love she left behind her (Of Me)  
Till I find her I'll be trying to (Till I find her, I'll be trying to)  
Everyday I'm growing kinder  
Tryin'  
Inclined to  
Find her  
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)  
Been looking everywhere (My baby)  
Hey baby I really really care  
  
My determination is fading fast  
So fast, so fast so fast  
Exploration is a thing of the past  
I can't see how my hope's gonna last  
Good things are bad and what's happy is sad  
So sad, so sad, I'm sad, so sad, so sad  
  
Since I lost my baby (since I lost my girl)  
Oh Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)  
I feel so bad, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
I feel so sad, yeah-eh,  
Since I lost my-, since I lost my-, my, my, my, my baby  
Cause everything is gone, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
And it's hard girl, to carry on,  
Since I lost my-, since I lost my-, my, my, my, my baby  
I know it's up to me, (Got to find that girl, I've got to find that girl)  
What's gonna happen to me  
Since I lost my baby  
What's gonna happen to me  
Oh I don't, I don't know, what I'm gonna do no, no, no, no I don't know  
Since I lost my baby,  
I don't know, I don't know, What to do without, my girl, my girl, my girl, I
don't know Since I lost my baby,  
I can't find her no where, no where, no where, no where, no where oh no  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
Yeah, I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where no where, no
where, no where, no where  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where, no where  
(Don't know, I don't know, since I lost my baby, I don't know, since I lost my
baby, yeah)  
  
I can't find them no where, no where, no where, no where, no where (fade)

Love has truly been good to me  
Not even one sad day  
Or minute I had since you come my way  
I hope you know I gladly go  
Anywhere you take me  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
Got to tell you how you thrill me  
I'm happy as I can be  
You have come and changed my whole world  
Bye bye sadness hello mellow  
What a wonderful day  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
And it's so amazing, so amazing  
I could stay forever, forever  
I would leave you never, never  
Cause we go amazing love  
Truly it's amazing, so amazing  
Love brought us together, together  
I would leave you never, never  
Cause we got amazing love  
  
So amazing and I've been waiting  
For a love like you  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above  
  
It's so amazing to be loved  
I'll follow you to the moon in the sky above

I am still your friend  
Standing by to catch you  
If ever life should let you down  
And you should fall.  
You don't need to pretend  
If ever doubt should find you.  
I don't need to remind you  
I'm there for you before and after all.  
I am who I am  
And I would never fool you.  
I feel the same way you do  
About honesty.  
But do we understand  
How love is sometimes jaded?  
It keeps us separated  
Even though we'll never part.  
So to be lovers  
We've got to understand  
Today is how today begins,  
Tomorrow's how it ends.  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above.  
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes it's only love.  
Loving who I am  
Is something that you've taught me.  
The kind of love you've brought me  
Takes me through the day.  
And even though our minds  
Are sometimes disagreeing  
Our hearts they're still believing  
We'll work it out and stay.  
So to be lovers  
We've got to understand  
Today is how today begins,  
Tomorrow's how it ends.  
And to be lovers  
Some things we rise above.  
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful  
But sometimes it's only love.  

I wanna tell you, baby  
The changes I've been goin' through  
Missin' you, missin' you, oh oh  
Till you come back to me  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
N-n-n-no, n-n-no  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby  
I love you  
Yeah, I really do  
  
Long ago  
And oh, so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show  
  
And your guitar  
And you sound so sweet and clear  
But you're not really here  
It's just the radio  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yeah  
I love you  
I really do  
  
(To belong) Yeah, hey, eah, yeah, hey, hey  
(To belong) Whoa, ho, oh, whoa, ho, ho,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You looked for me to be yours  
You want my love, but you're on the road  
Don't you remember me anymore  
  
Loneliness  
Is such a sad affair  
A sad affair  
And I can hardly wait  
To be with you again  
  
And what to say, to say  
To make you come again  
Oh, honey  
Come on back to me again, yeah, hey  
I wanna be, I wanna be anywhere you are  
  
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby  
You said you'd be comin' back this way again, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, woo, baby, oh, baby  
Yes, I love you

Ooh, baby, it's alright, it's alright  
Alright now  
I wonder, I wonder  
Where are you again tonight  
Are you holdin' someone else real tight  
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

Flower's bloomin', mornin' dew and the beauty seems to say  
"It's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true and gay"  
Easy livin' and we're givin' what we know we're dreamin' of  
We are one, havin' fun walkin' in the glow of love  
We're walkin', ooh  
  
Smilin' faces, goin' places, it's a wonder, it's so clear  
By a fountain, climbin' mountains, as we'll hold each other near  
Sippin' wine, we try to find that special magic from above  
As we share our affair talkin' in the glow of love  
Yeah, yeah, in the glow of love, ooh  
  
Here in glow of love  
(You're a shinin' star)  
Here in glow of love  
(No matter who you are)  
Here in glow of love, here in glow of love  
(So I want to let you know you move me, yeah, yeah)  
  
There is no better way to be  
(Hold me, caress me)  
I'm yours forever and a day, hey  
(We are a sweet bouquet, oh yeah)  
Seasons for happiness are here  
(Happy we're so happy)  
Reason we're filled with cheer is  
We'll imagine in the glow of love, yeah  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
In the glow of love yeah, ohh yeah come on  
  
Never lonely with you only time will always be our friend  
Reaching far to find a star, our destiny is Heaven sent  
Making on this lovin' tone, we'll never part, the two of us  
We'll always reminisce kissin' in the glow of love  
In the glow of love, we wanna be  
  
Here in glow of love

(We are a sweet bouquet, oh yeah)  
Seasons for happiness are here  
(Happy we're so happy, yeah)  
Reason we're filled with cheer is  
We'll imagine in the glow of love

I keep going over it and over it again in my mind  
I get these flashbacks and I feel so good  
This is one night that I'll never forget  
You see, it was just like in the movies  
I mean, it actually happened just like this...  
  
The stars were shining brighter than most of the time  
Then love came out of nowhere  
  
No thrill will ever be like  
(The night that I fell in love)  
It surely was the best thing I ever did that night  
(The night when I fell in love)  
The stars' lights were in your eyes  
(The night that I fell in love) with you  
  
I've known so many people, been to most parts of the world  
And seen some things that have blown my mind, but...  
  
I thought I would be happy without any love in my world  
But now I know that , that is so untrue  

What happened  
It seems like every time love comes  
You're never ready  
That's why they call it?  
The Rush  
  
Tell me, are you there?  
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer  
See, I've prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you  
Up in the morning  
Fell out of my bed  
Worn out, I couldn't sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be?  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time I'll  
Make it work somehow  
Guess I'm gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And it's love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Can't pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
I'm not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around, I know  
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again  
  
I can't remember when, I can't remember how  
It's very different now  
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me  
True to the touch  
I get a rush  

(If at first in love you lose)  
(Don't give up, try again)  
And love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Ooo Yeah  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Yeah  
  
So you wanted to be  
Everything you'd heard him say he'd always needed  
But, you're my everything and you mean the world to me  
Were things that he never said  
  
It's such a silly thing  
For you to say  
That you don't want love around  
Don't you know that ...  
  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around), around  
Ooo Yeah  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around)  
Yeah  
  
I wish there could be  
The kind of love  
Where there would be no wrong (No wrong, never be no wrong)  
So that heartache and pain  
And the misery of a bad love  
Would all be gone  
  
To get over the first love  
Is kinda hard, baby  
But, don't let it get you down  
Don't you know that ...  
  
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)  
The second time (Around) around  
Ooo, Yeah  
Love is gonna be better (Yeah)  
Better than ever, (Oooh Yeah) Yeah  
The second time around  
Yeah  
  
To get over the first love  
Is kinda hard, baby  
But, don't let it get you down  
Trust me, baby  
(Love will be better)  
If you trust me, baby  
(Better than ever) (Try me)  
You can love me, baby  
(The second time around)  
  
I really do believe you should try me, baby  
(Love will be better) Yeah  
(Better than ever) (Try me)  
Try me Yeah  
(The second time around) (Around, around)  
  
(Love will be better)  
If you trust me, baby  
(Better than ever)  
You can love me, baby  
(The second time around)  
I really do believe  
(Around, around)  
  
(Love will be better)  
I know  
(Better than ever)  
Next time it will  
(The second time around)  
Your love  
(Around, around)

I fell asleep last night  
And I dreamed the night  
and almost half the day away  
I just got up so that  
I can hear her say  
She's still in love  
and no one can take her love away  
Ooo love wakes me up everyday  
And I thought no one  
would ever make me feel this way  
It feels me up every time  
I hear her say  
She's still in love  
and no one will take her love away  
I wanna be love  
  
And I mean all these words I said  
And you don't have to guess  
what's going on inside me head  
Just try to know  
All the things that our heart says  
Listen to love and always  
get love to lead the way  
Whenever you love  
  
You know for love  
I'd go anywhere  
I would go there  
For love to the end of nowhere  
And for your love  
(And for your love)  
I would,  
I would  
I would love  
To just spend all my time  
With a girl who makes me  
feel her love is mine  
Someone you see  
Who would only dream of me  
And she be in love  
just because she wanna be  
She wanna be loved  
  
There's nothing better than love  
What in the world  
could you ever be thinking of  
It's better by far  
So let yourself reach for that star  
And go no matter how far  
To the one you love  
To love

Goodbye, so long  
Were the last words from you  
Seems like you're over  
All the goodness we knew  
  
You think that you're strong  
You think that you don't  
You don't need no one  
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin'  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something you'd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me  
Guess I'll suffer 'til I'm where I belong  
I'm under the pressure  
But I'll keep being strong  
  
You say that you're strong  
You say that you don't need anyone  
What in the world are you telling your friends  
I get confused every time I see them  
They said you needed me  
  
I know the people talk just for the thrill  
But the fact of the matter is still  
They said you needed me  
Take your time, re-invent your mind  
You'll feel better, you'll feel stronger  
Then decide if I'm in your life  
For forever or longer  
  
You think that you're strong  
You think that you don't  
You don't need no one  
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends  
Just to see how everyone was doin'  
And they said you needed me  
  
Said it was something you'd never admit  
But it was hard to see you going through it  
They said you needed me

Don't be discouraged, don't be dismayed  
There's hope for all in this world  
'Cause this is Christmas day  
Say a little prayer for the world  
God teach us love  
Though you think that He doesn't hear  
I know he does  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Christmas bells ring, people's hearts sing  
And I forget about all the troubles I seem to have,  
Aand I tell myself to feel how my brother feels  
Try to love him and maybe then I'll understand him  
Make a little room in our hearts  
No heart's too small  
Can't we love each other today?  
'Cause after all  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Come, come, come see the little one  
Come, come, come see the little one  
Come see the baby  
Come see the baby  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas

She gives it up till I get enough

'Til my baby comes home  
if she stays away for long  
she calls me on the phone  
I jump up when I hear her voice

That I'm just like a new guy, I'm doing  
very well  
cause I know she's coming back tonight  
  
Every night when I sleep  
I dream of my baby

then I'm alright  
'Til my baby comes home  

Love came to me that day  
Stayed longer than I planned  
But change is good, they say  
So I rearranged my world for them  
For her and love and, here I go again  
I spoke to my heart  
Said, "Open up wide"  
Then got the message you had changed your mind  
And now here I am and I just don't understand  
Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen  
There can't be no "us" honey, if "you" are missin'  
Yes I love you, yes I need you  
ain't no world for me without you  
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love...  
And it hurts you anyway  
I can't lose my soul to hope and wishing  
You don't understand me, I know that you think...  
I don't love you, I don't need you  
But, my intentions are to love you  
See, I want you, I'm just too proud...  
To beg for your love  
So don't put me through it  
Take a little time to think about what you're doing  
And try to understand why...  
Yes I love you, yes I need you  
ain't no world for me without you  
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg  
So sad the journey made  
So high the price we have to pay  
All for love...  
And it hurts you anyway  

What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
It's the only thing  
That there's just too little of  
  
[Chorus]  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we don't need another mountain  
There are mountains and hillsides  
Enough to climb  
There are oceans and rivers  
Enough to cross  
Enough to last  
Till the end of time  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we don't need another meadow  
There are cornfields and wheatfields  
Enough to grow  
And there are sunbeams and moonbeams  
Enough to shine  
So listen, Lord  
If you want to know  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love, sweet love  
It's the only thing  
That there's just too little of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More love, more love  
Everybody know that  
(the world needs love)  
Everybody, Everybody knows that  
(this world needs love)  
This world, the whole world  
(the whole world needs love)  
The whole world, the whole world  
(more love, more lovin')  
There's not enough

No one knows the side of you that I know  
No one gets to see, to feel you  
To hear you when they call  
I'm the only one you answer  
Because I know what to do  
I know what to do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
  
Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
A telephone can't take the place of your smile  
But I won't be traveling forever  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
It's not easy when the road is your driver  
But honey that's the heavy load that we bear  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, but hold out  
And do like I do  
When I need you  
  
But I won't be traveling a lifetime  
It's cold out, oh honey, hold out  
And do like I do  
  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and I'm with you baby  
And all that I so want to give you  
Is only a heartbeat away  
  
When I need love  
I hold out my hand and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day  
Honey, when I need you  
  
I'm in a cloud and I'm holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out to you  
Holding my hand out for you

We don't play any games, my girl and I  
We get by on the high of love  
And there's no time to spend on doubt or wondering  
'Cause no one else could I ever love  
You see the world outside can be cold and very lonely  
And it gets real bad  
And it makes me sad, but  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
We all live in a crazy world today  
There's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain  
And we'd be wiser to make a change, with love we could  
It's our world, we should make it good  
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely  
And it gets real bad  
It'll still make us sad  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  
Our love is out world  
And it keeps us safely from anything outside that could hurt us  
We look out from inside  
And depending on what we see  
We just hold each other tightly, hold me tightly  
'Cause sometimes it's just better to let it be  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I and love will be together, together  
Whether or not the world gets better  
You and I will truly survive  
And it's all because our love will never die  
Never ever die  

Oh, yes  
A kiss in the dark  
A certain time I can call you  
A letter of love  
But no name did you sign  
Pretending to all  
That we were just friends when I saw you  
I didn't know that you wanted me to be  
I didn't know that you wanted me for your  
(For your) To be  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
You should've let me know, from the first time baby  
That you were not, were not free to love  
How could you wait so long  
Oh, what a waste of love, baby  
I should known that you wanted me to be  
I should known  
That you wanted me for your (for your) to be  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
I won't be you secret love  
'Cause it's just a waste of my love  
I'm tellin' you from the start  
I won't be the one who gives you love  
When your other guy ain't givin' you none  
  
Don't come now, wait for awhile  
Let's meet at the place downtown  
It's a shame it has to be like this  
But I really miss you baby  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  
  
Your secret love  
Why can't we tell somebody  
'Cause secret loves  
Never last as long  
Your secret love  
Will never be your true love  
I can't be no secret baby  
It's breakin' my heart  
(You're breaking my heart)  

The world's sweetest lady  
Live around my way  
And I think that I'm in love  
Hey there sweet one  
You don't know what you've done  
I was once so lonely  
Now I only think of love, of love sweet love  
And you're the sweetest one

And I know she love me too

'Cause you're the sweetest one

Why I'm so sweetly in love, in love sweet love  
And you're the sweetest one
