Take my life and paint it black  
Until I'm sleeping  
And my promise, I take it back  
So please stop creeping  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
Stay until the curfew calls  
And kiss your idol  
Beneath your black hair waterfalls  
You look so bridal  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
I don't call your heart my own  
Where I rest my head, I'm home  
You are here to please me  
You know my name  
I don't know yours  
You know my name  
(My scarlet name)  
You don't know me  

My Soul feels empty  
I'm drowning in my tears  
It's pain I'm learning  
My Heart is aching  
Got poison in my veins  
In hell I'm burning  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
My You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
  
It's all or nothing  
I'm asking you to give  
Let live or die  
Everything is better  
Than this silent lie  
Say that it's no lie!  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
  
I need you to save my life  
  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let these tears be our secret  
You and I  
You and I  
Once we were so close  
Save my life  
Save my life  
Let me feel you breathing  
In your hands  
In your hands  
Is the heart of mine  
Save my life

I breathe the scent of your hair  
(Your emerald eyes are closed)  
There's still some music in the air  
(Feels like time no more flows)  
We sit, you're in my arms  
(Watching the first daylight gleam)  
You say, "I like your warmth"  
(A voice just in a dream)  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
In chaos waters I do swim  
(And you're the stone one's thrown into)  
A frail creature now gets dim  
(As the gold turns into blue)  
Made me think you were so damn near  
(Like a bright shining star)  
But reaching out, you disappeared  
(For real you are so very far)  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so..  
(I dreampt of the wind)  
I'd run, so sweet  
(I dreampt like the child)  
I'd burn, so sweet  
(I dreampt of the fire)  
(Of the time it was wild)  
I'd run, so sweet  
(I dreampt of the wind)  
(I dreampt like the child)  
I'd burn  
(I dreampt of the fire)  
And so you disappeared  

I was a fool for what I thought was love  
And I tried my best to keep up what we had  
We had a vision, no, I had a vision  
And now I've to see that the vision is dead  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And it's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
I was romantic, so silly and blind  
I told the world that true love had a name  
But all that is left now  
Is pity and shame  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And it's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
It's not me, not me
