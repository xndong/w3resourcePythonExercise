A cry for help, a hint of anesthesia,  
The sound from broken homes,  
We used to always meet here.  
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms,  
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm.  
  
A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye,  
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide,  
A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy  
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony.  
  
I can't see why all these confrontations,  
I can't see why all these dislocations,  
No family life, this makes me feel uneasy,  
Stood alone here in this colony.  
In this colony, in this colony, in this colony, in this colony.  
  
Dear God in his wisdom took you by the hand,  
God in his wisdom made you understand.  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand,  
God in his wisdom made you understand.  
  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand,  
God in his wisdom made you understand.  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand,  
God in his wisdom made you understand.  
In this colony, in this colony, in this colony, in this colony.

This is the room, the start of it all,  
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall,  
I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain,  
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
These are your friends from childhood, through youth,  
Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,  
Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,  
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin.  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
This is the car at the edge of the road,  
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed,  
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat,  
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak,  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
This is the room, the start of it all,  
Through childhood, thorugh youth, I remember it all,  
Oh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain.  
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?

Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,  
Here are the young men, well where have they been?  
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,  
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,  
  
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,  
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.  
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,  
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.  
  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
  
Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,  
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,  
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,  
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.  
  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?

Feel it closing in,  
Feel it closing in,  
The fear of whom I call,  
Every time I call,  
I feel it closing in,  
I feel it closing in,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out.  
  
I feel it closing in,  
As patterns seem to form.  
I feel it cold and warm.  
The shadows start to fall.  
I feel it closing in,  
I feel it closing in,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out,  
Day in, day out.  
  
I'd have the world around,  
To see just whatever happens,  
Stood by the door alone,  
And then it's fade away.  
I see you fade away.  
Don't ever fade away.  
I need you here today.  
Don't ever fade away.  
Don't ever fade away.  
Don't ever fade away.  
Don't ever fade away.  
Fade away. Fade away.  
Fade away. Fade away.  
Fade away. Fade away.  
Fade away.

I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand,  
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?  
These sensations barely interest me for another day,  
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.  
  
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,  
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,  
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,  
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.  
  
What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,  
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from you friends,  
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,  
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,  
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,  
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,  
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,  
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,  
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling.

When you're looking at life,  
In a strange new room,  
Maybe drowning soon,  
Is this the start of it all?  
Turn on your TV,  
Turn down your pulse,  
Turn away from it all,  
It's all getting too much.  
  
When you're looking at life,  
Deciphering scars,  
Just who fooled who,  
Sit still in their cars,  
The lights look bright,  
When you reach outside,  
Time for one last ride,  
Before the end of it all.

Don't speak of safe Messiahs,  
A failure of the modern man,  
To the center of all life's desires,  
As a whole not an also ran.  
Love in a hollow field,  
Break the image of your father's son,  
Drawn to an inner feel,  
He was thought of as the only one,  
He was thought of as the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Wise words and sympathy,  
Tell the story of our history.  
New strength gives a real touch,  
Sense and reason make it all too much.  
With a strange fatality,  
Broke the spirits of a lesser man,  
Some other race can see,  
In his way he was the only one,  
In his way he was the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Now that it's time to decide,  
In his time he was a total man,  
Taken from Caesar's side,  
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong.  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man,  
All the failures of the modern man.

No, I don't know just why  
No, I don't know just why  
Which way to turn  
I've got this ticket to use  
  
Through childlike ways rebellion and crime  
To reach this point and retreat back again  
The broken hearts, all the wheels that have turned  
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred  
  
No, I don't know just why  
Don't know which way to turn  
The best possible use  
  
Just passing through 'til we reach the next stage  
But just to where, well, it's all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away?  
  
Through childlike ways, rebellion and crime  
To reach this point and retreat back again  
The broken hearts, all the wheels that have turned  
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred  
  
Just passing through 'til we reach the next stage  
But just to where, well, it's all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away?

Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, pressurised  
Overheat, overtired  
Take it quick, take it neat  
Clasp your hands, touch your feet  
Take it quick, take it neat  
  
Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, wearing down  
On the run, underground  
Put your hand where it's safe  
Leave your hand where it's safe  
Do it again  
Do it again and again and again  
  
Anytime, that's your right  
Told ya we should do it again  
Overheat, overtired  
Don't you wish to do it again  
Anytime, that's all right  
Don't you wish to do it again  
I bet you wish you do it again  
Do it again  
  
In the Genetic demo version the previous verse is replaced by,  
Anytime, that's your right  
Bet you wish you'd done it again  
Anytime, that's your right  
Turn around and do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again and again and again

... 3, 4 warsaw!  
Don't talk to me girl, you know it's not nice.  
Don't laugh at murder, I won't pay the price.  
The facts are too high-powered, so sickened thrill,  
I'd give that mess up 'cos it makes you so ill.  
  
Blame bad things on me, whatever you do.  
When I come home I will be different from you.  
You're such a chictalk, you're really trussed up.  
Don't wanna talk to you, just left me your mum.  
  
Don't be a puppet, always rush you around.  
One just for you photo, try and tire me down.  
I won't tell him I talk like this all night,  
He must be worried 'cos you're sounding so trite.  
  
Respect is only normal, the way to our lives.  
Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife.  
We'll never change you, if you start acting that way.  
If do keep mouths all open, I'll never get a say.  
You know what's special, it's as dark as I say.  
Can you see me, just ourselves,  
No comment, copycat!

Instincts that can still betray us,  
A journey that leads to the sun,  
Soulless and bent on destruction,  
A struggle between right and wrong.  
  
You take my place in the showdown,  
I'll observe witha pitiful eye,  
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness,  
A request well beyond you and I.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
  
An abyss that laughs at creation,  
A circus complete with all fools,  
Foundations that lasted the ages,  
Then ripped apart at their roots.  
  
Beyond all this goo's is the terror,  
The grip of a mercenary hand,  
When savagery turns all good reason,  
There's no turning back, no last stand.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
  
Existence well what does it matter?  
I exist on the best terms I can.  
The past is now part of my future,  
The present is well out of hand.  
The present is well out of hand.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
One will burn, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.

We were strangers.  
We were strangers, for way too long, for way too long,  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
Violent, violent,  
Were strangers.  
  
Get weak all the time, may just pass the time,  
Me in my own world, yeah you there beside,  
The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side,  
We were strangers for way too long.  
  
Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair,  
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,  
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon,  
Me in my own world, the one that you knew,  
For way too long.  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
We were strangers,  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
For way too long.

Caressing the marble and stone,  
Love that was special for one,  
The waste in the fever I heat,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Body that curls in and dies,  
And shares that awful daylight,  
Warm like a dog round your feet,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Hangman looks round as he waits,  
Cord stretches tight then it breaks,  
Someday we will die in your dreams,  
How I wish we were here with you now.

Hey! You! You too!  
I could make the choice for you.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me,  
Everything I try to do.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
But you think you're number 1, hey!  
Act as tho' them dinner's gone.  
  
You! Carried in a room for one. You too!  
Darkness when the lights are on.  
Turn me on for good, it's so exciting.  
Slogans on the wall don't need no underlining.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Tackles you in fantasy. Hey!  
Hoping for some time to breathe.  
You! Some might get your corpse to easy. You too!  
I just want some time to breathe.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me.  
Everything I do, they're always trying to crowd me.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Watching every move you make. Hey!  
Choice of one that's hard to take. You!  
In fact it's just a big mistake. You too!  
In fact they make it feel like you.  
Maggots swarm inside the line. Hey!  
Ready for the perfect crime.  
Say you there is no right or wrong. You too!  
I don't know what's right or wrong.  
I don't know what's right or wrong.

I walked through the city limits,  
Someone talked me in to do it,  
Attracted by some force within it,  
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,  
Around a corner where a prophet lay,  
Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay,  
A wire fence where the children played  
Saw the bed where the body lay,  
And I was looking for some friends of mine.  
And I had no time to waste.  
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.  
  
The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,  
Heard a noise just a car outside,  
Metallic blue turned red with rust,  
Pulled in close by the building's side,  
In a group all forgotten youth,  
Had to think, collect my senses now,  
Are turned on to a knife edged view  
Find some places where my friends don't know,  
And I was looking for a friend of mine,  
And had no time to waste.  
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.  
  
Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,  
Getting darker now, faces look the same,  
And I walked round and round.  
No stomach, torn apart,  
Nail me to a train.  
Had to think again,  
trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!  
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.

In fear every day, every evening,  
He calls her aloud from above,  
Carefully watched for a reason,  
Painstaking devotion and love,  
Surrendered to self preservation,  
From others who care for themselves.  
A blindness that touches perfection,  
But hurts just like anything else.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
  
Mother I tried please believe me,  
I'm doing the best that I can.  
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,  
I'm ashamed of the person I am.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
  
But if you could just see the beauty,  
These things I could never describe,  
These pleasures a wayward distraction,  
This is my one lucky prize.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation.

Born from some mother's womb,  
Just like any other room.  
Made a promise for a new life.  
Made a victim out of your life.  
  
When your time's on the door,  
And it drips to the floor,  
And you feel you can touch,  
All the noise is too much,  
And the seeds that are sown,  
Are no longer your own.  
  
Just a minor operation,  
To force a final ultimatum.  
Thousand words are spoken loud,  
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd.  
  
When you walk down the street,  
And the sound's not so sweet,  
And you wish you could hide,  
Maybe go for a ride,  
To some peep show arcade,  
Where the future's not made.  
  
A nightmare situation,  
Infiltrate imagination,  
Smacks of past Holy wars,  
By the wall with broken laws.  
  
The leaders of men,  
Born out of your frustration.  
The leaders of men,  
Just a strange infatuation.  
The leaders of men,  
Made a promise for a new life.  
No savior for our sakes,  
To twist the internees of hate,  
Self induced manipulation,  
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation.

When routine bites hard,  
And ambitions are low,  
And resentment rides high,  
But emotions won't grow,  
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads.  
  
Then love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
  
Why is the bedroom so cold?  
You've turned away on your side.  
Is my timing that flawed?  
Our respect runs so dry.  
Yet there's still this appeal  
That we've kept through our lives.  
  
But love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
  
You cry out in your sleep,  
All my failings exposed.  
And there's a taste in my mouth,  
As desperation takes hold.  
Just that something so good just can't function no more.  
  
But love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.

A change of speed, a change of style.  
A change of scene, with no regrets,  
A chance to watch, admire the distance,  
Still occupied, though you forget.  
Different colors, different shades,  
Over each mistakes were made.  
I took the blame.  
Directionless so plain to see,  
A loaded gun won't set you free.  
So you say.  
  
We'll share a drink and step outside,  
An angry voice and one who cried,  
'We'll give you everything and more,  
The strain's too much, can't take much more.'  
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire,  
Can't seem to feel it anymore.  
It was me, waiting for me,  
Hoping for something more,  
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else.

So long sitting here,  
Didn't hear the warning.  
Waiting for the tape to run.  
We've been moving around in different situations,  
Knowing that the time would come.  
Just to see you torn apart,  
Witness to your empty heart.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Through the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in  
At her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo.  
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument  
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body.  
She shuddered  
Instinctively.  
No life at all in the house of dolls.  
No love lost.  
No love lost.  
  
You've been seeing things,  
In darkness, not in learning,  
Hoping that the truth will pass.  
No life underground, wasting never changing,  
Wishing that this day won't last.  
To never see you show your age,  
To watch until the beauty fades,  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Two-way mirror in the hall,  
They like to watch everything you do,  
Transmitters hidden in the walls,  
So they know everything you say is true,  
Turn it on,  
Don't turn it on,  
Turn it on.

When people listen to you don't you know it means a lot,  
'Cause you've got to work so hard for everything you've got.  
Can't rest on your laurels now,  
Not when you've got none.  
You'll find yourself in a gutter,  
Right back where you came from.  
  
Someone told me being in the know is the main thing.  
We all need the security that belonging brings.  
Can't stand on your own in these times,  
Against all the odds,  
You all just fall behind like all the other sods.  
  
You slap our backs and pretend you knew about,  
All the things that we were gonna do.  
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do,  
When it's over?  
  
You're on your own now,  
Don't you think that's a shame?  
But you're the only one responsible to take the blame.  
So what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone?  
Yeah, what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone?  
  
You slap our backs,  
And pretend you knew about,  
All the things we were gonna do.  
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do  
When its over?

This is a crisis I knew had to come,  
Destroying the balance I'd kept.  
Doubting, unsettling and turning around,  
Wondering what will come next.  
Is this the role that you wanted to live?  
I was foolish to ask for so much.  
Without the protection and infancy's guard,  
It all falls apart at first touch.  
  
Watching the reel as it comes to a close,  
Brutally taking it's time,  
People who change for no reason at all,  
It's happening all of the time.  
Can I go on with this train of events?  
Disturbing and purging my mind,  
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done,  
I know that I'll lose every time.  
  
Moving along in our God given ways,  
Safety is sat by the fire,  
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles,  
Left with a mark on the door,  
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?  
Forgive and forget's what they teach,  
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more,  
And watch as they drop by the beach.  
  
This is the crisis I knew had to come,  
Destroying the balance I'd kept,  
Turning around to the next set of lives,  
Wondering what will come next.

To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,  
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,  
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,  
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.  
  
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,  
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,  
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect,  
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.  
  
I did everything, everything I wanted to,  
I let them use you for their own ends,  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.

Confusion in her eyes that says it all.  
She's lost control.  
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,  
She's lost control.  
  
And she gave away the secrets of her past,  
And said I've lost control again,  
And a voice that told her when and where to act,  
She said I've lost control again.  
  
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said,  
I've lost control again.  
And how I'll never know just why or understand,  
She said I've lost control again.  
  
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said,  
I've lost control again.  
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.  
She said I've lost control.  
  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
  
Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case,  
And say she's lost control again.  
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,  
And said I've lost control again.  
  
But she expressed herself in many different ways,  
Until she lost control again.  
And walked upon the edge of no escape,  
And laughed I've lost control.  
  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.

Someone take these dreams away,  
That point me to another day,  
A duel of personalities,  
That stretch all true realities.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Where figures from the past stand tall,  
And mocking voices ring the halls.  
Imperialistic house of prayer,  
Conquistadors who took their share.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.  
  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
They keep calling me.

Moved in a hired car and I find no way to run  
Hurts every moment longer, had no time for fun  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
  
I had an impulse to clear it all away  
I used the tactics, make everybody pay  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
  
Oh, I keep it all clean, I've paid the graces there  
No kings of misuse, no sellers of flesh  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
Yeah through it all I kept my eyes on you  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you

Moved in a hired car,  
And I find no way to run,  
Adds every moment longer,  
Had no time for fun,  
Just something that I knew I had to do,  
But through it all I lefy my eyes on you.  
  
I had an impulse to clear it all away,  
Oh I used the tactics, make everybody pay,  
Just something that I knew I had to do,  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you.  
  
Oh, I keep it all clean,  
I've paid the graces there,  
No kings of misuse,  
No sellers of flesh,  
Just something that I knew I had to do,  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you,  
Yeah through it all I kept my eyes on you,  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you.

See my true reflection,  
Cut off my own connections,  
I can see life getting harder,  
So sad is this sensation,  
Reverse the situation,  
I can't see it getting better.  
  
I'll walk you through the heartbreak,  
Show you all the out takes,  
I can't see it getting higher,  
Systematically degraded,  
Emotionally a scapegoat,  
I can't see it getting better.  
  
Perverse and unrealistic,  
Try to make it all sick,  
I can't see it getting better,  
Hollow now, I'm burned out,  
All I need to break out,  
I can't see life getting higher,  
Love, life, makes you feel higher,  
Love, of life, makes you feel higher,  
Higher, higher, higher, higher,  
Higher, higher, higher, higher,  
Love of life, makes you feel higher.

Morning seems strange, almost out of place.  
Searched hard for you and your special ways.  
These days, these days.  
  
Spent all my time, learnt a killer's art.  
Took threats and abuse 'till I'd learned the part.  
Can you stay for these days?  
  
These days, these days.  
  
Used outward deception to get away,  
Broken heart romance to make it pay.  
  
These days, these days.  
  
We'll drift through it all, it's the modern age.  
Take care of it all now these debts are paid.  
Can you stay for these days?

So this is permanent, love's shattered pride.  
What once was innocence, turned on its side.  
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move,  
Deep in the memory, of what once was love.  
  
Oh how I realized how I wanted time,  
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find,  
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way.  
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away.  
  
Excessive flash points, beyond all reach,  
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep.  
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find,  
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires.  
  
I never realized the lengths I'd have to go,  
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know.  
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call,  
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all.  
  
Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong,  
Gottas find some therapy, this treatment takes too long.  
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway,  
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late.

All dressed in uniforms so fine,  
They drank and killed to pass the time,  
Wearing the shame of all their crimes,  
With measured steps, they walked in line.  
  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line.  
  
They carried pictures of their wives,  
And numbered tags to prove their lives,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line.  
  
Full of a glory never seen,  
They made it through the whole machine,  
To never question anymore,  
Hypnotic trance, they never saw,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
Walked in line,  
Walked in line.

I traveled far and wide through many different times,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the saints with their toys,  
What did you see there?  
I saw all knowledge destroyed.  
I traveled far and wide through many different times.  
  
I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross,  
What did you see there?  
The power and glory of sin,  
What did you see there?  
The blood of Christ on their skins,  
I traveled far and wide through many different times.  
  
I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the one sided trials,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the tears as they cried,  
They had tears in their eyes,  
  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes.

Don't know what I'm doing - don't know where I'm going  
Leading me to ruin - I should have traded you in  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Don't know if I care - don't know if I'm there  
I just sit and stare - making love to thin air  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good --  
  
I do lots of good - surprised at what you would  
Don't call me no crud - I really think I'm good  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Try to call the tune - I'll probably go and rue it  
I'll just get it groomed - all sorts of other clues  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
  
I get by the local peer group and their pressures  
I can wash the dishes - my soups can taste delicious  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real  
Come on let's make a deal - think of where you live  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good --  
  
I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real  
Come on let's make a deal - think of what you need  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me
