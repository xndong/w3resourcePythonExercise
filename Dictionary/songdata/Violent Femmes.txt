Day after day  
I will walk and I will play  
But the day after today  
I will stop  
And I will start  
  
Why can't I get just one kiss  
Why can't I get just one kiss  
Believe me there'd be somethings that I wouldn't miss  
But I look at your pants and I need I need a kiss  
Why can't I get just one screw  
Why can't I get just one screw  
Believe me I know what to do  
But something won't let me make love to you  
  
Why can't I get just one fuck  
Why can't I get just one fuck  
I guess it's something to do with luck  
  
But I waited my whole life for just one  
Day after day  
I get angry  
And I will say  
  
That the day  
Is in my sight  
When I'll take a bow  
And say goodnight  
  
Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum  
Have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?  
I know you've had problems, you're not the only one  
When your sugar left, he left you on the run  
  
Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum  
Take a look now at what your boy has done  
He's walking around like he's number one  
Went downtown and you got him a gun  
  
So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
You know you've got my sympathy  
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
  
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
You know you've got my sympathy  
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me  
  
Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs  
Can I mix in with your affairs?  
Share a smoke, make a joke  
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope  
  
Words to memorize, words hypnotize  
Words make my mouth exercise  
Words all failed the magic prize  
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs  
  
Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother  
I would love to love you, lover  
City is restless, it's ready to pounce  
Oh, here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce  
  
Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother  
I would love to love you, lover  
City is restless, it's ready to pounce  
Oh, here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce  
  
I've given you a decision to make  
Things to lose, things to take  
Just as she's about ready to cut it up  
She says, "Wait a minute, honey, I'm gonna add it up!"  
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!  
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!  
Add it up! Add it up!  
  
Day after day, I get angry and I will say  
That the day is in my sight  
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight

The telephone, the telephone  
I have an idea  
Women always have ideas  
Hello  
Here is Agamemnon  
Here is Agamemnon  
Who? Wrong connection  
This is  
I am a moralist  
An anti-militarist  
I am against duels  
I cannot stand seeing  
A fly in rage  
I cannot look at  
A uniform or blood  
That woman has seduced me  
And now I am done for  
Darling, where shall I  
Hide you in a hurry?  
Here is Agamemnon  
Here is Agamemnon  
I am coming  
Directly from the trenches  
And look forward  
To a solemn luncheon  
Oh, my nerves  
I'm losing my find  
This damned telephone  
Spoils my favorite position  
And no I can start  
Writing poetry again

All I want is to talk to you  
All I want is to talk to you  
I'm achin' for your touch  
I'm breakin' cause I miss you so much  
Do you miss me, too?  
All I want is to walk with you  
All I want is to walk with you  
I'm hopin' for your kiss  
I'm dopin' cause I miss you so much  
Do you miss me, too?  
Little bit closer, little bit closer, someday  
When I try to get closer, then you move away  
And all I want to say is all I want is to be with you  
All I want is to be with you  
You're hurting deep inside  
You're flirting cause you need to feel that you are still alive  
Little bit closer, little bit closer, someway  
When I try to get closer, then you move away  
And all I want to say is all I want is to walk with you  
All I want is to talk with you  
I'm prayin' for one night  
I'm layin' so low cause I love you so though I know it ain't right  

Do you like American music  
I like American music  
Don't you like American music baby  
I want you to hold me  
I want your arms around me  
I want you to hold me baby  
Did you do too many drugs  
I did too many drugs  
Did you do too many drugs too baby  
You were born too late  
I was born too soon  
But every time I look at that ugly moon  
It reminds me of you  
It reminds me of you ooh ooh ooh  
I need a date to the prom  
Would you like to come along  
But nobody would go to the prom with me baby  
They didn't like American music  
They never heard American music  
They didn't know the music was in my soul baby  
You were born too soon  
I was born too late  
But every time I look at that ugly lake  
It reminds me of me  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music  
We like American music  
I like American music baby  
Do you like American music  
We like all kinds of music  
But I like American music best  
Baby you were born too late  
And I was born too late  
But every time I look at that ugly lake  
It reminds me of me  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music

At your feet would fall many kings  
At your feet will fall many things  
At your hands I'd kiss every one of your rings  
And this song in silence sings... my love  
At your feet I'd kiss every one of your cool toes  
My dumb heart is not as smart as what a fool knows  
At your kiss I'd curse everyone  
For my bad luck I wish but to whisper  
"I love you" but I will not not fuck up your life  
At your feet will fall many tears  
And your hands will form many fears  
Before your face will pace many a peer  
I'm the one who comes but to disappear  
And reappear oh my dear  
I want you near... here  
At your feet would fall many queens  
At your feet the willow tree leans  
And my love will follow you there  
Lightning strikes but I don't know where  
Is my love  
I love you  
All my life  
  

I'm living in a bad dream.  
They're supposed to be here by now.  
What the hell is taking them so long?  
I parked the car just like they said.  
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bullet in my head.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm supposed to be feeling better by now.  
What the hell is taking me so long?  
I hit the hay just like they said.  
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bell in my head.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
On a curve, lost control.  
On a cliff, lost control.  
This is not happening to me.  
I say so.  
I'm supposed to be a better person by now.  
What the hell is taking me so long?  
Dying saviors off sum cross.  
Now, I'm hoping and I'm praying that they'll nullify my losses.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.  
I'm living in a bad dream  
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.  
I'm living in a bad dream.

See my ships  
They are sailing  
In and out of the harbor  
Will they go together  
Or must they stay apart  
Yes I know it's in my heart  
Surely you see what's inside of me  
Jesus is coming soon  
I can hear Gabriel  
Blow his trumpet tune  
This I know  
This I know  
Our Lord is coming soon  
Mercy mercy me  
Marvin Gaye he was shot  
By his father  
O my Father  
Have mercy on me  
Cold kane o my cheap thrill  
O my shame for Cain  
And the devil  
Momma I need water  
I'm thirsty  
Surely you see  
What's inside of me

Someone sucked me late last evening  
And it was time to make a change  
And I wonder am I too late, am I too far a strange  
For what I have been doin' for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
I have so few good memories  
Something's terribly wrong, as a singer singing badly  
As he tries to sing the wrong song  
Look what I have been doing all of these years  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Something moving in the light  
Something spoke to me and said, "Go, go, go, go"  
Something's moving in the house show, something to show  
For what I've been doing for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Someone sucked me late last evening  
And it was time to make a change  
And I wonder am I too late am I too far a strange  
For what I have been doin' for all of these years  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'  
Sleepwalkin', sleepwalkin', slee-ee-eepwalkin'

Of somebody who' special

So this time, I went away, but next time,

I look at my telephone book  
I look at my telephone book  
I can't stand the way it look  
I hate to think the way you took  
Me down into a burnin' rage  
I wrote your name on every page  
But you don't return my calls  
You don't return my calls  
You don't return my calls  
I'm ready to bust down the walls  
I'm going down Niagara Falls  
In a barrel of fun  
Hey ain't I a lucky one  
You don't return my calls  
My telephone book is the color red  
My telephone book is the color red  
The red is all in my head  
Some things are left better unsaid  
Is that why you don't try  
To acknowledge or reply  
You don't return my calls  
Why did you hear from an old friend  
I knew once way back when  
I did some bad things to myself and my health  
Or did you happen to hear an old song I once sang  
Did it make your sweet sweet blood run cold in your veins  
And will you never think of me the same

  
  
Ain't had no fun

Such a loving people  
We used to be  
  
That was before  
The end of our world  
That was before  
The end of our world

We got the mother and the kids  
We got the guy and his date  
We all get mad  
We all get laid  
Looks like somebody forgot about us  
Standin' on the corner  
Waitin' for a bus  
Say hey mister driver man  
Don't be slow  
Cause I got somewhere I got to go  
Say hey mister driver man  
Drive that thing fast  
My precious time keep slippin' past  
Lets call the mayor lets complain  
Looks like the city's done to us again  
Tied up in traffic what'ya know  
The damn city bus moves so slow  
I said hey mister driver man  
Don't be slow  
'Cause I got somewhere I got to go  
Say hey mister driver man  
Drive that thing fast  
My precious time keep slippin' past

Can you imagine  
The world at peace  
What would it be like  
Can you imagine  
  
Such harmony  
And what will happen  
When everybody's happy  
But me  
  
Can you imagine  
This headache I have  
Writing this song  
Can you imagine  
  
The storm inside  
And the quiet  
When everybody's happy  
But me  
  
I think that I would really  
Like to love  
Give and receive  
I pray that my spirit  
  
May rise above  
And I'll live a good life  
When everybody's happy  
But me

I quit thinking about killing myself  
When you died  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to live  
I quit believing these lies I tell myself  
When you died  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted the truth  
I will always love you my friend  
Now that you died  
But just for a day or two  
I'd like to be with you  
Just for a day or two  
I'd like to have you alive  
  

  
  
I can't go out no more  
  
I just better stay at home  
  
I just better stay all alone  
  
'cause what am I gonna do  
  
if I see someone I'd like to do  
  
something to  
  
what am I gonna say  
  
if I see someone I'd like to say  
  
something to  
  
if I see someone who'd like to do  
  
something too  
  
I can't help being careful  
  
did you notice the world  
  
that we're living in  
  
did you notice did you see  
  
something might happen to me  
  
did you notice a chill in the wind  
  
people are dying  
  
just because they had a little  
  
girlfriend is not my girlfriend  
  
my neighbor is not my lover  
  
boyfriend is not my boyfriend  
  
my brother is not my lover  
  
behavior is not my behavior  
  
my neighbor is not my savior  
  
didn't you notice the world  
  
that we're living in
