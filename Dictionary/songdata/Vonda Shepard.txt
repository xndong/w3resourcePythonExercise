We've live a long, long time and all the radios are playing our song tonight  
We walk a crooked line 'cause there is a counter life in your jailed eyes  
You're never a victim of your generation and you shine on me like a holy light  
All of the miracles and conversations rain on me tonight  
  
We've got a one track mind, true as a railroad, always on time  
I see it in your eyes, you don't have to talk to me, I know what you're
thinking  
I need my solitude as much as you do darling, to live this life we came here
for  
Never for one single solitary moment did I need you more  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it all tonight  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life  
  
My home is on the road, the pavement caters to, to my gypsy soul  
We walk the tightest rope, we live in a circus, circus of hope  
All of the melodies and inspirations shine on me like a holy light  
Right in the middle of our conversations you wink at me, saying it's alright  
  
We live a lucky life  
I see it in your eyes  
We sit and close our eyes  
Travelling to paradise or to anywhere we like  
We live a lucky life

I like the way you wanted me  
Every night for so long baby  
I like the way you needed me  
Every time things got rocky  
  
I was believing in you  
Am I mistaken do you say,  
Do you say what you mean  
I want our love to last forever  
  
But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
I like the way you'd hold me  
Every night for so long baby  
And I like the way you'd say my name  
In the middle of the night  
While you were sleeping  
  
I was believing in you  
Was I mistaken  
Do you mean, mean what you say  
When you say our love could last forever  
  
Well I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow  
  
You would run around and lead me on forever  
While I wait at home thinking that we're together  
I wanted our love to last forever  
  
Well I'd rather you be mean than love and lie  
I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye  
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know  
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I have been lost in this verbal rain  
I went to bed feeling no pain  
I was drowning baby, you're my wine  
You're my thoughts, you're my silence  
You're my sense of time  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30  
  
Maybe your love's an uncrackable code  
Or maybe your love is a railroad  
That you ride when you are all alone  
And you speed down the tracks  
To what you call home  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
Do you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30  
  
Quite unsubtle these thoughts  
You send me  
Or is it I who sends them unreceived?  
And they fly through the air  
At enormous speed  
Like a boomerang flying back at me  
  
By 7:30 you'll fall in love with me  
So you believe in destiny?  
I believe by 7:30

Chances are you'll find me  
Somewhere on your road tonight  
Seems I always end up driving by  
Ever since I've known you  
It just seems you're on my way  
All the rules of logic don't apply  
  
I long to see you in the night  
Be with you 'til morning light  
  
I remember clearly how you looked  
The night we met  
I recall your laughter and your smile  
I remember how you made me  
Feel so at ease  
I remember all your grace, your style  
  
And now you're all I long to see  
You've come to mean so much to me  
  
Chances are I'll see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
You'll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are I'll hold you and I'll offer  
All I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget  
Baby you're the best, I've ever met  
  
And I'll be dreaming of the future  
And hoping you'll be by my side  
And in the morning I'll be longing  
For the night, for the night  
  
Chances are I'll see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
You'll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are I'll hold you and I'll offer  
All I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget  
Baby you're the best I've ever met

Oh city shine on tomorrow  
For today I feel rain  
There is a decent moon  
Now I lay me down in the light  
  
My man's afraid, no communication  
I'm sure life in my arms ain't been free  
Is it a sacrifice to love me now  
Are you alright?  
  
Will you take my hand so I'm not alone  
You're the road I need to lead me home baby...forever  
Will you be my friend, will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely won't be  
There's a clean rain fallin' over me  
  
I know I cried after what you told me  
You said you're not sure where this love is going  
Why would you hesitate if you really love me now  
Are you alright?  
  
Will you take my hand, you're the road I need to lead me home...forever  
Will you be my friend, will you walk with me  
Can we wash away the history that clouds our love  
What came before surely won't be  
  
Hey we've been running too long, let's settle down  
Gotta keep our head above water  
Take a look around  
How long will you wait for me  
How long will you wait for me  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

Skinny little brats  
Walking down Avenue A  
Dangling their cigarettes  
Their Independence Day  
Tears like filigrees  
Wear them on their sleeves  
Nobody's main squeeze  
It's thirty-five degrees  
  
Poetry of ordinary life is what I live for  
They just want to be seen  
They just want to be heard, said  
  
[Chorus]  
My words are like confetti  
And you never pick them up  
They fall to the ground  
I need someone to lift me up  
  
So diaphanous so ephemeral  
And all those bad words  
They never learned in school  
Groovy like my mamma was  
In her black turtle neck  
She was so high strung  
She was so low tech  
  
Poetry and tattooed dreams  
And fourteen caret nose rings  
The children of elite  
Are trying to be street saying  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]

  
  
  
  
You ran away with your conscience dear  
  
There was a red flag waving in my ear saying  
  
"Stay away, you've got something to fear"  
  
Well why did I not choose to hear?  
  
Well I am through with suffering  
  
Gonna make better choices I don't need no wedding ring  
  
I can sing, I can dance  
  
But I can't make thus feeling cease  
  
Cause deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
We all got our cross to bear  
  
Our Star of David, our dreadlocked hair  
  
And oh yeah baby, I still care  
  
And if you need some help  
  
You know I'll always be there  
  
  
Well it's been a strange year  
  
You've been a very bad dog  
  
As my fire went out  
  
You'd put on another log  
  
But it was worth never having any peace  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
  
Some nights I thought I'd cry forever  
  
I'd wish him away and then I'd turn into a beggar  
  
But it was worth always scraping my knees  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease  
  
  
I wear my heart like a wrinkle on my sleeve  
  
  
And I've got the aching love that only you can relieve  
  
But I'm not afraid to go down with a sinking friend  
  
I'm gonna live out my dreams even if they kill me in the end  
  
  
Repeat chorus  
  

He had his father's eyes  
And his mother's point of view  
There was no disguise  
He couldn't see through  
Sometimes the little things  
They don't seem so small  
But they had a good thing overall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
  
There was a rainbow over here  
He didn't see it from over there  
Black and white are fine  
But he's color blind  
Watching over me  
There must have been some kind of mystery  
Because I wanted him too  
But it was all wrong, all wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
Knew him the way you did  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene, no don't cry  
It's hard to say exactly why he left you  
Maybe a change for good  
Don't cry Ilene  
Oh no, Don't cry

I stopped at an all night diner  
Oh, it seemed like a romantic thing to do  
Yeah, but I'm lonely, it ain't like the movies  
In the old days  
I saw you sittin' in the corner counting change,  
Like you were counting your daydreams  
Then your eyes, they suddenly hit me like a railroad train  
  
Oh, sometimes I think I might be immune to a guy like you  
But I can't walk away, no I can't walk away  
Oh, tonight I see you're at the end of the line, well, me too  
But we all gotta pay  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
I guess I've known you before, maybe in high school  
or maybe you're just one more guy I went looking for  
The boy next door  
Or maybe I'm the girl with the see-through eyes  
But I watch too many movies,  
I get tangled in the story of someone else's life  
Baby, who am I, and who are you?  
  
Oh, sometimes I go to bed at night  
And I think that I'm with you  
Then I say a little prayer, 'cause I threw it all away  
The other day you called up to see if I miss you  
And all I could say was  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
Night has a clever disguise  
She makes me believe that I'm lonely  
I should know by now if I can make it to tomorrow  
I can work it out  
  
'cause in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself

I feel like I'm walking on a mine  
I'm gonna leave it all behind  
I feel like I'm gaining my soul  
While I'm losing my mind  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
I'm gonna walk through that door  
I'm gonna see what it's there for  
'Cause all I ever want is your skin or your soul, baby  
But you couldn't give me either one of those  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
  
You use to hold me like a flower  
We used to talk for seven hours  
I see the bigger picture now  
  
And I feel like I understand  
And I feel like a grain of sand  
And I feel like a grain of sand

Calling all these other guys  
I'm seeing something I didn't before  
Is that a new look in your eyes  
Now you don't believe that I'm asking for more  
  
I saw you walking down the street  
With another girl who looks just like me  
People always say we look so happy  
He took my love but he didn't take me  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He says he loves me but he don't look in my eyes  
But I'll take it 'till it's all gone 'cause  
He ain't with me, but at least I'm not alone  
  
You say you laughed with your old girlfriend  
You're doing nothing to encourage the end  
I could be charming on long distance too  
And if you want I'll make it easier for you  
  
Communication is the key  
Interrogation don't work for me  
You saw that other guy smiling at me  
If you were here I wouldn't act so free  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He says he loves me but he don't look in my eyes  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
Stranger can't you see he ain't with me  
He ain't with me he ain't with me no more  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
  
I guess fate really has my number  
Every time you wander away  
I reconsider all the time you said you'd stay  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He ain't with me no more  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
But I'll take it 'till it's all gone 'cause  
He ain't with me but at least I'm not alone  
He ain't with me

I know that I'm not crazy  
If I were I wouldn't talk about it  
I'm homesick for your love  
'Cause I know I can't live without it  
  
If you need a guarantee I'm gonna love you everyday  
Say no more about it because you've got it in every way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
I wish I could get you out of my system  
I say in my mind but my heart won't listen  
I need a fix or two  
'Cause I'm in the habit of you  
  
And if a guarantee is what you need  
To keep me by your side  
Say no more about it  
Because my love I just can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say...  
  
All you need in your life  
All you need in your heart  
All you need from a friend  
Is love  
  
All you need from your mother  
All you need from your lover  
All wee need from another  
Is love  
  
I'm gonna hold out one more day  
I won't let her take you away  
I'm gonna hold out somehow someway  
I don't want to see the day when you say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]

I can't stop this feeling  
Deep inside of me  
Girl, you just don't realize  
What you do to me  
  
Your lips are sweet as candy  
The taste stays on my mind  
You just keep me thirsty  
For another cup of wine  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
I've got it bad for you, darling  
But I don't need a cure  
I'll just stay addicted  
And hope I can endure  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up boy  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
I said I'm hooked on a feeling

Above all things there must be love  
And following your deepest soul  
You look like you need some fun  
I'm dying to sail into the sun  
Dreamers ask what've I become  
  
I can see that shoreline star  
Pulling me to worlds so far  
Taking me and pulling hard  
Away from judgment's own backyard  
Away from judgment's own backyard  
  
Why should I change for anyone?  
Why should my chains break or come undone?  
And I'll sing glory hallelujah I'm coming home  
Baby don't rescue me, don't rescue me  
'Cause I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be  
  
Do you hear my melodies?  
Do you hear my Van Gogh's cry?  
Will it be my brother's purchase?  
Even only when I die? Even only when I die  
  
Why should I change for anyone?  
Why should my chains break or come undone?  
And I'll sing glory hallelujah I'm coming home  
Baby don't rescue me, don't rescue me  
'Cause I'm gonna be what I'm gonna be  
  
I been up and down, I been all around  
In the sky and baby on the ground  
High as the sun, deep as the sea  
Rain has been falling all over me  
I want to live in harmony  
I know what I need to be free  
Baby, please don't rescue me 'cause I'm gonna be...

I can think of younger days when living for my life  
Was everything a man could want to do  
I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend a this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

There's a secret path I follow  
To a place no one can find  
Where I meet my perfect someone  
I've kept hidden in my mind  
  
Where my heart makes my decisions  
Til my dream becomes a vision  
And the love I feel  
Makes him real someday  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
  
Am I living an illusion?  
Wanting something I can't see  
If I compromise, I'd be living lies  
Pretending love's not meant to be  
  
Cause I know my heart's worth saving  
And I know that he'll be waiting  
So I'll hold on  
I'll stay strong til then  
  
Cause I know he's out there somewhere  
Just beyond my reach  
Though I've never really touched him  
Or ever heard him speak  
  
Though we've never been together  
We've never been apart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart  
No, we've never met  
Haven't found him yet  
But I know him by heart

  
  
  
  
Since I met you, I've missed you all my life  
  
What I don't know won't hurt me baby  
  
Since I've known you, I can recall the old times  
  
  
Wasn't that your face in my old photographs  
  
Didn't we laugh and talk for hours baby  
  
Really want to see you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
I don't ask you about the girls in your life  
  
'Cause what I don't know might hurt me baby  
  
I don't question when something feels right  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin'  
  
I could fall in live with you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you...  
  
  
(Bridge)  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share to love  
  
I really want to share the love  
  
Share the love to share the love  
  
Share the love  
  
  
Always waiting for the right one  
  
You say I should take my chances darlin'  
  
I could really fall in love with you but baby  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  
  
I shy away from your love  
  
Don't you know what I'm going through  
  
(I don't you know what I'm going through)  
  
Baby I shy away from your love  
  
I should be loving you but I just shy away  
  
  
(Chorus)  
  

Does he love me  
I want to know  
How can I tell if he loves me so?  
(Is it in his eyes?) Oh no,  
You'll be deceived  
(Is it in his eyes?) Oh no,  
He'll make believe  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
It's in his kiss  
(Or is it in his face?) Oh, no  
It's just his charm  
(In his warm embrace?) Oh, no  
That's just his arms  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
It's in his kiss  
Kiss him and squeeze him tight  
And find out what you want to know  
If it's love, if it really is  
It's there in his kiss  
(About the way he acts?) Oh, no  
That's not the way  
And you're not listening to all that I say  
If you want to know  
If he loves you so  
It's in his kiss

He sees what I'm lacking and he tells me without attacking my life  
He sees what I'm needing and he gives me love without my pleading  
I see where his worries lie and I help him to decide  
He sees what I'm missing, that sometimes I need to be alone, but sometimes I
need him to listen  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
He knows what I'm thinking without a sign, without blinking my eyes  
I know what he's asking, in our love there ain't no masking, no disguise  
I know what he's after, it's the truth and the laughter  
Why can't we see in ourselves, all the beauty we see in everybody else?  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdon that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and he makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
I don't want to go through this life just getting by, I want to fly  
I don't want to go through this life not asking why  
I need to know why we are here, we are here together now  
I don't want to go through this life just to die  
Well, you made me see just how lonely I have been  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been

I try so hard I don't know what to do  
I'm gonna lose my mind if I can't have you  
The brake lights are on and nobody's home  
I can hear you talking on the telephone  
And my baby has the blues again  
Somehow they just seem to hit him  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that you're leaving  
And I believe you're already gone  
You're already gone  
  
If you can't find love, you've gotta find a method  
Of learning to live in the world today  
I don't know what it was that I expected  
I guess I'm a fool to want perfection  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend  
  
I believe that you're leaving  
And I believe you're already gone  
I better believe what I'm seeing  
'Cause I believe that it's so long  
It's so long (as in "see ya")  
  
I try so hard I don't know what to do  
It's obvious I won't end up with you  
The brake lights are on and it's so clear  
You can't pretend you want to be here  
This train of thought has arrived at the station  
We don't need anymore contemplation  
And I'm breaking up again with another long term boyfriend

Here's a photo I've been looking for  
It's a picture of thee boy next door  
And I loved him more than words could say  
Never knew it 'til he moved away  
  
Faded pictures in my scrapbook  
Just thought I'd take one more look  
And recall when we were all  
In the neighborhood  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Here's a photo of the neighborhood  
Here's the corner where we stood  
Here's a snapshot of dad's old car  
  
Never got us very far  
Faded pictures in my scrapbook  
Just thought I'd take one more look  
And recall when we were all  
  
In the neighborhood  
And all those friends  
Where did they go, I don't know  
All those friends we used to know  
In the neighborhood

Sitting here in this dirty bar  
Watching the trash go by  
She's selling cigarettes and lollipops  
She's got a sparkle in her black eye  
  
She says "Maybe my time will come"  
Maybe my time will come  
  
He said he'd sweep her off her feet  
Defying all of gravity  
Well she'd move any bright city  
To fill this gaping cavity, she says  
  
I'm a slave in this empty life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
  
Well he must have a very small broom  
As she sits in this very large room  
Maybe it's just a piece of straw  
She says why am I so in awe?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a slave to this empty life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
I'm ashamed of this meaningless life  
Diggin' my grave I'm his newspaper wife  
  
She sits across from him  
Drinking her coffee  
His face is buried in other people's lives, she says  
"I wonder if he's gonna read forever  
I'm his newspaper wife  
  
[Chorus]

Bells will be ringing the sad sad news  
Oh, what a Christmas to end the blues  
My baby's gone, and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings, once again  
  
Choirs will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Sure as the stars shine above  
For this is Christmas, yeah, it's Christmas my dear  
It's the time of year to be with the one you love  
  
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And I'll be happy, happy once again  
  
[instrumental interlude]  
  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And I'll be happy, happy Christmas once again

Eighteen and flying  
Like every great American  
Slept until sundown  
And baby your were wild enough fro me  
Rolled the night over  
In my '72 Nova  
Mexican rain on my  
Tijuana vinyl beer stain  
Watching the sunrise  
Lightening in your lazy eyes  
And all this time you never let me down  
I had a dream  
That made me move to New York City  
?Cause I wasn't about to  
About to let this magic slip away  
But he did anyway  
He was kind of illusive that way  
Like clouds on a promising grey day  
The beauty of my life  
A moment that's long gone  
But so much a part of me  
Oh, how I wish it weren't history  
I wish it were my future  
Rolling, rolling my way  
Like clouds on a promising grey day  

Every time you go  
This much I know  
That it didn't mean nothing  
'Cause I've closed the back door  
Every night apart  
You were in my heart  
So don't you worry  
'Cause I'm ready for this love to restart  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
I'll love you all my life  
We'll weather the seasons  
We'll laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
I'm yours, you're mine  
I'll love you all my life  
When I feel afraid  
In my own parade  
That marches through me  
And I don't recognize a single face  
You drew a line in the sand  
Then you took my hand  
And we crossed over  
Now I finally understand that  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
I'll love you all my life  
We'll weather the seasons  
We'll laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
I'm yours, you're mine  
I'll love you all my life  

We were walking above  
Pretending to be in love  
In phases I watched you float away  
I was under the gun  
Trying to have some fun  
In phases I watched you slip away  
Remember all these rainy says  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even, even the clearest of days  
We were sticking it out  
Getting used to the doubt  
In phases you watched me drift away  
Now I'm taking a train  
Shooting through the rain  
Amazed that I'm alone here  
Once again  
Remember all these rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even, even the clearest of days, yeah  
I watched you float away  
Remember all these rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even the clearest of days  
These rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even, even the clearest of days  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even, even the clearest of days  

We held hands and laughed  
Then we jumped in the water  
Off the jetty we'd fly  
As the sun got hotter  
We were any age  
Floating through space  
Happy for once in the human race  
On this sweet Sunday and into Monday  
Your arms wrapped around me  
Where my love has found me  
But am I really free?  
If I could read your mind  
I hope I'd find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
I'd try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Like a broken record  
I've stayed protected  
From promises, from disappointments  
I wanna hear your dreams, wanna drift away  
Wanna break you in  
Oh, I wanna stay  
Stay in heaven, oh in heaven  
And see my life finally begin  
Will we be together, oh forever?  
Darling please let me in  
If I could read your mind  
I hope I'd find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
I'd try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Oh, I want to stay in this sweet Sunday and into Monday  
Your arms wrapped around me  
Where my love has found me  
Has finally found me  
But am I really free?  
If I could read your mind  
I hope I'd find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
I'd try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Na, na, na , na, na  
If I could read your mind  
Na, na, na, na, na  

If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never think about myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never think about myself

Every light shines on you tonight  
Making a fool out of me  
Why won't this love leave me alone  
All of the people in this smoky room  
Crowded with faces I know  
I feel them watching me watch you  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over  
  
Your eyes are deeper  
They are worthy of many words  
But none I can conjure up will do for you  
I shouldn't see you  
Cause I know my own motivation  
It's taking too long for this love  
To leave me alone  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over  
  
Oh love, you worry me  
When you say you'll wait forever  
I have another life  
We just cannot be together  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words, say them for me  
I need to hear you say, it's over  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over

I've been down this road walkin' the line  
That's painted by pride  
And I have made mistakes in my life  
That I just can't hide  
Oh I believe I am ready for what love has to bring  
Got myself together, now I'm ready to sing  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
One by one, the chains around me unwind  
Every day now I feel that I can leave those years behind  
Oh I've been thinking of you for a long time  
There's a side of my life where I've been blind and so...  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
Don't want to be alone in life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
Baby I been holding back now my whole life  
I've decided to move on now  
Gonna leave all my worries behind  
Oh I belive I am ready for what love has to give  
Got myself together now I'm ready to live  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
I know there's so much more to life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
Everything gonna be alright  
I've been searchin' my soul tonight  
Don't want to be alone in my life  
Now I know I can shine a light  
To find my way back home  
(Repeat Chorus)

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids rush  
This is Santa's big day  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
Very soon it will be Christmas day

Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Hey New York City  
Won't you welcome me back home?  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that I'll be gone  
By the time you figure out what you want  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through my solitude a little longer  
Turn your head now sailor  
Well I used to be so much stronger  
How in the hell did I get here?  
In this city so alone  
Oh sometimes life seems so long  
  
[Chorus]  
You can't soothe me with your sweet voice  
If I can't be your first choice  
You can't soothe me with your deep eyes  
If I can't be your first prize  
You can't soothe me with affection  
If it's pointed in the wrong direction  
Unless you think I'm perfection  
Unless you think I'm perfection  
  
Maybe I should wander  
Through these streets a little longer  
Find my ruthless angel  
That will carry me back home  
Cause we all want to go home  
And we search for love our whole lives  
I found a man who only wants to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe down the road who knows?  
You'll get it together  
With all your charm my hope grows  
It's wonderful  
But you're flirting only as a friend  
You touch my heart  
And promise everything  
  
It'll be a mighty cold winter  
Five million people  
Couldn't one of them be you?  
And darling I love you  
But I swear that I'll be gone  
By the time you figure out  
What you want  
  
[Chorus]

I need your sweet inspiration  
I need you here on my mind  
Every hour of the day  
Without your sweet inspiration  
The lonely hours of the night  
Just don't go my way  
A woman in love  
Needs sweet inspiration  
Yeah, and, honey, that's all I ask  
That's all I ask from you  
I've gotta have your sweet inspiration  
You know there just ain't no tellin'  
What a satisfied woman might do  
The way you call me baby, baby  
Is such a sweet inspiration  
The way you call me darlin', darlin'  
Sets my heart to skating  
And if I'm out in the rain, baby  
And in a bad situation  
You know I just reach back in my mind  
And there I find your sweet, sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration  
Oh, what a power  
And I've got the power  
Every hour of the day  
I need your sweet inspiration  
To go on, to go on living  
To keep on giving this way  
I need your sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration, sweet inspiration, sweet inspiration  
Sweet, sweet inspiration  
Sweet, sweet inspiration  
I need sweet inspiration

I know something about love  
You've gotta want it bad  
If that guy's got into your blood  
Go out and get him  
  
If you want him to be the very part of you  
That makes you want to breathe  
Here's the thing to do  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
I know something about love  
You gotta show him it and make him  
  
See that moon up above  
Reach out and get it  
If you want him to  
Make your heart sing out  
  
And if you want him to  
Only think of you  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
Ever since the world began it's been that way  
For woman and man were created  
To make love their destiny  
  
Then why should true love be so complicated? Oh  
I know something about love  
You gotta take it and  
Show him what the world is made of  
  
One kiss will prove it  
If you want him to be  
Always by your side  
Take his hand tonight  
  
Swallow your foolish pride and  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

Why does the sun go on shining?  
Why does the sea rush to shore?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world  
'Cause you don't love me anymore?  
Why do the birds go on singing?  
Why do the stars glow above?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world  
It ended when I lost your love.  
I wake up in the morning and I wonder  
Why everything's the same as it was.  
I can't understand, no I can't understand  
How life goes on the way it does  
Why does my heart go on beating?  
Why do these eyes of mine cry?  
Don't they know know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said goodbye  
Don't they know know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said goodbye

He was a poor boy having a hard time  
A shoulder chipped and a head for crime  
He was destined to be broken  
She found a diamond in a coal mine  
What she saw in him was a crooked line  
She just wanted him to straighten  
  
She said truth lies underneath the radical light  
Show you what you need, what you're looking for  
One night underneath the radical light  
She said once you see the truth you'll be wanting more  
  
She doesn't know why she's got the desire  
To lead this boy out of the burning fire  
Call it love or call it mercy  
See, one night she was dreamin'  
She saw a man who looked just like him,  
He said "When you find me baby set me free"  
  
We can shine standin' in the radical light  
Take a chance and find your vision  
We can feel fine walkin' in the radical light  
It all comes down to radical decisions  
  
I feel your sorrow  
I know you're afraid to let it go  
There's always tomorrow  
Come into the light you don't have to be alone anymore  
  
[Chorus: 2X]  
Show me, real truth, real love  
Wake me, hold me tonight  
Under the radical light  
Show me, the real truth, real life  
Under the radical light  
  
Someday we will be one  
Under the radical light

I have fallen, I have stood up, I've had the patience of a tree  
  
You have trembled, you have stayed still, you have tumbled like a weed  
  
All the mountains, all the deserts, go for miles and miles around  
  
We have driven for years now, baby, just to get bak to a place we had  
  
already  
  
found  
  
Now you're driving me downtown, baby, on a rainy night  
  
You're driving me crazy, baby, is this really life?  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought I'd be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
I was mistaken, our love was forsaken, the worst mistake I ever made  
  
Were you lonely, were you brave, now?  
  
I guess the two are one and the same  
  
Now I'm singing here with my sweet, sweet darling in my eye  
  
Ain't it funny how you're walking through life and it turns on a dime?  
  
I was missing you crazy, baby, are you really mine?  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought I'd be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Let's stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
Hey Hey Hey...

Hang all the mistletoe  
I'm gonna get to know you better  
This Christmas  
And as we trim the tree  
How much fun it's gonna be together  
This Christmas  
  
The fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me, yeah  
  
Hang all the mistletoe  
I'm gonna get to know you better  
This Christmas  
And as we trim the tree  
How much fun it's gonna be  
This Christmas  
  
The fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me, yeah  
  
Presents and cards are here  
My world is filled with cheer and you  
This Christmas  
Lights twinkle all around  
But your eyes outshine the town  
This Christmas  
  
The fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me, yeah  
  
The fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Blown away like the wind, restless again  
My only friend has gone away  
Washed like the tide but I'm still alive  
I'm gonna drive all night long  
  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
I can't walk away from you  
  
Shaken like a leave, sharpened like a reef  
All of my senses need relief  
Looking out to sea, I still believe  
That you and I were meant to be  
  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now (like a finger paint)  
Fill the space somehow (smearing in the rain)  
I can't walk away from you (wash it all away)  
  
This is crazy now (shaken like a leave)  
I'll fill the space somehow (Sharpened like a reef)  
I can't walk away from you  
  
This is crazy now  
(Shaken' like a leaf)  
Fill the space somehow  
(Sharpened like a reef)  
I can't walk away from you

I seem to walk on ice  
Some things make me think twice  
When I get that resistance  
Like having freedom with my hands tied  
  
I've censored what's inside way too long  
I can't live so black and white  
Somebody listen  
Somebody say what's on your mind  
  
I've got the wheels of the reckless  
I'm gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so I'm not alone  
Disturb this neighborhood  
Maybe it'll do some good  
You know what I'm missing  
When everybody's asleep at night  
  
Somebody's got to tlak  
Might as well be my job yeah  
Maybe somebody's listening  
You know I've censored this heart too long  
  
I've got the wheels of the restless  
I'm gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on all the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so I'm not alone  
  
I can't live so black and white  
You know what I'm missing  
Something's making me think twice  
Is anybody listening?

And when I see the sign that points one way  
  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You won't see me follow you back home  
  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I'm forced to cry  
  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You won't see me follow you back home  
  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
  
Still find a way to haunt me though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You won't see me follow you back home  
  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You won't see me follow you back home  
  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
  
You're not to blame

Maybe it's much too early in the game  
Ooh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's eve?  
  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Year's eve  
  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You received  
  
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance:  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?  
  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I'd ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You received  
  
Oh, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance:  
What are you doing New Year's  
New Year's Eve?

Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that I'm stronger without you  
And that I'll never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
When the heartache is over  
I know I won't be missing you (missing you)  
Won't look over my shoulder  
'Cause I know that I can live without you  
Yeah I can live without you  
Live without you

I guess you sunk in, oh yeah you made it in  
Now I'm fumbling somewhere deep within  
Will I raise my glass or will you kick my ass?  
Or will we fall down laughing, laughing?  
I know love is pain, I know your life's insane  
I want you anyway, I'll probably complain  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?  
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after  
But I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing, will you marry me?  
Strange behavior from my savior  
You yank me up and down just like a yo-yo  
Do you love me? You're an anomaly  
Or maybe you are just unbelievably ordinary  
Why would I subject myself to this kind of disaster?  
A respectable ball and chain is all you're really after  
But I'm tumbling inside this reeling feeling coming over me  
Will you ever decide? So unrevealing, will you marry me?  
I'm tumbling inside, I'm happiest when you are next to me  
But I'm still on the outside am I obsessed or will you marry me?  

Part of me wants to break the ice  
And part of me wants to roll the dice  
Exactly how it stands  
Part of me wants to roll the dice  
And part of me wants to leave them curled up in my hands  
  
Where they will be safe and no one will know  
How I really feel and I'll never be real  
And I'll roll with the punches that I'll never feel  
And I'll have a heart that no one can steal  
  
[Chorus]  
It's you and me and you're nowhere to be found  
I'm rolling on the ground  
It's me and you and I'm nowhere to be found  
  
Part of me wants to break these chains  
And part of me wants to keep them locked up tight  
Part of me wants to stop these rains  
And part of me wants them to fall all night  
  
Fall on my head just to wake me up  
Anything to drench my half-empty cup  
And I'm sorry baby I've had enough  
I'm tired of your promised tearing me up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You will be safe and no one will know  
How you really feel and you'll never be real  
And you'll roll with the punches that you'll never feel  
And you'll have a heart that I'll never steal  
  
[Chorus]
