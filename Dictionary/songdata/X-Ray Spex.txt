Packet of cigarettes on the counter  
Carrying a government health warning  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
  
Why not take paper currency and light it up?  
A lower tar content and a quicker puff  
Then you could keep the money, you could keep the tax  
You could keep the money, you could keep the tax  
  
Fields wasted growing tobacco  
Could be used to feed the third world countries  
This is the age of hypocrisy  
Everybody's saying, vote for me! Vote for me!  
  
Blind leaders leading the blind  
The cheaters and the cheated will you always find  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
The tax, the tax, the tax  
  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
The biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
  
Still they want the money, still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer is a heart attack

I clambered over mounds and mounds  
Of polystyrene foam  
And fell into a swimming pool  
Filled with fairy snow  
And watched the world turn day-glo  
You know you know  
The world turned day-glo you know  
  
I wrenched the nylon curtains back  
As far as they would go  
And peered through perspex window panes  
At the acrylic road  
  
I drove my polypropolene  
Car on wheels of sponge  
Then pulled into a wimpy bar  
To have a rubber bun  
  
The X-rays were penetrating  
Through the latex breeze  
Synthetic fiber see-through leaves  
The I fell from the rayon trees

Highly inflammable  
Waiting to explode  
Neurotic tensions  
Risen overflowed  
  
You thought I was a woman  
I thought you were a man  
But I was Tinkerbell  
And you were peter pan  
  
Influenced by the fashion pages  
Influenced by others' phases  
It ain't hip if you are retro  
You're a pseudo quasi intellectual  
  
Supreme equality  
We used to compete  
The right to decide  
Is denied to the sheep  
  
You thought I was a woman  
I thought you were a man  
But I was tinker bell  
And you were peter pan

Johnny's got an addiction  
He's strung out without conviction  
He was raised with a microwave  
Sticky trashy fast food slave  
  
He's a junk food junky  
He could be a lot more spunky hunky  
But he's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah, you know it's bad  
  
Mother doesn't really know  
Shopping in a glossy show  
Then again her budget's low  
Her health so bad it makes her slow  
She's a junk food junky  
She's stressed and very jumpy  
She's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah, we know its bad  
Blame it on the food yeah, we know it's bad  
Jenny's in a fix  
With her arithmetics  
Poor concentration  
Boys in the classroom cause agitation  
  
She's a junk food junky  
She could be a lot more fun  
  
But she's a junk food junky  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
Blame it on the food yeah  
You know it's bad  
You know it's bad  
be a d ! !

It's dark and eerie  
And it's really late  
Come on kid's don't hesitate  
We're going down to the underground  
We're going down we're going down  
To the underground  
  
The Hades ladies are dressed to kill  
Dagger glares from Richard hell  
Tension heightening heating frightening  
Thunder rolls as fast as lightning  
  
If you've got the urge  
Come on let's submerge  
  
The subterranean is a bottomless pit  
The vinyl vultures are after it  
Molten lava sulfur vapors  
Smolder on to obliterate us  
  
If you've got the urge  
Come on let's submerge

My mother the cow who still feeds me now is being tortured  
Her son the bull who the fields should plough is being slaughtered  
The human child in the womb who is never born for being unwanted  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Kali Kali  
  
My mother, the earth, man treats like dirt, her resources being exhausted  
Ant-like astronauts, of the human race, scratch and scar the moon's beautiful
face  
My brother, the sun, he still shines on  
He'll continue to shine for some time to come  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Kali Kali  
  
Lamentation Lamentation Lamentation (repeat)  
  
Heavenly Father still waters the grains  
Seems like tears fall as it rains  
Little boy blue come blow on your horn  
The sheeps in the meadow the cows in the corn  
Oh sweet friend of mine from an ancient nursery rhyme  
From a distant land once upon a time  
  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Melancholy in the Age of Kali  
Kali Kali

Bind me tie me  
Chain me to the wall I want to be a slave  
To you all  
  
Oh bondage up yours, oh bondage no more [Repeat: x1]  
  
Chain-store chain-smoke  
I consume you all  
Chain-gang chain-mail  
I don't think at all  
  
[Chorus:]  
Thrash me crash me  
Beat me till I fall  
I want to be a victim  
For you all  
  
[Chorus]  
Thrash me crash me  
Beat me till I fall  
I want to be a victim  
For you all  
  
Bind me tie me  
Chain me to the wall I want to be a slave  
To you all

Did you enjoy the party you went to the other night?  
No not really not really, no not really at all  
I was bored stiff all night.  
Did you find anyone you could talk to?  
Anyone with a lot to say?  
No not really no one, no not one not really  
Just a boy who had a fixation on his body all the time.  
He wanted to know if I..... he called 'making love'  
I said "My dear pubescent adolescent socks  
I gave up being shocking when you were getting spots  
Pour me a lime and soda and I'll not tell a lie  
But I've always been searching for something more sublime."  
  
Did you enjoy did you enjoy at all? (repeat)  
  
Then I met a Prima, Prima Donna Queen  
Who wanted to have a sex change 'cause he thought it would be a scream  
Decadence personified daddy's blood runs wild  
Half the world is starving mother says, you're a spoilt hung-up child.  
Then I met a guy who wanted to die  
With a smack crack deathwish his T-shirt said 'Destroy'  
I know I'm not this body and I'm just a fallen soul  
But you have to serve some time before you get out on parole  
  
Did you enjoy did you enjoy did you enjoy at all? (repeat)  
The party's over the party's over  
The party's over !!

1977 and we are going mad  
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads  
1977 and we're gonna show them all  
That apathy's a drag  
  
My mind is like a plastic bag  
That corresponds to all those ads  
It sucks up all the rubbish  
That is fed in through by ear  
I eat Kleenex for breakfast  
And use soft hygienic Weetabix  
To dry my tears  
  
My mind is like a switchboard  
With crossed and tangled lines  
Contented with confusion  
That is plugged into my head  
I don't know what's going on  
It's the operator's job, not mine  
I said  
  
My dreams I daren't remember  
Or tell you what I've seen  
I've dreamt that I was Hitler  
The ruler of the sea  
The ruler of the universe  
The ruler of the supermarket  
And even fatalistic me

We got something don't you know it's true?  
We got something don't feel it too?  
We got something, we got something to do  
Not a mushy line that I'm pushing on you  
Just another blue-note sung slightly out of tune  
We got something, we got something to do  
  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace.  
  
It may appear that we've been sleeping through our years  
And we've been living in an imaginary world  
But we know what  
We know what we got  
And if the choice was your of love eternally  
Or destruction of the world by some atomic energy  
The you'd know what  
You know what we got  
  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace. (repeat)  
We got got got, we got got got, we got we got something  
We got we got got got, we got got got, we got we got something  
Prayer for peace, prayer for peace  
Prayer for peace. (repeat)

Sophia look like a witch  
A beautiful witch is she  
Sophia look like a witch  
Hidden form in the name of chastity  
  
Sophia wears a crucifix  
Christ hung round her neck  
Sophia wears a crucifix  
Crucifix effect  
  
Sophia lies between black sheets  
Between black sheets she rests  
Sophia rises while the cock-a-doodle-doos' a calling  
And in black robes she's dressed  
  
Sophia look like a witch Sophia look like a witch (repeat)  
  
Sophia rises while the cockerel's mourning  
As the sun sets in the West  
Sophia is a mother with a child at her breast  
  
Sophia look like a witch Sophia look like a witch (repeat)

Warrior in woolworths  
Behind his serville innocence  
He's the rebel on the underground  
He plots and he schemes  
Humble he may seem  
She's the rebel of the modern town  
He's the rebel on the underground  
His roots are in today  
Warrior in woolworths  
She's the rebel of the modern town  
Doesn't know no history  
Warrior in woolworths  
He threw the past away  
Weapons rule their livesDips on Friday nights  
Youths meet at stockwell tube
