You are the best, for all of times  
You beat the rest, you're in my mind  
Don't take away this dream in me  
Don't leave me here in misery  
You are the best, from coast to coast  
From east to west, love you the most  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure, you'll beat the rest  
  
Ten seconds to countdown  
Ten seconds to know  
Who will be the hero  
Everybody loves the show  
  
Oh we're ready for the victory  
You're the hero number one for me  
Baby, baby  
We're in the pole position now  
  
(Ten seconds to countdown)  
  
You are the champ, a hurricane  
From heaven sent, you win again  
Oh tell me where the hero's gone  
But you are here, we can't go wrong  
The price is high, when dreams come true  
Oh we can fly, it's up to you  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure you beat the rest

Oh reach out to my dream  
All the masquerade of loneliness  
You're a fool, baby  
It seems words can not express  
Oh, only your lonely heart can show  
You're made for me I know  
It's the time for our love  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your love  
Need your kisses  
Baby, baby need that stuff  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your mind  
Need your kisses  
Always like the first time  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your soul  
A telegram to your heart  
A telegram to your soul  
It started in heaven  
I was lost in your lonely world  
I'll be there forever  
Oh you're gonna be my girl  
There must be more to live, take care  
Our love survive for share  
Your love with me tonight

Oh you playing games, playing games, hurting my soul  
Seven days, seven nights, without control  
Oh every day, every night I was alone  
When you're not next to me  
Should I listen to my heart, girl  
Should I listen to my brain  
When you tell me, you leave me, and you give it up  
Can't we still be friends?  
  
Oh after your love is gone  
I don't know where I belong  
When you're not next to me, not next to me  
I'm dying, crying baby  
Oh, after your love is gone  
Oh baby I'm so alone  
When you next to me, it's ecstasy  
I'm dying, crying baby  
  
Oh you playing games, playing games, playing with love  
You can run but don't hide, can't get enough  
Anyway, anywhere, I'll be there  
Cause you're the one for me  
Cause when I give you all my heart girl  
You know I will die for you  
And when you tell me, you'll leave me, and you give it up  
I lose my destiny

Don't take away my heaven, don't take away my heart  
Close your eye's to seven, but, do not tear apart  
It's an endless fire, it's an endless dream  
I feel love and desire, oh, it's really love it seems  
  
[Chorus]  
All I have, all I need and all I want is you tonight  
All I see and all I feel is just holding you so tight  
All I miss, all I dream and all I want is your sweet love  
All I miss is you, where ever I go and whatever I do  
  
My love is getting stronger, my love is here to stay  
I can't wait no longer, baby, make my day  
Oh, tonight I am lonely, so lonely without you  
Know that your the only and that my heart is true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, it's now or never, is it no empty way?  
I will stay forever, baby, what can I say?  
I miss you like crazy, where did you sleep last night?  
Nobody know's you baby, shouldn't you stay by my side?

Every little moment  
Oh, she dreams of you  
Half a million miles of love come true  
How can you mend all the heartaches you've made ?  
  
What is easy for two, is so hard for one  
What is gonna happen when the summer's gone ?  
How can you mend all the heartaches that you've made ?  
Baby, how can you mend all the heartaches that you've made ?  
  
Someone is breaking Angie's heart  
What about the thing called love ?  
He's breaking Angie's heart  
Her heart, her heart  
  
Someone is breaking Angie's heart  
One night is not enough  
Everybody got to believe in someone  
Ooh Angie  
  
Angie, there will never be another you  
If it doesn't fit that your dreams come true  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?  
Tears of love, you wasted for this love affair  
  
And his love will really hurt you, oh to care  
How can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?  
Baby, how can he mend all the heartaches he has made ?

Stay, please stay with me tonight  
And all the stars up in my Heaven  
They're shinin' bright  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it, if you stay  
Oh, I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
I know it hurts but it hurts me more and more  
I hear your heartbeat, baby louder than before  
And when I cry, I cry for you  
'Cause I know you are the only  
And when I die, I die for you  
'Cause I know your heart is lonely  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you, if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try, oh if you call  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely  
Don't leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh, you're the only  
I know it hurts you  
You are walking out my dreams  
You've set my heart on fire  
And now you're gone it seems  
My dying heart, it cries for you  
'Cause I know you are my only  
Don't break apart, can't let you go  
'Cause I know my heart is lonely  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it if you stay  
I will catch you if you fall  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh, anything is possible  
I know it from my heart  
I will try, oh if you call  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely  
Don't leave me girl and all the feelings right  
Oh, you're the only  
Don't leave me girl, don't leave me here tonight  
Oh, I'm so lonely  

What kind of fool I am  
There's no smoke without a fire  
You don't want me in your game  
There's a shadow of desire  
Come on in my arms again  
I don't need no heart that's broken  
Come and try me as friend, my love  
  
Arabian gold  
For your gangster love  
Arabian gold  
The last albatross  
Arabian gold  
For your heart and pride  
Arabian gold  
For you, midnight child  
  
Arabian gold  
For your precious love  
Arabian gold  
I can turn it off  
Arabian gold  
Frozen in my tears  
Oh, I'm crying  
Take away, away my fears  
  
Take the ship that never sailed  
Silent lover and devotion  
Seven lonely nights too late  
Oh, you're breaking my emotions  
Like a loser I will smile  
Hearts are better left unbroken  
Come an try me for a while, my love

Lady, I know it was hard  
But it's much harder to ignore  
There's a chance and I'll promise  
I won't hurt you anymore  
Hollywood nights we're romancin'  
You can trust me anytime  
Somewhere, oh babe - there is someone  
Oh you're dancing in my mind  
  
Ohoho, little queenie  
I'm your fool  
Come on, teach me the rules  
And I will send an S.O.S. for love  
Ohoho, little queenie,

And I will send a S.O.S. for love  
  
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love  
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above  
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love  
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop  
  
If loving you is wrong, babe  
Oh, I don't want to be right  
I've got you under my skin, babe  
And baby, hold me tight  
I'm ready for our romance  
I wait a million years for you  
I love you more than I'm saying  
Baby, that's for me the truth

Avec toi, avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will cry, I will die if you love me  
  
You're all I want, I told you twice  
You are for me my paradise  
My heart is makes a lonely sound to me  
You had the love right in your eyes  
But maybe you are telling lies  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
  
Avec toi, avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will smile, I will try, if you love me  
Avec toi, avec toi

You are my love, you are my life  
Without you girl I can't survive  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me

Tell me, that you mine baby til the end of time  
Tell me, you can't hide, that your love for me is right  
1, 2, 3 and 4 all my love you can't ignore

I was blinded by your love  
I was blinded by your love  
I couldn't talk to you last night  
Friends and strangers side by side  
I was blinded by your love  
  
Oh God knows  
We're walking through a fire  
Sound of breaking hearts around  
Oh you know, we're burning in desire  
City of the lost and found  
In a world of broken dreams  
We will build a better life  
You're my Venus in blue jeans  
Only the strong survive  
So come on baby, come on baby  
  
Dreams are made  
Made of deep emotion  
Love will feed a brand new world  
Baby, you need the shadows and devotion  
Living in a better world  
There's a heavy weather girl  
The clouds disappear  
The masquerade of loneliness  
Is drowning too much tears  
Come on baby, come on baby

It's 5 o'clock, I think of you  
Live my life without you and I'm feeling blue  
I told you lies, love fades away  
Oh I loved you baby but didn't say  
It's 5 o'clock a lonely night  
And I just remember, we were side by side  
I made mistakes, you went away  
And now I know the words, I didn't say  
  
How can I fall in love  
With a blue eyed coloured baby girl  
How can you tell me, we can't be together, oh no  
  
The night is gone, I couldn't sleep  
I saw the old videos, I'll always keep  
Day in day out, I'm missing you  
Is there just a little chance, what I can do?  
The night is gone, I watched a star  
I have to face the future, oh you're so far  
Some lies are true  
Can we stay friends  
Tell me baby when will I see you again  
  
How can I fall in love  
With the girl with the golden hair  
How can you tell me, we can't be together, oh no

Deep, love is a burnin' fire stay  
'cause then the flame grows higher babe  
Don't let him steal your heart  
It's easy easy  
  
Girl this game can't last forever why  
We cannot live together try  
Don't let him take your love from me  
  
You're no good can't you see

Behind the sun - I found some one - my china woman, oh no  
She's painting clouds - day in day out - my china girl, don't go  
Oh I can't oh I can't, oh I can't ignore  
The way she looks to me  
Oh I can't - oh I can't - oh I can't give her more  
Just my heart, she is my destiny

China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my china woman, oh no

Behind brown eyes, she's mystify - my china woman, oh no  
It's like a dream the moon turns green - my china girl, don't go  
I believe, I believe, I believe, I'll fly  
I'm writing hearts to you  
And I wait and I wait, see a rose in the sky  
Take my heart, what have I got to do

From New York to Hong Kong  
And back again  
It's the No.1 fun maker in the nation  
Making you dance  
  
She wanna rub me down, keep my muscles strong  
Keep it going on, from New York to Hong Kong  
Think of something freeky in a crazy form  
As long as I don't have to put ma pants back on  
She's the girl I never had, she's the girl of my dreams  
A body like a Lamborgini covered in jeans  
Too much for a man much more than I can stand  
Wanna pack my bags aud move to Japan....  
  
She has China in her eyes -can't you see it  
China in her eyes - can't you feel it  
China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my china woman, oh no  
I miss you so, can't let you go - my China girl - don't go  
  
From Paris to Bankok

You feel the music all around the world  
My China girl - Come on!  
  
Let me get tonight, you know I'll treat you right  
Want China in your eyes, 'til the morning light  
The next day you'll realize, I'll be holding you tight  
Because the love you be giving is dynamite  
I wanna freak you here, i wanna freak you there  
I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Tall as the China wall I wanna feel the world  
Let nothing come between me and my China girl  
  
She has China in her eyes -can't you see it  
China in her eyes - can't you feel it  
China in her eyes - a secret smile  
Oh can't you see, it's you and me - my China woman, oh no  
I miss you so, can't let you go - my China girl - don't go  
  
From the moon to the stars  
And all around the universe  
This is a dedication to you  
China in your Eyes

The heart of the ocean told me, you're the only one  
You're like a rose in the snow, and you need the sun  
And my heart is crying, when your love is dying  
What have I got to do  
And I'm tossing and turning, my heart is burning  
We're more than two  
  
You're my cosmic girl, you are in my mind  
And a girl like you, is so hard to find  
You're my cosmic girl, from rainbow two  
And to hell and back, I will go for you  
Oh cosmic girl come hear my heart  
I'll never try to break apart  
Oh cosmic girl, give me some time  
I swear you're always on my mind  
  
You are like the sunshine and I kiss away the rain  
I tell you I miss you baby can't we be friends  
Let's stay together, here and forever  
It's good for me, good for you  
The heart of the ocean, is always in motion  
What can I do?

Oh my heart is crying in the night for you  
Oh, my God, oh don't you feel like a fool  
You're fooling yourself with a millionaire  
You think it's love but he don't care  
And one of these days  
You're gonna be surprised  
  
Diamonds never made a lady, lover or a friend  
I know it  
Diamonds never made a lady, all your dreams will end  
I know it  
  
Your Californian nights  
Warm body held you tight  
Was just a dream  
But all the diamond lights  
Can't give you peaceful lives or sweet dreams  
  
Oh my God, you really think you have it made  
Your heart is won, with first class expenses paid  
You drink campaign, eat caviar  
A colour TV in the back of your car  
But one of these days  
You're gonna be surpised

I hear your heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat  
Playing with my mind  
Oh, I need you wrapped around me  
Just like I be on a veil  
But now I'm only lonely, lonely  
Holding on to you  
Oh, I need you back here with me yeah  
I think you want it too  
Now I feed you with a new emotion  
Heal you when you cry  
I'll be your loving doctor of the night  
  
Do you want to take me tonight  
Do you want to make me at night  
Do you want to, if you want to, take what you need  
  
Do you want to make it alright  
Do you want to heaven is tonight  
Oh baby, do you want to, if you want to, take what you need  
  
I hear your heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat  
Begging for more  
Oh, I need to hear that question  
Like a dancer needs the floor  
And now you're only, only, only  
Holding on to me  
Oh, now tell me that you're coming back  
One word is all I need  
Now I feed you with a new emotion  
Heal you when you cry  
I'll be your loving doctor of the night

Babe, how can you mend a broken heart?  
Oh, you're tearing me apart  
Thousand drums play in my mind  
Take, it off him put it on me  
Oh, I'm feeling so lonely  
And I'm holding back my tears  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to try a brand new start  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to a commander of my love  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my lonely heartache  
My heart bleeds love me lady  
Come, take a chance on love  
  
I can give you anything but love  
Take this chains from your heart  
Thousand drums are playing my mind  
Babe, harder I try, bluer I get  
Don't put my love in a dirty bag  
Until then there's no end

I'm crying through the night  
A cry of loneliness  
Strangers side by side looking for a kiss  
You feel your heart is dead  
Oh like a broken toy  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Your heart is out of tune  
These tears can never dry  
I'll save your heart, babe, soon  
Oh baby give a try  
A sound of breakin' hearts  
I hear again and again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Take my helping hand  
  
Don't let it get you down  
It's never too late  
Don't leave this heartbreak town  
Feel the love we'll make  
Harder you'll try the more you get  
Oh your heartbeat is too sad  
Come keep your heart just burning in the night  
For you and me  
  
You're tired of been alone  
But time is on your side  
You'll make it on your own  
Baby, if you'll try  
Holding back the tears and mend a broken heart  
Oh blue eyes, don't cry  
Never give you up  
Somewhere there's a friend  
When rain is in your heart  
Babe, don't let it end  
Oh light the flame of love  
Oh, call me just again  
Oh, I'll be there  
Where the rainbow end

Oh, Please Believe Me Baby - It's Just A Sad Sad Memory  
Oh, Please Believe Me Baby - I Swear I Am Not So Blind To See  
You Broke My Heart - And I Meant What I Say  
I Tell You, I Swear You - I Love You  
Oh, Please My Baby - Stay!  
Baby, I Love You - It's True  
  
Oh, Baby - Don't Let Me Down

I Am Calling Your Name - I Meant What I Say  
I Tell You I Swear I Love You  
My Love Is A Flame - Oh, Show Me The Way  
I Tell You, I Love You - It's True.....

A lonely avenue, it's raining in my heart  
No name, no number girl, how can I try a start without you?  
I'm as lonely as a cloud, oh, when your love falls down  
You make the sun keep shining, oh, when you're just around  
And whenever will be, I promise your love, forever my love  
  
Don't let me go, little darling  
Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling  
That I'm so in love with you  
Don't let him know, little darling  
Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling  
That I'll never let you go  
We're flying high and flying low  
Oh, babe there's one thing you should know  
I'll never ever let you go  
  
And when the sun goes down, my world is in your hands  
On silver clouds we'll fly, just to the rainbow's end, you and I  
Only my shadow knows, love is on my side  
I'll fly around the moon, only to hold you tight  
And whatever will be, I promise your love, forever my love

Woman is a man's best friend  
And I was crying in the night for love  
Baby, to the rainbows end  
I'll run for that sweet sweet stuff  
Oh, side by side  
I'll give all my love and emotions  
  
Don't lose my number, girl  
I'm qualified for  
Don't lose my number, girl  
I'm qualified for  
Don't don't lose my number  
I'm waiting for you  
Don't don't lose my number  
I'm qualified for love  
  
Diamonds are forever girl  
Save them for a rainy day  
I just want to be your world  
There's nothing left for me to say  
Oh, eye to eye  
I'll give all my love and devotion

Don't play  
Don't play with my heart  
  
You can stop my heart  
Love is here and now you're gone  
Oh please, don't tear apart  
Baby, I am so alone  
We're looking on the same stars  
And on the same moon  
What have I done to you, lady  
Oh, wherever you are, please come back soon  
Can't you see I'm waiting for you  
  
Oh, don't play with my heart  
Don't do that again  
If you tear it apart, I cannot be your friend  
Don't play with my heart  
Again and again  
If you tear it apart  
How this love will end  
  
Don't play (playing tricks with my heart) don't play (playing tricks with my
heart) don't play (playing tricks with my heart) don't play (playing tricks
with my heart)  
Oh, you know it's true  
I gave you every single day  
Now, it's up to you  
Baby, please don't go away  
  
Oh, we'll find paradise  
And we'll loose it all  
What have I done to you, lady  
Don't tell me no lies  
Just give me a call  
Can't you see I'm waiting for you

Electrify my heart, electrify my soul  
Oh baby don't, don't lose control  
Electrify my skin, electrify my brain  
Oh baby don't leave me again  
No matter what I do, I do it just for you  
Love will last forever  
You are a part of me, I'm not to blind to see  
We'll stay together  
  
Refrain: Don't take away my heart  
Don't break it and depart  
I'll be right here next to you  
Don't take away my heart  
Don't break it and depart  
When my heart beats, oh it's true  
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, don't say it's over  
Why do you promise, why do you promise love, I'll be your lover  
  
Electrify my life, electrify the rain  
Tell me the number of heaven again  
Electrify my night, electrify my time  
You are always on my mind  
Why do I love you so, cannot let you go  
Dreams will last forever  
The way you look tonight, lighting up my life  
Lets stay together  
  
I will stay, I will go, oh my baby let me know  
I will die, I will steal, baby if your love is real

Oh, life is so hard  
And you have to choose  
The call of the wind  
On the highway of fools  
Why does a man never cry when he's feeling  
You murder all his feelings  
Will you still be there  
Only love knows why  
Between the fire  
When white doves cry?  
Why does a man never show what he's meaning  
To murder all his feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When there's no one besides  
Your tears  
  
Don't worry baby  
I'll be by your side  
Don't let it ever get you down with you tonight  
Don't worry baby  
Where he has gone?  
My heart is out of my control  
I'm falling strong  
  
Don't worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight  
Come and get  
Come and get  
Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Don't worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight

Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Heart and pride  
  
I live for love  
And you've got to try  
Oh, don't let this chance, baby pass you by  
Why does a girl never cry when her feelings  
Are murdered by bad dealings  
It started in heaven  
There's a place for you  
Give me the chance for a rendez-vous  
Why does a girl never shows what she's meaning  
You murder all her feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When there's no one beside  
Your tears

Oh everybody needs somebody, baby (every needs someone to love)  
Anytime I see you, I get crazy (anytime I kiss you, can't get enough)  
  
Tell me, is this love, a burning fire  
That's burning fast, but then it's gone away  
Oh tell me baby, do you feel desire  
I'll give you everything, I'm too shy to say  
I don't want to lose you girl  
I won't let you go  
Oh I don't want to lose you girl  
My love will show  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody, baby

Anytime I kiss you, can't get enough  
  
Oh you, you are a symphony  
Oh you, you are my destiny  
Girl you, you are the venus of my heart  
  
Tell me babe, do you find another  
Another man, who's breaking your heart?  
Oh tell me baby, is he your new lover  
And will you say, love will break apart  
Oh this is now the end of love  
I won't let you go  
Oh why'd you break this lonely heart  
Say it isn't so  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody, baby  
Needs someone to love  
I get crazy  
I can't get enough  
  
Oh you, you are a symphony  
Oh you, you are my destiny  
Girl you, you are the venus of my heart

Oh fight for your love, fight for your heart  
Baby, don't break apart

Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare.  
  
Modern rebel Mr. Rust he showed the world Moscow or bust  
  
Flying in red baron's shoes zig-zag course  
That leaves no clues.  
The Kremlin says this can't be true  
  
Heads will roll 'cause this won't do  
  
Reuther  
Tass and cbs said this story is the best.  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare.  
  
No-one saw him on the screen  
  
'cause he kept his nose down  
Kept it clean  
  
Flying solo in his Cessna Mr. Rust beat Russion radar.  
Uncle Sam and Pentagon they couldn't do what he has done  
  
Gorbachev he had no laughs when Mr. Rust signed autographs.  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare.  
  
The people rolled their eyes  
And said the flag was black and gold and red  
  
The kgb took the plane away but some photos went astray.  
And the news went out around the world  
  
The story soon become unfurled  
  
The new born hero from the west came down  
To earth and pass the test.  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare.  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare. Fly to Moscow!

She's cool as ice, I'm hypnotized  
My heart is crying just for more  
No guarantee, she stays with me  
She's my dream, I can't ignore  
  
How can I just explain to her  
That she's my baby, oh I swear  
How can I just explain my love  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I am: higher than heaven (higher than heaven)  
In the middle of the night (of the night)

Oh, can't you see, love makes me stronger  
  
She's cool as ice, she's cool as ice

I can't explain-the way I feel  
Night after night - the stars shine bright  
You're my baby, oh it's real  
  
How can I just explain to you  
Tell me what have I got to do  
How can I just explain my love  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

Oh, Somewhere There Is A Chance For Me  
I Said To My Friends And Family  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere There's A Love For Me  
  
I Want To Find My Own Reality  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
Tell Me There's A Heaven - I Know That's It's No Dream  
Sometime's I'm High And Low Girl - And Sometime's Inbetween  
  
Tell Me How You Mend A Broken Heart  
I Don't want to Be The Lonely Eye  
Tell Me How I Find A Brand New Start  
I Will Never Be A Heart Survivor  
I Will Make My Dreams Come True  
Oh, I Will Try - Just For Me And You  
  
It's All Or Nothing - Forever Girl  
I Said Goodbye To My Old Old World  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
And Somewhere More Than Thousand Miles Away  
  
I'll Find My Heart - But, I Have To Say  
It's A Long And Lonely Road To Southern Chelsea  
I Will Find My Heaven - I'm Halfway To My Dream  
I See A Tiny River - Like In An Old Old Movie Scene

I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
I'll never find what I am searching for  
  
Oh, I know that I will die for you  
Can't you see my deep emotions?  
Tears may go, but, I'm lonely too  
My love is just like the ocean  
Oh, please come back to me  
Cause I won't die girl, for nothing  
Oh, your not blind to see  
Oh, I won't die girl, for nothing  
  
I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
I'll never find what I am searching for  
I can't give you more, I can't give you more  
There's no one else, this love you can't ignore

Why did you go  
Why did you run away  
Is there someting I can do  
I'm standing here  
Oh I don't know what to say  
Feeling helpless without you  
  
I do'nt care what you said and what you've done  
For me you're still the one  
Refrain  
I need you now  
It's the only thing that you should know  
Here's my declaration  
I need you now  
Searching for you wherever you go  
Looking for salvation  
I need you now  
I hear your voice  
When I'm so alone at night  
Want to hold you in my arms  
I see your eyes  
Shining so warm and bright  
Wanna fall into your charms  
I don't care what you said and what you've done  
For me you're still the one  
Refrain I need you now  
It's the only thing that you should know  
Here's my declaration  
I need you now  
Searching for you wherever you go  
Looking for salvation  
I need you now  
Bridge  
Oh I need you here and now  
Need to get to you somehow  
Tell the world that I will show my love to you  

Oh my baby, hold me, there is only you and me  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Tell me there's a heaven and there is a destiny  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
I will tell you baby, oh my love is real  
Can't you feel it lady - feeling what I feel?  
  
I will follow you - oh, every time and every minute  
I will follow you - see my love is true  
I will follow you - every time and every minute  
All I want to do - is making love to you.....  
  
There's no me without you, why an angel breaks my heart  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Please send me a rainbow, and we'll try a brand new start  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
And beyond my tears girl - I will see your smile  
Baby I can't wait - or wait a while  
  
I will follow you.....

All friends are gone, my heart, it burns like fire  
When the night comes falling, falling from the sky  
I was so wrong, how could I loose my desire  
How many times can we say goodbye  
Love is a sacrifice  
You have to head between the lies  
  
[Chorus: ]  
If I'll never see the sun again  
If I'll never have your helping hand  
If I'll never see a children smile  
My would is lost  
If we don't try  
  
I'm so alone - I cannot stand it forever  
Sometimes I feel, like I can't stand the pain  
All that I want, we can't do it together  
Only with you, I feel like I'm born again  
No matter what I do  
I do it baby just for you  
  
[Chorus: ]

Oh, I'll Never Give You Up - I'll Never Give You Up  
I'll Never Give You Up - My Promise Lasts Forever  
I'll Never Give You Up - I'll Never Give You Up  
I'll Never Give You Up - We Tie Our Dreams Together  
  
Oh, I Got What I Want - But, I Lost What I Had  
A Slave To Your Love - Oh, You'll Drive Me Mad  
Oh, Whatever May Be - My Baby And Me  
Oh, I'll Miss You Like Crazy - My Destiny  
I'm Talking To Myself - I Can't Let You Go  
We're Gonna Make It, Baby - I Know  
  
It's Higher Than Heaven - This Love Is No Lie  
Oh, I Promise You This Love Is No Goodbye  
If You Love Him Girl, I Will Sleep Beside  
All The The And Motion, My Baby Can't Hide  
I'll Never Be So Wrong - Please Don't Say Goodbye  
We Are Gonna Make It - Give Us One More Try  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Baby I Know - That I'm Hurting You So  
Can't Stand The Pain - Oh, I Can't Let You Go  
I'll Never Forget You - There Will Be A Day  
There Will Never Be A Girl - Who Looked At Me This Way  
  
Oh, I'll Never Find Just What I Am Searching For  
But, My Love For - Just Can't Ignore  
Oh, What Are You Doing With The Rest Of Your Life?  
Oh, Without Your Love - I Cannot Survive

That I'm hooked on you, my baby  
Are you ready to play this game  
I show your love, it's not the same  
I'll tell you no lies, I tell you the truth  
That I'm hooked on you my baby

And I'm so in love with you  
Can't you feel the rhythm of love

Outside the gates of heaven  
Oh, there lives a unicorn  
I close my eyes to seven  
Oh, this world is not my home  
A broken heart in danger  
And a pillow filled with tears  
Oh, can you see the strangers?  
In the pain and in the fears  
Can you feel my heart?  
Baby don't give up  
Can you feel my love tonight?  
  
In one hundred years  
Love is illegal  
In a hundred years from now  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal in this lonely, heartbreak town  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
All your dreams will die  
In a hundred years  
Love is illegal  
And your hope will not survive  
  
L.O.V.E.  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
L.O.V.E.  
Love is illegal in my heart  
Hear my heart is beating  
  
You're looking through a fire  
Computers everywhere  
Oh, you're a shotgun rider  
Controllers here and there  
And you read old love letters  
Drowning in the sea  
Oh baby it doesn't matter  
Oh you've lost all what you feel  
Can you feel my heart?  
Baby don't give up  
Can you feel my love tonight

You're hunting me  
In the night and in your fantasy  
It's the sign of the gypsy queen  
An endless dream  
You're hunting me  
I feel the need  
I never felt love so deep  
Love is so dangerous, mysterious  
I try to win, baby  
  
Oh, in Shaire  
You won't have my love for free  
You are selling frozen tears  
A journey to my heart and fears in Shaire  
In Shaire you will play a game with me  
You are stealing memories  
My heartbeat is a loving beat in Shaire  
  
In Shaire you try  
Breaking the rules  
Make white doves cry  
In Shaire I know  
All your love will come and go  
When I say you will take all my feelings away  
In Shaire  
  
You're hunting me  
Winning games of the night I see  
Loving you such is such a thrill  
You make me feel  
You're hunting me  
You're holding me  
I'm lost in a lonely sea  
And behind your painted smile  
You're a child  
Try to win, baby

A limousine in the night  
Drives away out of sight.  
The girl inside has stolen my pride,  
Run away with my whole life.  
  
Don't expect she'll turn around,  
Think about what she left behind.  
It's time to know what's goin' on.  
She turned my world around.  
  
She's the one, she's the girl  
That left me in this misery,  
Stole my pride, stole my life,  
Leaving me in mystery.  
  
You're my independent girl,  
You try to rule my world.  
And everytime she goes,  
She'll cast me in her spell.  
Independent girl living in her world,  
You never know how well -  
My love for her is blind.  
  
You're my independent girl,  
You try to rule my world -  
An independent girl.  
  
Day and night she feels no shame.  
Love to her is just a game.  
'Cause of her I feel I changed,  
Feel the day of her return.  
  
Calls my name, plays the game,  
Way ahead of time.  
Stole my pride, kills my life,  
Leaving me in disbelief

I watched the stars oh one by one  
Why you left me so alone  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart  
I watched the stars, I think of you  
Oh, I'm just the biggest fool  
Oh, why I let you break apart  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart  
  
It hurt's so good, to be in love  
You are the girl, I'm living for  
It hurts so good, to be in love  
Oh, I need you more and more  
It hurts so good, you're in my heart  
I love you more and more each day  
It hurts so good, let's try a start  
Oh, baby come what may  
You are with me, where I belong  
My heart can't get enough  
  
What's good for me is good for you  
Oh, I'll never make you blue  
Oh, why, oh why you break my heart  
From coast to coast and sky to sky  
Oh, there is no reason why  
Oh, why I let you break apart  
Oh, why, oh why, you break my heart

I cry the whole night, just for you  
My tears will dry, that is true  
But I can't live without you one more day  
You're always in my heart, I swear  
And if you call, I'll be there  
But I can't live without you one more night  
And I promise I will touch the sky  
If you ask me baby I will die  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you  
  
It's your smile, what makes my heartbeat fast  
It's your smile, and it will last  
I know, that you the one for me  
It's your smile, I can never let you go  
It's your smile, it always shows  
I know, that you're the one for me  
  
You mean everything to me  
Day in day out you're a mystery  
And I can't live without you one more day  
And everyday is a new day  
And I can't sleep, to see you stay  
Before my eyes my love can't let you go  
And I promise I will catch a star  
Move a mountain, even I know so far  
Oh babe I saved my life only for you

The times were hard and I was running  
I could feel my chance was coming  
Another time, another place  
A pillow filled with frozen tears  
  
See the gates, a distant fire  
Shows the way, to my desire  
Laying down my heart for you  
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue  
  
I know that I'll never die on love  
But I'll never get enough  
Oh, I got no time to lose  
  
On my avenue to a jet airliner  
Avenue to my broken dreams  
My avenue to a jet airliner  
Like an old old movie-scene  
  
My avenue to a jet airliner  
Brings me back to the dreams I loved  
Good guys only win in movies  
But this time babe I'll get enough  
  
(The avenue is closed, is closed forever)  
  
Love can breed misunderstanding  
But my heart will soon be landing  
Another love on golden wings  
Oh, I'll buy you diamond rings  
  
Waitin' for a lonely rainbow  
Magic wave where will I go  
Breaking down my heart to you  
'Cause I'm lonely, feelin' blue  
  
I know that I'll never die on love  
But I'll never get enough  
Oh, I got no time to lose  
  
(But you know, yes you know you can change it)

Did I ever ever told you  
That I miss you every night  
And I cannot find my sleeping girl  
If I cannot hold you tight  
Did I tell you when you left me  
There's no sun up in the sky  
An I cry so many time girl  
Just like a broken toy  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It was over, I can see  
And now you told me lady,  
there's a chance for you and me  
  
Just close your eyes - and stay with me  
There is a place - where I want to be with you  
Just close your eyes - take me in your heart  
I will love you pretty baby, if you try a start  
  
Did I ever ever told you  
That I dreamed of you last night  
Is there anything I can do  
cause I want to hold you tight  
Did I tell you I was dying  
When turned away from me  
Took away my sweet sweet heaven  
And I lost my destiny  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It is over, I can see  
And now you told me baby,  
There's a second chance for me

City lights spinning in my head  
Here comes the night and go to bed  
I'm sitting here in that night cafe  
My love won't go away  
Neverending dreams of you  
Lonely hours passing through  
Still missing you  
Where will you go, tonight?  
  
Just like an angel, you are  
Hotline to heaven, you're my star  
Just like an angel, in the night  
Ice in the fire, melt in the light  
  
Just like an angel  
Waiting for you  
Let me down easy  
Like angels do  
You're my angel  
Oh call on me  
Give me high, high energy  
  
I cross the streets to a telephone  
Shadows dancing - still on my own  
I'm sitting here in that night cafe  
My love won't go away  
Cafe is empty, the night goes by  
A million stars shine in the sky  
Still missing you, where will you go tonight ?

Bitter sweet, you wasted years  
Lonely dream about souvenirs  
Baby, touch an hand and make a friend, tonight  
Bitter sweet love has no pride  
Try again time is on your side  
Oh, strange are the ways of love  
Come on and take my heart  
It's breaking just apart  
  
Keep love alive  
Too hard to hold it  
Keep love alive  
Too hard to stop it  
  
Keep the fire burning in your heart  
Forever and ever  
Keep the fire burning from the start  
Ever together  
  
Bitter sweet so high so low  
Lonely dreamer  
Life is a show  
Oh, touch an hand  
Make a friend, tonight  
Bitter sweet more than words can say  
Evil women want to play  
Oh, strange are the ways of love  
Come on and take my heart  
It's breaking just apart

Like a hero in the midnight rain  
Like a hero I will go

Oceans of sorrows  
A man with no tomorrow  
No more tears, my baby  
I cry for you  
No more fears, oh maybe  
I'm missing you

A broken heart, a pillow filled with tears

Everybody needs someone to hold

A penny for your thoughts, oh to care

Come on, take the rest of me  
  
Tonight did what  
It means to be so young  
When two hearts are beating  
Just as one  
Our love can go a long, long way  
There's nothing left for me to say  
Nobody makes me crazy, like you do  
Take the starts out of the sky for you

(Hold me darling, you know that I really, really love you)  
  
Oh lady, oh lady, my heart is crying  
Can't holding back, keep on trying  
You went out off that door  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
Oh let me, oh let me explain  
Love don't live here anymore  
Oh let me, oh let me explain  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
Troubles stole my paradise  
Was our love just blind ?  
Look what you have done to me, my love  
You can still win back my heart  
Love can find a way  
Got my love lying in your hands  
Oh, still I can't explain  
Why you went away  
So, I ask again have you gonna stay  
I feel just the same  
Love might come again  
Emotion, emotion  
  
Oh lady, oh lady, my one and only  
You've been gone  
I'm feeling so lonely  
You went out off that door  
Love don't live here anymore  
Oh let me, oh let me explain  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
(Hold me darling, you know that I really, really love you)  
  
Could I ever love you more babe  
Than I did before  
See you through the eyes of love, my love  
I gave everything, how could you  
Were to blind to see  
But my love is still for you babe  
Still I can't explain  
Why you ran away  
So I ask again  
Have you gonna stay  
I feel just the same  
Love might come again  
Emotion, emotion

When I was young  
  
I took my feelings just for fun  
I never knew how long I stay with someone  
Never really care to know  
Now times are changing  
Been through every high and low  
And falling into all affections  
But thing that is true  
It's the best thing I share with you  
  
Love is forever  
Forever in your arms  
And all I need is to hold  
Hold you like no one before  
And never let you go  
Love is forever  
  
Then I met you  
And I was feeling so alive, baby  
A joy like this I've never seen before  
In the best years of my life  
Gone all the bad times  
Never knowing where to go  
Wand'ring around in darkness  
Now my days are bright  
'Cause you're the sunlight in my life  
  
Love is forever...

When I Look Into Your Eye's - I Can See A Part Of Heaven  
Never Felt Like This Before - In My Life...  
Love Shines In Many Colors - Love Is Shining For Us  
Believe Me - That My Love Is Real...  
  
Love Will Lift You Up And And Let You Down  
The Light Behind The Shadow Will Tell You  
That I Will Never Go.....  
If You See A Rainbow In The Sky  
I Will Promise That You'll Never Cry - Again  
Those Tears From Heaven...  
  
Every Hour And Every Minute  
I Will Touch You And I Will Feel It  
Alway's Looking For Someone Like You In My Life

Oh Maria, oh Maria, oh Maria, oh, ah  
Oh when she speaks, this Spanish words  
It's like a fire in my soul, and it hurts  
And when she moves, I cannot sleep  
I think I'm strong, but I know I'm so weak  
When she's next to me  
Oh it's like ecstasy  
  
Lonely Maria, Maria, Maria  
You're such a beautiful but lonely senorita  
Lonely Maria, Maria, Maria  
Oh do you have the time, to kiss me oh Maria  
Maria, Maria, I know  
Maria I miss you so  
Maria, Maria don't go  
Baby I need you so  
  
Oh when she danced, and when she smiles  
It's like an old old Spanish lullaby  
And when she talks, see now her dance  
It's like an old old Spanish love romance  
When she's next to me  
Oh it's like ecstasy

Oh everyday and just every night  
I see your face babe on my laptop screen  
You're high and low and just between  
Oh everyday and just every night  
I send an e-mail to the dream factory  
I asked if you're reality  
But more and more I like you more than just before  
  
Oh la da die, oh la da da  
Only a vision, Mrs. Robota  
Oh, oh, oh, la da die, oh la da da  
Only a computer, without a heart  
Oh Mrs. Robota, just a fantasy can't break my heart  
Mrs. Robota, only a fiction, right from the start  
It's impossible  
  
Oh every morning, when I wake up  
I push the bottom for a brand new game  
Can't live without you, it's a shame  
I hear your voice, and I see your face  
I can't believe, oh babe you blow my mind  
There is no answer, I can find  
And more and more I like you more than just before

Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
  
Like an angel, you came in my life  
I'm walking on on cloud number 9  
This may not be the start of the world  
Is your heart really mind?  
When will I see you again?  
When will this sad moment end?  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changes this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Like a stranger, you're sometimes to me  
But whatever will be, will be  
One step from heaven, I don't stop this love  
I know you're my destiny  
When will I see you again?  
When will this sad moment end?  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changes this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing changs this love - oh it's forever  
I will never tear apart  
  
Nothing but the truth (nothing but the truth)  
Nothing but my heart (nothing but my heart)  
Nothing takes the place of you, my love  
  
Nothing but the trunt

You're walking like an angel in heaven  
In the night I see an angel in you  
In my lonely dreams I count to seven  
And I call you baby  
Know that it is true  
When you're young and in love  
It's too hot to stop  
Young and in love  
You never give up  
  
Only love can break my heart  
It's tearing me apart  
Now I never feel brand new  
Only love can break my heart  
Playing it's so hard  
Nobody love's me like you do  
  
Only love can break my heart  
It's time to make a start  
Babe, I love you without end  
Only love can break my heart  
You'll make it if you start  
Babe, take me as your friend  
  
Your feelings are tossing and turning  
You have to love to pay the right price  
Your lonely heart keeps on burning  
But an angel will hear many lies  
When you're young and in love  
It's too hot to stop  
Young and in love  
You can never give up

It was a cold November day  
Raindrops on the window  
I was asking you to stay  
Hoping you wouldn't deny and then you gave me that smile  
It only took me a while  
To see my heart was burning just for you  
  
  
And life with you is like paradise  
Standing hand in hand  
And that's just when I realize  
These memories are the treasures of my past  
  
Deep down in my heart  
The strongest of emotions  
Never wanting us apart  
I'm feeling hot devotion  
And every secret we share  
Nothing we can't take care  
Knowing our hearts share the strongest love of all  
  
And life with you is like paradise  
Standing hand in hand  
And that's just when I realize  
These memories are the treasures of my past  
  
And then you gave me that smile  
It only took me a while  
To see my heart was burning just for you

If I have to cry, if I have to kill  
If I have to die, oh baby I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
If I have to beg, if I have to steal  
If I have to swim, through oceans, I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
I miss you forever, forever my love  
  
Oh baby, why does it always rain in my heart  
My sweet baby?  
Oh my lady, I can't live without you, oh no  
Oh baby, why does it always rain in my heart  
Tell me baby  
Oh my lady, I'm lonely and I'm blue  
  
If I have to climb, on the greatest hill  
If I have to fall, oh baby I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
If I have to lose, everything just for you  
If I have to fight, oh baby I'll do  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
I love you forever, forever my love

Ready for the party, 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 go  
Go, go, go, ready for the victory, go, go, go  
  
You're in our hearts,  
Just from round to round  
And you will be the champion,  
The king without a crown  
Like a fireball (like a fireball)  
You never never give up (never give up)  
Hear the engine call (hear the engine)  
Waiting for a start (waiting, waiting)  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't you see, we're ready for the victory  
It's clear, you're the hero just for you and me  
I feel, we're in the pole position team  
Oh can't you see, it's like a dream  
From Australia, to USA  
And from Italy, to Germany  
And from San Marino, to Canada  
He is our biggest star  
  
Ready for the party, 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  
Oh you cannot lose, if you have a lucky hand  
And you will be the hero, you have many friends  
Oh dreams we cannot buy (cannot buy),  
But you will win again (win again)  
Nobody does it better (does it better),  
Through passion and through in  
  
[Chorus]

Secret message for a rendez-vous  
Distant fire it's hurting you  
It's so sad  
Good love go's bad  
Tears of love will make me sad  
Frozen teardrops  
Running with the night  
Sorry doesn't always make it right  
Tears of love tears in my heart  
Why did love just break apart break apart?  
  
I'm riding on a white swan  
I need your love tonight  
I'm riding through a hard storm  
Don't treat me like a child  
  
I'm riding on a white swan  
I've got just what you need  
I'm riding on a white swan  
You've got the best of me  
  
On the wings of a nightingale  
Playing games your love for sale  
Then my girl belongs to yesterday  
No return don't lose your way  
It's more than just the two of us  
Heart is open come on, trust  
Love I gave for your mystic smile  
Should I go (?)  
Or stay awhile stay awhile  
  
I'm riding on a white swan

In the nights of lost and found  
Many strangers are around  
You're nobody until someone will love you  
You can't make it on your own  
When you standing there alone  
Many heartaches keep the world on turning  
'Cause you are fooled by your feeling  
You can pay the price of love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
You're undercover, yeah tonight  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
Romantic warrior, yeah tonight  
  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your love  
Oh oh oh  
We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your heart  
We're fighting for your love  
  
Legends have a broken heart  
There's someone who tore apart  
Oh, there must be more to life than this, babe  
Idol love can't last through years  
How can love, babe, last through years ?  
You're surrounded, baby, oh by strangers  
Come let me be your hero  
And I'm fighting for your love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart

That Day In September  
  
When I Promised All My Love  
Baby, I Was Dreaming Of  
That You Were Here With Me  
Oh, Baby Can't You See

I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
In a smokey night cafe, all the guys are so happy  
Baby I can see  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Thinking of you, girl, all this sweet sweet memories  
We built a better world  
When will I see you again, baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me, my sweet baby  
I won't cry for yesterday, baby come and hear me say  
Tell me, do I have a chance, my love?  
  
I will run to you, I will kiss the rain  
Make your dreams come true, if I have you back again  
I will run to you, everyday and night  
Give you all my heart, want to have you by my side  
  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Catch a falling star, when you're there the sky is bluer  
But you are so far  
I'm sitting here, I'm lonely  
Can't trust your pretty face, maybe you were telling lies  
I saw you in this place  
When will I see you again, baby let me be your man  
Tell me that you miss me, my sweet baby  
I won't cry for yesterday, baby come and make my day  
Tell me do I have a chance, my love

Lady you can trust my heart, you know  
I know that the love survive  
Love is all what matters girl  
Love is all what matters  
I'll never understand it's hard, I know  
Oh god, why she lost her life  
Love is all what matters girl  
Love is all what matters  
Down on my knees I pray for you, baby, baby  
Oh girl no matters what I do  
  
[Chorus]  
Send me a letter from heaven, send me a letter from heaven  
Do you wait for me my girl, oh oh  
Send me a letter from heaven, a little letter from heaven  
Wait 'til I will leave this world  
Oh now and forever I'll swear your love is all what matters  
Soon we're together, I know girl, love is all what matters  
  
Every night I see your smile, I swear  
Heaven just comes down to me  
Love is all what matters, love is all what matters  
Baby can't you wait a while, please dare  
And we have eternity, love is all what matters girl, love is all what matters  
Oh will you send a message to me, baby, baby  
I know it means eternity

My tears will never dry  
Behind my painted smile  
You are the nearest thing to heaven, girl  
This world is not my home  
Love in a danger zone  
Some hearts are better left unbroken, girl  
  
Slow-motion, baby  
Hold on tight  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
Deep inside  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
I got hooked on you  
I know it isn't true  
Slow-motion, baby  
Full of pride  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
I have cried  
Slow, slow-motion, baby  
'Cause only love knows why  
I know I want to die  
  
Good love can never die  
Inside my love's alive

They just don't need  
Just when I needed you most  
Oh babe, God only knows  
I'm lost without your love in me, baby

Want to see your face (Wanna see your face)  
Wherever you be, send some words to me

Albatross  
Show me a dream of love  
Albatross  
Without her love I'm lost  
Good love never dies  
Angels never fly so high  
I'm dreaming, dreaming  
Coming back to me  
  
I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere, take care  
I'm stranded in a struggle of my dreams, it seems  
Baby, oh I need you more  
Like roses need the rain  
Baby, oh I need you more  
Come and take my hand  
  
Albatross  
Harder I try, bluer I get  
Albatross  
Don't leave me alone I'm sad  
Oh, I find my home  
Right back where I started from  
I'm dreaming, dreaming  
Coming back to me  
  
I'm stranded  
Nobody cries, time's on my side  
I'm stranded  
I don't know where but you're not there  
I'm stranded  
Playing the fool, breaking the rules  
I'm stranded  
Take up your hand, make me a friend

Yo, yo, I wanna be close to you  
  
Anytime that you go,  
Girl I'm gonna miss you so  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
With my head in the clouds  
Oh my heart is crying loud  
Oh I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And I know, you are my angel  
But angels are not flying low  
And I know, oh you are my angel  
And I'll never let you go  
  
A summer in December  
Love we just remember  
A summer love in winter  
I always will remember  
  
And the way you look tonight,  
Make the stars shine bright  
I wanna he close to you, close to you  
Every step on my way, every word I will say  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And for me, it was like heaven  
Everything will turn out fine  
And for me, it's like a heaven  
Baby give it some more time

So sad  
Watch good love go bad  
Smoke from a distance  
Fire burning me  
Oh, babe, the heaven can't wait  
I need these hints  
I'm feeling, my heart is appealing  
  
Sweet lady sheila  
Do you? Do you really want me?  
Sophisticated lady want me  
Sweet little Sheila  
Do you? Do you really love me?  
She's a different baby to me  
  
I only want Sheila  
Oh my Sheila  
Oh, she's precious  
Like the sun  
I only want Sheila  
Oh, my Sheila  
Oh she's foolish  
And most fun  
  
Oh, babe  
For the promise you made  
Be careful they've got storms, you're afraid  
Oh, babe  
Don't say it's too late  
Words can't express my feelings, being  
Believing

You're breaking my paradise  
Hearing an echo cry  
Don't be fool for stealing hearts  
Dreamland at your fate  
You never find your way  
Don't be fool for tears of love  
All precious memories, you had through the years  
All they are passing one by one  
You kill the memories  
Wave off the pain and tears  
Baby, together we are strong  
  
10000 lonely drums  
Are playing in my heart  
10000 drums of dreaming fell apart  
10000 drums are playing just for you  
10000 drums are saying I'm missing you  
  
Oh, my drums  
They're playing in your mind  
Thinking of endless lovers  
Some too hard  
Oh my drums  
I never let you go  
They give the mimbick of a lonely drum  
  
Like a hero will smile again  
If you will play this game  
Don't be a thief for stealin' hearts  
Like all the thousend smiles  
It takes a little while  
Don't be fool for tears I love  
Welcome to paradise  
If you will realise  
Then passing one by one  
You kill the memories  
Wave off the pain and fears  
Baby, together we are strong

See all stars - so fine tonight  
And the old nightingale is flying tonight  
To my dreams  
Here are the birds are quiet tonight  
And titanic is calling an echo of love  
To your heart  
And it hurts so much  
But I have to go  
Oh, it hurts so much  
'Cause you have to know  
  
And the angels sing in New York city  
Do what I want to do  
And the angels sing, sound so pretty  
Baby, I'm missing you  
  
Do you need love  
Hey, I see the albatros  
Do you fever?  
Hey man in the stars above  
Do you need love?  
Titanic - a call of love  
  
I'm a million miles from home  
And the fire of mountains are calling tonight  
To my dreams  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
And the lonely dreamer is crying tonight  
In your dreams  
And it hurts so much  
But I have to go  
Oh, it hurts so much  
'Cause you have to know

I know, I know, your love  
Is like the ocean  
I know, for sure, your head is in the clouds, my love  
Oh I know, your love, is like a sweet devotion  
Baby, baby tell me, tell me, what's love is all about  
  
There's something in the air  
Oh be...be...baby, your love is so unfair  
Oh be...be...baby  
There's something in the air, something in the air  
Baby but your love is crazy, baby I don't care  
There's something in the air tonight  
  
Baby but your love will make it always right  
Baby there's something in the air tonight  
Oh I can feel it  
I know we make a night, we will remember, oh no  
I know we turn the night, in million days, my love  
I know for sure it like summer in December  
Baby, baby, nobody knows, where is the perfect way

Like the leaves falling off a tree  
I feel your love is dying for me  
You tell me it's not the end  
Where is the love that you forsake  
You forsake, you forsake  
  
There's too much blue in missing you  
I believe I was a fool  
Before you say goodbey  
Oh, give us one more try  
Yet, I can't forget all the love we had  
There's too much blue in missing you  
Oh believe my heart is true  
Your love slipping away, a little bit every day  
Throw it away, it's such an easy way  
  
Look at me I'm the lucky one  
Without feelings you can't be strong  
Though I call you in the night  
To hear your voice, Feel you deep inside  
Deep Inside, Deep Inside

We still have dreams  
You've got a friend  
Young hearts are free  
Until the end  
  
Baby, I've been lonely for so long  
Lady, I'm tired of being alone  
Save me, 'cause everybody needs some love  
Got a date with an angel, baby  
Be my for ever, lady

We'll take the chance, we will again  
It's our dream and you will see, we'll go hand in hand  
  
I know we're here but I feel, we're not alone  
Millions of people are waiting, in their homes  
See all the winners and losers, they're always in our hearts  
Oh, everybody's waiting, waiting for a start  
  
We'll take the chance, we'll win again

We're living in deep emotion, we're fighting with our hearts  
Oh, everybody's waiting, waiting for a start

Baby I feel guilty, there's no reason why  
Oh baby cause I promised you, love will never lie  
Oh I send a wish to heaven  
I can't stand the pain inside  
This moment tells a story  
And I'm stronger than my pride  
  
It was the night, when the sky rained fire  
(when the sky rained fire)  
It was the night, when the stars begin to fall  
It was the night, when I lost my hearts desire  
It was the night, baby-when I missed your call  
  
Music is the answer-baby, if you cry  
Can't you tell me, where love goes, when it dies  
And I knew it's all or nothing  
It was not a love affair  
Lay your cards here on the table  
If you need me I'll be there

Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The rain is getting stronger, I listen to the rain  
And I can't wait no longer, oh please come back again  
If I could live forever, baby I will live with you  
If we can't be together, baby I will die, it's true  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
Who will be there, my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when I'm alone  
Who will be there, where is my home  
Who will be there, it's so unfair, stay by my said  
  
Who will be there  
Who will be there  
  
The summer was oh magic, oh baby just we two  
Now times are getting tragic, and lonely without you  
Oh when my heart is crying, baby oh it cries for you  
And if our love is dying, baby I will die, it's true  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
Who will be there, my heart cries loud  
Baby I swear that I'll be there, if you need me  
  
Who will be there, when I'm alone  
Who will be there, where is my home  
Who will be there, it's so unfair, stay by my said  
  
Who will be there, when the lights go out  
And when my heart cries loud

Father they have written  
On the point of no return  
Soldiers they will come and  
Oh they're coming to burn  
(I said) Oh boy, we need your hope to live  
Oh boy, you have so much to give  
Oh boy, don't let it get you down  
  
Who, baby, who will save the world ? (it's not too late)  
Who, baby, who will save the world ? (all heroes hesitate)  
I'm too young to die  
I'm too young to die  
  
Father, I've been looking  
Through a rainbow of tears  
Found yourself so lonely  
Oh they're drowning in my fear  
(I said) Oh boy, I'm old enough to know  
Oh boy, that it hurts to grow  
Oh boy, don't let it get you down

[Chorus: ]  
You take me up, and than you take me down  
I hear my heart, it's such a lonely sound  
And I know my love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
The grass is greener, girl when I see you  
The sky is bluer, girl it's true  
But I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
'Cause I, I want to kiss your lips tonight  
  
Why does it feels so good  
To be with you tonight  
'Cause no matter what I do, I do it just for you, my love  
Why does it feels so good  
If you are by my side  
'Cause no matter what I do it's only me an you  
'Cause it's  
One to make me crazy  
Two to be my baby  
Three you'll never let me go  
Oh it's  
Four you play with fire  
Five higher and higher  
Six and baby time will show  
  
Why does my heart, is beating just for you  
You promised on a secret rendevous  
And I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart, you're dangerous  
Maybe I'm weak, and you are strong  
But babe I know where my heart belongs

Sail across the universe  
All the magic here on earth  
Slipping and sliding  
Rolling and riding to you, my love  
Summer breeze reminded me love was wild and love was free  
Love was wilde and love was free  
Memories were hiding  
Baby, come riding to me  
  
Wild, wild water  
Brings me back to you (over and over)  
Wild, wild water  
Babe, still missing you (over and over)  
  
Wild, wild water  
Freeze the wind in summersky  
Wild, wild water  
Expect that love that just wo'nt die  
  
Silverwater evening tide  
Brings that girl back to my side  
Slipping and sliding  
Rolling and writing to you, my love  
You will be coming back some day  
True, we gonna come what may  
Memories were hiding  
Baby, come home riding to me

Dreams are flying like an eagle  
To the orinoco flow  
From the desert of Eldorado  
To the east coast, yes I know  
  
A heart of gold, and she's alone  
Garden Eden is her home  
She's like a storm, she's like a star  
You think she's near, but she so far  
She's like the sun in wintertime  
She's hard to find  
  
She's the witch queen of Eldorado  
High on the mountain, heya heya heya hoh  
For the freedom in Eldorado  
She's the fountain, heya heya heya hoh  
She's the witch queen of Eldorado  
Lady of fire - heya heya heya heya hoh  
And she fighting for Eldorado  
With her desire - heya heya heya heya hoh  
  
She is warming frozen roses - gives you dreams  
Money can't buy - in the desert of Eldorado  
All your dreams will learn to you  
  
She's justified in wounded knee  
Some lies are true, oh can't you see  
Follow the sun, and you will find  
A secret room, just in your mind  
Let's make this world, a better place  
For the human race  
  
Love can move the greatest mountain  
And all your love comes back to you  
In the desert of Eldorado  
Oh some dreams are coming true  
  
Walk on water - walk on fire  
The wind must come, from somewhere  
In the desert of Eldorado  
There is the answer, oh take care

They said : Oh yeah, it's a tough world  
You're restless and you're young  
I said : Oh girl, it's a good twirl  
And your time will come, your time will come  
They said : you came from the wrong side  
He's a page from the end of the book  
I said : You came from the right side  
Took me just one look  
Then you understood  
  
With a little love  
You will survive  
With a little love  
You will get by  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
'Cause its your life  
  
With a little love  
You'll make a start  
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
'Cause it's your life  
  
They said : no future forget it  
You came from the wrong side of town  
I said : don't listen, don't let it  
Let it bring you down  
Make you wear a frown  
They said : Oh let him down easy  
Laugh at the heart you have won  
I said : that life is for living  
Like the morning sun  
It had just began

Love delight, deep inside  
I'm sharing all my love with you  
Oh, I know I can't live without you girl  
I can't live without you  
Take me away  
Make my day  
Every time I see your face  
Oh, I know I can't live without your love  
That I can't live without you  
There's one life to live  
And one heart to give  
Tell me that you need  
Body heat  
Just turn out the lights  
  
You and me  
Dreams are free  
Just a woman and a man, babe  
You and me  
Can't you see  
That I'm doing what I can, babe  
Babe, you and me  
Ecstasy  
And I never want to lose you  
To the end of the world  
Oh, I'll stay by your side  
You and me  
Oh, I feel  
Like the moon was made for lonely  
You and me  
Oh it's real  
You are the one and you're the only  
You and me  
Memories  
All the love that's never ending  
To the end of the world  
Oh, I'll stay by your side  
  
It's getting late  
And I can't wait  
The ocean beating in my heart  
Oh, I know I can't live without you girl  
I can't live without you  
I call your name  
Again and again  
I lose my soul, my self-control  
Oh, I know that I can't live without your love  
That I can't live without you  
There's one life to live  
And one heart to give  
Tell me that you need, body heat  
Just turn out the lights

You packed your things in a carpetbag  
Left and never looking back  
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes  
Music wherever you go  
You don't fit in a smalltown world  
But I feel you're the girl for me  
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes  
You're leaving town where nobody knows  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it, you will win  
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy  
Take my hand, follow me  
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it you will win  
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance  
Take my hand for the night  
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight  
  
Oh, darkness finds you on your own  
Endless highways keep on rolling on  
You're miles and miles from your home  
But you never want to phone your home  
A steady job and a nice young man  
Your parents had your future planned  
Rings on your finger, paint on your toes  
That's the way your story goes

Deep in my heart, there's a fire  
That's a burning heart  
Deep in my heart, there's desire for a start  
I'm dying in emotion  
It's my world in fantasy  
I'm living in my, living in my dreams  
  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
I keep it shining everywhere I go  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
I'll be holding you forever, stay with you together  
  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
That's the only thing I really know  
  
Let's close the door and believe my burning heart  
Feeling alright, come on, open up your heart  
I'll keep the candles burning  
Let your body melt in mine  
I'm living in my, living in my dreams

You remind me can't you see  
Of a girl just memories,  
A flickering of your eyes tonight  
I see her in the light  
  
Something happened on the way  
To heaven, but I just can't say,  
Oh why she had to go away,  
Baby come what may  
  
You're not Lisa, oh I know  
She's in heaven, had to go  
You're not Lisa, that's no lie  
I will see her, in paradise  
  
If there's a god somewhere  
Oh do you think it's really fair, oh she was only 23  
Give her back to me  
How could I forget the time  
  
We were together, she was mine  
Oh anytime and anywhere,  
I wish she could be there

You are my teacher, I come to school  
I love you, baby  
Sometimes I'm right and then a fool  
Oh, be my lady  
It's not a game I play with you  
Darling I know, 'cause I know the golden rule  
  
Do what you want be what you are  
You're the lady of my heart  
Oh come, oh come to me  
  
I was lonely  
I was so lonely  
I never break apart  
The loving feeling  
My sense is reeling  
You're the lady of my heart  
  
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose  
I love you baby  
Sometimes we sin, I always choose  
You're my lady  
Always forgive what I have said  
Darling, I know  
We'll hold together come what made
