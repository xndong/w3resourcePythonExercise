ANSWER ME OH MY LOVE  
JUST WHAT SIN HAVE I BEEN GUILTY OF  
TELL ME HOW I CAME TO LOSE YOUR LOVE  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE  
  
YOU WERE MINE YESTERDAY  
I BELIEVED THAT LOVE WAS HERE TO STAY  
WON'T YOU TELL ME WHERE I'VE GONE ASTRAY  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE  
  
IF YOU'RE HAPPIER WITHOUT ME  
I'LL TRY NOT TO CARE  
BUT IF YOU STILL THINK ABOUT ME  
PLEASE LISTEN TO MY PRAYER  
  
YOU MUST KNOW I'VE BEEN TRUE  
WON'T YOU SAY THAT WE CAN START ANEW  
IN MY SORROW NOW I TURN TO YOU  
PLEASE ANSWER ME MY LOVE

I left her by the river sainte marie  
We pledged our love from to eternity  
Now along the pebbled pathway to her door  
We kissed and then we kissed again and parted on the shore  
  
The angels wings reached out upon the sea  
I saw her kneel and say a prayer for me  
When winters gone and spring is on  
I will meet her by the river sainte marie hay  
  
musical interlude  
  
Hay I left her by the river sainte marie  
We pledged our love from to eternity  
Now along the pebbled pathway to her door  
We kissed and then we kissed again and parted on the shore  
The angels wings reached out upon the sea  
I saw her kneel and say a prayer for me  
When winters gone and spring is on  
I will meet her by the river  
We will meet by the river sainte marie

All day I've faced a barren waste  
Without the taste of water, cool water  
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry  
And souls that cry for water  
Cool, clear, water  
  
Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you  
  
The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
Each star's a pool of water  
Cool water  
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn  
And carry on to water  
Water, water, water  
  
Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan  
He's a devil, not a man  
He spreads the burning sand with water  
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree  
Where the water's runnin' free  
And it's waitin' there for me and you  
  
Cool, clear, water  
Cool, clear, water

Don't cry  
Don't cry  
Come on back in the house  
And don't cry  
  
Come on back in the house  
And get out  
From under that old  
Cold sky  
  
Don't weep  
Don't weep  
Come on back in the house  
Little sheep  
  
Come on back in the house  
For a smile of welcome and go  
To sleep  
  
Yes I know  
How you feel  
It's the wild runaway feeling  
You're hurt  
When you had the wrong dream  
And you wake with a start  
  
Well, don't cry  
Don't cry  
Come on back in the house  
And don't cry  
  
Come on back in the house  
And get out  
From under that old  
Cold sky  
  
And don't cry...  
And don't cry

Oh, give me land, lots of land, under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through that wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me be by myself in the evenin? breeze  
An' listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don?t fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
And I can't look at harbours and I can't stand fences  
Don?t fence me in  
  
(Oh, give me land, lots of land, under starry skies above,)  
(Don?t fence me in.)  
(Let me ride through that wide open country that I love:)  
(Don?t fence me in.)  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
An' listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don?t fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
An' gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
An' I can't look at harbours and I can?t stand fences  
So don?t fence me in, oh no  
Now brother, don?t you fence me in

Them thats got shall get  
Them thats not shall lose  
So the Bible said and it still is news  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Yes, the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets dont ever make the grade  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Money, youve got lots of friends  
Crowding round the door  
When youre gone, spending ends  
They dont come no more  
Rich relations give  
Crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But dont take too much  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child thats got his own  
Thats got his own  
He just worry bout nothin  
Cause hes got his own

I came to town  
To search for gold  
And I brought with me  
A memory  
And I seemed to hear  
The night wind cry  
Go hang your dreams on the hanging tree  
Your dreams of love that could never be  
Hang your faded dreams on the hanging tree  
  
I searched for gold (at the hanging tree)  
And I found my gold (at the hanging tree)  
And I found a girl (and I found a girl)  
Who loved just me (and she loved just me)  
And I wished that I could love her too  
But I'd left my heart on the hanging tree  
I'd left my heart with a memory  
And a faded dream on the hanging tree  
  
Now there were men  
Who craved my gold  
And they meant to take my gold from me  
When a man is gone  
He needs no gold  
So they carried me to the hanging tree  
To join my dreams and a memory  
Yes they carried me to-o the hanging tree  
  
To really live you must almost die  
And it happened just that way with me  
They took the gold and they set me free  
And I walked away from the hanging tree  
I walked away from the hanging tree  
  
And my own true love  
Oh yes, she walked with me  
That's when I knew that the hanging tree  
Was a tree of life, new life for me  
A tree of hope, new hope for me  
A tree of love, new love for me  
  
The hanging tree  
The hanging tree  
The hanging tree

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'  
On this, our weddin' day  
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'  
Wait, wait along  
  
I do not know what fate awaits me  
I only know I must be brave  
And I must face a man who hates me  
Or lie a coward, a craven coward  
Or lie a coward in my grave  
  
Oh, to be torn 'tweenst love and duty  
Supposin' I lose my fair-haired beauty  
Look at that big hand move along  
Nearin' high noon  
  
He made a vow while in state prison  
Vowed it would be my life or his, and  
I'm not afraid of death, but, oh  
What will I do if you leave me?  
  
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'  
You made that promise as a bride  
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'  
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'  
Now that I need you by my side  
  
Wait along (wait along), wait along  
Wait along, wait along  
(Wait along, wait along, wait along, wait along)

(humming, humming, humming, humming)  
  
Humming bird, humming bird should be your name,  
(humming bird should be your name)  
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame,  
(too restless, too wild to tame)  
Too restless to settle, too wild to tame,  
Humming bird, humming bird should be your name.  
  
(humming, humming, humming, humming)

No tender young blossom can hold you for long

No tender young blossom can hold you for long  
Humming bird, humming bird winging along  
  
I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be blue  
Yes I'd rather spend my whole life without you  
Than feather a nest to be shattered apart  
By the hum, hum of your humming bird heart.  
  
Humming bird, humming bird feathered so fine,  
(humming bird feathered so fine)  
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine  
(no, no it would not make you mine)  
If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine  
Humming bird, humming bird feathered so fine,  
  
(humming, humming, humming)  
  
Humming bird, humming bird fly right on by  
Some folks like to gamble but, darling, not I  
Some folks like to gamble but, darling, not I  
Humming bird, humming bird fly right on by  
  
I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be blue  
Yes I'd rather spend my whole life without you  
Than feather a nest to be shattered apart  
By the hum, hum of your humming bird heart.

I believe for every drop of rain that falls  
A flower grows  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night  
A candle glows  
I believe for everyone that goes astray  
Someone will come to show the way  
I believe  
I believe  
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer  
Will still be heard  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere  
Hears every word  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf  
Or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry  
Or touch a leaf  
Or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
(Why I believe)

Jealousy, night and day you torture me.  
I sometimes wonder if this spell that I'm under,  
Can only be a melody for I know no one but me,  
Has won your heart but when the music starts:  
My peace departs,  
From the moment they play that lovely strain  
And we surrender to all it's charm again.  
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain.  
We dance to a tango of love.  
Your heart beats with mine as we sway.  
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of:  
That soft word your cruel lips will never say.  
Well, I fear that the music will end,  
And shatter the spell it may lend.  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive,  
It's only a tango you love.  
I fear that the music will end,  
And shatter the spell it may lend.  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive,  
It's only a tango you love.  
It's only a tango that you love.

Jezebel, Jezebel  
  
If ever the devil was born without a pair of horns  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you  
If ever an angel fell, Jezebel, it was you  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise  
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you  
  
Could be better that I never know a lover such as you  
Forsaking dreams and all for the siren call of your arms  
  
Like a demon, love possessed me, you obsessed me constantly  
What evil star is mine, that my fate's design should be Jezebel?  
  
If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise  
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you, night and day, every way  
Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel!

Laura, hold these hands and count my fingers  
Laura, touch these lips you once desired  
Lay your head upon my chest, hear my heartbeat  
Gently run your fingers through my hair  
  
Mmm, touch these ears that listened to your wishes  
Most of them fulfilled, and that's a lot  
Let your soft gentle hands caress my body  
And then tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Oh, yes tell me what he's got that I can't give you  
Well, it must be something I was born without  
You took an awful chance to be with another man  
So tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Laura, see these walls that I built for you  
Laura, see this carpet that I laid  
See those fancy curtains on the windows  
Touch those satin pillows on your bed  
  
Laura, count the dresses in your closet  
Note the name upon the checkbook in your bag  
And if there's time before I pull this trigger  
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Oh, yes tell me what he's got that I can't give you  
Well, it must be something I was born without  
And if there's time before I pull this trigger  
Then tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Laura, tell me what he's got that I ain't got  
  
Fade  
Laura, tell me what he's got

Your love and mine, dear, It will shine, dear  
Just like that golden ring on your finger  
Love isn't just for tonight  
Or two arms that hold me so tight  
Love is a song that two must learn to sing  
Love is a golden ring  
Love's not a summer romance  
Or the kiss that follows the dance  
Love is forever a rare and lasting thing  
Love is a golden ring  
A wedding in the church  
The happiness and tears  
The little ring you'll wear  
Will last through all the years  
And in our golden days  
We'll find eternal spring  
With love and the golden ring  
So please won't you wear it for me  
With faith and sweet charity  
For lonely lovers lost  
This message we will bring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love

It was Montmartre  
It was midnight Come to think of it  
It was spring  
There was music I was listening  
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing  
This serenade made for remembering  
  
A small cafe, Mam'selle  
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle  
The violins were warm and sweet  
And so were you, Mam'selle  
And as the night danced by  
A kiss became a sigh  
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle  
Just like wine does  
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you  
And yet I know too well  
Some day you'll say goodbye  
Then violins will cry  
And so will I, Mam'selle  
  
A small cafe, Mam'selle

You can gamble for match sticks, you can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost, you haven't gambled at all  
  
They call me a moonlight gambler  
I've gambled for love and lost  
When I gamble for love and it isn't in the cards  
Oh, what heartaches it can cost me  
  
Win or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler  
And a winner is what I long to be  
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
You can gamble for match sticks  
You can gamble for gold  
The stakes may be heavy or small  
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost  
Then you haven't gambled at all  
  
No, if you haven't gambled for love in the moonlight  
Then you haven't gambled at all  
  
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live  
Till the day Lady Luck smiles at me  
  
They call me the moonlight gambler  
They call me the moonlight gambler

My little one as the years go by  
There may be times when your heart will cry  
And if your in need of a word of cheer  
You can always turn to me  
  
My little one though I love you so  
There'll come a day I must let you go  
But you'll have my love for eternity  
Little one you are everything to me  
  
My darling I love you so much  
So much there's nothing in the world nothing that I wouldn't do for you  
And it gives me such a wonderful feeling to know your mine  
Fills me with more happiness than I've ever known before  
And each night as you slip off to dream land  
I thank heaven for giving me you  
spoken verse ends  
  
My little one though I love you so  
There'll come a day I must let you go  
But you'll have my love for eternity  
Little one you are everything to me

Walked with no one and talked with no one  
And I had nothing but shadows  
Then one morning you passed  
And I brightened at last  
Now I greet the day and complete the day  
With the sun in my heart  
All my worry blew away  
When you taught me how to say  
  
Grab your coat and get you rhat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
  
Can't you hear a pitter pat?  
And that happy tune is your steop.  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street.  
  
I jused to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This Rover crossed over.  
  
If I never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street.  
Grab your street.

Keep movin', movin', movin',  
Though they're disapprovin',  
Keep them dogies movin', rawhide.  
Don't try to understand 'em,  
Just rope 'em, throw, and brand 'em.  
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.  
My heart's calculatin',  
My true love will be waitin',  
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,  
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!  
Head 'em out, ride 'em in,  
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,  
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!  
  
The ending lyrics are:  
  
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin',  
Though the streams are swollen,  
Keep them dogies rollin', rawhide.  
Through rain and wind and weather,  
Hell bent for leather,  
Wishin' my gal was by my side.  
All the things I'm missin',  
Good vittles, love and kissin',  
Are waiting at the end of my ride.  
  
Move 'em on, head 'em up,  
Head 'em up, move 'em on,  
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide!  
Head 'em out, ride 'em in,  
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,  
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!  
Rawhide!

Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart  
What is your future?, now we have to part  
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away  
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay  
  
Make way, oh, make way for my Eastern Rose  
Men crowd in dozens everywhere she goes  
In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret  
"Please make way for Rose" you can hear them say  
  
All my life I shall remember  
Oriental music and you in my arms  
Perfumed flowers in your tresses  
Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms  
  
Rose, Rose I love you with your almond eyes  
Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies  
I must cross the seas again and never see you more  
Way back to my home on a distant shore  
  
(All my life I shall remember)  
(Oriental music and you in my arms)  
(Perfumed flowers in your tresses)  
(Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms)  
  
Rose, Rose I leave you, my ship is in the bay  
Kiss me farewell now, there's nothing to say  
East is East and West is West, our worlds are far apart  
I must leave you now but I leave my heart  
  
Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart  
What is your future?, now we have to part  
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away  
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay  
  
(Rose, Rose I love you, I cannot stay)

Singing the blues.  
Well I never felt more like singing the blues  
'cause I never thought that id ever lose  
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way  
  
Well I never felt more like crying all night  
'cause everythings wrong and nothing ain't right  
Without you, you got me singing the blues  
  
The moon and stars no longer shine  
The dream is gone I thought was mine  
There's nothing left for me to do  
But cry-why-why-why over you  
  
Well I never felt more like running away  
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you  
You got me sing the blues

There's nothing left for me to do  
But cry-why-why-why over you  
  
Well I never felt more like running away  
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you  
You got me sing the blues

Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bone  
With a mind that's weak and a back that's strong.  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper and debt  
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store.  
  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
Loaded sixteen tons of No. 9 coal  
And the store boss said well bless my soul.  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper and debt  
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store.  
  
I was born one mornin' it was drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
Raisin' the cane, break by an old mountain lion  
Ain't no hightoned woman makes me walk the line.  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper and debt  
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store.  
  
If you see me comin' better step aside  
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died  
One fist of iron the other of steel  
If the right one don't get you then the left one will.  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper and debt  
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store

Strange lady in town,strange lady in town  
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for  
If I were king I'd trade the crown  
For that strange strange lady in town  
  
Oh heart of mine your in danger  
There's a strange lady in town  
Who is this heart stealin' stranger  
Who is turnin' the town upside down  
  
Her hair is red as the setting sun  
Her lips are ripe as the corn  
The lights that rise in her sea green eyes  
Make a man can be glad he was born  
  
Strange lady in town,strange lady in town  
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for  
If I were king I'd trade the the crown  
For that strange strange lady in town  
  
Ain't got no ring for her finger  
And I can't buy her a gown  
But rain or shine  
I'll still make her mine  
That strange strange lady in town  
  
Strange lady in town,strange lady in town  
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for  
If I were king I'd trade the crown  
For that strange strange lady in town

Strange lady in town

Up in the mornin'  
Out on the job  
Work like the devil for my pay  
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids  
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray  
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise  
  
Show me that river, take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise  
  
Show me that river, take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day

To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,  
And reminisce with you that's my desire.  
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,  
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.  
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.  
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.  
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,  
  
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.

THE KID'S LAST FIGHT  
WRITER BOB MERRILL  
It was Tiger Wilson versus Kid McCoy In the summer of 'ninety-three Now the
Kid was everybody's pride and joy Just as game as a kid could be And his
darlin' Bess was in the second row She was prayin' with all her might Sayin,
"Kid, we need that little bungalow Oh, you've just gotta win tonight" Come on,
Kid, come on, Kid Let's hit him with a left and a right Go on, Kid, go on, Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight (But how were they to
know it was the Kid's last fight) Now the Kid had fever to the very bone But
nobody would ever guess He was in there fightin' on his heart alone Cause he
just had to win for Bess Oh, the Kid was battered, the Kid was floored But the
count never got to ten Though his brain was reelin' when the people roared He
was up on his feet again Come on, Kid, come on, Kid Let's hit him with a left
and a right Go on, Kid, go on, Kid But how were they to know it was the Kid's
last fight (But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight) Said the
Tiger, scowlin', don't you know you're through I can whip you just like a
child I'm gonna take the fight and take your woman too When he heard that the
Kid went wild Said the Kid, "For that I'll tear you limb from limb" And he
sprang like an angry colt He said a punch a-flyin at the Tiger's chin Knocked
him out like a thunderbolt Come on, Kid, come on, Kid Let's hit him with a
left and a right Go on, Kid, go on, Kid But how were they to know it was the
Kid's last fight (But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight) To
the crowd that saw it there was little doubt That the Kid was a champ that
night But the champ would never have another bout 'Twas the fever that won the
fight Gather round, I'm bettin' even money folks There's a bell soundin' way
up high And the champ is climbin' through the golden ropes Of the Big Ring up
in the sky Come on, Kid, come on, Kid Let's hit him with a left and a right Go
on, Kid, go on, Kid But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight  
  

There must be a reason for raindrops to fall.  
There must be a reason why mountains are tall.  
And why are the stars in the sky?  
There must be a reason why.  
There must be a reason for rivers to flow.  
For beautiful trees and flowers to grow.  
And why have the birds wings to fly?  
There must be a reason why.  
The changes from season to season,  
The dawning that brings the new day.  
These wonders mist all have a reason,  
It was intended that way.  
There must be a reason for falling in love,  
It must have been planned up in Heaven above.  
And why are we so much in love, you and I?  
There must be a reason why.

A rose must remain with the sun and the rain  
Or it's lovely promise won't come true.  
To each his own, to each his own,  
And my own is you  
  
What good is a song if the words just don't belong?  
And a dream must be a dream for two.  
No good alone, to each his own,  
For me there's you.  
  
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow,  
To open each door there's a key.  
And I need you, I know, I can't let you go,  
Your touch means too much to me.  
  
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed  
Or they'll never know what love can do.  
To each his own, I've found my own,  
One and only you.
