Won't you please let me go  
These words lie inside they hurt me so  
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what I want to do  
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you  
Just what you, want me to  
  
I saw you this morning, I thought that you might like to know  
I received your message in full a few days ago  
I understood every word that it said  
And now that I've actually heard it, you're going to regret  
  
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what you want me to  
You're not the kind that needs to tell me  
About the birds and the bees  
  
Do you find this happens all the time  
Crucial point one day becomes a crime  
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you  
Just what I want to do  
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you  
  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you  
  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you  
  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you, I've lost you  
I've lost you

This is a song about an innocent  
Who died at the hands of a desperate man  
He trusted those who he thought he knew  
He trusted those who he looked up to  
I'll never forget the joy in his face  
He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place  
He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild  
I used to scream and shout all day long  
  
Now I hope you know this song  
Is about a child who now has gone  
And other children like him, too  
Abused and used by what adults do  
So don't tell me about politics  
Or all the problems of our economics  
When you can't look after what you can't own  
You scream and shout all day long

It doesn't take a genius  
To tell me what I am  
Or lecture me with poetry  
And tell me that I can  
I don't remember  
What happened yesterday  
But I don't give a damn about  
What all those people say  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
  
It don't take no Houdini  
To tell me what I am  
Parasites and literates  
They'd burn me if they can  
But I don't give a damn about  
What those people say  
They pick you up and kick you out  
They hurt you every day  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone  
It takes years to find the nerve  
To be apart from what you've done  
To find the truth inside yourself  
And not depend on anyone

What shall I say  
I fear you will betray me  
How many ways  
Can you prolong this tragedy  
Who told you that I would be back  
You came here to seize my freedom  
I will send you falling slowly  
To the earth I see below me  
  
You never knew  
With open arms I came to you  
Judging me so safe to be with  
Mistakes you made that you can't live with  
What you get is what you need  
When you watch the blood but you don't bleed  
You make me feel like a masked delusion  
A man whose life's became illusion

I've kept my head against the wall  
I've been this way for so long now  
You weren't exactly falling over yourself  
When last I saw you  
Well I always thought  
We'd get along like a house on fire  
Until you told me that I'd have to go  
How can someone like you work that slow  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
I don't feel anything no more  
This state of grace is consuming me  
I'm not grown up and I am not a boy  
I feel no pain and I feel no joy  
Well I always thought  
We'd get along like a house on fire  
In those days when the sun was warm  
I ran in the street where I was born  
  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
Whatever you think of me  
You listen hard and I will make you see  
  
The streets are so empty at this time of night  
I'd rather walk on my own than fight  
In a world where I'd forgotten you  
I found myself forgotten, too  
That's the danger of believing books  
And all the lies of those thieves and crooks  
We sing intellectual songs of love  
From a stolen pen to a velvet glove.

Walk in silence,  
Don't walk away, in silence.  
See the danger,  
Always danger,  
Endless talking,  
Life rebuilding,  
Don't walk away.  
Walk in silence,  
Don't turn away, in silence.  
Your confusion,  
My illusion,  
Worn like a mask of self-hate,  
Confronts and then dies.  
Don't walk away.  
People like you find it easy,  
Naked to see,  
Walking on air.  
Hunting by the rivers,  
Through the streets,  
Every corner abandoned too soon,  
Set down with due care.  
Don't walk away in silence,  
Don't walk away.

There is a secret place  
Underneath a tree  
Where if you go and haste  
You will find a key  
The key will open doors  
And you will look inside  
The things that you will see  
Will open up your eyes  
  
At any given time  
On every other street  
The city comes to life  
Though everyone's asleep  
A man beats up his wife  
He doesn't want to keep  
Behind closed doors  
They're in retreat  
  
I don't know what makes me stay  
The city life just ain't the same  
There's something wrong with kids today  
I blame the parents anyway  
There's no hope  
No one to trust  
I can't cope  
It's obvious  
Please don't take my drugs away  
I'm gonna give them up someday  
  
There is a place somewhere  
That I could call a home  
I'd live without a care  
I'd never be alone  
One day I will get there  
I feel it in my bones  
I check upon the scores  
I listen to The Coors  
Behind closed doors  
  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors  
They still want more  
Behind closed doors

Every time I think of you  
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue  
It's no problem of mine  
But it's a problem I find  
Living a life that I can't leave behind  
But there's no sense in telling me  
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free  
But that's the way that it goes  
And it's what nobody knows  
Well every day my confusion grows  
  
Every time I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I can't say  
  
I feel fine and I feel good  
I'm feeling like I never should  
Whenever I get this way  
I just don't know what to say  
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday  
I'm not sure what this could mean  
I don't think you're what you seem  
I do admit to myself  
That if I hurt someone else  
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be  
  
Every time I see you falling  
I get down on my knees and pray  
I'm waiting for that final moment  
You say the words that I can't say

How does it feel to treat me like you do?  
When you've laid your hands upon me and told me who you are.  
I thought I was mistaken, I thought I heard your words.  
Tell me how do I feel. Tell me now, how do I feel.  
Those who came before me lived through their vocations  
from the past until completion, they'll turn away no more.  
And still I find it so hard to say what I need to say.  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today.  
I see a ship in the harbor. I can and shall obey.  
But if it wasn't for your misfortune, I'd be a heavenly person today.  
And I thought I was mistaken, and I thought I heard you speak  
Tell me, how do I feel. Tell me now, how should I feel.  
Now I stand here waiting...  
I thought I told you to leave me when I walked down to the beach.  
Tell me how does it feel, when your heart grows cold, grows cold, cold.

[Verse:]  
My cold heart needs some company  
Shine a light in there, maybe I can see  
Wild hostiles on an open frame  
Sun shining when it could be rain.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.  
We can stop at a grocery store,  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.  
  
[Verse:]  
My hand, it shakes, my pulse is high.  
And my complications I can't describe.  
Cause your cold heart will break one day  
So don't you throw this chance away.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Give me all that I ask, some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me, I want everything that I see.  
We can stop at a grocery store,  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more.  
  
Sun shining when it could be rain.

This is why events unnerve me,  
They find it all, a different story,  
Notice whom for wheels are turning,  
Turn again and turn towards this time,  
All she ask's the strength to hold me,  
Then again the same old story,  
World will travel, oh so quickly,  
Travel first and lean towards this time.  
  
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,  
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,  
Watching her, these things she said,  
The times she cried,  
Too frail to wake this time.  
  
Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown  
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,  
Avenues all lined with trees,  
Picture me and then you start watching,  
Watching forever, forever,  
Watching love grow, forever,  
Letting me know, forever.

Any kind of fool with the will to live  
Tries to get it right with the one they're with  
But even though I give you special treatment  
You keep getting high juvenile delinquent  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
Constantly harassed and misunderstood  
I'm the 'lost and found' of the neighbourhood  
And I am not a part of society  
So don't get off the ground just be with me  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
I would brave the rainstorm in my car  
Maybe you can leave but you won't get far  
It wasn't just a dream it was much too good  
Just another day in the brotherhood  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
And all the men are falling down  
  
And this is how it feels to be  
On the payroll company  
Your every scene is in the round  
We don't need to hang around

One day it's now or never  
To stay at home  
Sometimes the dreams are better  
One thing you hold  
Believe that all these changes  
Keep me alone  
What brought the last reaction  
I'll never know  
I'll never know  
I'll never know  
  
Believe me, all I said to you  
Believe me, all I did for you  
All I did for you  
All the times it takes to complain  
But live in doubt  
Sometimes they keep you waiting  
For a look around  
I've got a friend in here somewhere  
Who can help me out  
Believe me, all I said to you  
Believe me, all I did for you  
All I did for you

  
I want to scream, I want to shout  
I want to know what it's all about  
I've seen it before, but not like this  
I saw your name, it was on the list  
  
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)  
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)  
Lying on the floor (It's gonna change)  
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)  
I remember you (It's gonna change)  
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)  
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)  
The things you did  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
No cold heart could turn away  
And not be moved by what I saw today:  
There on the floor, thirty years or more  
He doesn't care, he just wants to score  
  
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)  
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)  
Lying on the floor (It's gonna change)  
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)  
I remember you (It's gonna change)  
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)  
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)  
The things you did  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
Yet it only seems just like yesterday  
We used to run and hide  
Remember in the park where we used to play  
The grass looked ten foot high  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  
  
You've got to pull yourself together man  
You've got to get back on your feet again  
How can I ever make you understand ?  
You've got the world right in your hand  

We're like crystal  
(Hey)  
We break easy  
(Hoo)  
I'm a poor man  
(Hey)  
If you leave me  
(Hoo)  
I'm applauded  
(Hey)  
Then forgotten  
It was summer  
(Hey)  
Now it's autumn  
(Hoo)  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
(Hoo, hey)  
We're like crystal  
(Hey)  
It's not easy  
(Hoo)  
With your love  
(Hey)  
You could feed me  
(Hoo)  
Every man  
(Hey)  
And every woman  
(Hoo)  
Needs someone  
(Hey)  
So keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You're not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
I don't know what to say  
You don't care anyway  
I'm a man in a rage  
With a girl I betrayed  
Here comes love  
It's like honey  
You can't buy it with money  
You're not alone anymore  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
You shook me to the core  
  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming  
Keep it coming

Here I am in a house full of doors but no exits  
In a light that is grey like the stain on my windows  
All of this is a gift, such a painful companion  
Inside of me  
  
It's just something I know, the answer's not there  
It comes and it goes and it frightens me  
It's just something I know, the answer's not there  
It comes and it goes and it frightens me  
  
This feeling inside me can't confront the decay  
To fall down on my knees and resume this charade  
Believe me, this distance, it's not what I need  
Inside of me  
  
It's another story, some of it is blurred  
I tried to understand him, I tried so hard  
Time worked so well upon us inside of me  
Inside my soul, Inside my soul  
  
Time worked so well upon us  
Inside of me, inside my soul  
Inside of me, inside my soul

Those steps which seem to take a lifetime  
When eyes just turn and stare  
The day begins, collapsing without warning  
You fade from sight, there's nothing there  
  
No hope allowed, calls are answered daily  
Questions are on your side  
Deeply moved, beyond all consolation  
You felt the pulse, now hear the cry  
  
In my mind, thoughts are becoming clearer  
I'm watching every move you make  
Counting time spent in observation  
A single blow a false mistake  
  
Then you revealed to me  
All that I need to know now  
(The close went down to times  
too, too much behind us)  
Then please don't turn away,  
Why can't I talk to you now?  
(The number of forgotten years  
Where my honor isn't deepest  
Grows the deepest feeling and it  
Grieved for safety and despair)  
There's nowhere left to go  
Where is this taking her and how?  
(The torish threats forevermore  
Over our natural favor  
And us and he's and I'll fall  
Far in it, and it sees enough  
In our failures and it's not time.)  
There's nothing more I want  
To know beyond your trust now  
(I missed his promised time again  
For my friend)  
Don't throw our joy away  
Why must you just you leave now?  
(Has God forgotten to approach us?  
Has He rememberd to not despise us?)  
Memories are all that's left  
I need you near to me now  
(There, now, now, don't come to mind my deeds  
And call out in defiance of times gone by)

What's the matter here?  
Something ain't right  
Tell me it's not true  
Tell me it's all right  
  
There was time I'd run around for you  
Get down on my knees  
I swear it's true  
But you came in the night,  
And you took my heart  
To Dracula's Castle  
In the Dark  
  
Now I've gotta tell you  
Now you've gotta know  
I want you to stay  
But you're gonna go  
  
Don't leave me alone  
You'll tear me apart  
You're in control  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
You can't keep on running  
How far'd you think you'll get  
You got the world if you want it  
I ain't done with you yet  
  
I work hard just to keep you by my side  
Every day and almost every night  
In the end you took away my heart  
Left me alone  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel  
  
So goodbye love  
You were not real  
You came to stay  
But now you leave  
  
I can't explain  
The way you feel  
We once stood high  
But now we kneel

Nothing in this world  
Can touch the music that I heard  
When I woke up this morning  
It put the sun into my life  
It cut my heartbeat with a knife  
It was like no other morning  
  
I don't belong to no one  
But I want to be with you  
I can't be owned by no one  
What am I supposed to do  
  
I can't see the sense in your leaving  
All I need is your love to believe in  
  
Don't look into the sun  
It's not for me or anyone  
To steal the light out of the sky  
Is it really such a sin  
Cause if it is then I'll give in  
I can't live without your love  
  
I don't belong to no one  
But I want to be with you  
I can't be owned by no one  
What am I supposed to do  
  
I can't see the sense in your leaving  
All I need is your love to believe in  
And for you I would do what I can  
But I can't change the way that I am

My promise could be your theme  
A given end to your dreams  
A simple movement or rhyme  
Could be the smallest of signs  
We'll never know what they are or care  
An empty statement or view  
There's no escape so few in fear  
Give in a changing value  
  
To be given your sight  
Hid in a long peaceful night  
A nervous bride for your eyes  
A fractured smile that soon dies  
A love that's wrong from your life and soul  
A savage mine had begun  
Hello, farewell to your love and soul  
Hello, farewell to your soul  
  
Now I know what those hands would do  
No looking back now, we're pushing through  
We'll change these feelings, we'll taste and see  
But never guess how the him would scream  
But never guess how the him would scream  
But never guess how the him would scream

Every second counts  
When I am with you  
I think you are a pig  
You should be in a zoo  
I guess I should've known  
I'd end up on my own  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second counts  
  
Every little counts  
When I am with you  
You make me feel so good  
I never felt so new  
I saw you long ago  
Though you never let it show  
Every little counts when I am with you  
  
Every little counts when I am with you  
  
Every second counts  
When I am with you  
Even though you're stupid  
I still follow you  
The smile upon your face,  
It always stays in place  
Every second counts when I am with you  
  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second...

At the end of the day there's no food on our plate  
So we beg and we steal for we know love is real  
And if we don't take a chance in a spare sideways glance  
These are all the chains I wanted to justify the things I do  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
And in a single breath this world is gone  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
It's a crisis I know at the end of the show  
People change but we don't falter 'cause we know love is real  
This is no place to shiver so get up off the grass  
You were once the main attraction but all that's in the past  
How much is free for me and you?  
I'm on my knees, I am a fool  
But when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
This world is gone  
How could I fail to give her when she cried such a lot?  
People change but we don't falter 'cause we use what we've got  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
And when we kiss we speak as one  
With a single breath this world is gone  
This world is gone  
This world is gone  
This world is gone  

Help me, somebody help me  
I wonder where I am  
I see my future before me  
I'll hurt you when I can  
It seems like I've been here before  
  
Confusion sprung up from devotion  
A halo that covers my eyes  
It sprung from this first estrangement  
No one have I ever despised  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Won't you show me, please show me the way  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Won't you show me, please show me the way

You're much too young  
To be a part of me  
Too young  
To get a hold on me  
  
You're much too young  
You're much too young  
You're much too young  
To mess around with me  
  
Hey  
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks  
But I've never met a girl with all her own teeth  
That's why I love you babe  
That's why we could be  
But you're too young  
Too young  
  
The past doesn't matter [Repeat x12]  
  
Hey  
Sophisticated lady  
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks  
But you've got style  
You've got class  
But most of all  
You've got love technique.

Just another day in the week  
Waiting for an opportunity to step in front of me  
Maybe I'm losing my mind  
Searching for another place in another time  
Real love can't be bought  
It is wild and it can't be cought  
Real love can't be sold  
It's another color than gold  
(I need your love) I just want to buy it  
(I need your love) Will you help me find it

You sure know a lot for a girl  
You can bring the good times back get me on the track  
Real love can't be bought  
It is wild and it can't be cought  
Real love can't be sold  
It's another color than gold  
I need your love) I just want to buy it  
(I need your love) Will you help me find it  
(I want your love) How can you deny it

You and me just can't go wrong

Old friend, what you doin' out there?  
Come inside, sit yourself on that chair  
It's been a long time, since the last time  
Of many burdons have passed through our hands  
Not end today and day in to tonight  
  
Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry  
You're the star in the sea, your not just anybody  
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach  
Over head, in the sky, is it shining on me? is it shining on me?  
  
I've always knew, that you would not hang around  
You and me were like the thieves of the town  
Too many girlfriends, but not enough love  
Too many late nights, and not enough sleep  
Strung out and wasted, no good in shape for  
The life we tasted, there on the table  
  
Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry  
You're the star in the sea, your not just anybody  
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach  
Over head, in the sky, is it shining on me? is it shining on me?  
  
Open our heart, and deeds in our head, but most of the time, we stay in a
place  
If you go out there, your just up north,  
It's a calm cool world, I slapped that door.

Who is this man  
That follows me  
This blue eyed boy  
Who wants to be  
  
This worthy cause  
Of human kind  
This pawn set up by time  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane  
But then he'll remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying  
  
This open book  
Yet to be read  
This second look  
This leap ahead  
  
The hope I held inside  
With you, was kept alive  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane  
But then he'll remove all of your pain  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, He'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, He'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying  
  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
We're here to stay  
  
Like a bright light on the horizon  
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying  
He'll get you flying, flying, flying

(One, two, three, four)  
I am for you can enjoy I can give you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
It's a time we love to hate, I can give you  
  
I am for you will enjoy I can give you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
This is the time you'd love to hate, I will take you  
  
I'm quite determined and there will be  
No more mistakes, no more talking  
I'll bet you hate this  
  
Oh, I am for you will enjoy, I can take you  
(Give me, give me, give me)  
This is the law and you...  
  
I'm quite determined and there will be  
No more mistakes like the last one

It's been ten long years since I've been home  
I've been waiting here with nowhere to go  
It's an occupation I don't like  
But it pays the rent and turns on the light (alright)  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and runaway with me  
We'll go out every night  
I'll be there by your side  
And we'll all get high down the old west side  
  
If it ain't the job and it ain't the place  
But I must stay for your pretty face  
It's a bad reaction I can't fix  
You conned me with those feline tricks  
  
And I told you so  
It's a crazy world  
For a mixed-up guy  
And a no-good girl  
  
And I told you so  
It's a crazy world  
For a mixed-up guy  
With a no-good girl  
  
(Take her, take the world)  
  
I told you so  
It has to be  
Cut loose and run away (run away) with me  
We'll go out every night  
I'll be there by your side  
And we'll all get high down the old west side  
  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
Down the old west side  
(Take the world, yeah)

Caressing the marble and stone  
Love that was special for one  
The waste and the fever and hate  
How I wish you were here with me now  
  
The body that kills and hides  
Matches an awful delight  
Warm like a dog 'round your feet  
How I wish you were here with me now  
  
The hangman looks 'round as he waits  
Gullet stretches tight and it breaks  
Someday we will die in your dreams  
How I wish we were here with you now

In fear every day, every evening,  
He calls her aloud from above,  
Carefully watched for a reason,  
Painstaking devotion and love,  
Surrendered to self preservation,  
From others who care for themselves.  
A blindness that touches perfection,  
But hurts just like anything else.  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
Mother I tried please believe me,  
I'm doing the best that I can.  
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,  
I'm ashamed of the person I am.  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
But if you could just see the beauty,  
These things I could never describe,  
These pleasures a wayward distraction,  
This is my one lucky prize  
Isolation, isolation, Isolation, isolation, isolation.

On a thousand islands in the sea  
I see a thousand people just like me  
A hundred unions in the snow  
I watch them walking, falling in a row  
We live always underground  
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight  
A thousand islands in the sea  
It's a shame  
  
And a hundred years ago  
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon  
Take me away everyone  
When it hurts thou  
  
From my head to my toes  
From the words in the book  
I see a vision that would bring me luck  
From my head to my toes  
To my teeth, through my nose  
You get these words wrong  
You get these words wrong  
Everytime  
You get these words wrong  
I just smile  
  
But from my head to my toes  
From my knees to my eyes  
Everytime I watch the sky  
For these last few days leave me alone  
But for these last few days leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone

You know it never meant much to me  
But there's something on your mind that I could see  
It didn't hurt me too much to find  
You were seeing someone else for all of this time  
You know that I don't care  
And I like you to know that I don't care  
I don't need your sympathy  
Why don't you ever look at me?  
  
[Chorus]  
You did nothing for me  
You did nothing I see  
You did nothing for me  
You did nothing  
  
There's no today and there's no tomorrow  
Where you find sadness, I find sorrow  
Nobody knows, but it always shows  
I think I'm losing my mind, but that's the way that it goes  
And it's fine, all those lies  
I can see their truth lies in your eyes  
So I guess we are through  
You did to me what I did to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
[La, la, la, etc. omitted]  
I don't need your sympathy  
'Cause you don't mean that much to me  
  
[Chorus:]

I haven't time to sympathise  
With all this nonsense and your lies  
You are the king of nothing  
But you shall hold me  
You've got your finger on the pulse  
And in my pocket, yes of course  
I am the voice of treason  
But you betrayed me  
  
I used up nearly all my luck  
I didn't have to try  
But yesterday is gone  
And now I need an alibi  
If this gets any stranger things are gonna change  
Cause I can't stand the music, always lying  
If that's what it takes I'll do it (I'll do it)  
I'll keep on right on through it (on through it)  
  
So please believe me when I say  
I wouldn't give the time of day  
Because then I'd be faking  
When I could tell the truth  
Were you abandoned in your youth  
Because if not, you will be soon  
I'm growing tired of waiting  
For you to say goodbye

There was a time I call before  
When all I knew was what I saw  
The keeper of a major key  
I lived in a town called Liberty  
  
I worked hard  
To give you all the things that you need  
And almost anything that you see  
I spent a lifetime working on you  
And you won't even talk to me  
  
Can't you see  
Why don't you look at me  
It's not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
I knew that I could never give  
You knew that you could not forgive  
No price or pride would fall before  
A ten foot wall without a door  
  
But you know  
I watch every step that you make  
To find some other fool you can take  
And I don't know why I even try  
Because it all comes down to this  
  
Can't you see  
Why don't you look at me  
It's not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
Can't you see  
Why don't you look at me  
It's not your right to be  
So much my enemy  
  
I worked hard  
To give you all the things that you need  
And almost anything that you see  
I spent a lifetime working on you  
And you won't even talk to me

Oh I've just come  
From the land of the sun  
From a war that must be won  
In the name of truth  
With our soldiers so brave  
your freedom we will save  
With our rifles and grenades  
And some help from God  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
I've got to go home  
I've been so alone, you see  
  
You just can't believe  
The joy I did receive  
When I finally got my leave  
And I was going home  
Oh I flew through the sky  
my convictions could not lie  
For my country I would die  
And I will see it soon  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
I've got to go home  
I've been so alone, you see  
  
When I walked through the door  
My wife she lay upon the floor  
And with tears her eyes were sore  
I did not know why  
Then I looked into her hand  
And I saw the telegram  
That said that I was a brave, brave man  
But that I was dead  
I want to see my family  
My wife and child waiting for me  
I've got to go home  
I've been so alone, you see

How can I ever forget you  
You don't know just what I've been through  
The holiday we spent together  
Lives with me now and forever.  
  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do.  
  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
  
Maybe you'd write me a letter  
And tell me why I never met you  
Our rendezvous just ended in sorrow  
Without you there's no tomorrow.  
  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do  
I tried but I can't find you  
Tell me now what do I do.  
  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
I used to think about you night and day  
I didn't care what other people would say  
  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
I can't find my piece of mind  
Because I need you with me all of the time  
  
I used to think about you night and day  
I used to feel what language cannot say  
Oh I can't find you  
No I can't find my piece of mind without you.  
  
Ibiza, Majorca, and Benidorm too  
I've searched all these places but never found you.

If we left this town, we could walk the earth together  
If you let me down, I will live in you forever  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
  
If we could find a home, we could go through time together  
If we could hold our own, devastate the night forever  
There's no place where we can't go  
There's no place where I have been  
There's no limit I can show  
There's no level inbetween  
Jolene, I could have seen you there,  
Jolene, I need you everywhere  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
Jolene, I could have seen you there  
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere  
There's no place where you can hide  
There's no place that I can't find  
There's no end to leave me clean  
There's no reason I have seen  
  
If you find me on my own, you could live your life forever  
Shall we leave our world alone, maybe we'll go back or never  
Jolene, I could've seen you there  
When I looked into your lifeless eyes, I saw you everywhere  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you  
I want you, I want you, I need you, I need you

  
It doesn't take a lot to confuse me  
I'm not aware of the passing of time  
And I'd like to say to those who accuse me  
Could you do it while you looked in my eye  
  
If you hold on primitive notion  
And if you think you'd like to try  
You can drink this magic potion  
And you can do it 'til the day that you the day that you die  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I'm doing my best to confound you  
Your behaviour is so volatile  
Not even a zoo would impound you  
Don't look at me with your criticle smile  
  
Well I've been driving in the wrong gear  
It's been a long and lonely ride  
It's been winter for a whole year  
But you couldn't hurt me if you tried  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to be like it was at the start  
  
I've done it before and I'll do it again  
Charged with a life that'll burn 'til the end  
How can it be that we're so far apart  
I want it to feel like it did at the start  
  
I've got a message that I need to send  
It's coming to you straight from a friend  
I wanted to see what's inside my heart  
I wanted to be like it was in the start

[Verse:]  
You've got a strange look in your eyes  
Nothing to get and no need to lie.  
And when the dust come howl at your door  
You're not afraid, it's just the role.  
  
It's not the way that I want to be  
But I can't explain just how I feel.  
Out of my heart and into my soul  
You were the start and you are the go.  
  
But it isn't funny the way that you talk about me  
You know I can't change the way that you want me to be.  
But I tried to do what I can, gone is the life we built in a sec.

  
I've been accused of everything  
From Timbuktu to old Berlin  
I need some armor for my flesh  
I need to stop and take a rest  
I've been wide-eyed but couldn't see  
I stand accused of being me  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline  
When I hear a baby cry  
When I see an old man die:  
That's just the way it is  
  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Yeah, that's the way it is  
  
I took each day the way it came  
I put my future out of frame  
The signs were there for all to see:  
Light through our line to you and me  
  
My hand laid on my beating breast  
I swear to you I'll pass this test  
I'll walk one hundred thousand miles  
Ignore the judges 'til my trial  
It might try  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is just a den of vice and sin  
But even on the darkest night  
We could reach for the light  
And we could get it right  
  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
We could get it right  
  
I believe in politics  
I believe in everything  
I believe this world of ours is giving me adrenaline  
Ten thousand years ago  
Crawling on the floor  
Well, get up, Jack  
It's time to rock the shack  
  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
Rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack, rock the shack  
It's time to get up  

Listen  
I may be wrong but you're missing  
There's something wrong you could say  
Ruined in a day  
You could be the lover of jade  
Forever on your own in the shade  
Let's do it anyway  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
While I do the best that I can  
Keeping my life in my hands  
  
And if you feel  
Your cradle rocking  
Then take the wheel  
Don't let me stop you  
(Hang around for awhile)  
But stop acting like a child  
Every step we take is the one  
That's gonna undo what you've done  
It could take all day  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
But I do the best that I can  
I keep my world in my hands  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
But I do the best that I can  
Keeping my world in my hands

Open hearts  
Empty spaces  
Dusty roads  
To distant places  
But all the time  
When I'm alone  
I think of you  
And how you've grown  
  
Far and wide  
Sweet and simple  
Jehovah knows  
That I've been sinful  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
I'm not cruel  
And you're not evil  
And we're not like  
All those stupid people  
Who can't decide  
Which book to read  
Unless the paper  
Sows the seed  
  
You're the kind of person  
That I've always wanted to be with  
Well you're really cool  
And you always say the right things to me  
But now I'll tell you something  
For my heart beats for you deep inside  
You'll never be a burden  
And my love for you will never die  
Never die, never die, never die, never die  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
But if Jesus comes to take your hand  
I won't let go, I won't let go  
  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
I swear it's getting warmer  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
Good times around the corner  
  
I'm gonna live 'til I die  
I'm gonna live to get high  

That's the way, Shellshock  
Hold on!It's never enough  
It's never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain  
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
You call me on the phone, you left me all alone  
All I get from you is shellshock  
Another day goes by and all I do is cry  
All I get from you is shellshock  
I'd tell the world and save my soul  
But rain falls down and I feel cold  
A cold that sleeps within my heart  
It tears the earth and sun apart  
But that's the way that I can win  
A victim of your evil sin  
You've lost the hold you've had on me  
By causing the changes that you never see  
Hold on! It's never enough  
It's never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain  
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
When we walk through open doorways,  
Counting time in one or more ways  
We can't find our peace of mind  
And life becomes a life of crime  
And that's the day I call your name  
I came to you, I called in vain  
You lost the faith within your heart  
The fire in your soul from the end to the start  
Hold on!It's never enough  
It's never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain  
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
I've been good and I've been bad  
But common sense I've never had  
No matter how I try and try,  
I hide the truth behind a lie  
But that's the way that I can win  
A victim of your evil sin  
You lost the faith within your heart  
The fire in your soul from the end to the start  
Hold on!It's never enough  
It's never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain  
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating

  
As I look at the morning sky  
Today the wind is blowing hard  
See that bird has flown too high  
Pretty soon it will be tired  
I spent a day all by myself  
A rich man without his wealth  
Sometimes I get it wrong  
But I'm not the only one  
  
The afternoon was very clear  
The sun was beating down on me  
I got thirsty for a beer  
That I had to go to sea  
The sea was very rough  
It made me feel sick  
But I like that kind of stuff  
It beats arithmetic  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
The early evening mist  
Looked beautiful to me  
Was sweeter than a kiss  
I wish you all could see  
I'm a long long way from home  
But this photograph of you  
Even though it's monochrome  
Tells me what I should do  
So I got up on my feet  
And I knew it would be alright  
For my clothes were looking beat  
In the middle of the night  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I don't want the world to change  
I like the way it is  
Just give me one more wish  
I can't get enough of this  
When it gets to be alive  
And not just still survive  
To hit and not to miss  
I can't get enough of this  
  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this  
I can't get enough of this

This can't be real  
My heart is burning  
How does it feel ?  
Well, let's say I'm learning  
It had to come  
The ship has landed  
It's time to run  
The crew are stranded  
  
We're having the time of our lives  
We're lost in a cruel paradise  
  
Someone like you could make me feel like I used to do  
Return my heart, yeah  
Make it real like it was at the start  
Someone like you, someone like you, yeah  
  
You're everything to me:  
The sweetest symphony  
All that I try to be  
You are my harmony  
I guess what I mean to say  
Is you keep the wolves at bay  
We're children on holiday  
Here comes the cloud  
  
We're having the time of our lives  
We're lost in a cruel paradise  
  
Someone like you could make me feel like I used to do  
Return my heart, yeah  
Make it real like it was at the start  
Someone like you, yeah, someone like you, yeah  

Hello, everyone, it's nice to be here  
I've come so far to see you all  
I can see your deep blue eyes  
They sleep beneath the open sky  
Before you stands one like your brother  
Swear to God he needs no other  
But how can I afford to be  
Here with you so carelessly  
You know what you did was so unkind  
You search for the life we need to find  
There's right and there's wrong  
And there's good and there's bad  
And there's an answer to this I wish I had  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
  
Well we had a party in our hotel last night  
It ended up in an awful fight  
My friend left me and my heart too  
I hope I don't end up like you  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
  
Your country is a wonderful place  
It pales my England into disgrace  
To buy a drink that is so much more reasonable  
I think I'll go there when it gets seasonable  
You know what you did was so unkind  
You search for the life you need to find  
There's right and there's wrong  
And there's good and there's bad  
And there's an answer to this I wish I had  
  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do  
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

It isn't what it used to be  
I wake up every night  
On the stairs  
Waiting for the dawn to come  
Every drop of wine  
You can be my time  
Only tomorrow knows  
Why do we beg when we can borrow  
This time we knew  
No more or less  
There's nothing left  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
  
It wasn't that I didn't try  
It's not the kind of thing, that you buy  
Written in my destiny  
Life is but a dream  
Covered by the sky  
Stop saying that you're calling time  
Look at your life before you start on mine  
I'm not the kind of person that you need  
I'm sick of trying  
I mean that it's over  
  
It was always special  
It was like water down the drain  
I'm intoxicated  
Every time I hear your name  
I try to remember  
But nothing is the same  
It was always special  
it was like water down the drain  
  
Patiently you wait for me  
You're so blind  
I thought it couldn't be  
Then changed my mind  
Drowning in the endless sea  
Line all those lines  
The traces of your memory  
Don't belong with mine

Once in a while I need a friend  
So why won't you let me recover  
It's just a moment in your life  
But sometimes we divide each other  
  
Maybe we could find a time  
Eliminate what's on your mind  
We'd do everything we could  
Our presence in the neighborhood  
  
We could break every rule  
Anytime we wanted to  
Don't be afraid to live this way  
Lets defend the things we say  
  
I want to be up in the air  
I could be anywhere  
Tell me I'm wrong, at least till tomorrow  
Set me free and I will follow  
  
Maybe we could find a time  
To elevate what's on your mind  
Recreate for me and you  
A master plan just for two  
  
We could break every rule  
Anytime we wanted to  
Don't be afraid to live this way  
Let's defend the things we say  
  
Elevate what's on your mind  
Eliminate what's on your mind

You can walk, or you can run  
You don't have to be someone  
I went on a summer cruise  
Upon an ocean born to lose  
My brother said that he was dead  
I saw his face and shook my head  
Can you see where we can't be  
We're losing our blood in the sea  
'Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
  
From my home I traveled far  
I drove in my stolen car  
When it broke down, I kissed the ground  
'Cause I don't kiss when you're around  
I don't find that I have been  
The portrait of an only son  
If that's the case, then who could tell  
Where my story had begun?  
Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, the state of the nation  
That's causing deprivation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
That's causing deprivation  
  
Even now, I'm all alone  
Behind a wall that's made of stone  
I think about where we have been  
And all the sights that could be seen  
I know it all could be worthwhile  
If only I could force a smile  
Now we turn our backs to the sea  
The shame of a nation we'll never be  
Cause it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Yes, it's the state of the nation  
That's holding our salvation  
Oh, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Yes, the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation

I like walking in the park  
When it gets late at night  
I move 'round in the dark  
And leave when it gets light  
I sit around by day  
Tied up in chains so tight  
These crazy words of mine  
So wrong they could be right  
What do I get out of this?  
I always try, I always miss  
One of these days you'll go back to your home  
You won't even notice that you are alone  
One of these days when you sit by yourself  
You'll realize you can't shaft without someone else  
In the end you will submit  
It's got to hurt a little bit  
  
I like talking in my sleep  
When people work so hard  
They need what they can't keep  
A choice that leaves them scarred  
A room without a view  
Unveils the truth so soon  
And when the sun goes down  
You've lost what you had  
What do I get out of this?  
I always try, I always miss  
One of these days you'll go back to your home  
You won't even notice that you are alone  
One of these days when you sit by yourself  
You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else  
In the end you will submit  
It's got to hurt a little bit

[Verse:]  
From my head to my toes  
I can hardly believe the things that I read are not  
That it's hard, fly it in your plane and drive it in your car  
You're a superstar, yes you are,  
Signing autographs, making people laugh  
You'll go far, clever boy,  
Girls just wanna be with you, lawyers wanna deal with you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
[Verse:]  
Write a book about your life,  
I can hardly believe the things that you need at home  
With your wife, you treat it like a game, but this made you pretty fame  
With perfect hair and your clothes,  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
[Bridge:]  
Take care over what you do,  
You gotta take care of what you are.  
You gotta take care of what you're not,  
You gotta take care of what you've got.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why don't you wake up  
And stop what you're doing right now?  
You gotta be true.  
You know you don't live forever  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
Wake up right now, stop what you're doing,  
You've gotta be true,  
You know you don't live forever,  
Hey, man, it's gotta be right.  
  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.  
It's just another day in a life of a superstar.  
It's gotta be the way, it's the same, no matter who you are.

I've been waiting to hear your voice for too long now  
One way conversations do not work somehow  
Tell me how does one get your soul in touch with the one above  
When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love  
I tried so hard last night you would not talk to me  
I live with the fear of the few with the gift  
And I know what's going to be  
  
Why did you never speak my name in front of my family  
You gave me a gift that you then took away  
Like you never did before  
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me  
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me  
We might be your black sheep  
But you forgot us a long time ago  
We might be your lost sheep  
But it's time you remembered us now  
  
As we spend our days together, nothing can go wrong  
No one told the truth about it because it was so strong  
If you ever think of me, if you hear my name  
If you read between the lines, you'll hang your head in shame  
These? ears will never hear, the ice will never freeze  
Whatever I have done for you I did because you complained  
  
(Whatever you may think of me whatever you may say  
I've lived my whole life in danger,  
You've lived your life in hate)

Some days you waste your life away  
These times I find no words to say  
A crime I once committed filled me  
Too much of heaven's eyes I saw through  
Only when meanings have no reason  
They're taken beyond your sense of right  
  
Small boy kneels, wandering in a great hall  
He pays pennance to the air above him  
White circles, black lines surround me  
Reborn, so plain my eyes see  
This is the reason that I came here  
To be so near to such a person  
  
I'm so tired, I'm so tired

I've watched your face for a long time  
It's always the same  
I've studied the cracks and the wrinkles  
You were always so vain  
Well, now you live your life like a shadow  
In the pouring rain  
Oh, it's called love  
Yes, it's called love  
Oh, it's called love  
And it belongs to us  
Oh, it dies so quickly  
It grows so slowly  
But when it dies, it dies for good  
It's called love  
And it belongs to everyone but us  
  
I've lived my life in the valleys  
I've lived my life on the hills  
I've lived my life on alcohol  
I've lived my life on pills  
But it's called love  
And it belongs to us  
It's called love  
And it's the only thing that's worth living for  
It's called love  
And it belongs to us  
It's called love  
Yes it's called love  
  
Oh, love is found in the east and west  
But when love is at home, it's the best  
Love is the cure for every evil  
Love is the air that supports the eagle  
It's called love  
And it's so un-cool  
It's called love  
And somehow it's become unmentionable  
It's called love  
And it belongs to every one of us  
It's called love  
And it cuts your life like a broken knife

We all feel the same  
All pleasure nothing to gain  
I've known you from the start  
I've grown used to your wooden heart  
Now you know my name  
You search your empty brain in vain  
If you don't change your ways  
You'll end up here with me unraised  
Without you they'll never know  
Without you my life won't flow  
Without you they'll never show  
Without you the night won't go  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you I lay in pain  
Without you I've gone insane  
  
Now you must decide  
What good's a lie when you've nothing to hide  
Maps they'll never show  
They're dumb like you, they never know  
It's time we said goodbye  
Bury your head and silence your cry  
Know the feel of pain  
Join our world and play our game  
  
Without you they'll never know  
Without you my life won't grow  
Without you they'll never show  
Without you the night won't go  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you my life's a waste  
Just for you I wrap my face  
Without you I'm left alone  
Without you I'm on my own  
Without you I live in pain  
Without you I've gone insane  
  
Whatever you may think of me  
Don't ever take my dignity (x4)  
Whatever you may do to me  
Don't crucify my dignity

In a manger like Christ I lay  
Yellow fever, yellow hay  
Feel the rhythm, sweetest sound  
Making, breaking sacred ground  
I'd give you a piece of my love for free  
But whatever I say you'll never see  
Acquire a taste for a different sound  
Make or break it this side of town  
  
Life will never be the same  
In Port-Royal town, I hear it coming  
The shaking of the ground  
They're stealing in the day  
In Port-Royal town, the children are running  
  
Ever strange the lives we lead  
So detached from the things we need  
Signs of greed in everyone  
Instant eviction and the blood on a gun  
Just when you think you've found it  
Spinning world I want to spin around it  
What is wrong? This pain won't peel  
The fibres of my life won't heal

I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face  
I couldn't look at you  
I guess you knew it but I never realized  
That we were through  
  
And now I'm down here all alone  
With every feeling that I own  
You can't take that away  
  
And with every breath we take  
And the illusions we create  
Will come to you someday  
  
And I was touched  
By the hand of God  
Never knew it  
But of course I was  
  
I never hoped to do the things in this world  
I wanted to  
Because everything I own  
It belongs to you  
  
I never looked at you in a sexual way  
In my life before  
And I've never woken up like this  
So desperately before  
  
And I was touched  
By the hand of God  
Never knew it  
But of course I was

Radio, live transmission  
Radio, live transmission  
  
Listen to the silence, let it ring on  
Eyes, dark gray lenses, frightened of the sun  
We would have a fine time living in the night  
Left to blind destruction, waiting for our sight  
  
And we would go on as though nothing was wrong  
And hide from these days, we remained all alone  
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time  
Touching from a distance, further all the time  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
  
Well, I could call out when the going gets tough  
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough  
No language, just sound, that's all we need know  
To synchronize love to the beat of the show  
  
And we could dance  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio

Oh, it's a strange day  
In such a lonely way  
I saw some children dance  
I watched my life in a trance  
And the people around me  
Seemed so glad to be here  
Will my time pass so slowly  
On the day that I fear?  
  
And the noise that surrounds me  
Pulls so loud in my head  
From the promise that healed us  
To the lies that I said  
Oh, it's a strange day  
In such a lonely way  
Some people look down on me,  
I know they like what they see  
  
Strange day,  
Such a strange day  
Such a strange day

It's a hard way to come home  
You've got me on my knees  
The walls are tumbling down  
They're falling like the leaves  
  
The days turned into months and years  
I can't forget that you were here  
I feel your presence everywhere  
In the corner over there  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know  
  
It's a wild world out there  
And nobody gives a damn  
In cold blood we don't care  
And we don't want to understand  
  
I'm sitting here alone at night  
My sleepless eyes are open wide  
What do you want me to say  
What we had has gone away  
  
The sky is high the road is long  
Show me what I should have done  
What do you want me to do  
Take it all away from you  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know

  
Take my hand  
And don't let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
Don't take me down  
Cause I'm not done  
Don't steal my crown  
Before it's won  
The wide expanse  
The wheel of chance  
Will turn my way  
The sky will not be gray  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
Take my hand  
And don't let go  
Trust this man  
And let it flow  
  
I drank in every bar in town  
I filled my cup when I was down  
I saw the things I wanted to see  
Became the man I wanted to be  
But then somehow I lost my way  
I've got to get back there today  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
Don't want to have to work like other people do  
I want it to be free, I want it to be true  
  
I don't want to be like other people are  
Don't want to own a key, don't want to wash my car  
I lie awake at night, or wait until it's light  
I want it to be free, I thought that I was right  
  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right  
Tought that I was right

Grow up children, don't you suffer  
At the hands of one another  
If you like a sleeping demon  
Listen can you hear him weeping  
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow  
He buys love to sell tomorrow  
  
My life ain't no holiday  
I've been through the point of no return  
I've seen what a man can do  
I've seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
Feel your heartbeat lose the rhythm  
He can't touch the world we live in  
Life is short but love is strong  
There lies a hope that I have found  
And if you try you'll find it too  
Remember why I'm telling you  
  
My life ain't no holiday  
I've been through the point of no return  
I've seen what a man can do  
I've seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
And they gave him away  
Like in 'Whistle Down The Wind'  
By the look on his face  
He never gave in

  
What am I gonna do ?  
I feel like I'm on fire  
If you only knew  
That you're the object of desire...  
  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that you're the only one  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it won't be long  
  
My aim is true  
My vision is clear  
My thoughts are crude  
Whenever you're near  
  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that you're the only one  
I keep hanging on, keep hanging on  
And I swear by God that it won't be long  
  
I keep hanging on  
  
You've got a vicious streak  
For someone so young  
You're like solar flare  
In the rising sun  
  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on  
I keep hanging on

What does this ship bring to me  
Far across the restless sea  
Waiting for the sirens' call  
I've never seen it here before  
  
There she plies a lonely trade  
Cutting through the breaking waves  
Drifting slowly from her course  
She is lost forever more  
  
We all want some kind of love  
But sometimes it's not enough  
To the wall and through the door  
With a stranger on the shore  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
When you're gone  
  
Gotta catch the midnight train  
First to Paris then to Spain  
Travel with a document  
All across the continent  
  
City life is flying by  
The wheels are turning all the while  
Get on board we can't be late  
Our destination cannot wait  
  
All the stars and all the worlds  
Filling up this universe  
Could never be as close as us  
Will never shine as bright on us  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
When you're gone  
  
I won't desert you  
I don't know what to say  
I really hurt you  
I nearly gave it all away  
  
I've got it all wrong  
Cause you were not the wrong one  
And I don't know where to turn when you're gone  
  
How many times must I lose my way, hey  
How many words do I have to say, hey  
What can I do just to make you see  
That you're so good for a man like  
A man like me

You told me about yourself,  
How you once lived with someone else  
The way of life that you had tried  
The way they hurt you deep inside  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
But I thought I could've seen you here today  
But you leave me standing each and every way  
You told me a pack of lies  
That I can't even reason with  
Failure of your moral code  
The kind of things that I can't give  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying

Three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
  
I've got three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on  
  
It's a red sky tonight  
It's a red sky tonight  
At the end of the road  
Where all futures go  
At the end of the road  
There's a soldier waiting for me  
He's got three miles to go  
Three miles to go  
At the end of the road  
At the end of the road  
There's blood on shore  
  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me  
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy  
Forever to be still  
Breath held tight inside of me

Who's that over there  
Looks like he don't care  
Almost lost his mind  
Too much working overtime  
  
Gotta get out every night  
City gates are open wide  
Gotta get away from here  
Take that car and push that gear  
  
He don't need no one  
He's the rising sun  
He won't shed no tears  
Got no time to break down here  
  
Hey  
  
He's going nowhere fast  
Just a piece of dirty trash  
All alone, by his self  
He don't need nobody else  
  
Walking down the street  
So much going on  
People everywhere  
Look at him but they don't care  
  
See that world out there  
Make it go away  
You can't change his mind  
Too much working overtime  
  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
  
He crossed that picket line  
In trouble all the time  
Where did it all go wrong  
House music all night long  
  
All those girls out there  
Looking for the one  
Do they really care  
Could they just be having fun  
  
He did all he could  
Tried to get it right  
Somewhere he went wrong  
Too much working overtime  
  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Hey  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime  
Overtime

I turn sideways to the sun  
Keep my thoughts from everyone  
It's a jungle, I'm a freak  
Hear me talk, but never speak  
  
So I'm stepping out of time  
Because breaking is a crime  
And it may all be too late  
But I've no passion for this hate  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)  
  
And when this building is on fire  
These flames can't burn any higher  
I turn sideways to the sun  
And in a moment I am gone  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)  
  
That's the price of love (that's the price of love)  
Can you feel it (can you feel it)  
If we could buy it now (that's the price of love)  
How long would it last (that's the price of love)

Pictures of an image of a person who could not be blamed  
You are a colour and you are a number  
We need a sanction to see one another  
If I keep my distance in the season of this slender hell  
It's because of the need to live off one another  
Go home young offender and stay undercover  
  
We're busy running out of time  
(Whatever it takes, I will make you mine)  
I'll take the future from your hands  
(All the things I've ever had, I can make the perfect crime)  
  
We're strong, we do our thing  
Let the world cry, watch the birds sing  
Give me the freedom, I need to recover  
Words cannot heal, when a line is your lover  
  
Wind howls in my chamber like an angel  
(like an angel)  
You are a colour and you are a number  
Go home young offender and stay undercover

A thought that never changes  
Remains a stupid lie  
It's never been quite the same  
No hearing or breathing  
No movement, no colors  
Just silence  
  
Rise and fall of shame  
A search that shall remain  
We asked you what you'd seen  
You said you didn't care  
  
Sound formed in a vacuum  
May seem a waste of time  
It's always been just the same  
No hearing or breathing  
No movement no lyrics  
Just nothing  
  
The sign that leads the way  
The path we can not take  
You've caught me at a bad time  
So why don't you piss off
