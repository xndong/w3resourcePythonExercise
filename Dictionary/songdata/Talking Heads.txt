And she was lying in the grass  
And she could hear the highway breathing  
And she could see a nearby factory  
She's making sure she is not dreaming  
See the lights of a neighbor's house  
Now she's starting to rise  
Take a minute to concentrate  
And she opens up her eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
The world was moving and she was right there with it (and she was)  
The world was moving she was floating above it (and she was) and she was  
  
And she was drifting through the backyard  
And she was taking off her dress  
And she was moving very slowly  
Rising up above the earth  
Moving into the universe  
Drifting this way and that  
Not touching ground at all  
Up above the yard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was glad about it... no doubt about it  
She isn't sure what she's done  
No time to think about what to tell him  
No time to think about what she's done  
And she was  
  
And she was looking at herself  
And things were looking like a movie  
She had a pleasant elevation  
She's moving out in all directions  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Joining the world of missing persons (and she was)  
Missing enough to feel alright (and she was)

I'm mad and that's a fact  
I found out animals don't help  
Animals think they're pretty smart  
Shit on the ground, see in the dark  
  
They wander around like a crazy dog  
Make a mistake in the parking lot  
Always bumping into things  
Always let you down, down, down, down  
Eh, eh, eh, eh  
  
Animals think they understand  
Trusting them, a big mistake  
Animals want to change my life  
I will ignore, animals' advice  
  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them down  
Down, down, down  
  
I know the animals are laughing at us  
Don't even know what a joke is  
I won't follow animals' advice  
I don't care if they're laughing at us  
  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them  
They're never there when you need them  
They're never there when you call them down  
Down, down  
Eh, eh, eh  
  
They say they don't need money  
They're living on nuts and berries  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
You know animals are hairy?  
They say animals don't worry  
They think they know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
  
They ought to be more careful  
They're setting a bad example  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
They're setting a bad example  
They ought to be more careful  
You know animals are hairy?  
They're living on nuts and berries  
  
They want to know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
They ought to be more careful  
They're setting a bad example  
  
They like to laugh at people  
They're setting a bad example  
They have untroubled lives  
They think every thing's nice  
  
They say they don't need money  
They say animals don't worry  
They're living on nuts and berries  
You know animals are hairy?  
  
They think they know what's best  
They're making a fool of us  
They like to laugh at people  
They're making a bad example  
  
They say they don't need money  
You know animals are hairy?  
They're living on nuts and berries  
They say they don't need money  
They're setting a bad example

She had such tiny tears  
Just like a Barbie doll  
She likes to shop at Sears  
And visit shopping malls  
Now she's a big mamma  
Tell poppa  
Cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Old money  
Your old money doesn't matter now  
Have mercy  
Mercy, mercy, daddy's going fishing now  
He put the bait onto his line  
He's winding out his reel  
Fish are swimming in the pond  
Gonna let 'em sail away  
  
He's got his eye on you  
He knows just what she wants  
The fish is gonna bite  
She is his latest catch  
'Cause he's Big Daddy  
Oh, mammy  
Cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Big Daddy  
Oh, daddy's scraping bottom now  
Oh, momma  
Daddy, daddy, daddy does the talking now  
Mesmerized like horny toads  
By shiny things like jewels and gold  
Throwing all their pearls to swing  
Let 'em sail away  
  
You lucky dog  
You'll be on Easy Street  
Drinking champagne  
She gets all that she wants  
His heart's desire  
No more worries anymore  
Like a fairy tale  
Anything that she likes  
  
I seen you do the dog  
I seen you getting down  
A swimming back and forth  
When daddy's not around  
  
Big Daddy  
Oh, she's pretty as a picture now  
Oh, momma  
Oh, what a little martyr now  
He knows how to drive 'em wild  
One day you'd think she'd see  
Saying "This is mine and this is her.  
Now take that stuff away"  
  
It's best left unspoken  
One and one is two  
The velvet lies sing softly  
Each with a golden spoon  
And she passed her time in the wind and the rain  
Got a one way ticket on a Southbound train  
Said baby, baby, wants to have a good time  
And Big Daddy laughed  
And Big Daddy smiled  
  
Like dynamite  
One fine day she'll explode  
Who's laughing now?  
No one sees anymore  
Sneak in and out  
Don't get caught running 'round  
Swim back and forth  
Bubbles float to the top

Bill was a man  
Who grew too big  
It didn't matter what he did  
The girls would always run away  
When everybody laughs at you  
It can be humiliating  
  
Billy likes a  
Cute little girl  
They are lovers  
We can tell  
Kisses on the mouth  
Holding hands 'n' all  
Look into their eyes...  
  
Sneaking off together  
Running to the woods  
Swimming in the river  
Cooking up some food  
Making up religions  
Dropping out of school  
Laughing through the summertime  
Never meant to hurt nobody  
  
Angel of God  
Take me along  
Happy days  
Quiet life  
We are not alone...  
  
He bought a gun  
And she fixed her dress  
"I'm not afraid of Jesus Christ  
Who cares about the price we pay"  
It's our little secret  
And we're never, never, never going  
  
Angel of God  
Take me along  
Happy days  
Quiet life  
We are not alone...

Signs  
Signs are lost  
Signs disappeared  
Turn invisible  
Got no sign  
Somebody got busted  
Got a face of stone  
And a ghostwritten biography  
Dogs start to run in,  
Hungry for some food  
Dogs start a-twitching  
And they're looking at you  
It was light  
By five  
Torn all apart  
All in the name of democracy  
He's hurt  
He's dying  
Claimed he was a terrorist  
Claimed to avert a catastrophe  
Someone should'a told him  
That the buck stops here  
No one ever said  
That he was involved with thieves  
And they're blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
  
No sense of harmony, No sense of  
Time, Don't mention harmony, Say:  
What is it? What is it? What is it? Give  
A little shock, and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out, says: What is  
It? What is it? What is it?  
He was shot down in the night!  
People ride by but his body's still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done? She looks down at me...  
Says: "I don't want to die!"  
  
And I'm blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Somebody could have told us where they go  
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints  
Now tell me what the Hell have we become?  
Some dirty little bastards What the Hell is going on?you  
No sense of harmony, No sense of  
Time, Don't mention harmony, Say:  
What is it? What is it? What is it? Give  
A little shock, and he raises his hand  
Somebody shouts out, says: What is  
It? What is it? What is it?  
He was shot down in the night!  
People ride by but his body's still alive  
The girl in the window what has she  
Done? She looks down at me ...  
Says: "I don't want to die!"  
  
They're blind and they're blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind  
Blind, blind  
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands  
The hand speaks, the hand of a government man  
Well I'm a tumbler born under punches, I'm so thin  
  
All I want is to breathe  
(I'm too thin)  
Won't you breathe with me?  
Find a little space, so we move in-between  
(In-between it)  
And keep one step ahead, of yourself  
  
Don't you miss it, don't you miss it  
Some of you people just about missed it  
Last time to make plans  
And I'm a tumbler, I'm a government man  
  
Never seen anything like that before  
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor  
(Well I'm a tumbler)  
When you get to where you wanna be  
(Thank you! Thank you!)  
When you get to where you wanna be  
(Well, don't even mention it)  
  
Oh, take a look at these hands, they're passing in-between us  
Take a look at these hands  
Take a look at these hands, you don't have to mention it  
No thanks, I'm a government man  
  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
And the heat goes on  
(I got time)  
And the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
And the heat goes on, where the hand has been  
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on  
  
I'm not a drowning man  
And I'm not a burning building! I'm a tumbler  
Drowning cannot hurt a man  
Fire cannot hurt a man, not the government man  
  
All I want is to breathe  
(Thank you, thank you)  
Won't you breathe with me?  
Find a little space so we move in-between  
(I'm so thin)  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
(I'm catching up with myself)  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Won't you breathe with me?  
(Hands of a government man)  
Find a little space so we move in-between  
And keep one step ahead of yourself  
(Don't you miss it! Don't you miss it!)  
  
All I want is to breathe  
Won't you breathe with me?

Watch out you might get what you're after  
Cool baby strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary guy  
Burning down the house  
  
Hold tight wait till the party's over  
Hold tight we're in for nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
Burning down the house  
  
Here's your ticket pack your bag: time for jumpin' overboard  
Transportation is here  
Close enough but not too far,  
Maybe you know where you are  
Fightin' fire with fire  
  
All wet hey you might need a raincoat  
Shakedown dreams walking in broad daylight  
Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees  
Burning down the house  
  
It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself  
Gonna come in first place  
People on their way to work baby what did you expect  
Gonna burst into flame  
Burning down the house  
  
My house's out of the ordinary  
That's might don't want to hurt nobody  
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet  
Burning down the house  
  
No visible means of support and you have not seen nuthin' yet  
Everything's stuck together  
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set  
Fighting fire with fire

Here where you are standing  
The dinosaurs did a dance  
The Indians told a story  
Now it has come to pass  
  
The Indians had a legend  
The Spaniards lived for gold  
The white man came and killed them  
But they haven't really gone  
  
We live in the city of dreams  
We drive on the highway of fire  
Should we awake  
And find it gone  
Remember this, our favorite town  
  
From Germany and Europe  
And Southern U.S.A.  
They made this little town here  
That we live in to this day  
  
The children of the white man  
Saw Indians on TV  
And heard about the legend  
How their city was a dream  
  
We live in the city of dreams  
We drive on the highway of fire  
Should we awake  
And find it gone  
Remember this, our favorite town  
  
The Civil War is over  
And World War One and Two  
If we can live together  
The dream it might come true  
  
Underneath the concrete  
The dream is still alive  
A hundred million lifetimes  
A world that never dies  
  
We live in the city of dreams  
We drive on the highway of fire  
Should we awake  
And find it gone  
Remember this, our favorite town

Day by day  
Whistle while you work  
Our backs are breaking  
Up from hollow earth  
From end to end  
The noise begins  
In the human battle stations  
And the big one's coming in  
  
Work, work, work, work  
Work till holes are filled  
Work, work, work, work  
Bags of bone and skin  
Lovers hold hands  
Tossing their heads  
Tangled in hair  
Tied to earth  
With skin and glue  
  
But their skin is the same as yours  
Coming in for the world to see  
They can sit at the table, too  
The same blood as you and me  
  
Speak very softly  
Hold my hand  
Someone is sleeping in my bed  
Priests pass by  
Worms crawl in  
One dreams to be  
One dream for all  
His skin is the same as yours  
Is he not made the same as you?  
And some have fallen down  
And blood spilled on the ground  
  
Work, work,work  
Till his life is done  
The old man is at our door  
And he's knocking...knocking  
As his neighbors weep  
Each day repeats  
Are we nothing in your eyes?  
Someone answer, someone answer  
This rusted garden gate  
Can barely even stand  
Their work is over now  
And rest will be at hand  
  
Is their skin not the same as yours?  
Can they sit at the table to drink  
Cool water  
Cool water  
And his lungs are filled with rain...  
And the water's rushing in...

Lost my shape  
Trying to act casual!  
Can't stop  
I might end up in the hospital  
I'm changing my shape  
I feel like an accident  
They're back!  
To explain their experience  
Isn't it weir  
Looks too obscure to me  
Wasting away  
And that was their policy  
I'm ready to leave  
I push the fact in front of me  
Facts lost  
Facts are never what they seem to be  
Nothing there!  
No information left of any kind  
Lifting my head  
Looking for danger signs  
There was a line  
There was a formula  
Sharp as a knife  
Facts cut a hole in us  
There was a line  
There was a formula  
Sharp as a knife  
Facts cut a hole in us  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...  
The feeling returns  
Whenever we close out eyes  
Lifting my head  
Looking around inside  
The island of doubt  
It's like the taste of medicine  
Working by hindsight  
Got the message from the oxygen  
Making a list  
Find the cost of opportunity  
Doing it right  
Facts are useful in emergencies  
The feeling returns  
Whenever we close out eyes  
Lifting my head  
Looking around inside.  
Facts are simple and facts are straight  
Facts are lazy and facts are late  
Facts all come with points of view  
Facts don't do what I want them to  
Facts just twist the truth around  
Facts are living turned inside out  
Facts are getting the best of them  
Facts are nothing on the face of things  
Facts don't stain the furniture  
Facts go out and slam the door  
Facts are written all over your face  
Facts continue to change their shape  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...  
I'm still waiting... I'm still waiting...

I see the clouds that move across the sky  
I see the wind that moves the clouds away  
It moves the clouds over by the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods  
I see the pine cones that fall by the highway  
That's the highway that goes to the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
It's over there, it's over there  
My building has every convenience  
It's gonna make life easy for me  
It's gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax alone with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building,  
Take the highway, park and come up and see me  
I'll be working, working but if you come visit  
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important  
  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
I wouldn't worry about me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
  
I see the states, across this big nation  
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.  
I think of the ones I consider my favorites  
I think of the people that are working for me  
  
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones  
They work so hard and they try to be strong  
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building  
They own the buildings to help them along  
  
It's over there, it's over there  
My building has every convenience  
It's gonna make life easy for me  
It's gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax along with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones, loved ones visit the building  
Take the highway, park and come up and see me  
I'll be working, working but if you come visit  
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important  
  
I wouldn't worry 'bout  
I wouldn't worry about me  
Don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't you worry 'bout me...

When you were little  
You dreamed you were big  
You must have been something  
A real tiny kid  
  
You wish you were me  
I wish I was you  
Now don't you wake up  
The dream will come true  
  
Every dream has a name  
And names tell your story  
This song is your dream  
You're the dream operator  
  
It's bigger than life  
You know it's all me  
My face is a book  
But it's not what it seems  
  
Three angels above  
The whole human race  
They dream us to life  
They dream me a face  
  
And every dream tells it all  
And this dream is your story  
You dreamed me a heart  
You're the dream operator  
  
Shake-it-up dream  
Hi-di-ho dream  
Fix-it-up dream  
Look at me dream  
I've been waiting so long  
Now I am your dream  
  
Hard to forget  
Hard to go on  
When you fall asleep  
You're out on your own  
  
Let go of your life  
Grab on to my hand  
Here in the clouds  
Where we'll understand  
  
And you dreamed it all  
And this is your story  
Do you know who you are?  
You're the dream operator  
  
And you dreamed it all  
And this is your story  
Do you know who you are?  
You're the dream operator

And all I see is little dots  
Some are smeared and some are spots  
Feels like a murder but that's alright  
Somebody said there's too much light  
Pull down the shade and it's alright  
It'll be over in a minute or two.  
  
I'm charged up...don't put me down  
Don't feel like talking...don't mess around  
I feel mean...I feel o.k.  
I'm charged up...electricity  
  
The boys are making a big mess  
This makes the girls all start to laugh  
I don't know what they're talking about  
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked  
They pick the sound and let it drop  
Nobody know what they're talking about  
  
I'm charged up...I'm kinda wooden  
I'm barely moving...I study motion  
I study myself...I fooled myself  
I'm charged up...it's pretty intense.  
I'm charged up...don't put me down  
Don't feel like talking...don't mess around  
I feel mean...I feel o.k.  
I'm charged up...electricity.

Electric guitar is run over, by a car on the highway  
  
This is a crime against the state  
This is the meaning of life  
  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tu-tune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is plugged-in  
Recording, "Fa" (from "Psycho Killer")  
  
Judge and the jury  
Twelve members of the jury  
All listening to records  
Is this is a crime against the state?  
Ah, this is the verdict they reach:  
  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is copied  
Copy sounds better  
Call this law of justice  
Call this freedom and liberty  
I thought I perjure myself  
Right in front of the jury  
  
Is this a crime against the state?  
No, this is the verdict they reach:  
  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar

Here we stand  
Like an adam and an eve  
Waterfalls  
The garden of eden  
Two fools in love  
So beautiful and strong  
The birds in the trees  
Are smiling upon them  
From the age of the dinosaurs  
Cars have run on gasoline  
Where, where have they gone?  
Now, it's nothing but flowers  
  
There was a factory  
Now there are mountains and rivers  
You got it, you got it  
  
We caught a rattlesnake  
Now we got something for dinner  
We got it, we got it  
  
There was a shopping mall  
Now it's all covered with flowers  
You've got it, you've got it  
  
If this is paradise  
I wish I had a lawnmower  
You've got it, you've got it  
  
Years ago  
I was an angry young man  
I'd pretend  
That I was a billboard  
Standing tall  
By the side of the road  
I fell in love  
With a beautiful highway  
This used to be real estate  
Now it's only fields and trees  
Where, where is the town  
Now, it's nothing but flowers  
The highways and cars  
Were sacrificed for agriculture  
I thought that we'd start over  
But I guess I was wrong  
  
Once there were parking lots  
Now it's a peaceful oasis  
You got it, you got it  
  
This was a pizza hut  
Now it's all covered with daisies  
You got it, you got it  
  
I miss the honky tonks  
Dairy queens, and 7-elevens  
You got it, you got it  
  
And as things fell apart  
Nobody paid much attention  
You got it, you got it  
  
I dream of cherry pies,  
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies  
You got it, you got it  
  
We used to microwave  
Now we just eat nuts and berries  
You got it, you got it  
  
This was a discount store  
Now it's turned into a cornfield  
You got it, you got it  
  
Don't leave me stranded here  
I can't get used to this lifestyle

Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
You with that cocktail in your hand  
You in your red Mercedes Benz  
Goin' in one ear and out the other  
Cover up the pain with laughter, baby  
I'm not laughing, ha ha ha  
I'm not laughing  
  
Hey Al Capone  
Is that who you think you are?  
All the girls  
All around the world  
Well they, wanna shake your hand  
It won't be long  
You'll need an alibi  
A little bird  
Told me what he'd heard  
Is it really true?  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
  
I'm gonna take you for a ride  
And hit you right between the eyes  
You can hear the pretty music playin' well  
Listen to the words that I'm saying,  
You can hear them calling', hear them calling'  
  
Hey, Al Capone  
You'll need a bodyguard  
Just like that  
You'll be laid out flat  
With a broken heart  
I shot you down  
Who's gonna help you now?  
Valentine's day  
Better hope and pray  
They'll be tearing you apart  
Gangster of love, Gangster of love  
Gangster of love, Gangster of love  
  
I hear conversations  
In restaurants and bars  
I read all the papers  
And what they say is wrong  
It's such a fine, fine line  
Such a fine, fine line  
  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love  
Gangster of love

What you gonna do when you get out of jail?  
I'm gonna have some fun  
What do you consider fun?  
Fun, natural fun  
  
I'm in heaven  
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend  
there's no beginning and there is no end  
Time isn't present in that dimension  
Hell take my arm  
When were walkin', rolling and rocking  
Its one time I'm glad I'm not a man  
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping  
  
I'm in heaven  
With the maven of funk mutation  
Clintons musicians such as Bootsy Collins  
Raise expectations to a new intention  
No one can sing  
Quite like Smokey, Smokey Robinson  
Wailin' and shakin' to Bob Marley  
Reggaes expanding with Sly and Robbie  
  
All the weekend  
Boyfriend was missing  
I surely miss him  
The way he'd hold me in his warm arms  
We went insane when we took cocaine.  
  
Stepping in a rhythm to a Kurtis Blow  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
With a hiditihi and a hipitiho  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
Who needs to think when your feet just go  
James Brown, James Brown  
James Brown, James Brown  
  
If you see him  
Please remind him, unhappy boyfriend  
Well he's the genius of love  
he's got a greater depth of feeling  
Well he's the genius of love  
he's so deep.

I...Who took the money?  
Who took the money away?  
I...It's always showtime  
Here at the edge of the stage  
I, I, I, wake up and wonder  
What was the place, what was the name?  
We want to wait, but here we go again...  
  
I...takes over slowly  
But doesn't last very long  
I...no need to worry  
Evr'ything's under control  
O - you - T But no hard feelings  
What do you know? Take you away  
We're being taken for a ride again  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
She has the smoke in her eyes  
She's moving up, going right through my house  
She's ginna give me surprise  
Better than this, know that It's right  
I think you can if you like  
I git a girlfriend with bows in her hair  
And nothing is better than that  
  
Down, down in the basement  
We hear the sound of machines  
I, I, I'm driving in circles  
Come to my senses sometimes  
Why, why, why, why start it over?  
Nothing was lost, everything's free  
I don't care how impossible it seems  
  
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear  
Get closer to be far away  
Only one look and that's all that we need  
Maybe that's all that it takes  
All that it takes, all that it takes  
All that it takes, all that it takes  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And she goes wherever she likes. (there she goes...)  
  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
Now everyone's getting involved  
She's moving up going right through my heart  
We might not ever get caught  
Going right through (try to stay cool) going through, staying cool  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And nothing is better than you  
  
I got a girlfriend that's better that this  
And you don't remember at all  
As we get older and stop making sense  
You won't find her waiting long  
Stop making sense, stop making sense...stop making sense, making sense  
I got a girlfriend that's better than that  
And nothing is better that this ( is it? )

In...my...sensations  
I believe that I...was  
Born with the things that I know  
I want...to talk...  
Like ev'ry  
Before I decide what to do  
  
And I fell all over and I  
Couldn't stand up  
I can't be critical  
I can't won't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come...  
  
I'm...only...looking  
Feel like my heart  
Has a will of it's own  
I feel...feel nice inside  
Right here  
And now it's...summer again  
  
The story that I told  
The story I made up  
I was foolin' around but I  
Can't won't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Come to me, come to me, here it come...  
  
This...boy...is in motion  
Some density  
Moved right beside me  
I want  
My sentence  
Right here  
But now I'm far away  
  
A sign was given but  
Many years have passed  
Cost a little bit to love you but I  
Won't can't stop  
Such a happy day  
For me  
Bring a happy day  
To me  
Send a happy day  
To me  
And a happy day  
Came to me come to me here it come...  
  
It's alright

Everyone is trying to get to the bar.  
The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven.  
The band in Heaven plays my favorite song.  
They play it once again, they play it all night long.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
  
There is a party, everyone is there.  
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time.  
Its hard to imagine that nothing at all  
Could be so exciting, and so much fun.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
  
When this kiss is over it will start again.  
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same.  
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all  
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun.  
  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.  
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.

For a long time I felt without style or grace  
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather  
I knew my heart was in the right place  
I knew I'd be able to do these things.  
  
And as we watch him digging his own grave  
It is important to know that was where he's at  
He can't afford to stop...That is what he believe  
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years.  
  
I'm walking a line  
I'm thinking about empty motion  
I'm walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isn't the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
I'm turning around  
No trouble at all  
You notice there's nothing around you, around you  
I'm walking a line  
Divide and dissolve.  
  
Never get to say much, never get to talk  
Tell us a little bit, but not too much  
Right about then, is where she give up  
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope  
  
I'm walking a line  
I hate to be dreaming in motion  
I'm walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isn't the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
I'm turning around  
No trouble at all  
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me  
I'm walking a line  
Divide and dissolve.  
  
I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards  
I'm moving twice as much as I was before  
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth  
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...  
  
I'm walking a line  
Visiting houses in motion  
I'm walking a line  
Just barely enough to be living  
Get outta the way  
No time to begin  
This isn't the time  
So nothing was done  
Not talking about  
Not many at all  
I'm turning around  
No trouble at all  
Two different houses surround you, 'round you  
I'm walking a line  
Divide and dissolve.

I wish you wouldn't say that  
I thought I'd have to come right over  
I thought I made it clear enough  
I guess I'll have to make it clearer  
  
Say something to change your mind  
Bring me back the way I used to be  
If it takes forever that's all right  
Say the words that I've been trying to hear  
  
I wish you didn't tell her  
I thought o'd have to come right over  
I thought I'd have to make it clearer  
Now jimmy's coming over  
  
There are places that I won't forget  
And I guess I'm never going back  
Guess it's information that I lack  
I've told lies without a hint or regret  
  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that  
I wish you wouldn't say that...

Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons,  
Packed up and ready to go  
Heard of some grave sites, out by the highway,  
A place where nobody knows  
  
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,  
I'm getting used to it now  
Lived in a brownstone, lived in a ghetto,  
I've lived all over this town  
  
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,  
This ain't no fooling around  
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,  
I ain't got time for that now  
  
Transmit the message, to the receiver,  
Hope for an answer some day  
I got three passports, a couple of visas,  
You don't even know my real name  
  
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,  
Everything's ready to roll  
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime,  
I might not ever get home  
  
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,  
This ain't no fooling around  
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C. B. G. B.,  
I ain't got time for that now  
  
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?  
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?  
You oughta know not to stand by the window  
Somebody see you up there  
  
I got some groceries, some peanut butter,  
To last a couple of days  
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones,  
Ain't got no records to play  
  
Why stay in college? Why go to night school?  
Gonna be different this time  
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard,  
I ain't got time for that now  
  
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock,  
We blended in with the crowd  
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines,  
I know that that ain't allowed  
  
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,  
Or in a suit and a tie  
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,  
I don't know what I look like!  
  
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,  
We make a pretty good team  
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,  
You ought to get you some sleep  
  
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?  
They won't help me survive  
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace,  
The burning keeps me alive

I have tried marijuana  
I get nervous every time  
There will come a knockin' at the door  
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me?  
I don't want to know  
Excuse and pardon me  
Stay for a while  
Maybe we'll never meet again  
  
I can see my lifetime piling up  
I can see the days turn into nights  
I can see the people on the street  
Open those windows up  
A hundred floors below me  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
I can feel them swayin' back and forth  
Building it higher, higher  
This tower's learning over  
  
I got bad coordination  
Stuck a pencil in my eye  
I can hardly wait to get back home  
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?  
I's only havin' fun  
Scum-bags and superstars  
Tell me your names  
I'll make a bet, you're  
Both the same  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
Reaching from my bedroom to the stars  
I can see the house where I was born  
When I was growin' up - they say that  
I could never keep my trousers up  
I remember days and crazy nights  
Are there any pirates on this ship?  
And if they sober up - they'll have us  
Home by morning  
  
Cry, cry, cry  
It's just you and I  
Like an automobile  
With no one at the wheel  
Spinning out of control  
We're all over the road  
In our sexy machine  
All the passengers scream  
Scream, scream!  
  
I can see my lifetime pilin' up  
I can see it smashin' into yours  
It was not an accident at all  
Open your window up - I hear you laughin'  
  
Goin' one, two, three, four, five  
Goin' from the bottom to the top  
Maybe I'm holding on too tight  
And now I'm growin' up  
I got a funny feeling  
Pilin' those houses up  
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher  
Building that highway to the stars  
And turning the music up - Hey!  
I got a winning number

Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill  
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came  
He sees the foreigners in growing numbers  
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses  
He thinks of days that he can still remember...now.  
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands  
Mojique sends the package to the American man  
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys  
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover  
He feels the time is surely now or never...more.  
The wind in my heart  
The wind in my heart  
The dust in my head  
The dust in my head  
The wind in my heart  
The wind in my heart  
(Come to)  
Drive them away  
Drive them away.  
Mojique buys equipment in the market place  
Mojique plants devices in the free trade zone  
He feels the wind is lifting up his people  
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission  
He knows his friend the wind is always standing...by.  
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away  
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place  
He feels the presence of the wind around him  
He feels the power of the past behind him  
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him...on.  
The wind in my heart  
The wind in my heart  
The dust in my head  
The dust in my head  
The wind in my heart  
The wind in my heart  
(Come to)  
Drive them away  
Drive them away.

I was born in a house with the television always on  
Guess I grew up too fast  
And I forgot my name  
We're in cities at night and we got time on our hands.  
So leave the driving to us.  
And it's the real thing.  
  
And you're rolling  
In the blender  
With me.  
And I can love you  
Like a color  
TV.  
  
Now love is here  
C'mon and try it  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
And now love is here  
C'mon and try it  
Got love for sale,  
Got love for sale.  
  
You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans.  
I'll be a video for you.  
If you turn my dial.  
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank  
You get two for one  
For a limited time.  
  
Push my button...  
The toast pops up  
Love and money  
Gettin' all  
Mixed up  
And now love is here  
C'mon and try it.  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
  
Love is here  
C'mon and try it  
I got love for sale  
I got Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love

Nothing can come between us  
Nothing gets you down  
Nothing strikes your fancy  
Nothing turns you on  
Somebody is waiting in the hallway  
Somebody is falling down the stairs  
Set someone free, break someone's heart  
Stand up help us out  
  
Ev'rything is divided  
Nothing is complete  
Ev'rything looks impressive  
Do not be deceived  
You don't have to wait for more instructions  
No one makes a monkey out of me  
We lie on our backs, feet in the air  
Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain  
  
Snap into position  
Bounce till you ache  
Step out of line  
And you end up in jail  
Bring me a doctor  
I have a hole in my head  
But they are just people  
And I'm not afraid  
Doctor Doctor  
We have nothing in our pockets  
We continue  
But we have nothing left to offer  
Faces pressed against the window  
Hey! they are just my friends  
Check this out don't be slick  
Break our backs it goes like this . . .  
  
We are born without eyesight  
We are born without sin  
And our mama protects us  
From the cold and the rain  
We're in no hurry  
sugar and spice  
We sing in the darkness  
We open our eyes (open up)  
  
I can't believe it  
And people are strange  
Our president's crazy  
Did you hear what he said  
Business and pleasure  
Lie right to your face  
Divide it in sections  
And then give it away  
  
There are no big secrets  
Don't believe what you read  
We have great big bodies  
We got great big heads  
Run-a-run-a-run it all together  
Check it out - still don't make no sense  
Makin' flippy floppy  
Tryin to do my best  
Lock the door  
We kill the beast  
Kill it!

Do you remember anyone here?  
No you don't remember anything at all  
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back  
Never woke up, had no regrets  
  
There's a party in my mind...  
And it never stops  
There's a party up there all the time...  
They'll party till they drop  
Other people can go home...  
Other people they can split  
I'll be here all the time...  
I can never quit  
  
Take a walk through the land of shadows  
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows  
Try not to look so disappointed  
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?  
There's a party in my mind...  
And I hope it never stops  
I'm stuck here in this seat...  
I might not stand up  
  
Other people can go home...  
Everyone else will split  
I'll be here all the time...  
I can never quit  
  
Everything is very quiet  
Everyone has gone to sleep  
I'm wide awake on memories  
There memories can't wait.

Time won't change you  
Money won't change you  
I haven't got the faintest idea  
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time  
  
I need something you change your mind  
  
Drugs won't change you  
Religion won't change you  
  
Science won't change you  
Looks like I can't change you  
I try to talk to you, to make things clear  
But you're not even listening to me...  
And it comes directly from my heart to you...  
  
I need something to change your mind.

All the way home from Baltimore  
We couldn't find a seat  
Conductor says he's sorry for  
The blisters on our feet  
  
Comes a-riding in a bus  
The high and the low  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Going on a trip  
  
And we're not going home  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Driving, keep driving  
Driving, driving all night  
  
Sleeping on my daddy's shoulder  
Drinking from a paper cup  
And I'm wearing my grandfather's clothes  
And they say that up North it gets cold  
  
Crawling out of bed one night  
Walking in my sleep  
We're not the only family  
To take this little trip  
  
Driving all the way up  
It's thirty below  
Mommy, daddy, you and I  
Even little kids  
  
Getting ready to go  
Mommy, daddy,you and I  
Chilly, chilly-willy  
It's colder the further we go  
  
Some are born to take advantage  
But saying it don't make it so  
So hold me and don't let me go  
'Cause the sidewalks are covered with snow  
  
He's speaking English now  
And he's smoothing out his clothes  
He's Mr. Button Down  
He's leaving home  
  
Making changes day by day  
And we still ain't got no plan  
How we gonna make our way  
In this foreign land?  
  
Well we'll keep driving, keep driving  
Driving with all of our might  
Changing, still changing  
Changing the water of life  
  
Keep that little man a shining  
See how the tail can wag the dog  
And we're all riding in this old bus  
And the driver is singing to us  
  
And we're wearing out grandfather's clothes  
'Cause we heard that up North it gets cold

Mr. Jones  
Put a wiggle in your stride  
Loosen up  
I believe he'll be alright  
Changing clothes  
Now he's got ventilated slacks  
Bouncing off the walls  
Mr. Jones is back!  
Bulge out  
And wind your waist  
Tight pants  
Got curly hair  
Drinking cold beer  
From metal cans  
Moonshine  
And Handi-Wipes!  
Mr. Jones is back in town  
It's his lucky day  
Hold up your hands and shout  
Jones is on his way  
Pitter pat  
Mr. Jones is back in town  
Aces high  
Now his pants are falling down  
He looks so fine  
In those patent leather shoes  
Mr. Jones, you look tired  
I believe you'll be alright  
Sales men  
Conventioneers  
Some rock stars  
With tambourines  
Short skirts  
And skinny legs  
Selling bibles  
And real estate  
It's a big day for Mr. Jones  
He is not so square  
Mr. Jones will stick around  
He's everybody's friend  
Fast cars  
And motorbikes  
I'm sure glad  
He's on our side  
The Jones Gang  
Down at the bar  
Watch out, this time  
They've gone too far  
They call for Mr. Jones  
They put him in charge  
Mr. Jones will help us out  
He's a lucky guy  
It is Mr. Jones' Birthday party  
For another year  
In his hotel room Party favors  
It's a holiday

It's not...yesterday...anymore  
I go visiting, I talk loud  
I try to make myself clear  
In front...of a face...that's nearer  
Than it's ever been before  
Not this close before  
Nearer than before  
Not this close before  
  
It is...is a million...years ago  
I hear music...and it sounds like bells  
I feel like my head is high  
I wish...I could meet...every one  
Meet them all over again  
Bring them up to my room  
Meet them all over again  
Everyone's up in my room  
  
And now...now I'm busy...busy again  
I feel like sitting down but  
I'm still thinking...thinking about my friends  
In my garden...moments  
But now I'm speaking out  
Speaking about my friends  
Now I'm speaking out  
Thinking about my friends

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack  
And you may find yourself in another part of the world  
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile  
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife  
And you may ask yourself  
Well...How did I get here?  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
After the money's gone  
Once in a lifetime  
Water flowing underground  
  
And you may ask yourself  
How do I work this?  
And you may ask yourself  
Where is that large automobile?  
And you may tell yourself  
This is not my beautiful house  
And you may tell yourself  
This is not my beautiful wife  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
After the money's gone  
Once in a lifetime  
Water flowing underground  
  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
  
Water dissolving...and water removing  
There is water at the bottom of the ocean  
Under the water, carry the water at the bottom of the ocean  
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
Into the silent water  
Under the rocks and stones  
There is water underground  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
After the money's gone  
Once in a lifetime  
Water flowing underground  
  
And you may ask yourself  
What is that beautiful house?  
And you may ask yourself  
Where does that highway go to?  
And you may ask yourself  
Am I right?...Am I wrong?  
And you may say to yourself yourself  
My God!...What have I done?!  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
Into the silent water  
Under the rocks and stones  
There is water underground  
  
Letting the days go by  
Let the water hold me down  
Letting the days go by  
Water flowing underground  
Into the blue again  
After the money's gone  
Once in a lifetime  
Water flowing underground  
  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Look where my hand was  
Time isn't holding us  
Time isn't after us  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Same as it ever was...  
Yeah, the twister comes  
Here comes the twister  
Same as it ever was...

  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
[Our house, in the middle of our]  
Something tells you that you've got to get away from it  
  
Father wears his Sunday best  
Mother's tired she needs a rest  
The kids are playing up downstairs  
Sister's sighing in her sleep  
Brother's got a date to keep  
He can't hang around  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our  
  
Our house it has a crowd  
There's always something happening  
And it's usually quite loud  
Our mum she's so house-proud  
Nothing ever slows her down  
And a mess is not allowed  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our...  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
[Our house, in the middle of our]  
Something tells you that you've got to get away from it  
  
Father gets up late for work  
Mother has to iron his shirt  
Then she sends the kids to school  
Sees them off with a small kiss  
She's the one they're going to miss  
In lots of ways  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our  
  
I remember way back then when everything was true and when  
We would have such a very good time such a fine time  
Such a happy time  
And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away  
Then we'd say nothing would come between us two dreamers  
  
Father wears his Sunday best  
Mother's tired she needs a rest  
The kids are playing up downstairs  
Sister's sighing in her sleep  
Brother's got a date to keep  
He can't hang around  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
Our house, in the middle of our...  
  
Our house, was our castle and our keep  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
  
Our house, that was where we used to sleep  
Our house, in the middle of our street  
  
Our house, in the middle of our street

You'll be, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, magnet for money  
You'll be, mm-mm-mm-mm, magnet for love  
You'll feel, hmm, light in your body

To the city of camps.  
Now, we're your children  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night  
In the night  
Come and ride your horse

Of six sevens and nines  
Dust in your garden  
Poison in your mind  
There is a king  
That will steal your soul  
Din't let him catch you,  
Don't let him get control.

In the night, come and ride your horse

Hold the paper up to the light  
(some rays pass right through)  
Expose yourself out there for a minute  
(some rays pass right through)  
  
Take a little rest when the rays pass through  
Take a little time off when the rays pass through  
  
Go ahead and mess it up...Go ahead and tie it up  
In a long distance telephone call  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because it's been taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
  
Had a love affair but it was only paper  
(some rays they pass right through)  
Had a lot of fun, could have been a lot better  
(some rays they pass right through)  
  
Take a little consideration, take every combination  
Take a few weeks off, make it tighter, tighter  
But it was never, it was never written down  
Still might be a chance that it might work out (if you)  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because it'll be taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
Don't think I can fit it on the paper  
Don't think I can get it on the paper  
Go ahead and rip up, rip up the paper  
Go ahead and tear up, tear up the paper

In 1950 when I was born  
Papa couldn't afford to buy us much  
He said be proud of what you are  
There's something special 'bout people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who will answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
We don't want freedom  
We don't want justice  
We just want someone to love.  
Someone to love.u  
I was called upon in the third grade class  
I gave my answer and it caused a fuss  
I'm not the same as ev'ryone else  
And times were hard for people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who will answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing as big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
  
What good is freedom?  
God laughs at people like us  
I see it coming  
Like coming down from above  
  
The clouds roll by and the moon comes up  
How long must we live in the heat of the sun  
Millions of people are waitin' on love  
And this is a song about people like us  
  
People like us  
(Who answer the telephone)  
People like us  
(Growing big as a house)  
People like us  
(Gonna make it because)  
We don't want freedom  
We don't want justice  
We just want someone to love.  
  
Someone to love.  
Someone to love.  
Someone to love.

Well, I know what it is  
But I don't know where it is  
Where it is  
Well, I know where it is  
But I don't know what it looks like  
What it looks like  
Well, I know what it looks like,  
But I don't know where she comes from  
Well, I know where she comes from,  
But I don't know what's her name.  
  
[Chorus:]  
(and she said) This is a perfect world  
I'm riding on an incline  
I'm staring in your face  
You'll photograph mine  
  
And I've been walking, talking  
Believing the things that are true  
And I've been finding  
The difference between right and wrong...good and bad  
See me put things together  
Put them back where they belong  
Am I just like the others  
Have I always been singing the same song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody said that it happens all over the world  
I do believe that it's true  
And the sun's coming up  
And we're doing all the things that we should  
Doesn't everybody here believe in the things we do?  
  
(And she said)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a strange situation  
What's wrong with you?  
Baby...baby...baby  
What you doing in my house?  
And it's all true  
There's nothing wrong with you  
(And I said)  
  
[Chorus]

I'm hanging round the airport  
I'm waiting for the plane  
Mmm, something sweet and sticky  
Runnin'down my hand  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those

coconut delight  
Honey honey honey don't let go  
(It's summertime, love)  
  
Mmm, a kinky little sister  
Mmm, a-wearin' rubber gloves  
A sexual health emergency  
A copulation fantasy  
You and me, ecstasy  
Hate to be reality  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those (hoo!)  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
I'm taking off my clothes  
Honey honey honey don't let go

Pay, and ye shall receive  
Cigarettes and pantyhose  
Hit me in the funny bone  
Hynie hole Tootsie roll  
Jelly roll Time to go  
  
Popsicle of love  
Gimme gimme gimme one of those  
(It's summertime, boy!)  
coconut delight  
Honey honey honey don't let go  
(It's summertime, love)  
  
I'm throwing up my hands

(It's summertime, boy!)  
I'm blowing up my mind  
Lemme lemme see what I can do  
(It's summertime, boy!)

Hello again  
Yes indeed my friend  
I can tell  
Goin' get together again  
I could be right  
I could be wrong  
I feel nice when I sing this song  
And I don't mind  
Whatever happens is fine  
Baby likes to keep on playing...  
What do I know, what do I know?  
Wilder than the place we live in...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
I don't mind some slight disorder...  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And I know ev'ry living creature...  
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots  
  
And I know you  
I understand what you do  
Yes, indeed  
I put the hat on my head  
Come outta your mess  
Bring yourself in  
I feel nice when I start to sing  
And I can see  
Ev'ryone else is like me  
  
Towns that disappeared completely...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
Miles and miles of endless highway...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
Colored lights and shiny curtains...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
Ev'rything has been forgiven...  
Pull up the roost, pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good time...when I go out of my mind  
And it's a wonderful place...and I can't wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful sounds...coming outta the ground  
Gonna take us a while...but we'll go hundreds of times  
  
Baby likes to keep on playing...  
What d'you know? what d'you I know?  
Wilder than the place we live in...  
I'll take you there, I'll take you there  
And I don't mind some slight disorder...  
Pull up the roots pull up the roots  
And no more time for talkin' it over...  
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots  
  
Well I have a good time...when I go out of my mind  
And it's a wonderful place...and I can't wait to be there  
And I hear beautiful sounds...coming outta the ground  
Someone musta been high...but I guess it's alright

Mommy, Daddy, come and look at me now  
I'm a big man in a great big town  
Years ago who would believe it's true  
Goes to show what a little faith can do  
  
I was complaining, I was down in the dumps  
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up  
  
I slipped, and I got pulled  
Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,  
You pulled me up  
I slipped, and I got pulled,  
Pulled up, I slipped, and then you pulled,  
You pulled me up pull me up pull me up...  
Pulled me up up up up up up up up  
  
I drift away to another land  
Sleeping dreaming such a simple thing  
I think of things that I might be  
I see my name go down in history  
  
I was complaining, I was down in the dumps  
I feel so string now 'cause you pulled me up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up  
I slipped, and I got pulled,  
Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,  
You pulled me up  
I tripped, and I got pulled  
Pulled up, I slipped, and then you pulled  
You pulled me up! Pulled me up up, Pulled me up...  
Pulled me up up up up up up up up  
  
I got up  
'cause you pulled me up  
I stood up  
'cause you pulled me up  
I got up  
And that was because you pulled me up  
I got up  
In a little while you pulled me up  
Pull me up up up up, up up up up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up!  
  
I cast a shadow on the living-room wall  
Dark and savage with a profile so sharp  
Keep that wonderful food on the table  
There's really no hurry I'll eat in a while  
  
I was complaining, I was down in the dumps  
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up!  
I slipped, and I got pulled  
Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,  
You pulled me up  
I slipped, and I got pulled  
Pulled Up, I slipped,  
And then you pulled, you pulled me up!  
Pull me up...Pull me up...Watch out!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up!  
Pull me up up up up up up up up!

Baby your mind is a radio  
Got a receiver inside my head  
Baby I'm tuned to your wavelength  
Lemme tell you what it says:  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...of a brand-new world.  
  
So look at my fingers vibrate  
From their tip down down to my toes  
Now I'm receiving your signal  
We're gonna leave the land of noise  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...of a brand-new world.  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...Of a brand-new world.  
  
Now you and I have no secrets  
Now baby, lemme read your mind  
I hear ev'rything you're thinking  
You can't help the way you sound  
  
Transmitter!  
Picking up something good.  
Hey! Radio head!  
The sound...Of a brand-new world  
Oh! Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head

Well we know where we're goin'  
But we don't know where we've been  
And we know what we're knowin'  
But we can't say what we've seen  
And we're not little children  
And we know what we want  
And the future is certain  
Give us time to work it out  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're on a road to nowhere  
Come on inside  
Takin' that ride to nowhere  
We'll take that ride  
  
I'm feelin' okay this mornin'  
And you know,  
We're on the road to paradise  
Here we go, here we go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe you wonder where you are  
I don't care  
Here is where time is on our side  
Take you there...take you there  
  
We're on a road to nowhere  
We're on a road to nowhere  
We're on a road to nowhere  
  
There's a city in my mind  
Come along and take that ride  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
And it's very far away  
But it's growing day by day  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
They can tell you what to do  
But they'll make a fool of you  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
We're on a road to nowhere

'Round and 'round  
And we won't let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Down and down  
In a spin we turn  
Looking like  
We'll never learn  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Think about  
What ev'ryone is saying  
Ruby dear  
Oh don't you hear  
  
Late at night  
When the radio is playing  
Ruby dear  
So looky here  
  
Oh this record's broken  
It slips a beat  
And all those watermelons  
Have gone to seed  
  
Nothing lives  
In this dirty little river  
No one here  
Will shed a tear  
  
It dried up  
But it couldn't run forever  
Ruby dear  
That's what we hear  
  
I still like the ocean  
Down by the sea  
They left that door wide open  
It tempted me  
Hounding me  
From the bedroom to the kitchen  
  
Ruby dear  
I'm still right here  
Now they threw  
The fox amongst the chickens  
It's too deep  
I'll drown in my sleep!  
  
Angels and prostitutes  
They might look the same  
And if to Hell we're going  
I'll see you there  
  
'Round and 'round  
And we won't let go  
And where we stop  
No one knows  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Down the street  
Where the bonfires glow  
Looking like  
They lost control  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Settle down  
In that rocking chair  
Breathing in  
That rotten air  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
  
Johnny Jones  
Fell fast asleep  
Down a hole  
Where the rocks are steep  
Uh-huh uh-huh

Falling, falling  
Gonna drop like a stone  
I'm falling through the atmosphere  
On a warm afternoon  
If lovers discover  
That everyone dies  
So don't tell me, please hold me  
It's a dangerous life  
  
Daddy dear  
Let's get outta here  
I'm scared  
Ten o'clock  
Nighttime in New York  
It's weird  
  
If you're looking for trouble  
Well, that's what you will find  
  
Mom and Pop  
They will fuck you up  
For sure  
Love so deep  
Kills you in your sleep  
It's true  
  
Love keeps us together  
And love keeps us alive  
  
And we - are criminals that never  
broke no laws  
And all - we needed was a net  
to break our fall  
  
They're searching for diamonds  
They're grabbin' at straws  
Sex 'n' sin  
Sax 'n' violins  
It's hell  
Wooden heads  
Furniture with legs  
For sale  
  
Love keeps us together  
And love will drive us insane  
  
And we - are criminals that never  
broke no laws  
And all - we needed was a net  
to break our fall  
  
Going home  
Back where I belong  
To stay  
Rays of light  
They will turn the light  
To day  
  
Birds travel together  
Birds follow the sun  
And I - am watching as the birds go flying home

He would see faces in movies, on T.V., in magazines, and in books...  
He thought that some of these faces might be right for him...  
And through the years, by keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his
mind...  
Or somewhere in the back of his mind...  
That he might, by force of will, cause his face to approach those of his
ideal...  
The change would be very subtle...It might take ten years or so...  
Gradually his face would change its' shape...  
A more hooked nose...wider, thinner lips...beady eyes...a larger forehead.  
He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people...  
They had also molded their faced according to some ideal...  
Maybe they imagined that their new face would better  
Suit their personality...Or maybe they imagined that their  
Personality would be forced to change to fit the new appearance...  
This is why first impressions are often correct...  
Although some people might have made mistakes...  
They may have arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them...  
They may have picked an ideal appearance based on some childish  
Whim, or momentary impulse...  
Some may have gotten half-way  
There, and then changed their minds.  
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake.

What about the time?  
You were rollin' over  
Fall on your face  
You must be having fun  
  
Walk lightly!  
Think of a time.  
You'd best believe  
This thing is real  
  
Put away that gun  
And this part is simple  
Try to recognize  
What is in your mind  
  
God help us!  
Help us lose our minds  
These slippery people  
Help us understand  
  
What's the matter with him? (He's alright!)  
I see his face (The lord won't mind)  
Don't know no games (He's alright)  
Love from the bottom to the top  
  
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)  
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)  
We're gonna move (Right now)  
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel  
  
I remember when  
Sittin' in the tub  
Pulled out the plug  
The water was runnin' out  
  
Cool down  
Stop acting crazy  
They're gonna leave  
And we'll be on our own  
  
Seven times five  
They were living creatures  
Watch 'em come to life  
Right before your eyes  
  
Backsliding!  
How do you do?  
These slippery people  
Gonna see you through

I think that we can signify our love now,  
Ooh girl, you can initiate an impulse of love.  
  
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry  
Move a muscle, move a muscle, move a muscle.  
Make a motion, make a motion, make a motion.  
Pull it tighter, pull it tighter, pull it tighter.  
Double beatin', double beatin', double beatin'  
Double beatin', double beatin', double beatin'  
Palpitation, palpitation, palpitation.  
Stay hungry, stay hungry, stay hungry.  
  
Here's that rhythm again.  
Here's my shoulder blade.  
Here's the sound I made.  
Here's the picture I saved.  
Here I am.

Mommy had. A little baby.  
There he is. Fast asleep.  
He's just. A little plaything.  
Why not. Wake him up?  
Cute. Cute. Little baby.  
Little pee pee. Little toes.  
Now he's comin' to me.  
Crawl across. The kitchen floor.  
  
Baby, baby, please let me hold him  
I want to make him stay up all night  
Sister, sister, he's just a plaything  
We want to make him stay up all night  
Yeah we do  
  
See him drink. From a bottle.  
See him eat. From a plate.  
Cute. Cute. As a button.  
Don't you want to make him. Stay up late.  
And we're having fun. With no money.  
Little smile. On his face.  
Don't cha' love. The little baby.  
Don't you want to make him. Stay up late.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Here we go (all night long)  
Sister, sister (all night long)  
In the playpen...woo...(all night long)  
Little baby goes, ha! (all night long)  
I know you want to leave me...  
  
Why don't. We pretend.  
There you go. Little man.  
Cute. Cute. Why not?  
Late at night. Wake him up.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Here we go (all night long)  
Sister, sister...woo...  
(with the television on)  
Little baby goes...woo! (all night long)  
Hey, hey, baby! (all night long)  
And he looks so cute (all night long)  
In his little red suit (all night long)

Now lemme tell you a story  
The devil he has a plan  
A bag a' bones in his pocket  
Got anything you want  
No dust and no rocks  
The whole thing is over  
All these beauties in solid motion  
All those beauties, gonna swallow you up  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi,  
One time too many  
Too far to go  
I-We come to take you home  
  
And when they split those atoms  
It's hotter than the sun  
Blood is a special substance  
They gonna pray for that man  
  
So wake up young lovers  
The whole thing is over  
Watch but touch monkeys  
All that blood, gonna swallow you whole  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
What's that? Who's driving?  
Where we goin'? Who knows?  
I-We come to take you home  
  
How many people do you think I am  
Pretend I am somebody else  
You can pretend I'm and old millionaire  
A millionaire washing his hands  
Rattle the bones, dreams that stick out  
A medical chart on the wall  
Soft violence and hands touch your throat  
Ev'ryone wants to explode  
  
And when your hands get dirty  
Nobody knows you at all  
Don't have a window to slip out of  
Lights on, nobody home  
  
Click click- see ya later  
Beta beta- no time to rest  
Pika pika- risky business  
All that blood, will never cover that mess.  
  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
So soft hard feelings  
What's that, who's driving  
No tricks lets go  
I-We come to take you home  
I-We come to take you home  
Hi hi hi hi hi  
Etc.

I'm looking and I'm dreaming for the first time  
I'm inside and I'm outside at the same time  
And everything is real  
Do I like the way I feel?  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the world crashes in into my living room  
Television man made me what I am  
People like to put the television down  
But we are just good friends  
(I'm a) television man  
  
I knew a girl, she was a macho man  
But it's alright, I wasn't fooled for long  
This is the place for me  
I'm the king, and you're the queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a walk in the beautiful garden  
Everyone would like to say hello  
It doesn't matter what you say  
Come and take us away  
  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
The world crashes in, into my living room  
  
And we are still good friends...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...(Television man)  
I'm watching everything...(Television man)  
Television man...and I'm gonna say  
We are still good friends...and I'm trying to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
We are still good friends...You know the way it is  
Television man...I've got what you need  
We are still good friends...I know the way you are  
Television man...I know what you're tryin' to be  
Watchin' everything...and I gotta say  
That's how the story ends.

Now that I can  
Release my tensions  
Let me make clear  
My best intentions  
Girls ask and I  
Define decision  
Boys ask and I  
Describe their function  
  
Oh the boys  
Want to talk  
Like to to talk about those problems  
And the girls  
Say they're concerned  
And they are  
Concerned with these decisions  
  
And it's all  
Hard Logic  
To follow and the  
Girls get lost  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
But they are  
Concerned with these decisions  
  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
  
Decide, decide  
Make up your mind  
Decide, decide  
I told you what to say  
Confuse, confuse  
Describe what I found  
Confuse, confuse  
I told you what to say  
  
Oh the girls  
Still want to talk  
Want to talk about those problems  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
But they are concerned with these decisions  
  
And it's all  
Hard Logic  
I know  
And the girls get lost  
And the boys  
Say they're concerned  
And they are concerned with these decisions  
  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
I want to talk  
I want to talk as much as I want  
I'm gonna give  
I'm gonna give the problem to you  
  
Decide, decide  
Make up your mind  
Decide, decide  
I told you what to say  
Confuse, confuse  
Describe what I found  
Confuse, confuse  
I told you what to say

I see the shapes,  
I remember from maps.  
I see the shoreline.  
I see the whitecaps.  
A baseball diamond, nice weather down there.  
I see the school and the houses where the kids are.  
Places to park by the fac'tries and buildings.  
Restaurants and bar for later in the evening.  
Then we come to the farmlands, and the undeveloped areas.  
And I have learned how these things work together.  
I see the parkway that passes through them all.  
And I have learned how to look at these things and I say,  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't live there if you paid me.  
I wouldn't live like that, no siree!  
I wouldn't do the things the way those people do.  
I wouldn't live there if you paid me to.  
  
I guess it's healthy, I guess the air is clean.  
I guess those people have fun with their neighbors and friends.  
Look at that kitchen and all of that food.  
Look at them eat it' guess it tastes real good.  
  
They grow it in the farmlands  
And they take it to the stores  
They put it in the car trunk  
And they bring it back home  
And I say...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm tired of looking out the windows of the airplane  
I'm tired of traveling, I want to be somewhere.  
It's not even worth talking  
About those people down there.  
  
Goo Goo Ga Ga Ga  
Goo Goo Ga Ga Ga

I'm writing 'bout the  
Book I read  
I have to sing about the  
Book I read  
I'm embarrassed to admit it hit the soft spot in my heart  
When I found out you wrote the  
Book I read so  
  
Take my shoulders as they touch your arms  
I'm a little cautious but I feel alright  
The Book I read was in your eyes oh oh  
  
Oh... I'm living in the future.  
I feel wonderful.  
I'm tipping over backwards  
I'm so ambitious  
I'm looking back I'm  
Running a race and you're the book I read so  
  
Feel my fingers as they  
Touch your arms  
I'm spinning around but I feel alright  
The book I read was in your eyes  
  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oooooh... I'm living in the future  
I feel wonderful  
I'm tipping over backwards  
I'm so ambitious  
I'm looking back I'm  
Running a race and you're the books I read so  
  
Feel my fingers as they touch you arms I'm  
Spinning around and I feel alright  
The book I read was in your eyes  
  
Na na na na na... na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na

Monkey see and monkey do  
Ma king babies, eating food  
Smelly things, pubic hair  
Words of love, in the air  
Sparks fly, shoo ting out  
Ma king sure that everything is working  
I can't turn you down  
We are programmed happy little children  
Matter over mind  
We can not resist so I won't fight it  
Love is a machine  
Love is a machine without a driver  
The facts of life  
The facts of life  
A masterpiece  
Biology  
Smokey water  
Air conditioned  
Boys 'n' girls  
And automation  
Chromosomes  
Designer jeans  
Chimpanzees  
And human beings  
Machines of love  
Machines of love  
Strong in body, strong in mind  
A love machine with the facts of life  
The facts of life  
The facts of life  
So much sex 'n' violence  
Must be a bad design  
We're stupid to be fighting  
Every night  
The monsters we create  
They welcome us aboard  
The best in advertising  
From coast to coast  
The girls and boys combine  
Like monkeys in the zoo  
The clouds have silver linings  
Looks pretty good  
People fall in love like in fairy tales  
I'm not sure I like, what they can do  
I'm afraid that God has no master plan  
He only takes -- what he can use  
Factory life, ice cream and pie  
Factory life  
Someday we'll live on Venus  
And men will walk on Mars  
But we will still be monkeys  
Down deep inside  
If chimpanzees are smart  
Then we will close our eyes  
And let our instincts guide us  
Oh oh oh oh no

The girls don't want to play like that,  
They just want to talk to the boys.  
The just want to do what is in their hearts,  
And the girls want to be with the girls.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And the boys say, "What do you mean?"  
And the boys say, "What do you mean?"  
Well there is just no love,  
When there's boys and girls.  
And the girls want to be with the girls,  
And the girls want to be with the girls.  
  
Girls want things that make common sense,  
The best for all concerned.  
They don't want to have to go out of their way,  
And the girls want to be with the girls.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girls are getting into abstract analysis,  
They want to make intuitive leap.  
They are making plans that have far reaching effects.  
And the girls want to be with the girls.  
  
[Chorus]

Last time she jumped out the window,  
Well, she only turned and smiled.  
You might think she would say something,  
But you'd have to wait a while.  
  
Well the lady don't mind.  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind  
She just turns her head and disappears,  
I kinda like that style  
  
Little boat that floats on a river,  
it's drifting through a haze  
She stops by whenever she wants to,  
well, there she goes again  
  
Well, it's no trouble at all.  
No, no, no trouble at all  
Well, what she does  
Is all right with me, and  
I kinda like that style  
  
Come on. come on. I go up and down.  
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.  
It's like make believe.  
Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying.  
I'm not lost but I don't know  
Where I am. I got a question.  
All right. All right.  
This is what we like.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What I'm thinking  
  
She says love is not what she's after,  
And everyone knows.  
Each time she looks in the mirror,  
She lets her feelings show.  
  
Well, the lady don't mind  
No, no, no, the lady don't mind.  
Well, what she says is all right by me,  
And I kinda like that style  
  
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again  
I don't know, I don't know,  
What I'm sayin'.  
Hey man. Hey man.  
I sure don't feel the same  
She likes to say what she's feeling  
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.  
I know you think so.  
Come on. Come on. She says anything.  
Who knows, who knows,  
What she's thinking.

A terrible signal  
Too weak to even recognize  
A gentle collapsing  
The removal of the insides  
  
I'm touched by your pleas  
I value these moments  
We're order than we realize  
...in someone's eyes  
  
A frequent returning  
And leaving unnoticed  
A condition of mercy  
A change in the weather  
  
A view to remember  
The center is missing  
They question how the future lies  
...in someone's eyes  
The gentle collapsing  
Of every surface  
We travel on the quiet road  
...the overload

Home is where I want to be  
Pick me up and turn me around  
I feel numb, born with a weak heart  
Guess I must be having fun  
  
The less we say about it the better  
Make it up as we go along  
Feet on the ground, head in the sky  
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing  
  
I got plenty of time  
You got light in your eyes  
And you're standing here beside me  
I love the passing of time  
Never for money, always for love  
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight  
  
Home, is where I want to be  
But I guess I'm already there  
I come home, she lifted up her wings  
I guess that this must be the place  
  
I can't tell one from the other  
I find you, or you find me?  
There was a time before we were born  
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be  
  
We drift in and out  
Sing into my mouth  
Out of all those kinds of people  
You got a face with a view  
  
I'm just an animal looking for a home  
And share the same space for a minute or two  
And you love me till my heart stops  
Love me till I'm dead  
  
Eyes that light up  
Eyes look through you  
Cover up the blank spots  
Hit me on the head

Big and I'm bad  
And I want you to know  
I hand around  
Where the grass is greener  
Totally naked, baby  
Totally nude  
'Cause if I want to  
Who's gonna stop me?  
I'm absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
'Cause I'm a nature boy  
  
Locked up inside  
You can't tell me where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
Rocks and trees and physical culture  
Some days you hide  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
We got a life that's undiscovered  
  
We threw it all away  
Throw it all away  
Rolling every way  
It's irresponsible  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered  
  
I'm a little fish and you're the river  
Living in a boat that's underwater  
We can tip, tip, tip it over  
You can push, push, make it better now  
Wake your daddy up  
It's a quarter to five  
Our little boat  
Has lost it's rudder  
Dive to the bottom  
And we never come up  
  
A polka party  
For Bob and Martha  
I'm absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
'Cause I'm a nature boy  
Think what you like  
This is really where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
We don't need clothes and we don't need money  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered

Wait, wait for the moment to come  
Stand up, stand up and take my hand  
Believe, believe in mystery  
Love, love is simple as one, two, three  
  
I'm a know-it-all, I'm smartest man around  
That's right, you learn real fast through the smartest girl in town  
So here come a riddle, here come a clue  
If you were really smart, you'd know what to do  
When I say  
  
Jump back, sit back, get back, relax  
It's okay  
I've called in sick I won't go to  
Work today  
I'd rather be with the  
One I love  
I neglect my duties, I be in trouble but  
  
I've been to college, I've been to school  
I've met the people that you read about in books  
Here come a riddle, here come a clue  
If you were really smart you'd know what to do when I say  
Jet pilot gone out of control, ship captain on the ground  
Stock broker make a bad investment when love has come to town  
  
Where, where is my common sense?  
How did I get in a jam like this?  
Believe, I believe in mystery  
Love, love love love is simple as one-two-three  
  
Here come a riddle, here come a clue  
If you were really smart, you'd know what to do when I say  
Why am I going out of my head, whenever you're around?  
The answer is obvious, love has come to town

I...I am just a number  
I...hang on to what I got  
You...say what you want to  
I...I...I...I just try to stay alive  
I...put myself together  
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in  
Life, life without surrender  
Togetherness...ecstasy is what I need  
I can laugh, but I should cry  
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes  
  
[Chorus]  
(And I said) Walk it down. Talk it down.  
(oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.  
Somebody will take you there.  
Walk it down. Talk it down.  
(oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.  
Somebody will take you there.  
  
She...says she remembers.  
Time...long time ago.  
We...belong together.  
I...I...I...I turn up the radio  
Lies, lies and propaganda  
I...gonna tell you what I need  
Life, life, without surrender  
Togetherness...ecstasy is what I need  
I got yours and you got mine  
And I can swim, but I should fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't no crime to believe  
I took my money, I bet my life  
What you see is what you get  
But it sure ain't what we need.  
  
[Chorus]

Warning sign, warning sign,  
I see it but I pay it no mind.  
Hear my voice, hear my voice,  
It's saying something and I hope you're concentrating  
I've got money now, I've got money now,  
C'mon baby, c'mon baby.  
  
Warning sign of things to come (take it over, take it over)  
Someone's talking on my telephone (when we're older, when we're older)  
Hear my voice, move my hair.  
I move it around a lot, but I don't care. (what I remember)  
  
Warning sign, warning sign,  
Look at my hair, I like the design.  
It's the truth, it's the truth.  
Your glassy eyes and your open mouth  
Take it easy, take it easy,  
It's a natural thing and you have to relax,  
I've got money now, I've got money now.  
C'mon baby, c'mon baby.  
Warning sign, of things to come (turn me over, turn me over)  
Love is here but I guess it's gone now (hurry up babe, hurry up babe),  
Hear my voice, move my hair.  
I move it around a lot, but I don't care.  
  
Do you remember  
What it is that you remember  
Baby remember  
Baby remember.

Well, I'm dressed up so nice  
An' I'm doin' my best  
An' I'm startin' over...  
I'm startin' over in another place  
  
Lemme tell you a story  
Big chief with a golden crown  
He's got rings on his fingers  
And then he walks up, up to the throne  
  
He's makin' shapes with his hands  
An' don't choo dare sit back  
Now don't choo dare sit down  
And don't choo dare speak up!  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh who could've asked for more?  
And on the second day, there was nothing else left to do  
Ooh what a day that was.  
  
There are fifty thousand beggars  
Roaming in the streets  
They have lost all their possessions  
They have nothing left to eat  
  
Down come a bolt of lightning  
Start an electrical storm  
Starts a chain reaction  
Go pull a fire alarm  
  
I'm dreaming of a city  
It was my own invention  
I put the wheels in motion  
A time for big decisions  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day, there was nothing else at all  
Ooh what a day that was.  
  
Oh a day that was  
Ooh that's the way it goes  
There's a million ways- to get things done  
There's a million ways- to make things work out.  
  
Well I'm going right through  
And the light came down  
Well they're roundin' 'em up  
From all over town  
  
They're movin' forward and backwards  
They're movin' backwards and front  
And they're enjoying themselves  
Moving in ev'ry direction  
  
And if you feel like you're in a whirlpool  
You feel like going home  
You feel like talking to someone  
Who know the difference between right and wrong  
  
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand  
Ooh and then we let it fall  
And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all  
Ooh what a day that was.  
(We're go(in') boom boom boom That's the way we live  
And in a great big room and That's the way we live.) x3

Who is it who  
Who is it who  
Who is it who  
Who is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
Oh...Baby it's you!  
  
Who is it who  
Who is it who  
Who is it who  
Who is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
Oh...Oh baby it's you!  
  
Watch out now baby 'cause I'm in love with you  
Watch out now baby 'cause I'm in love with you  
And if you don't love me I don't know what I'm going to do!  
  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
Who, who, who is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
What is it  
Oh...Baby it's you!

It's just a look, and it makes the boys quiver.  
Yes, it's just the look, and now they remember.  
Had they forgotten ... what this all means?  
I think they want to forget,  
And they hope that this time.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I won't look, I've got other things to do now.  
I forgot what it was, I've got to get to work now.  
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!).  
It can happen to me too.  
(And it) didn't make any difference to us (But I)  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble.  
With our love,  
With our love,  
With our love  
They hear the words, such as "You're really special"  
(And they) can't face the feeling.  
(And they) can't really tell  
I look out the window,  
(And I) I call that education.  
(And I) See all my friends standing out there  
(And I) I call that education (sophistication)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Had the forgotten...what this all means?  
Things come and go (and I see 'em)  
And I won't be neglected (not this time!)
