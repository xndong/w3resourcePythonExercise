Underneath the lantern  
By the barrack gate  
Darling I remember  
The way you used to wait  
'Twas there that you whispered tenderly  
That you loved me  
You'd always be  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Time would come for roll call  
Time for us to part  
Darling I'd caress you  
And press you to my heart  
And there neath that far off lantern light  
I'd hold you tight  
We'd kiss good night  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Orders came for sailing  
Somewhere over there  
All confined to barracks  
'Twas more than I could bear  
I knew you were waiting in the street  
I heard your feet  
But could not meet  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
  
Resting in our billet  
Just behind the line  
Even though we're parted  
Your lips are close to mine  
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed  
Your sweet face seems  
To haunt my dreams  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene  
My Lili of the lamplight  
My own Lili Marlene.

We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day  
Keep smiling through,  
Just like you always do  
Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away  
  
So will you please say "Hello"  
To the folks that I know  
Tell them I won't be long  
They'll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go  
I was singing this song  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where  
Don't know when.  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.  
Keep smiling through  
Just like you always do,  
'Til the blue skies  
Drive the dark clouds far away  
So will you please say"Hello"  
To the folks that I know.  
Tell them it won't be long.  
They'll be happy to know  
That as you saw me go,  
I was singin' this song.  
  
We'll meet again,  
Don't know where,  
Don't know when  
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

Yours 'til the stars lose their glory  
Yours 'til the birds fail to sing  
Yours to the end of life's story  
This pledge to you dear, I bring  
  
Yours in the grey of December  
Here or on far distant shores  
  
I've never loved anyone the way I love you  
How could I, when I was born to be  
Just yours  
  
This night has music, the sweetest music  
It echoes somewhere within my heart  
I hold you near me, oh darling hear me  
I have a message I must impart  
  
Just yours  
When I was born to be just yours
