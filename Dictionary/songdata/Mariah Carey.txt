Hmmm  
How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking  
Every breath with you ohhhh  
You're the only one  
Who really knew me at all  
  
How can you just walk away from me  
When all I can do is watch you leave  
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain  
And even shared the tears  
You're the only one  
Who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
'Cause there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
So take a look at me now  
'Cause there's just an empty space  
And you coming back to me is against the odds  
And that's what I've got to face  
  
I wish I could just make you turn around  
Turn around and see me cry  
There's so much I need to say to you  
So many reasons why  
You're the only one  
Who really knew me at all  
  
So take a look at me now  
'Cause there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me  
Just the memory of your face  
So Take a look at me now  
So there's just an empty space  
But to wait for you  
Is All I can do  
When that's what I've got to face  
  
Take a good look at me now  
'Cause l'll still be standing (standing here)  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
That's the chance I've got to take  
  
Yeahh yeah yeah  
Take A look at me now  
(Take A Look at me now)

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There's just one thing I need  
I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true...  
All I want for Christmas  
Is you...  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need (and I)  
I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree

There upon the fireplace (aahh)  
Santa Clause won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day

I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the north pole for Saint Nick (aahh)  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ohh)  
Holding on to me so tight(Ohh)  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for christmas is you  
You Baby...  
  
Oh all the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere (so brightly baby)  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air (Ohh)  
  
And everyone is singing (Oh yea)  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me...  
  
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for (aahh)  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
  
Oh I just want you for my own (ohh)  
More than you could ever know (ohh)  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You Baby  
  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby

Come closer  
You seem so far away  
There's something I know you need to say  
I feel your emotions  
  
When I look in your eyes  
Your silence  
Whispering misunderstandings  
There's so much you need to realize  
You'll feel my emotions if you look in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey darlin'  
I know you think my love is slipping away  
But baby it's all in your mind  
Don't worry  
  
Hold on tight and hear me when I say  
Baby it's all in your mind  
  
Believe me I believe in you  
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do  
Move closer my darling  
Feel the love in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you feel my love  
In your mind... yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby it's all in your mind  
Baby it's all in your mind  
Baby it's all in your mind  
Got to let you know baby  
  
Baby it's all in your mind  
You know my love is good now baby yeah  
Baby it's all in your mind  
Baby it's all in your mind  
  
Yeah darling  
Baby it's all in your mind  
Baby it's all in your mind [Repeat until fade]

If you only know  
What I feel for you  
If you only lived for me  
The way I live for you  
I'd be in heaven  
My dreams would come true  
  
'Cause all I've ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All I've ever wanted  
Is you  
  
If you were my own  
To caress and hold  
I would shower you with love  
And drown within your soul  
Because I live and breathe for you  
And I really need you to know  
  
That all I've ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All I've ever wanted  
Is you  
  
Everything I do is for you  
You are every part of me  
And I don't want to face  
Another day  
Alone  
Without our love  
  
'Cause all I've ever wanted  
Is you  
And you alone  
And I love you so  
More than you could ever know  
All I've ever wanted  
Is you

I've been waiting for someone  
To come into my life  
Who would bring me joy  
And give me pleasure  
  
I have taken chances on  
Romances once or twice  
And I found that in my heart  
It's you I treasure  
  
You and only you can  
Make me feel the way I do  
You and only you can  
Make it better  
  
You and only you can  
Do the freaky things you do  
And I'm so into you and  
That's forever and ever  
  
All my life  
My love's been  
Waiting for you  
All my life  
My heart's been waiting too  
  
All my life  
  
I've been wishing  
On a star  
I've been praying  
On my knees  
  
I've got some sly and  
Sexy tricks to show you  
Most of all  
I'll give you anything  
  
Boy that you need  
To keep you right  
Here by my side  
I know you  
I'll show you  
  
You and only you can  
Make me feel the way I do  
You and only you can  
Make it better  
  
You and only you can  
Do the freaky things you do  
And I'm so into you and  
That's forever and ever  
  
All my life  
My love's been  
Waiting for you  
All my life  
  
My heart's been waiting too  
Don't you know I need you  
And adore you  
All my life  
I'll give to only you

Hey, hey  
You're almost home  
You're almost home  
You're almost home  
  
I've seen the light in the sky  
In the skies are like fireflies  
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark  
  
I've held hope in my two hands  
That there would be another chance  
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart  
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you run, run so far  
You've forgotten who you are  
Where you're from, it's like some other universe  
You count your steps, like they're regrets  
You catch one breath then lose the rest  
Wrong is right, right is left  
And there's nowhere left to turn  
  
So don't believe in everything  
You think, you think you know  
  
When you're almost there  
And you're almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
When you're almost there, almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you let your heart be the compass  
You won't get lost, not if you trust it  
When you hear the sound of the trumpet  
Louder than ever before  
  
Oh, when you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Cause you're almost there  
Almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home  
  
When you're almost there  
Almost home  
Just open up your eyes and go, go  
Almost there  
You're almost home  
Know you're not alone  
You're almost home

[Chorus]  
Swept me away  
But now I'm lost in the dark  
Set me on fire  
But now I'm left with a spark  
Alone you got beyond the haze and  
I'm lost inside the maze  
I guess I'm all alone in love  
  
I look into your eyes  
You turn the other way  
And now I realize  
It's all a game you play  
I hold you in the night  
And wake to find you gone  
You're running out of sight  
It's so hard holding on  
All alone in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You haunt me in my dreams  
I'm calling out your name  
I watch you fade away  
Your love is not the same  
I've figured out your style  
To quickly drift apart  
You held me for a while  
Planned it from the start  
All alone in love  
  
Sitting in the dark without you  
How am I supposed to make it  
Through the night  
Slowly fall apart without you  
Cry away the hours  
Till the morning light  
  
[Chorus]

We were as one babe  
For a moment in time  
And it seemed everlasting  
That you would always be mine  
Now you wanna be free

Shattered dreams  
Cut through my mind  
Tragically our love has died  
Memories confine my head  
Bitterly I face the end  
  
Trustingly  
I gave myself to you  
I let you inside  
Believing your lies  
  
[Chorus]  
And you don't remember  
Every time you told me  
You were mine for ever  
For eternity  
And you don't remember  
How you used to hold me  
How we'd melt together  
How you needed me  
How we used to be  
In love  
  
Stranded here  
In nothingness  
With only tears  
And loneliness  
  
Foolishly  
I gave my soul to you  
I let you inside  
Believing your lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Helplessly  
I fell so deep  
I was so naive  
To let you in  
Why did I let you in  
To my heart  
  
And you don't remember  
Anything that you told me  
You were mine forever  
For eternity  
I know you don't remember  
How you used to hold me  
How we'd melt together  
Together  
How you needed me  
How we used to be  
In love

I shouldn't have walked away  
I would've stayed if you'd say  
We could've made everything okay, but we just  
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport  
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground  
  
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall  
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor  
Super natural love conquers all, remember we  
Used to touch the sky  
And lighting don't strike  
The same place twice, when you and I,  
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry  
True love's a gift,  
But we let it drift in a storm  
Every night I feel the angels cry  
  
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?  
Bring it back and we gon' make it right  
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Limitless omnipresent, kind of love  
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear  
In a whirlwind  
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling  
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow  
  
I know I can stand just pull me back up  
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us  
I'm willing to live and die for our love  
Baby, we can get back that shine  
  
'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice  
When you and I, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry  
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm  
Every night, I feel the angels cry  
  
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived  
Bring it back and we gon' make it right  
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive  
As the angels cry  
  
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (Don't let our love)  
We gotta ride it through,  
I'm reaching for you (Baby I'm missin' you)  
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (You can)  
We gotta ride it through, (We gotta ride it)  
I'm reaching for you (And I'm gonna say)  
  
Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice  
You and I, said goodbye, felt the angels cry  
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip, in a storm  
Every night, I feel the angels cry,  
Oh babe don't let the angels cry

It's 2:11 and I'm stressing  
Watching T.V in my hotel suite  
I check my service every second  
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me  
  
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone  
Turned on in my purse by the bed  
And before I fall asleep  
I guess I'll just check my machine  
  
Again and again because I'm  
Obsessing on you  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Zoning out thinking about  
You and me between the sheets  
I want to get intimate  
But you're not within my reach  
  
So I'll have a little more wine  
And I'll try to drink you  
Out of my head  
And I'll lay awake awhile  
  
'Til I'm high enough I can  
Forget about you until  
I wake up again  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
ome lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
Slipping into dreams  
I feel my love surround you  
Ny subconscious seems  
To weave itself around you  
  
Do you care for me  
Beyond idolization  
Tell me how you feel  
But don't keep me at bay  
  
'Cause I won't be waiting long  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
  
You want to be my babydoll  
  
I want to be your babydoll  
Wrap me up nice and tight  
Love me through the night  
Come lay me down  
  
Enfold me in your arms  
Cover me with velvet kisses  
Rock me on and on  
And whisper softly to me  
You want to be my babydoll

Touch me baby  
It feels so amazing  
And you stimulate me  
And you make me want you  
More and more  
  
What do I do  
What do I say  
Does it feel good  
To you this way I wanna be  
All that you need  
Boy what's your fantasy?  
Setter hold on, ready or not  
Baby my love ain't gonna stop  
Take it down low  
Make me get high  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh my love goes  
On and on and on and on and on  
My love goes  
On and on and on and on and on [Repeat x2]  
See, all my love's for you  
  
Baby don't you rush me, no  
You got to take it slow  
Just let the feeling grow  
Until it overflows  
Anyway you want it now  
Just gotta tell me how  
To give you everything  
You've even dared to dream  
  
Isn't it bliss  
To you right now  
Don't be subdued  
Say it out loud  
Ain't it a sweet  
Luscious delight  
When you're immersed in my  
Ocean of love  
  
Coming on strong  
Baby I've been waiting so long  
Revel inside of paradise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So  
Gimme some pure delectable love  
Like I'm gonna give to you  
Keep coming around  
Cause I won't run out  
I can't get enough of you  
My love goes on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All my love's for you

I can't help it  
When I'm not around you (Boy)  
'Cause all I ever seem to  
Do is drift away  
In dreams about you  
'Cause when I'm without you (Boy)  
It always seems like  
Part of me is missing baby  
  
Sometimes I don't call  
Like I don't care at all  
But secretly, you're the only thing  
That lifts me up  
And makes me smile  
When I'm unhappy  
All you gotta do is call  
And suddenly things don't really  
Seem so bad at all  
  
(Boy) I need you  
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)  
Gotta have you (Oh boy)  
I wanna feel your touch  
This ain't no little crush  
So come and get my love  
Baby anything you want  
Feeling you (Boy)  
Fiending for you (Boy)  
Just waiting on you (Boy)  
When I see you (Oh boy)  
I'm gonna wrap you up  
Inside my love  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy  
  
My heart races when  
My Motorola beeps  
Or my cell rings  
I just make a wish and if it's you  
My whole day changes  
'Cause when I know  
You're thinking of me (Boy)  
Heaven knows  
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby  
  
Sometimes I don't call  
Like I don't care at all  
But secretly, you're the only thing  
That lifts me up  
And makes me smile  
When I'm unhappy  
All you gotta do is call  
And suddenly things don't really  
Seem so bad at all  
  
(Boy) I need you  
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)  
Gotta have you (Oh boy)  
I wanna feel your touch  
This ain't no little crush  
So come and get my love  
Baby anything you want  
Feeling you (Boy)  
Fiending for you (Boy)  
Just waiting on you (Boy)  
When I see you (Oh boy)  
I'm gonna wrap you up  
Inside my love  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy  
  
I... (What?)  
Need... (Who?)  
You... (Uh huh, uh huh)  
I wanna feel your touch... (Why wouldn't you)  
So come and get my love (Show me where it's at - now sing)  
I... (What?)  
Need... (Who?)  
You... (Uh huh, uh huh)  
I'm gonna wrap you up (Wrap me up)  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy (Never let me go, girl)  
  
(Boy) I need you  
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)  
Gotta have you (Oh boy)  
I wanna feel your touch  
This ain't no little crush  
So come and get my love  
Baby anything you want  
Feeling you (Boy)  
Fiending for you (Boy)  
Just waiting on you (Boy)  
When I see you (Oh boy)  
I'm gonna wrap you up  
Inside my love  
And never let you go boy  
Never let you go boy

Krayzie:  
  
Break break down,  
Steady breakin me on down, break break down,  
Steady breakin me on down,  
Break break down, steady breakin me on down,  
Break break down, steady breakin me on down.  
  
Mariah:  
  
You called yesterday to basicallly say  
That you care for me,  
But that you're just not in love  
Immediately I pretended  
To be feeling similarly  
And led you to believe it was O. K  
To just walk away from the one thing  
That's unyielding and sacred to me  
  
Chorus:  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath a disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Mariah:  
  
So what do you do  
When somebody you're so devoted to  
Suddenly just stops loving you  
And it seems they haven't got a clue  
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through  
Do you cling to your pride  
And sing "I will survive"  
Do you lash out and say "How dare you leave this way?"  
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away  
  
Wish:  
  
Yeah, c' mon, yeah, c' mon, c' mon  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath the disguise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry  
  
Wish:  
  
It'll break you down  
Only if you let it  
Everday crazy situations rocking my mind  
Tryin' to break me down  
But I won't let it  
Forget it (forget it)  
  
Krayzie:  
  
I be feelin' like you bringing me down  
Taking me around  
Stressin' me out  
I think I better go and get out  
And let me release some stress (stress)  
  
Wish:  
  
Don't ever wanna feel no pain (pain)  
Hoping for the sun  
But it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)  
Lord, I just wanna maintain  
  
Krayzie:  
  
Yeah, I can feel pressures ya'll  
But never the less  
Krayzie won't fall  
It's over, it's ending here (here)  
  
Well I guess I'm trying to be  
Nonchalant about it  
And I'm going to extremes to prove  
I'm fine without you  
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind  
Underneath the guise of a smile  
Gradually I'm dying inside  
Friends ask me how I feel  
And I lie convincingly  
Cause I don't want to reveal  
The fact that I'm suffering  
So I wear my disguise  
Till I go home at night  
And turn down all the lights  
And then I break down and cry

Gypsy, sittin lookin pretty  
A broken rose and laughin' eyes  
You're a mystery  
Always runnin' wild  
Like a child without a home  
You're always searchin'  
Searchin for a feelin'  
But it's easy come and easy go  
  
Oh - I'm sorry but it's true  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Takin all the best of me  
Oh can't you see  
You got the best of me  
Whoah can't you see  
  
CHORUS 1:  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Bringin' on the heartache  
Can't you see  
Oh  
  
You're such a secret  
Misty eyed and shady  
Baby, how you hold the key  
Oh, you're like a candle  
Your flame slowly fadin'  
Burnin' out and burnin' me  
Can't you see  
Just tryin' to say to you  
  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Takin all the best of me  
Oh can't you see  
You got the best of me  
Oh can't you see  
  
CHORUS 2:  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Bringin' on the heartache  
Can't you see  
Can't you see  
  
No  
No  
No-  
  
You got the best of me  
Oh can't you see  
You got the best of me  
Oh can't you see  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
  
CHORUS 3:  
You're bringin on the heartbreak  
You're bringin on the heartache  
  
REPEAT

When you love someone so deeply  
They become your life  
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside  
Blindly I imagined I could  
Keep you under glass  
Now I understand to hold you  
I must open up my hands  
And watch you rise  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were meant to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
I have learned that beauty  
Has to flourish in the light  
Wild horses run unbridled  
Or their spirit dies  
You have given me the courage  
To be all that I can  
And truly feel your heart will  
Lead you back to me when you're  
Ready to land  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
I can't pretend these tears  
Aren't over flowing steadily  
I can't prevent this hurt from  
Almost overtaking me  
ButI will stand and say goodbye  
For you'll never be mine  
Until you know the way it feels to fly  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
Chorus:  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Fly abandonedly into the sun  
If you should return to me  
We truly were ment to be  
So spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly  
  
So flutter through the sky  
Butterfly  
Spread your wings and fly  
Butterfly

(Jay-Z):  
Everytime  
The guns goes blast  
Another day goes past  
I don't miss my dogs  
I'm wishing the days  
Could go fast  
So I could crash  
Close my eyes  
Try to go to sleep  
And bring you back but  
I can't bring you back  
(Nah can't bring you back)  
So I back  
Back memories of us  
Acting bad  
Wish time could freeze  
But time is up  
And I promise ya  
Imma hold it down  
Till it's my time  
To leave and I'm ok  
I mean  
Am allright not ok  
And it hurts my soul  
I won't see your face  
But if you truely  
Are in a better place  
Like what say  
And that's ok  
I'll be allright  
I've been up all night  
Like if I didn't  
With my nigga to be living  
With the time  
Tick-tick-ticking away  
So forever I'm forever  
I'm in search of yesterday  
(Yesterday)  
Like a beattle song  
I close my eyes  
Repeat the song  
Tryna bring us back  
To where we belong  
Middle of the club  
When be was on I tear  
The song blowing on  
Going back before  
So when I meet the don you  
Should know I meet way back  
With my dog when I go  
So when times says goodbye  
Y'all say hello  
  
(Mariah):  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
(Jay-Z):  
Rock with me  
Mc come one  
  
(Mariah):  
And you never got the chance  
To see how good I've done  
And you never got to see me  
Back at number one  
I wish that you were here  
To celebrate together  
I wish that we could spend  
The holidays together  
  
I remember when you used  
To tuck me in at night  
With the Teddy Bear  
You gave to me  
That I held so tight  
I thought you  
Were so strong  
That you can make it  
Through whatever  
It's so hard  
To accept the fact  
You're gone forever  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
I wish I could find a way  
Try not to cry  
As time goes by  
And soon as you reach  
A better place  
Still I'll give  
The whole world  
To see your face  
And I'm right here  
Next to you  
It feels like you  
Gone too soon  
The hardest thing to do  
Is say bye, bye  
  
Bye, bye (3x)  
Bye, bye  
  
This is for my people's  
Who just lost somebody  
Your best friend, your baby  
Your man or your lady  
Put your hand way up high  
(Put em up, put em up)  
We will never say bye  
(No, no, no)  
Mamma's, daddy's, sisters  
Brothers, friends and cousins  
This is for my people's  
Who lost their grandmothers  
Lift your head to the sky  
(Lift it up lift it up)  
Cause we will never  
Say bye, bye  
  
Never knew  
I could hurt like this  
(I never knew it)  
And everyday  
Life goes on like  
(Everyday of my life I wish)  
I wish I could  
Talk to you for awhile  
(I wish)  
Miss you  
But I try not to cry  
As time goes by  
(I wish, I wish  
I wish as time goes by)  
And as soon  
As you reached  
A better place  
Still I'll give the world  
To see your face  
And we were here  
Next to you  
It feels  
Like you're gone too soon  
Now the hardest thing  
To do  
Is say bye, bye  
  
(It's hard to say  
Bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye  
So come on  
Somebody sing it with me  
Wave your hands up high  
Hey, hey  
This if for my people's  
Who just lost somebody  
So this is for everybody  
You put your hand to the sky  
Cause we will never say bye, bye)

I still remember  
That hazy September  
I've been waiting for somebody like you  
To come back around  
  
We would walk in the park  
Every Saturday  
Brand new  
All in love  
Kissing time away  
You was all up on me  
It was plain to see  
That I was your girl  
Way back when it was the simple thing  
Anklets, Nameplates  
That you gave to me  
Sweet tarts, Ring pops, and that candy bling  
And you were my world  
  
Now I wish I could go back and make time stop  
I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
Were not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
It was everything that I could do  
To stay awake  
And I often reminisce  
About the games we played  
It was Tag, Chess, Spin The Bottle  
Then butterflies would last till tomorrow  
Then the lights came on  
I had to run right home  
  
And now I wish I  
Could go back and my time stop  
And I would take this love throwback from the top  
Go DJ play my song  
And I'm a think about you all night long  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I still wishing we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby  
  
I'm a see Mimi  
Felt the need to change me  
Butterfly flow  
Like Mohamed Ali  
Wish I can bring you back  
Like the O.D.B  
Thinkin' bout the world  
Plus me you and Jack  
No matter what I do  
Well the memories are stacked  
Thinkin' tenth grade  
Thinkin' 'bout eleventh  
When you went doggy fresh  
All the way to heaven heaven heaven  
  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I sit and wish we was in one again  
Back in the days we were in love  
We're not in love anymore  
But some days  
I still wishing we was in one again  
  
It was personal things we would do  
Things we were to  
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school  
Now I'm back to the future missing you  
  
My sweet baby  
My sweet thang  
Like candy  
Felt like real love  
Not just play play  
Missing you  
My sweet baby

There you are holding her hand  
I am lost  
Dying to understand  
Didn't I cherish you right  
Don't you know you were my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Even though I try I can't let go  
Something in your eyes  
Captured my soul  
And every night I see you in my dreams  
You're all I know  
I can't let go  
  
Just cast aside  
You don't even know I'm alive  
You just walk on by  
Don't care to see me cry  
And here I am  
Still holding on  
I can't accept  
My world is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside  
Everyday of my life  
Do you know the way it feels  
When all you have just dies  
I try and try to deny that I need you  
But still you remain on my mind  
  
No I just can't get you out of my mind  
I never can say goodbye  
'Cause every night  
I see you in my dreams  
  
You're all I know  
I can't let you go  
Even though I try  
I can't let go of something I need so badly  
You're all I know  
I can't let go

Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry  
Maybe I didn't leave much  
Between us, That day  
And maybe I shouldn't have told you  
I loved you, Played the game  
And now I understand  
Wish I could have you back  
And kiss you so and feel your hands on me  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down  
And cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
And maybe I didn't give you Your space back then  
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer  
But I was seduced by you  
And I didn't know enough truly to enchanted to disregard the words you said  
To make me yours  
Need to hold you til we both  
Till we both break down  
(Break down)  
Till we both breakdown  
(I should have known you were tired of me)  
Till we both break down  
Till we both break down and cry  
  
Oh my love  
Imprudently I left every cell in me  
So naked  
Somewhere at the core of you  
Blasts us off  
I just need you to win boy  
Till we both breakdown  
I'm just saying  
Till we both break down  
Might as well tell the truth about the battle  
Till we both break down  
Yes I, guess it's selfish of me to just expect I'm entitled to heaven  
Till we both break down  
But tonight, all I wanna do is hold you tight  
Till we both break down  
And cry, cry, cry, cry  
Till we both break down  
And cry  
Till we both break down  
And cry

It's so sweet  
In my daydreams  
  
Every night you creep into my dreams  
Fantasy  
It's so deep but it's a fantasy  
Every night you creep into my dream  
  
It's so real  
(In my daydreams)  
It's just a sweet  
It's just a sweet  
  
(In my daydreams)  
It seems so real  
You touch me  
You come into my room  
  
Come to me  
It's just a fantasy  
It feels so sweet  
But it's just not real  
Oh baby, it's just a sweet fantasy  
  
And daydream is all that I can do  
I feel raptured over you  
In silence, I keep it to myself  
Come take me  
I don't want nobody else  
  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
  
And it's deep  
I feel really deep  
It's just a sweet  
It's just a sweet  
  
You're like the kiss of life  
You're like the kiss of life  
Beaming in the sky  
  
Oh you're just a fantasy  
Oh baby, you come into my room  
Yeah, but you're just a fantasy

I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you  
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own  
Oh baby you know, all that love-making we did  
Boy it was so real I wanna feel that again  
Long lost friend from way back when Kennedy was president  
Tell me where the melody went  
And if you still care, say yeah yeah  
Sing it like they used to do  
This one's for me and you  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, make love that's how to do it  
Just like we did back then  
Well, this is dedicated to you  
  
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you  
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own  
Oh baby you know, that love-making we did  
Boy it was so real I wanna feel that again  
And all your friends from way back then  
Saying can you visualize 36 chambers high  
Feels like we're there, yeah, yeah  
We were so afraid to say  
I hear them saying back to me  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, make love that's how you do it  
Just like we did it back then  
Well, this is dedicated to you  
  
[Nas]  
We all wish today's game was old again  
We just wish it wasn't full of draconian, Babylonian, phony men  
F-O-H, my summation fascinates  
We have debates, who's the greatest living or passed away  
I ask mc, see what she has to say  
Eric B or Master P  
Some see it differently, '87 meant to me  
I try to describe it, you try to relive it  
I try to revive it, hoping that you get it  
Somethin bout ladidadida got inside our bodies  
Somethin bout my adidas coming out the speakers  
Used to do the wop or the Peewee Herman  
Rest in peace, Heavy D, Money Earnin' Mount Vernon, let's go  
  
La di da di da di da  
That's how you do it  
That's how to make it okay  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
Oh baby you know, this is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you  
This is dedicated to you

When you took me out  
I knew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I guess I turned you on  
  
Now I bring you home  
You told me goodnight's not enough for you  
I'm sorry baby  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
No, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
You read me wrong  
I wasn't trying to lead you on  
Not like you think  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I know you  
Were expecting a one night stand  
When I refused  
I knew you wouldn't understand  
  
I told you twice  
I was only trying to be nice  
Only trying to be nice  
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
Babe now why should I  
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give  
Guilty 'cause I won't give in  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
Ooh, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
When I took you out  
Iknew what you were all about  
But when I did  
I didn't mean to turn you on  
No, I didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I didn't mean to turn you on...  
I didn't mean to turn you on...

(oo-oo, ahh) ooo-oo, woah  
(woah-oh-oh-oh) ahh-ah  
(do-do, do-do, do-do) do-do-do, yeah  
(do-do, do-do, do-do) oh-oh-oh  
  
I wonder if you think of me  
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind (ooo-oo)  
Although our love could never be  
I find I think about you all the time (mmm, baby)  
  
Am I in your fantasies?  
The way you always wander into mine (ooo-oo)  
And are you longing endlessly?  
Just like me, deep inside (oh baby, baby)  
  
When the nights are dark and cold  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
  
(oo-oo) I picture you embracing me  
We drift away and leave the world behind (baby)  
But it's only make-believe  
Love can be, so unkind (oh baby, baby, baby)  
  
When the nights are dark and cold (ooo)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone (ooo, baby)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me?  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (oh-oh-ooo)  
  
Hey, tell me babe, 'cause I need you babe  
Really want you baby, oh baby, and oh  
  
When the nights are dark and cold  
Do you think of me? (oh-oh) Do you think of me?  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? (woah) Do you think of me?  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (baby, baby, baby)  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? (you-oo) Do you think of me?  
  
When the nights are dark and cold (I, need you so much)  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (when I'm lying all alone baby)  
And when you're lying all alone  
Do you think of me? (oo-baby) Do you think of me? (tell me do you-oh-oh-oh)  
When you feel the touch of another love  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (baby, baby, baby, baby)  
Am I the one you're dreaming of?  
Do you think of me? Do you think of me? (yeh)  
  
'Cause I think about you baby, I'm lying all alone, yeh  
I think about you, yes I do

(Don't forget about us)  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
No baby, no baby, no baby no  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
My baby boy  
  
Just let it die  
With no goodbyes  
Details don't matter  
We both paid the price  
Tears in my eyes  
You know sometimes  
It'd be like that baby  
  
Now every time I see you  
I pretend I'm fine  
When I wanna reach out to you  
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride  
Baby I must confess  
We were bigger than anything  
Remember us at our best  
And don't forget about  
  
[Chorus]  
Late nights, playin' in the dark  
And wakin' up inside my arms  
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and  
I can see it in your eyes  
You still want it  
So don't forget about us  
I'm just speaking from experience  
Nothing can compare to your first true love  
So I hope this will remind you  
When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us  
  
Oh they say  
That you're in a new relationship  
But we both know  
Nothing comes close to  
What we had, it perseveres  
That we both can't forget it  
How good we used to get it  
  
There's only one me and you  
And how we used to shine  
No matter what you go through  
We are one, that's a fact  
That you can't deny  
So baby we just can't let  
The fire pass us by  
Forever we'd both regret  
So don't forget about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if she's got your head all messed up now  
That's the trickery  
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be  
I bet she can't do like me  
She'll never be M-C  
  
Baby don't you, don't you forget about us  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
No baby, no baby, no baby no  
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go  
  
When it's for real, it's forever  
So don't forget about us.

I need a lover to give me  
The kind of love  
That would last always  
I need somebody uplifting  
To take me away  
  
I want a lover who knows me  
Who understands how I feel inside  
Someone to comfort and hold me  
Through the long lonely nights  
Till the dawn  
Why don't you take me away  
  
[Chorus]  
Dreamlover come rescue me  
Take me up take me down  
Take me anywhere you want to baby now  
I need you so desperately  
Won't you please come around  
Cause I want to share forever with you baby  
  
I don't want another pretender  
To disillusion me one more time  
Whispering words of forever  
Playing with my mind  
  
I need someone to hold on to  
The kind of love that won't fly away  
I just want someone to belong to  
Everyday  
Of my life  
Always  
So come and take me away  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You've got me feeling emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
higher than the heavens above.  
I feel good, I feel nice.  
I've never felt so satisfied.  
I'm in love, I'm alive.  
Intoxicated, flying high.  
It feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly.

But I like the way I feel inside.  
You've got me feeling emotions deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.

It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly.  
I don't know if you're for real  
But I like the way I feel inside.

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of.  
Woh, oh.You've got me feeling emotions  
Higher than the heavens above.  
You've got me feeling higher.

You've got me feelin' emotions higher, higher  
I feel good, I feel nice  
I feel good, satisfied  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
I feel good, I feel nice  
I've never felt so satisfied  
I'm in love, I'm alive  
Intoxicated, flyin' high  
Feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly  
I don't know if it's real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
In the morning, when I rise  
You are the first thing on my mind  
And in the middle of the night  
I feel your heartbeat next to mine  
It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly  
I don't know if you're for real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
You've got me feelin' emotions

You make me feel so high, oh baby

Oh yeah, you've got me feelin' emotions  
Emotions, deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
Emotions, emotions  
You've got me feelin' higher  

My love  
There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's right  
My first love  
You're every breath I take  
You're every step I make  
  
And I  
I want to share  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)  
They tell me how much you care  
Oh, yes  
You'll always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
And forever  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
And I  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(No, you know I don't mind)  
And yes  
You mean the world to me  
I know I've found in you  
My endless love  
  
And love  
I'd play the fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
(Whoa, you know I don't mind)  
Oh, yes  
You'd be the only one  
'Cause no, I can't deny  
This love I have inside  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love (my love, my love)

It was overcast that day  
And I was feeling some kind of way  
I pulled the covers up over my head  
Tried reaching for you but that was then  
I can't forget  
My heart's hungover but ain't nothing different  
I close my eyes nothing but faded pictures of you, Of you  
  
Faded, baby, you're faded  
Baby, you're faded, faded  
  
You come and you go, you're just an echo  
  
Whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here  
So intangible, just like an echo  
Still trying to pretend it's possible  
To bring us back to life  
Boy we continue to subside  
Hanging over life on this rollescoaster ride  
I know your name baby sub consciously  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Boy you, boy you, faded, baby, you're faded  
Baby you're faded, faded  
Boy you just come and you go  
You come and you go  
You're just an echo  
Whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here  
So intangible, just like an echo  
Faded,  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Not there for me, not there for me  
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me  
Not there for me, not there for me

Oh, when you walk by every night  
Talking sweet and looking fine  
I get kinda hectic inside  
Mmm, baby I'm so into you  
Darling, if you only knew  
All the things that flow through my mind  
  
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby  
When I close my eyes  
You come and you take me  
It's so deep in my daydreams  
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby  
  
Images of rapture  
Creep into me slowly  
As you're going to my head  
And my heart beats faster  
When you take me over  
Time and time and time again

Don't be afraid to fly  
Spread your wings  
Open up the door  
So much more outside  
  
Don't be afraid to fly  
Come spread your wings  
And just fly  
Fly, fly, just fly, just fly  
Don't be afraid  
Don't let your spirit die  
She said...  
  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly  
Spread your wings and prepare to fly  
For you have become a butterfly

Somehow I know that  
There's a place up above  
With no more hurt and struggling  
Free of all atrocities and suffering  
Because I feel the unconditional love  
From one who cares enough for me  
To erase all my burdens  
And let me be free to...  
  
[Chorus]  
Fly like a bird  
Take to the sky  
I need you now, Lord  
Carry me high  
Don't let the world break me tonight  
I need the strength of you by my side  
Sometimes this life can be so cold  
I pray you'll come and carry me home  
  
Can we recover?  
Will the world ever be  
A place of peace and harmony  
With no war and with no brutality?  
If we loved each other  
We would find victory  
But in this harsh reality  
Sometimes I'm so despondent  
That I feel the need to...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep your head to the sky  
With God's love you'll survive  
Fly like a bird  
Take to the sky  
I need you now, Lord  
Carry me high  
Don't let the world break me tonight  
I need the strength of You by my side  
  
Sometimes this life can be so cold  
I pray You'll come and carry me home  
Carry me higher, higher, higher  
Carry me higher, higher, higher  
Carry me home  
Higher, Jesus  
Carry me higher, Lord

Trembling  
Starry eyed  
As you put your hand in mine  
  
It was twilight  
On the Fourth of July  
Sparkling colors were  
Strewn across the sky  
And we sat close enough  
That we just barely touched  
While roman candles  
Went soaring above us and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we wandered away  
I was trembling inside  
But I wanted to stay  
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind  
On that Fourth of July  
  
So starry eyed  
On the flowery hillside  
Breathless and fervid  
Amid the dandelions  
As it swept over me  
Like the wind trough the trees  
I felt you sigh with a  
Sweet intensity and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we floated away  
Delicately lay entwined  
In an intimate daze  
A crescent moon began to shine  
And I wanted to stay  
Tangled up with you among the fireflies  
On that Fourth of July  
  
Thunder clouds  
Hung around  
So threateningly  
Ominously hovering  
And the sky  
Opened wide  
Showering  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we ran from the rain  
Tentatively kissed goodnight  
And went our separate ways  
And I've never truly felt the way that I  
Felt the Fourth of July  
  
Truly I have never felt the same inside  
Like that Fourth of July  
Truly I could never feel the same as I  
Felt that Fourth of July

[chorus]  
Oh damn  
The club 'bout to close in a minute  
Can I get your number, baby  
So you and I can go get in it  
Let me come and pick you up, oh  
And go take you out, oh  
Can I get your number, baby  
So I can show you what I'm all about  
What I'm all about, damn  
  
I've been checkin' you out  
And I noticed that you ain't just one of the crowd  
So tell me won't you  
Come on and see about me, baby  
I've got the Cris on ice and I'm 'bout to get nice  
Up in VIP with all my ladies  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin' about you  
Here's a little somethin' about me  
I got a house in Capri and my own G4  
And that Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you're sitting next to me  
I bet you're wondering  
What my intentions are for you  
And I to get into  
Baby, I just want to  
Hug and kiss and love ya  
Look into my eyes, baby, don't be shy  
Is it yes or no  
We ain't got all night  
Tell me how many times in your life  
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight  
Tell me a little somethin' bout you  
Here's a little somethin' bout me  
I got a pimp penthouse with a sick hot tub  
We can watch the flat screen  
While the bubbles fill it up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Saviour  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we had gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Saviour  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we had gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Ah... Ahh... Ahh...  
Ahh... Ahh...  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...  
  
La la la... Ahh... Ahh... Ooh...  
Ahh... Ooh...  
  
Once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye  
Something got a hold of us and we changed  
Then you sat alone in pride  
And I sat at home and cried  
How'd our fairytale just end up this way  
  
We went round for round 'till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound  
And if that's a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you...  
Uh uh uh... Ah ah ah ahhhhh...  
  
Oh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain  
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again  
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night...  
Wanna pause it, but I can't make it stay  
(Just gotta let it play)  
  
We went round for round 'till we knocked love out  
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound  
And if that's a metaphor of you and I  
Why is it so hard to say goodbye  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a loss cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you...  
Uh uh uh... Ah ah ah ahhh...  
  
No need to call my phone cause I changed my number today  
A matter a fact I think I'm moving away (away)  
Sorry, the frustration's got me feeling that way  
And I just keep having one last thing to say  
And I just wanna hold you, touch you,  
Feel you, be near you, I miss you baby baby baby...  
I'm tired of trying to fake through  
But there's nothing I can do...  
Boy I can't wait to hate you...  
  
Chorus:  
I can't wait to hate you  
Make you pain like I do...  
Still can't shake you off...  
I can't wait to break through  
These emotional changes...  
Seems like such a lost cause  
I can't wait to face you,  
Break you down so low  
There's no place left to go...  
I can't wait to hate you... Baby...  
Ah ah ah ahhhhh...  
  
I can't wait to H. A. T. E. You  
'Cause right now I need you  
Can't wait to make you go (go) (repeat to end)

[Repeat x8]  
Give me your love  
  
Hey  
You gotta bounce to it like this  
You almost gotta walk to this  
Uh huh  
Escape  
  
Boy your love's so good  
I don't want to let go  
And although I know I should  
I can't leave you alone  
Cause you're so disarming  
I'm caught up in the midst of you  
And I can not resist  
And oh  
  
Boy if I do  
The things you want me to  
The way I used to do  
Would you love me, baby  
Hold me, feeling now  
Go and break my heart  
  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
[Repeat x11]  
Give me your love  
  
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak  
When you smile at me  
And you tell me the things that you know  
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you  
But I can not resist at all  
  
Boy if I do  
The things you want me to  
The way I used to do  
Would you love me, baby  
Hold me, feeling now  
Go and break my heart  
  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay  
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night  
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends  
She want to creep past the block spyin' again  
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away  
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day  
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb  
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers  
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies  
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib  
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm  
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms  
She call me "Heartbreaker"  
When we apart, it makes her  
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble "I hate ya"  
But she know she love Jay because  
She love everything Jay say, Jay does  
And uh  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me  
But I just keep on coming back incessantly  
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me  
I should have known right from the start  
You'd go and break my heart  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Give me your love

They said I couldn't they said I couldn't

I see you with your favorite dress on again  
I guess you thought that you were slick  
But I already peeped  
You got your tag tucked in  
You're strugglin'  
Tryin' to look cute in your best friend's boots  
But they don't hardly fit  
Why you back again

You think I won't come out these heels  
And make it clear

You think I won't fuck up my hair  
And take it there

Keep your hands up off my boo  
Ain't no telling what I'll do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man, no  
Sho ain't the one  
Sho ain't the one  
I ain't the one  
All these J.O.'s want what's mine  
But they done lost their mind  
They on him like the ice cream man,  
Night and day  
Why I got to fight to keep 'em all away  
They crammin' but they know  
They can't have none  
Obsessin' but they're messin' with the wrong one  
I ain't who you think I'm is  
I will snatch off all this ish  
You think I won't come out these heels  
And make it clear  
I ain't the one  
You think I won't fuck up my hair  
And take it there  
I ain't the one  
Keep your hands up off my boo  
Ain't no telling what I'll do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man, no

They said I couldn't come no harder  
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother  
They said I couldn't come no harder  
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother  
They said I couldn't come no harder  
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother  
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't  
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother  
You think I won't come out these heels  
And make it clear  
I ain't the one  
You think I won't fuck up my hair  
And take it there  
I ain't the one  
Keep your hands up off my boo  
Ain't no telling what I'll do  
What makes you think you fly enough to  
Take my man  
I ain't the one  
Sho ain't the one  
Sho ain't the one  

There's a hero  
If you look inside your heart  
You don't have to be proud  
Of what you are  
There's an answer  
If you reach into your soul  
And the sorrow that you know  
Will melt away  
  
[Chorus]  
And then a hero comes along  
With the strength to carry on  
And you cast your fears aside  
And you know you can survive  
So when you feel like hope is gone  
Look inside you and be strong  
And you'll finally see the truth  
That a hero lies in you  
  
It's a long, road  
When you face the world alone  
No one reaches out a hand  
For you to hold  
You can find love  
If you search within yourself  
And the emptiness you felt  
Will disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lord knows  
Dreams are hard to follow  
But don't let anyone  
Tear them away  
Hold on  
There will be tomorrow  
In time you'll find the way  
  
And then a hero comes along  
With the strength to carry on  
And you cast your fears aside  
And you know you can survive  
So when you feel like hope is gone  
Look inside you and be strong  
And you'll finally see the truth  
That a hero lies in you  
That a hero lies in you  
That a hero lies in you

Oh, now you can have me  
When you want me  
You simply ask me to be there  
And you're the only one  
Who makes me come running  
'Cause what you got  
Is far beyond compare  
  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love affected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling  
Don't you see  
Every night and day I can hardly wait  
For another taste of honey  
  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
  
Yeah, oh  
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey  
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you  
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly  
You're the only thing I want to do  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love addected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling  
Don't you see  
Every night and day I can hardly wait  
For another taste of honey  
  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
  
(Breakdown)  
Oooh, woah  
Every little thing you do  
Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you  
Honey, it's like  
  
And it's just like honey  
When your love comes over me  
Oh, baby, I've got a dependancy  
Always strung out  
For another taste of your honey  
  
It's like honey  
When it washes over me  
You know sugar never ever was so sweet  
And I'm dying for ya  
Crying for ya  
I adore ya  
One hit of your love addected me  
And I'm strung out on you, darling  
Don't you see  
Every night and day I can hardly wait  
For another taste of honey  
  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
Honey, I can't describe  
How good it feels inside  
  

I loved this song when I was little, I won a talent contest singing this song,  
and I believe it was a little something like this:  
  
Guess mine is not the first heart broken  
My eyes are not the first to cry  
I'm not the first to know there's  
Just no getting over you  
  
Ladies and gentleman, Olivia Newton John!  
You know I'm just a fool who's willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
(But) baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no where to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you (you)  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Whoo  
  
Olivia Newton John!

Once again we sit in silence  
After all is said and done  
Only emptiness inside us  
Baby look what we've become  
We can make a million promises  
But we still won't change  
It isn't right to stay together  
When we only bring each other pain  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to cry  
Don't want to cry  
Nothing in the world  
Could take us back  
To where we used to be  
Though I've given you my heart and soul  
I must find a way of letting go  
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry  
  
Too far apart to bridge the distance  
But something keeps us hanging on and on  
Pretending not to know the difference  
Denying what we had is gone  
Every moment we're together  
Is just breaking me down  
I know we swore it was forever  
But it hurts too much to stay around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the magic's gone  
There's just a shadow of a memory  
Something just went wrong  
We can't go on make-believing  
  
[Chorus]

[Spoken:]  
Here we go again  
I don't wanna let you in  
But you know what happens  
  
When I, when I,  
When I feel it.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
Keep telling you it's over,  
But boy here we go again.  
You say 'I'm coming over'  
'Cause you know I'll let you in.  
So sly and so persuasive,  
I don't wanna let you win,  
But my respect's diminishing  
And then I go  
When I, when I,  
When I feel it.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
Keep trying to convince myself  
You ain't no good for me,  
Make futile resolutions  
That I'm gonna let you be  
But everytime you come back,  
My defenses start to wane,  
And I can hardly break away  
And then I go  
When I, when I,  
When I feel it.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
I feel it deep inside,  
I feel it come alive,  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
When I, when I, when I  
When I feel your love  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
Here it comes again boy,  
And I feel it, and I feel it!  
Here comes that feeling again.  
  
And I feel it, oh baby  
Here it comes and here it comes  
And here it comes...

Doesn't it ever stay  
Must it always fade away  
Couldn't love ever be  
Something tangible and real  
Farewell, fair weather friend  
Abandonment returns to taunt me again  
  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
  
I was caught in your masquerade  
Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil  
But it just seemed so easy to  
Open up myself to you  
Once more into the wind  
The embers scatter  
And the chill settles in  
  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
  
Oh  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be  
The one to get me through that night  
  
I only wanted you  
To be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
Oh  
Doesn't it ever stay?  
I only wanted you to  
Stay

No, oh No.... Yeah, Yeah... Oh..  
You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside  
I know its crazy, but you still can touch my heart  
And after all this time you think that I wouldn't feel the same  
But time hasn't done nothing, nothing has changed  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I had a dream  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
Each day of my life, I am filled with all the joy I could find  
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type  
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'd hold it with both  
Hands  
It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance  
  
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby  
I still believe that we can be together, no  
If we believe that true love never has to end  
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm..  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again (Oh, baby, yeah)  
  
I had a dream  
You and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe (Ooh, baby, I do)  
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)  
In love again  
  
I had a dream (I miss your love)  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me(will find ourselves in love...)

I gotta take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb  
Feels like a world upon my shoulders  
I through the clouds I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I'm gonna take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is  
And I know, I know you can show me  
  
Let's talk about love  
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside  
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love  
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide  
I know you can show me, yeah  
  
I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love  
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too  
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too  
And I know and I know, I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah  
I wanna know what love is

Won't you talk to me  
This is so out of hand  
Something's gone wrong  
With the life that we planned  
  
Won't you look at me  
You're avoiding my gaze  
And it seems like you've changed  
In so many ways  
  
[Chorus]  
It isn't fair  
It isn't right  
If it's really gone  
Then tell me tonight  
If it's over  
If it's over  
Let me go  
  
Won't you speak to me  
I'm just here holding on  
'Cause baby I really don't need to wait around  
If the feeling is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't need no apologies  
I'm not looking for no sympathy  
All I'm asking for  
Is for your honesty  
  
Won't you give it to me  
Give it to me now  
  
It isn't fair  
It just isn't right  
'Cause if it's really gone  
You've got to say the word tonight  
  
If it's over  
If it's over  
Won't you let me know  
Baby if it's over  
  
If it's over  
Over - let me go

I'll be lovin' you long time  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'

I'll be lovin' you  
I'll be lovin' you  
  
You ain't even gotta worry  
About a thing I gotcha babe  
And ain't nobody takin' me away  
It's not a game I'm here to stay  
Our love is stronger than any drug  
Addictive just can't get enough  
And every-time I'm with you  
I want some more  
Just close the door  
And let's explore each other  
  
[Chorus]  
Long as I know you got me  
I'll be loving you long time  
(As I can be)  
I'll be loving you long time  
(Eternally)  
There's no stopping you and me  
I'll be loving you long time  
(As I can breathe)  
I'll be loving you long time  
(Eternally)  
  
Don't care what no one has to say  
They don't understand us like we do  
I need you near me night and day  
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do  
Scoop me up and we can go  
To that little spot where no one knows  
Spend a little time just us alone  
You can caress my body and never let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want another  
Ain't gon' never be another  
Can't nobody do what you do to me  
Don't want another  
Ain't gon' never be another  
Can't nobody do what you do to me  
Don't want another  
Ain't gon' never be another  
Can't nobody do what you do to me  
  
I'll be loving you long time  
(As I can be)  
I'll be loving you long time  
(Eternally)  
Long as I know you got me  
I'll be loving you long time  
(As I can be)  
I'll be loving you long time  
(Eternally)  
There's no stopping you and me  
I'll be loving you long time  
(As I can be)  
I'll be loving you long time  
  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin'  
I'll be lovin' you

Tried and tried to let you go  
But it's just impossible  
  
Everytime we say goodbye  
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes  
Wish I didn't need you so  
But you're irresistible

Yet another early morning and you walk in like it's nothing  
Hold up, hold up, hold up  
Ain't donuts ain't no coffee  
See ya, know ya see me calling and calling  
I should crack ya right in ya forehead  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)  
If you f'd up it's over.  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a wrap for you baby (It's a wrap)  
It's a wrap for you boy (It's a wrap)  
Oh baby  
  
If I ever misrepresented my self-image  
Then I'm sorry  
I was oh so acquiescent  
But I learn my lesson  
Boy you sorry  
Buh buh buh  
All out in the open  
Don't make me go call Maury Povich  
  
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)  
And regain my composure  
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)  
If you f'd up it's over.  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put all of your shit in the elevator  
It's going down like a denominator  
Trying to keep holding on, holding on  
Boy let me go  
You go wake my neighbors, get away from my door  
That was your last shot you ain't coming back  
It's the martini I mean it baby  
It's wrap  
  
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone  
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong (you dead wrong)  
So just scoo do do doot baby  
Boy I ain't playing a game.  
I told you, I told you  
If you f'd up one more time it's over (It's wrap)  
So get out of my face it's over  
Been sitting here all night leave me alone.  
Since one o'clock A.M. been drinking patron  
Let the credits role, it's a wrap

We've known each other  
For a long long time  
But I never really noticed  
All the magic in your eyes  
I've been around you  
A thousand times before  
And you've always been a friend to me  
But now I'm wanting more  
I must have been so blind  
I never realized  
You're the one that's right for me  
All the while I couldn't see  
And now I feel so strange  
I'll never be the same  
Going 'round and 'round in circles  
And I don't know what to do  
'Cause baby  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
There's no explaining how I feel inside  
I'm going thru a transformation  
That's so hard for me to hide  
I had a revelation that  
Finally opened up my eyes  
The one I spent a lifetime searching for  
Was right here all the time  
I was oblivious so very out of touch  
All the while I couldn't see  
You're the one that's right for me  
And now my world has changed  
I'll never be the same  
Going 'round and 'round in circles  
And it's all because of you  
Sweet baby  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
Don't you know  
That you're blowing my mind  
What you do to me  
I can't describe  
Baby I can't hold back anymore  
I just can't conceal it  
You're the one I really adore  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you  
I've been thinking about you  
In the most peculiar way  
  
I've been thinking about you  
It's unbelievable to me  
But suddenly I think  
I'm falling in love with you

To the new born King  
  
He was herald by the angels  
Born in a lowly manger  
The virgin Mary was His mother  
And Joseph was his earthly father  
Three wise men came from afar  
They were guided by a shining star  
To see King Jesus where He lay  
In a manger filled with hay  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh what a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
Oh new joy He brings  
Won't you listen to the angels sing  
Glory  
To the new born King

Wonderful, wonderful one  
Oh, oh  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Son of God  
Oh Jesus  
Glory  
To the new born King, yeah

Baby baby don't you ever let go  
More and more until we both overflow  
Got a feeling that my heart's never known  
I found love  
Tender kisses and I'm floating on air  
You can have me anytime, anywhere  
When you need me I will always be there  
I found love  
  
And our love goes round and round  
Way up high, a joy ride  
We can touch the stars above  
We found love  
And our love was heaven sent  
From the day we first met  
We've got something they can't touch  
We found love  
  
Loving you is like a taste of heaven  
want to gaze into your eyes forever  
Run away and spend our lives together  
I've found love  
Baby baby  
All it takes is one touch  
And immediately I feel a rush  
Baby boy, too much is never enough  
I found love  
  
And our love goes round and round  
Way up high, a joy ride  
We can touch the stars above  
We found love  
And our love was heaven sent  
From the day we first met  
We've got something they can't touch  
We found love  
  
I don't need anything  
When you're here next to me  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Could ever replace you in my eyes  
We found paradise  
Forever you and I  
Our love goes round and round  
On a joy ride  
(With ya babe, with ya babe,  
With ya babe, with you baby)

Joy to the world  
The Lord has come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the world  
The Lord has come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the earth  
The Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills, and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
Joy to the world  
All the boys and girls  
Joy to the people everywhere you see  
Joy to you and me

Joy to you and me

With truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness

Joy to the world  
All the boys and girls  
Joy to the people everywhere you see  
Joy to you and me

Joy to you and me

Do you know  
How it feels  
Lying here without you baby  
You could never understand what's happening to me  
So alone  
Nothing's real  
I just dream about you baby  
And forever wonder why you had  
To break free  
  
Even though you're not my lover  
Even though you're not my friend  
I'd give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
  
It's so hard  
To believe  
I don't have you right beside me  
As I long to touch you  
But you're out of my reach  
And my heart doesn't feel  
It's so very cold inside me  
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be  
  
Even though you're not my lover  
Even though you're not my friend  
I would give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
  
You were the only one (only one)  
That I allowed inside my heart  
Now I'm just holding on  
To something so far gone  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Even though you're not my lover  
And even though you're not my friend  
I'd give my all  
To have you here  
Just to hold you once again  
Just to hold you once again

If you could only see  
That I was not put here for you  
To judge me and dispute my in most truth  
  
Ad after all these years of enmity, envy and tears  
It's a shame you don't know me at all  
  
I was wondering would you cry for me  
If I told you that I couldn't breathe  
If I was drowning, suffocating  
If I told you that I couldn't breathe  
  
Those ageless buried recollections  
We transform them and select them  
You have yours, I have mine that's fine  
  
Why are we too torn to heal  
Our stitches never dissapear  
I have mine, you have yours, I'm sure  
  
I was wondering  
Would you reach for me  
If you saw that I was languishing  
  
I was wondering would you cry for me  
If I told you that I couldn't breathe  
If I was drowning, suffocating  
If I told you that I couldn't breathe

Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Cause I was sittin' there  
Bored to death  
And in just one breath  
He said  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get on  
You gotta get down girl  
You know you  
Drive me crazy baby  
You've got me  
Turning to another man  
Called you on the phone  
No one's home  
Baby why ya  
Leave me all alone  
And if it wasn't for the music  
I don't know what I'd do  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life with a song  
  
You know  
I hopped into my car  
Didn't get very far no  
Because I had you  
On my mind  
Why be so unkind?  
You've got  
Your women all around  
All around this town, boy  
But I was trapped  
In love with you  
And I didn't know  
What to do  
But when I turned  
On my radio  
I found out all  
I needed to know  
Check it out  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved my life with a song  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
From a broken heart  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life with a song  
  
Hey listen up to your local DJ  
You better hear  
What he's got to say  
There's not a problem  
That I can't fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix  
And if your man  
Gives you trouble  
Just you move out  
On the double  
And you don't let it  
Trouble your brain  
Cause away goes troubles  
Down the drain  
I said away goes troubles  
Down the drain  
  
Last night a DJ  
Saved me life  
There's not a problem  
That I can't fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix  
There's not a problem  
That I can't fix  
Cause I can do it  
In the mix

Who would've believed  
That you and me would fall  
And land together  
And who could've forseen  
  
In you I'd find the place  
I've belonged forever  
And if I move closer  
Then love will take over  
  
And lead the way  
I'd given up hope  
Losing the faith that love  
Could be mine to treasure  
  
And now  
Nothing's the same  
I found myself reborn  
On the day I met you  
  
And if we move closer  
Then love will take over  
And lead the way  
Suddenly you are lying  
  
Here with me and the truths  
I used to hold have changed  
And if I move closer  
And let it take over  
  
Then love will lead the way  
And let it take over  
Then love will lead the way

You look at me and see the girl  
Who lives inside the golden world  
But don't believe  
That's all there is to see  
You'll never know the real me  
  
She smiles through a thousand tears  
And harbors adolescent fears  
She dreams of all  
That she can never be  
She wades in insecurity  
And hides herself inside of me  
  
Don't say she takes it all for granted  
I'm well aware of all I have  
Don't think that I am disenchanted  
Please understand  
  
It seems as though I've always been  
Somebody outside looking in  
Well here I am for all of them to bleed  
But they can't take my heart from me  
And they can't bring me to my knees  
They'll never know the real me

Make it last  
Ooh  
Let's make it last forever  
(Last... Ever)

Shorty knows she my babygirl and  
Playa hatas try hard to get her  
But she'll be loungin' in my cradle tonight  
Oh  
Typically a thug wouldn't say this  
But to see your love has got me faded  
No girl ever made me feel like you do, ow  
  
Oh  
I'ma be here night after night to  
Feel your lovin' arms around me baby, baby, baby, baby  
You make it alright  
No one but you baby, baby  
Can make me feel the way you make me, make me, make me feel  
Oh

Ooh  
Don't let our love end  
Oh, don't you let it end  
Make it last forever and ever  
Thank God I found you  
  
Your touch is wonderful  
Your love is so marvelous  
Joy, that's what I feel when I'm with you  
Yeah  
Nothing, no one

Could compare to what we have  
(Oh no, baby)  
Love, it feels so good  
I'm so glad you're mine  
Oh

Thank You, Lord (yeah)  
That I found love

Oh, baby  
See I was so lost without your love  
I was lost without you, my every wish and dream  
Became reality  
  
Oh, I was so lost  
Oh, I  
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude  
Oh yeah  
My baby I'm so thankful  
(Thank God I found you)  
  
Thank God I found you, I was so lost without you  
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality  
Brought the sunshine  
Completed my whole life  
Make it last forever, baby  
Thank God I found you, you, you, you  
You, you, you  
You, you

On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure  
This is my first and only self-portrait  
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it, "Me. I am Mariah."  
Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title  
Come on, I was only three and a half  
  
It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself  
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken  
I've kept this drawing private for so long  
But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that
have made me who I am today  
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care  
And have been here for me through it all  
I've been through a lot but I've always known me  
I am Mariah  
  
Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames  
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas  
Lately, they've been calling me, "The Elusive Chanteuse"

I remember when you used to be mine  
Way back when  
I was too naive to love you right  
But now if I only had the opportunity  
I would do anything  
Because my heart still believes  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
It's irrelevant to dwell on the past  
I'm accountable for what went bad  
And I mean that  
But I keep on praying for another chance  
Just to have you back  
Cause I've grown  
And I know how to be your everything  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Maybe we could bring it back to life  
  
No, no it ain't over yet  
I just can't accept the possibility  
We weren't made for each other's arms  
I know you're my destiny  
We can't erase what was meant to be  
Part of you and part of me  
If we try one more time  
Maybe somehow we'll survive  
  
Maybe you could be mine again  
Maybe we could make that dream for real  
Like way back then  
When love was yours and mine  
Boy maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back  
Maybe we could bring it back to  
Life  
Maybe you could be mine

I see fields of golden flowers,  
Shine in the evening Sun,  
Above are misty mountains,  
It's so beautiful  
As the wind caresses my eyes,  
Gazing gently at the sky,  
The Moon inside a halo,  
It's so beautiful  
  
When I think of all the beauty,  
That nature gives to me,  
From the flowers to the mountains,  
It's so beautiful  
There's glory and a wonder,  
Far wider than the sea,  
I say yes to all this loveliness  
It's so beautiful  
  
(Humming)

When I am lost  
You shine a light for me and set me free  
When I am low  
You wash away my tears  
And take me through  
  
The loneliness  
And emptiness  
Through the darkest night  
Somehow I survive  
Through it all  
  
When you tell me I'm the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
All I have I want to give to thee  
  
If I should fall  
Your love is strong enough to life me up  
If I'm afraid  
You chase away my fears  
And take me to  
  
A brighter place  
Beyond the rain  
And I feel alright  
Because you're by my side  
Through it all  
  
When you tell me I'm the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
All I have I want to give to thee  
  
You take me through  
The loneliness and emptiness  
And I feel alright  
'Cause you're by my side  
  
Through it all  
You tell me I'm the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
And baby all I have I want to give to thee  
  
Want to give you all of my love  
Now and forever my love  
All I have I want to give to thee

Oh  
Mm  
  
I am thinking of you  
In my sleepless solitude tonight  
If it's wrong to love you  
Then my heart just won't let me be right  
'Cause I've drowned in you  
And I won't pull through  
Without you by my side  
  
I'd give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
I'd risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
'Cause I can't go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
I'd give my all for your love tonight  
  
Baby can you feel me  
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes  
I can see you clearly  
Vividly emblazoned in my mind  
And yet you're so far  
Like a distant star  
I'm wishing on tonight  
  
I'd give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
I'd risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
'Cause I can't go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
I'd give my all for your love tonight  
  
I'd give my all to have  
Just one more night with you  
I'd risk my life to feel  
Your body next to mine  
'Cause I can't go on  
Living in the memory of our song  
I'd give my all for your love tonight  
(I'd) give my all for your love  
Tonight

I've still got a lot to learn  
But, at least I know where I can turn  
When I'm in my times of need  
Just as long  
(As I know all things are possible)  
Just as long as I believe  
  
I've loved a lot, hurt a lot  
Been burned a lot in my life and times  
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear  
With no end in sight  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
Yes, I've been bruised  
Grew up confused  
Been destitute  
I've seen life from many sides  
Been stigmatized  
Been black and white  
Felt inferior inside  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
And the bountiful things that you do  
Lord thank you  
For delivering me  
  
And giving me peace  
Giving me strength  
Giving me hope when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
Always my saving grace  
Pulls me through  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
(Yes you are - you're my every, everything)  
Within you...  
(Only, only you)  
Yes lord  
(Only you)  
My saving grace lord is  
You

I won't  
See your smile  
And I won't hear you laugh anymore  
Every night  
I won't see you walk through that door  
  
'Cause time wasn't on your side  
It isn't right  
I can't say I love you  
It's too late to tell you  
But I really need you to know  
  
No, I'll never forget you  
I'll never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
I'll hold on to the memories baby  
  
Baby can you hear me  
Wherever you may be tonight  
Are you near me  
I need you to be by my side  
  
'Cause I never said goodbye  
It isn't right  
I should have said I love you  
Why didn't I just tell you  
God knows I need you to know  
  
No, I'll never forget you  
I'll never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
I'll hold on to the memories baby  
  
Somewhere  
I know you'll be with me  
Someday  
In another time  
But right now you're gone  
You've just vanished away  
But I'll never leave yo behind  
  
No, I'll never forget you  
I'll never let you out of my heart  
You will always be here with me  
I'll hold on to the memories baby

You're with me  
Till the bitter end  
What we had transcends  
This experience  
Too painful to  
Talk about  
So I'll hold it in  
Til my heart can mend  
And be brave  
Enough to love again  
A place in time  
Still belongs to us  
Stays preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
There is solace  
  
Never too far away  
I won't let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
Cause I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
Though we can never be  
I'll keep you close to me  
When I remember  
  
Glittering lights  
Incandescent eyes  
Still preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
I'll find solace  
  
Never too far away  
I won't let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
And I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
Though we can never be  
I'll keep you close to me  
And I'll remember  
  
A place in time  
Still belongs to us  
Stays preserved  
In my mind  
In the memories  
There is solace  
  
Never too far away  
I won't let time erase  
One bit of yesterday  
Cause I have learned that  
Nobody can take your place  
And though we can never be  
I'll always think of  
You and me  
Always remember  
  
Love  
  
You're never too far

O holy night the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine O night  
O night divine

Oh, little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh, morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh, holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine  
Oh Santa  
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine  
Oh Santa  
  
Santa  
If you get this letter  
Won't you help me out  
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now  
And I don't know how  
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve  
  
But it's amazing  
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby  
Because every time I see Christmas lights  
I feel this burn inside  
And I just can't take it  
  
I saw them shopping last week  
And his new girl was so bleak  
And then I swore to myself  
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night  
Oh oh oh  
  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
  
Oh Santa  
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year  
So I hope Rudolph and them all the eight reindeer  
Get you safely here  
So you can scoop him up  
And scoop him right down my chimney  
  
I've been really, really, really good this year  
So put on that red suit and make him appear  
Make this Christmas cheer  
Just ain't the same without my baby  
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help  
  
They say it's unrealistic  
But I believe in you Saint Nick  
So grant this wish for me right quick  
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night  
  
Oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa! Oh Santa! Oh Santa!  
  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night  
Oh Santa!  
  
Oh Santa Claus  
If you get this letter  
Please don't make me wait  
Cause all December I'll be counting down the days  
So hop on your sleigh  
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies  
  
The trees all sparkly and gold  
But inside I feel so cold  
So soon as you leave the North Pole  
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas  
  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
oh oh oh this Christmas  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine oh oh oh  
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine

I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
I'm riding home in pain again, baby  
But that don't mean shit to you  
You're currently engaged  
In an intimate conversation  
With a young groupie or two  
They say "Players only love you  
When they're playing games"  
Still, I gave my heart to you  
I should have stayed away  
Like my friends all told me to  
  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
  
See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow  
Make me sing real high  
When he goes down low  
But see, it ain't just a physical thing  
He's gotta treat me affectionately  
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust  
Just like every other motherfucker does  
Is this just an impossible dream, baby  
Too elusive to pursue  
It's been such a sad and windy road for me  
Just searchin' for the truth  
  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
  
Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz  
And I'm dishin' out N's  
While you trippin' on a playa  
Baller, havin' bitter conversations  
While we're rollin' on 24's  
And I know you got doubts  
Why you listen to what people talk about  
You ain't figured out why they call ya  
The heavy steady hatin' cause  
You rollin' on 24's  
See how your money flows  
You dress in designer clothes  
From head to the toe  
You ain't satisfied, well tell me  
What you lookin' for  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, I'll be your one and only  
If you give me a chance  
I'll make the change for you, girl  
I know I ain't been the most faithful  
Nigga in the world  
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls  
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire  
To kiss your lips, I desire  
Twist and Mariah, together like a  
Grip on the tire  
  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
  
Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better  
We can do whatever  
While we're sittin' on suede and leather  
Thinkin' through the city  
While we rollin' lonely  
Let's kick it in the Chi  
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie  
I know you were feelin'  
You really know your guy  
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high  
Let me pick the pieces up  
And put them back together cause I want to be with you  
Don't want to leave you lonely  
Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony  
Shorty, can I be your one and only  
  
Every time, oh mm  
Every time I turn around  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
Why I'm looking for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
Why can't I find my one and only  
Still lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely  
Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha  
I find my heart in pieces on the ground  
I'm lookin' for my one and only  
Why can't I find my one and only, ah

An angel appeared  
Of the highest One  
And Mary believed  
The word she received  
Of God's only son  
The Virgin rejoiced  
Gave thanks to the Lord  
And as Joseph dreamt  
The angel was sent  
With tidings of piece and joy  
Of the blessed baby boy  
  
They traveled for miles  
To reach Bethlehem  
Yet when they arrived  
No one could provide  
Place at the inn for them  
But God kept them safe  
From hurt, harm and danger  
In His warm embrace  
Away in a manger  
Waiting for Jesus' birth  
To glorify the Earth  
Then He came  
  
One child can change the world  
Christmas morn'  
The King of all Kings was born  
He reigns forevermore  
Let us worship and adore  
Christ the Lord  
  
Wondrous star  
Led shepherds and wise men  
Through valleys and mountains  
Angels surrounded them  
As they traveled far  
As Heaven and home  
Rang out for the Savior  
The sweet Prince of Peace  
Lay majestively  
Asleep glorious and pure  
And His mercy endures for always  
  
One child can change the world  
Christmas morn'  
The King of all Kings was born  
He reigns forevermore  
Let us worship and adore  
Christ the Lord  
  
One child can change the world  
On Christmas morn'  
The King of all Kings was born  
He reigns forevermore  
Let us worship him  
Let us worship him  
Let us worship  
Christ the Lord  
  
This angel appeared  
The angel appeared  
Christ the Lord  
On Christmas morn'

Sorry I never told you  
All I wanted to say  
Now it's too late to hold you  
Cause you've flown away  
So far away  
  
Never had I imagined  
Living without your smile  
Feeling and knowing you hear me  
It keeps me alive  
Alive  
  
[Chorus]  
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven  
Like so many friends we lost along the way  
And I know eventually we'll be together  
One sweet day  
  
Darling I never showed you  
Assumed you'd always be there  
Took your presence for granted  
But I always cared  
And I miss the love we shared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Although the sun will never shine the same  
I'll always look to a brighter day  
  
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep  
You will always listen as I pray  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Sorry I never told you  
Together  
All I wanted to say

Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
  
Baby, no matter how long it be  
We never lose that chemistry  
And it's the strongest thing  
I've ever experienced  
So sorry, what ever happened to empathy  
I know you motherfucker feel like we  
When you're messin' with the one  
True lover that make you O.O.C.  
  
[Chorus]  
Even though I've been gone for a minute  
It's wrong I admit it  
Your love's so addictive that  
I get so O.O.C.  
Out of control baby  
Although we've both moved on to another  
Still long for each other  
It's wrong but eternally  
I get so O.O.C.  
And that's just the way it be  
  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
  
Baby, every time you touch me  
Still get that electricity  
And after all this time  
It don't even make no sense  
  
So s'cusa me, te quiero mucho papi  
Je ne sais pas mais c'est la vie  
When you're messin' with the one  
True lover that make you O.O.C.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
It's forever  
  
You're out of control  
I'm out of control  
Bounce on 'em, just bounce on, come on.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Lying beside you here in the dark  
Feeling your heart beat with mine  
Softly you whisper you're so sincere  
How could our love be so blind  
  
We sailed on together  
We've drifted apart  
And here you are by my side  
  
So now I come to you with open arms  
Nothing to hide believe what I say  
So here I am with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Living without you living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
But now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay  
  
So now I come to you, with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am, with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms

[Verse: 1]  
It's hard to explain  
Inherently it's just always been strange  
Neither here or there  
Always somewhat out of place everywhere  
Ambiguous  
Without a sense of belonging to touch  
Somewhere halfway  
Feeling there's no one completely the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe it's good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
[Verse: 2]  
Early on, you face  
The realization you don't  
have a space  
Where you fit in  
And recognize you  
Were born to exist  
  
[Chorus]  
Standing alone  
Eager to just  
Believe it's good enough to be what  
You really are  
But in your heart  
Uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the  
Outside  
  
And it's hard [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Irreversibly  
Falling in between  
And it's hard [Repeat: 1]  
To be understood  
As you are [Repeat: 1]  
  
Oh, and God knows  
That you're standing on your own  
Blind and unguided  
Into a world divided  
You're thrown  
Where you're never quite the same  
Although you try,try and try  
To tell yourself  
You really are  
But in your heart-uncertainty forever lies  
And you'll always be  
Somewhere on the outside

I've often wondered if there's  
Ever been a perfect family  
I've always longed for undividedness  
And sought stability  
  
A flower taught me how to pray  
But as I grew, that flower changed  
She started failing in the wind  
Like golden petals scattering  
  
And I miss you dandelion  
And even love you  
And I wish there was a way  
For me to trust you  
But it hurts me every time  
I try to touch you  
  
But I miss you dandelion  
And even love you  
  
I gravitated towards a patriarch  
So young predictably  
I was resigned to spend my life  
With a maze of misery  
  
A boy and a girl befriended me  
We're bonded through despondency  
I stayed so long but finally  
I fled to save my sanity  
  
And I miss you little sis and  
Little brother  
And I hope you realize  
I'll always love you  
(Always love you)  
And although you're struggling  
You will recover  
(We're gonna make it maybe)  
And I miss you little sis and  
Little brother  
  
So many I considered  
Closest to me  
Turned on a dime and sold me  
Out dutifully  
Although that knife was chipping  
Away at me  
They turned their eyes away and  
Went home to sleep  
(Sleep)  
(Sleep)  
(Sleep)  
  
And I missed a lot of life  
But I'll recover  
Though I know you really like  
To see me suffer  
Still I wish that you and I'd  
Forgive each other  
'Cause I miss you, Valentine  
And really loved you  
  
I really loved you  
(I guess I loved you)  
I tried so hard  
But you drove me away  
To preserve my sanity  
  
And I found the strength to break away  
(Do do do do do)  
(Do do do do do do do do)  
Fly  
  

Here comes the night  
No more living in the shadow of your love  
This is my life  
You always tried so hard to keep me down  
But now I'll rise above  
Those empty lies  
Stop pretending that my accusations  
Take you by surprise  
I've realized  
Now I'm ending all the secrecy  
I see through your disguise  
All the dreams we planned  
I believed so I held on  
I understand  
So when the morning comes  
You know that I'll be gone  
  
You don't think that I'll be strong enough  
I won't be a prisoner of your love  
  
No longer blind  
I can focus on deception  
Used to keep me by your side  
I read your mind  
Don't believe it's all a mystery  
There's nothing you can hide  
It's all defined  
There's nothing you can tell me now  
To change the way I feel inside  
All the dreams we planned  
I believed so I held on  
I understand  
So when the morning comes  
You know that I'll be gone  
  
You don't think that I'll be strong enough  
I won't be prisoner of your love  
I'm just not the girl you thought I was  
I won't be a prisoner of your love

It's only been twenty good minutes since I kissed you  
Come back boo, I miss you  
Wish I had twenty million hours to caress you  
And undress you, to be continued  
Boy you, you don't know how it feels when you whisper in my ear  
Boy you, you give my body chills whenever you are near  
  
And boy I got your lovin' on my mind  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
You got me wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
You got me wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
Wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Sometimes we argue and we fight  
But they better know that that's my baby  
You might even think you cute  
But everybody knows that I'm his lady  
Every time you see us, we super fly  
So proud he's by my side  
He knows I'm ride or die  
You don't know how we roll  
Holla at your boy  
Boy you, you don't know how it feels when you whisper in my ear  
Boy you, you give my body chills whenever you are near  
  
And boy I got your lovin' on my mind  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
You got me wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
You got me wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
Wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Boy I'm all wrapped up in you  
You make me feel so unloose  
Tell me what I'm suppose to do  
When you're not around  
  
Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah)  
Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah)  
Oh, baby (Yeah yeah yeah)  
Oh, baby (Yeah hey)  
Oh, boy you got me, you got me, you got me  
  
And boy I got your lovin' on my mind

You got me wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
Wrapped up, packed up  
Ribbon with a bow on it  
  
Got ribbon with a bow on it baby  
Boy you don't even know the things you do  
I could spend my whole life with you  
  
I got your lovin' on my mind  
Baby I could spend my life with you  
It's been twenty good minutes since I kissed you  
Come back boo I miss you

I lay awake sometimes  
Scared to close my eyes  
And I wonder where I left myself  
And lost the will to fight  
  
And the night melts into morning  
Still it's cold beneath the sun  
'Cause the fire in me is languishing  
And I'm too frozen to run  
  
And every once in a while  
There's a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know she's gonna be fine in time  
  
'Cause, you see  
I've got a lot to dream  
There's more than this for me  
  
An angel lands with broken wings  
He warms me with his eyes  
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart  
Unravels as he smiles  
  
See I grew up locked in sorrow  
So I learn to block the pain  
But I won't give up tomorrow  
'Cause I've come to life again  
  
And every once in a while  
There's a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know I'm gonna be fine, that's right  
  
'Cause, for real  
I've got a right to dream  
There's more than this for me  
  
But I keep goin' 'cause every once in a while  
There's a distant glimmer of hope  
I find somewhere deep inside  
Someone strong still resides  
And I know she's gonna be fine in time  
  
'Cause, you see  
I've got a right to dream  
There's more than this for me

Forty days and forty dreams  
Darkened visions, incline the reason  
Philosophy cannot soothe your soul  
But in the mirror the truth will be known  
I will show you your fears  
Just look in the mirror  
You can conquer your fears  
Look in deep  
See unobtrusive, through the lies  
No longer afraid, afraid to die  
  
Standing alone  
And on the day after  
All hell breaks loose  
The battle will be fought  
With stick and stone  
The beast has our backs  
Against the wall  
And the power to devour  
One and all  
  
[Refrain]  
  
Save The Day  
Save The Day  
Save The Day  
  
Bring a day of reckoning  
The bowels of the Earth  
Spit up the flame and fire  
To burn away every foul and evil thing  
No path will be left for  
The heartless liar  
Who will be left to claim  
This land and to be king  
  
[Refrain]

Save The Day

Looking at you  
You are over there  
Watching me too  
Both painting pictures of how we'll kiss and hug  
  
So what we gon' do  
(So what you gon' do, what you gon' do)  
Tell me why we're standing here  
Moments splashing here and there  
You got my mind blown  
And baby, I'm ready to go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me

Hot as you can stand it  
Something like volcanic  
You and me seems organic  
Just like the stars in the planet  
Yeah, we are  
So what you gon' do  
(So what you gon' do, what you gon' do)  
  
Tell me why we're still in here  
There is nothing for us to hear  
I could tell with my eyes closed  
Now baby, I'm ready to go  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me  
  
Everytime I fall through  
Want me to speak on the word or two  
It's the D-O-double-G  
And I do it so lovingly  
Digging the track to the Neptune  
Spending your time in the westgrove  
Now get bug wide  
Shhh, don't make a sound  
I'll take you, lay you down  
Make your body go round and round  
Do you want to?  
Won't say you want, I know you do  
Most girls play shy  
It won't hurt until you give it a try(Uhuh)  
I know you like my smile  
Dig my span  
Big, bad, wide  
  
But uh...  
If it's worth your while  
Say something, say something  
If it's worth your while  
Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
If it's worth your while  
Do something good to me

Say something, say something

Say something good to me  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Swizz Beats, ladies and gentlemen  
(Come on, come on, come on)  
Ladies and gentlemen  
(Mariah, Mariah)  
Ladies and gentlemen  
As we go a little somethin' like this  
Hit it!  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it between us  
You and me got a secret love, baby  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it on the hush  
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby  
It was a summer's day when walking by  
She didn't notice as as you turned  
And you discreetly winked your eye  
And I remember you from back in the day  
You were the boy I couldn't breathe  
Without the one that got away  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it between us  
You and me got a secret love, baby  
(Secret love)  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it on the hush  
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby  
(You're not mine)  
Oh, now that I found you, I cannot let you go  
You know I got my man at home  
But baby, I still need you so  
And I know you ain't never leaving that girl  
But every time you touch me, baby  
It feels so incredible  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
(Oh baby)  
But keep it between us  
You and me got a secret love, baby  
(You and me)  
Oh baby, oh baby  
(Oh baby)  
Come give it to me now, baby  
(Come on and give it to me, boy)  
But keep it on the hush  
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby  
Breakdown  
Secret lovers, yeah  
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it between us  
(Keep it on the hush)  
You and me got a secret love, baby  
Oh baby, oh baby  
Come give it to me now, baby  
But keep it on the hush  
(But keep it)  
You're not mine got a secret love, baby  
Baby, baby, baby  
Come give it to me, baby  
We got a secret love, darling  
Keep it between us, baby  

I can't imagine  
Looking in someone else's eyes  
What we have surpasses  
Even paradise  
  
It's hard to fathom  
Reaching for someone else's hand  
What we share is magic  
Heaven had a plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Sent from up above  
So much love  
In my life  
I can't get enough  
Of your touch-feels so right  
Unending passion  
Somehow the fire never dies  
  
What we share  
Is everlasting  
Love without without demise  
He made it happen  
  
Placed so much joy into our hands  
What we dreamed  
We finally captured  
Heaven took command  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I gotta shake you off  
'Cause the loving ain't the same  
And you keep on playing games  
Like you know I'm here to stay  
I gotta shake it off  
Just like the Calgon commercial  
I really gotta get up outta here  
And go somewhere  
I gotta shake it off  
Gotta make that move  
Find somebody who  
Appreciates all the love I give  
Boy I gotta shake it off  
Gotta do what's best for me  
Baby and that means I gotta  
Shake you off  
  
By the time you get this message  
It's gonna be too late  
So don't bother paging me  
Cause I'll be on my way  
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes  
Just ask your momma she knows  
You're gonna miss me baby  
Hate to say "I told you so"  
Well at first I didn't know  
But now it's clear to me  
You would cheat with all your freaks  
And lie compulsively  
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton  
Jumped in your ride and took off  
You'll never ever find a girl  
Who loves you more than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off  
  
I found out about a gang  
Of your dirty little deeds  
With this one and that one  
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets  
Heard y'all was  
Hold up my phone's breakin' up  
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back  
I gotta get this off of my mind  
You wasn't worth my time  
so I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I need a real love in my life  
Save this recording because  
I'm never coming back home  
Baby I'm gone  
Don't cha know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it  
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake,  
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off  
  
[Chorus]

Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Son of God  
Oh love's pure light  
Radiant beams from  
Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
Oh Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
  
Sleep

Yeh, la-di-da-di-da, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeh)  
Oh-ooo, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeh) oh-oo, yeh  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid  
(You're so far, so far, (oh yeh, babe) so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
I keep on reaching and I, keep on trying  
But you never even hold me and it seems like you don't know me baby  
I keep on yearning and I, I guess I'm learning  
That it's just a losing fight 'cause there's no passion in your eyes  
No, no, no, no, babe  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away) yeh  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid  
(You're so far, so far, so far, (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
I keep denying that our, our love is dying  
But it's all a big charade and it's a fruitless game to play  
I can't remember when you, you last were tender  
And it's always touch and go your silence chills me to the bone, yeh  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made  
Baby I'm so afraid, yeh  
(You're so far, so far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away from me  
  
Away, away, away, away, away, yeh (woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh) hey, yeh  
Further, further, (further, further) ooo-yeh  
(woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh) yeh  
You're so far  
  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy (hey) that you used to be (where,yeh)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
(You're so far away from me baby, baby)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy that you used to be (oh-babe)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
(You're so far)  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Slipping away from what we had, truly I just don't understand, yeh  
(You're so far, so far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
You're slipping right out of my grasp and you're fading so fast it seems  
You know you're slipping away, yeh-yeh-yeh, baby  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy that you used to be (oh-oh-oh, yeh-yeh-yeh)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Time after time I reach for you (so far, yeh)  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy that you used to be  
Baby you're slipping away from me (baby, baby, baby, I'm so afraid)  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof  
Where is the boy (oh) that you used to be (where, yeh-yeh)  
Baby you're slipping away from me  
  
(So far, so far, you're slipping away, away)  
Time after time I reach for you  
I try and I try but you're so aloof (so far)  
Where is the boy that you used to be (so far)  
Baby you're slipping away from me (oh)

Lying beside you  
This joy is so deep  
I reach out and touch you  
Tenderly  
  
Looking inside you  
My world is complete  
I struggled to find you  
Now I'm free  
  
Precious love  
Burning so deeply  
Shining completely  
For you  
  
[Chorus]  
So blessed  
Amazingly  
Touching you now  
Awakens me  
You are my heart  
My everything  
Feeling you now  
Is all I need  
  
Adrift in a moment  
So sacred and pure  
Alive for you only  
I am yours  
  
As you touch me so sweetly  
And you whisper my name  
I feel how you love me  
We are the same  
  
Precious one  
Don't ever leave me  
Forever need me  
This way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay with me  
Beyond the end  
I treasure you  
You made me whole again  
  
[Chorus]

You were so blind to let me go  
You had it all but didn't know  
No one you'll ever find will be  
Closer to all your dreams than me  
Believing the grass would be greener  
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"  
But I know you'll soon discover  
You're never satisfied with any other  
  
[Chorus:]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score  
  
You'll change your mind and call my name  
Soon as you find they're all the same  
And when you find yourself alone  
Don't come back crying  
You should have known  
Believe me I'm not pretending  
It's not hard to predict  
This ending now  
'Cause I know you'll soon discover  
You're needing me in spite of all the others  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score  
  
Maybe now you just can't conceive  
That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely  
Baby, how could you ever believe  
That another could replace me  
The one and only  
But when your down  
In your time of need  
And you're thinking that you  
Might be coming back to own me  
Just think again 'cause  
I won't need your love anymore!  
  
[Chorus]  
Someday Oh Someday  
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for  
Someday hey hey  
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

See it's hard to tell somebody  
That you're still somewhat  
Attached to the dream  
Of being in love once again  
When it's clear they've moved on  
  
So I sat down and wrote these few words  
On the off chance you'd hear  
And if you happen to be somewhere listening  
You should know I'm still here  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
What can I say, I had a little extra time  
So I figured I might as well explain  
A couple little things to you  
That you probably never knew  
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me  
Even though life goes on  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
And in my love will flow  
Like the waves to the shore  
You can fall into me  
Once again effortlessly  
And I'll comfort you so  
  
Your heart won't hurt anymore  
I'm waiting patiently  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
(if she hurts you or misleads you) Is call me and let love rush in  
(you can just call me baby)  
If you really need me (if you really need me baby)  
Baby just reach out and touch me(reach reach baby)  
(reach, baby)  
You don't ever have to be  
(don't ever hesitate to call me)  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you(if she hurts you)  
(she's a dam fool)  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
(all you gotta do is call me boy, I got you)  
  
If you really need me (yeah:.)  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
(if you're listening to me baby)  
You don't ever have to be (like you used to)  
Downhearted again  
(before I even knew you)  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
(then you know I'm singing to you)  
Baby all you ever need to do  
(so I just wanted you to know)  
Is call me and let love rush in  
(that "anytime you need a friend")  
  
If you really need me (I'm here)  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
(you can still believe  
You don't ever have to be in fairy tales)  
Downhearted again (yours and mine)  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
(so if by chance you take a listen)  
Baby all you ever need to do  
(I'm quite sure you "know is call me and let love rush  
In that this one's for you)  
(cause I'm giving "my all")  

Thank you for forgiving  
Hurtful things I've done as a child  
Adolescent or woman  
Thank you for embracing a flaxen-haired baby  
Although I'm aware you had doubts  
I guess anybody'd have had doubts  
  
Please be at peace father  
I'm at peace with you  
Bitterness isn't worth cling to  
After all the anguish we've all been through  
  
Thank you for the mountains  
The lake of the clouds  
I'm picturing you and me there right now  
As the crystal cascades showered down  
  
Strange to feel that proud, strong man  
Grip tightly to my hand  
Hard to see the life inside  
Wane as the days went by  
Trying to preserve each word  
He murmured in my ear  
Watch part of my life disappear  
  
Father, thanks for reaching out and lovingly  
Saying that you've always been proud of me  
I needed to feel that so desperately  
You're always alive inside of me  
Now you're shining like  
A sunflower up in the sky  
Way up high

Tuesday, 7:56 P.M.  
What's up, Jermaine? I miss you.  
Mmm.  
Do me a favor. Tell your friends you're not going out tonight.  
I got a little bit of that Christal, some of that Yak. And, oh. Better  
yet, I got on what you like to see in the most.  
Word!  
So, we're fucking tonight.  
Ha, ha, ha. For sure. Ha, ha.  
  
Uh, ha  
What you thinkin' about?  
You and me goin' one-on-one (say what)  
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)  
MC y'all (what you think about)  
I'm the man to fulfill your needs  
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (c'mon)  
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart  
If forever you'll be my sweetheart  
  
Boy, haven't you noticed (say what)  
The gleam in my eyes (uh, huh)  
Because of you  
I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)  
But every time you're with me (uh)  
Feel so positive  
That with you a little love  
Somethings gotta give  
  
A full moon is waiting in the twilight  
Maybe soon you will come to be my light  
Here we are  
Hoping that we'll never part  
Stay with me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)  
We can share a story book moment  
What you think about  
What you think about  
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one  
Just deep in love  
  
You ain't no Casanova (ha, ha, ha)  
I'll know that you'll be true  
And that's why (uh)  
I'm so in love with you (me, too)  
But this romantic evening  
You led me at my door (yeah, yeah)  
But tonight, I'd like to explore  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Verse 4:  
Na, na, na, na, na (say what)  
Na, na, na, na, na (like that)  
Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (bring it down, ooh)  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (putcha hand in the air)  
  
JD y'all  
MC y'all  
See, I saw you at the party  
With your eyes on me  
Fittin' the description  
On what I want my wife to be (ha, ha)  
As live as me  
Don't know the same guys as me  
But a lot of style  
And usin' wild name like Ivory  
I agree with my niggas  
You the baddest  
I ever seen in a long time (uh)  
But woman with her own shine  
Is her own time  
And I don't hit  
'cause I'm tired of dealin'  
With the wrong kind  
Getting non' but the bullshit  
She got a playa  
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)  
She up in the corner  
Sippin' Don P, Rosee' (yeah)  
Shakin' it up with the homegirls  
Payin' no attention to us  
They in they own world  
'Hey, yo, girl'  
I'm the man to fulfill your needs  
Get you everything you see in your dreams  
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart  
If forever you'll be my sweetheart  
  
Sounds so right (uh, huh)  
The mood is right  
Say what  
MC, baby, sing it to me  
To keep me warm  
Away from home  
Nowhere better than my baby's arms  
Sounds so right (uh, huh)  
The mood is right  
Say what  
MC, baby, sing it to me To keep me warm  
Away from home  
c'mon, baby, you can be my  
Won't you be my  
Sweetheart  
Sweetheart  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Mariah, you're on fire  
JD y'all  
You know I need your love roaming  
Yeah, yeah, me too  
All that shit

Ahhhm  
Mhhh  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I would give up everything  
Before I'd seperate myself from you  
After so much suffering  
I finally found unvarnished truth  
I was all by myself for the longest time  
So cold inside  
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside  
I felt like dying  
Until you saved my life  
  
Thank God I found you  
(Yeah yeah)  
I was lost without you  
(I was lost)  
My every wish and every dream  
(Mmmmh)  
Somehow became reality  
When you brought the sunlight  
Completed my whole life  
I'm overwhelmed with graditude  
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you  
  
Mmmh  
Oh yeah  
Whoaaaaaa  
Oh yeah  
  
I will give you everything (everything)  
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do (oh no)  
To ensure your happiness  
I'll cherish every part of you  
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive  
Don't wanna try  
(I don't wanna try)  
If you keeping me warm each and every night  
I'll be allright (be allright)  
'Cause I need you in my life  
  
Ooooh  
Thank God I found you  
(I'm thanking you)  
I was lost without you  
(So lost without you)  
My every wish and every dream  
(Every wish, every dream)  
Somehow became reality  
When you brought the sunlight (brought the sunlight)  
Completed my whole life (completed)  
I'm overwhelmed with graditude (overwhelmed with graditude)  
('Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you)  
And I'm so thankful I found you  
  
Oooooh  
(See)  
See I was so desolate before you came to me  
Looking back (looking back)  
I guess it shows that we were destined  
To shine over the rain to appreciate  
The gift of what we have  
And I'd go through it all over again  
To be able to feel  
This way  
(This way)  
  
Thank God I found you  
(Yeah yeah)  
I was lost without you  
(Lost without you baby)  
My every wish and every dream  
(And every dream)  
Somehow became reality  
Oooooooh  
When you brought the sunlight  
(Brought the light)  
Completed my whole life  
(My whole life)  
I'm overwhelmed with graditude  
See baby I'm so thankful I found you  
Oooooooh  
Thank God I found you  
I was lost without you  
I'm overwhelmed with graditude  
(So overwhelmed)  
My baby I'm so thankful I found  
You  
You  
I'm overwhelmed with graditude  
My baby I'm so thankful I found  
(I found you)  
You  

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Thanx for nothin'  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
You were just playin' a game  
  
I can't even know what to say  
I've been hurt I've been played  
And I'm so shamed  
I can't even cry it's that deep  
You just lie and you cheat  
Like it's nothin'  
  
See you said that you loved me too  
And so I trusted you  
But I guess that subconsciously I knew  
But I didn't wanna face the truth  
That I was only being used  
And you was just frontin'  
Hey boy, thanx for nothin'  
  
[Chorus]  
I never knew enough about you babe  
And I guess I only have myself to blame  
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering  
Cause you were just playin' a game  
Nothin' anyone could do to convince me babe  
I was livin' in a lie just a masquerade  
Now I only know that I'll never be the same  
But you were just playin' a game  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Thanx for nothin'  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
You were just playin' a game  
  
Every day and every night  
I stay by the phone  
Never go no place so just in case  
You call I'll be home  
Seems like what I do is  
Think about our pseudo romance  
While you're somewhere burnin' diesel  
In the streets havin' laughs  
  
Somebody say you know what I'm going through  
You been left with nothin' too  
Too much you can't count on one hand  
Singing 3,4,5,6  
7 days a week you're drowning in tears  
He was so insincere  
Now you're layin' up in bed  
Every night singing  
Hey boy, thanx for nothin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
So thanx for nothin'  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
So thanx for nothin'

Baby baby baby  
What's it gonna be?  
Baby baby baby  
Is it him or is it me?  
Don't make me waste my time  
Don't make me lose my mind baby  
  
Baby baby baby  
Can't you stay with me tonight?  
Oh baby baby baby  
Don't my kisses please you right?  
You were so hard to find  
The beautiful ones they hurt you  
  
Every time  
Paint a perfect picture  
Bring to life a vision in one's mind  
  
The beautiful ones  
(The beautiful ones)  
Always smash the picture  
  
Always every time  
If I told you baby  
That I was in love with you  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby  
If we got married  
Would that be cool?  
You make me so confused  
The beautiful ones  
You always seems to lose

The First Noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain  
Poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
In fields where they may  
Keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born  
Is the King of Israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the East  
Beyond them far  
And to the Earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born  
Is the King of Israel  
  
Then entered  
In those Wise men three  
Full reverently  
Upon their knee  
And offered there  
In His presence  
Their gold and myrrh  
And frankincense  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born  
Is the King of Israel  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born  
Is the King of Israel

We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world  
Drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl  
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you  
And I looked in your heart  
And saw all my dreams come true  
  
You did the impossible  
You rescued my love  
You did the impossible  
See, I had almost given up  
  
And now I love ya like summer time, love ya like cherry wine  
Love ya like free money, like a preacher loves Sunday  
Love ya like freeze pop, love ya like a milk shake  
Love ya like a high school girl on a first date  
Love ya like shootin' stars, love ya like a muscle car,  
Love ya like we're destined  
Love ya like my lover and best friend  
Yeah, you did the impossible  
  
Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention  
close the door  
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention  
Like a bird I'm gon' hum  
Those three words, I love you, I love you, I love you  
Freeze the time, let the world go by  
If you're mine say, you love me, you love me, you love me  
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you and the love that  
You gave me has pulled me through  
  
You did the impossible  
You rescued my love  
You did the impossible  
See, I had almost given up  
  
And now I love ya like Sunsets, bubble baths on the jet  
Love ya like kool-aid, Louis Millionaire shades  
Love ya like sugar daddys, love ya like a pimp caddy  
Love ya like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cane  
Love ya like it's five a.m. and I'm off work  
Love ya like Louboutin Heels and a Mini Skirt  
Love ya like an asher cut pink and white engagement ring  
Love ya like layin' in bed bumpin Jodeci  
  
And I'm forever your lady  
Layin' in bed bumpin Jodeci  
And I'm forever your lady  
Layin' in bed bumpin Jodeci  
  
And I'm forever your lady  
(I love you like the sunsets in the evening)  
Layin' in bed bumpin Jodeci  
(Like the shooting stars)  
And I'm forever your lady  
(Yeah, I love you)  
Layin' in the bed bumpin' Jodeci  
(Oh, You did the Impossible)  
  
(I'd almost given up)  
  
(The impossible)

See I'm going through a situation  
That I can't help  
Want to get a little closer  
But I promised myself  
That I would never give my heart  
Away again  
Oo oo babe, I know it's hard  
Butcha gotta understand it  
The truth is all the hurt and the pain  
And the shit that you get  
When you have it  
Ain't worth it  
I've been there so many times  
I should know better but I  
Can't stop what I feel  
When you're next to me  
I really think I  
  
Finally found somebody  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
  
(Baby you're the one)  
(Baby you're the one)  
  
See the problem with relationships  
In general is that it's always a game  
In the beginning they'll do  
Anything to have you  
And once they do it's never the same  
And I, know everyone out there can relate  
So the question is  
One: do I really want to trust this feeling  
Two: do I want to let it pass me by  
Three: do you think it's only superficial  
Four: could it actually be different this time  
Someone to love me  
Someone to be my everything  
Maybe I've stumbled upon  
  
Finally found somebody (The only one)  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love (No, no)  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (I just don't want to be hurt)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(But boy I think you might be the one)  
Finally found somebody  
That could be the one (Maybe I've found)  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (Boy I'm so afraid)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(Cause I know you're the one)  
  
Oh baby  
Sweet darling  
I  
I think I finally found  
  
Finally found somebody (The only one)  
That could be the one  
But I promised myself  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous (No)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
(I don't want to be hurt anymore)  
This is bad 'cause I know that you're the one  
(But I think you might really be the one)  
Finally found somebody  
Could be the one, but I promised myself (Finally found)  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
(I promised myself not to give in)  
And I'm scared  
And I'm nervous  
This is bad  
(Anymore this is bad)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(Cause I know that you're the one)  
Finally found somebody  
Could be the one  
(I finally found somebody that could be the one)  
But I promised myself  
(But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love)  
That I wouldn't give in to love  
And I'm scared  
(And I'm scared)  
And I'm nervous  
(And I'm nervous)  
Don't want to be hurt anymore  
This is bad  
Cause I know that you're the one  
(Please, please baby baby)
