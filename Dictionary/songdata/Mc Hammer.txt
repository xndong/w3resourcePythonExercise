Dance how they want to dance, kick and the slap a friend  
The Addams family  
  
Speakin' and thinkin' about the Addams  
You know the hammer is with it (I'm with it)  
Act a fool, no bones, swooop, goofy and randy  
You know we kick it (the posse)  
Now is the time to get in your mind  
It's okay to be yourself (be yourself)  
Take foolish pride and put it aside  
Like the Addams, yo! they def (that's a family!)

Lets go where the lights is hot  
Gotta back up on the sh-t he pop  
Lets go there, the game is so cold  
I could see it in his eyes, the boy sold his soul  
Devil said I'ma give you the World  
"I'll take it, plus give me a girl"  
Mr Devil can you give me a sign  
He said "Throw the Roc up, that's one of mine"  
  
Lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[MC Hammer - Verse 2]  
Yo Jay, I got a Reasonable Doubt

If I knocked on your door that mean I'm knocking you out  
If I knocked on your door boy, I'll buss ya in ya mouth  
Uh, see me son I don't play  
I come from the shoulders that due the hard way  
New rules, let me show you the way  
If a rapper talk tough he gotta back up what he say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[MC Hammer - Verse 3]  
I don't really have to go in on the fella  
But that dude wrote back to devil  
Nah nah I don't roc-your-wear  
Your shoes I don't need a dark pair  
That boy tried to steal my swag  
Fingerprints all over the bag  
Imposter get him outta here  
Imposter the king is right here, lets go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah you're now rocking with the king of heart  
The king of heart, tearing all imposters apart  
Yeah, king, king, king, king, king, king, king...  
  
Lets go

When you're in this war, yo, all is fair  
A tap on my shoulder, I turn around  
Too Big is dyin? fast, he's on the ground

My babes are trained to make that dollar  
To take you out, fool, it ain't no bother  
You dropped your pants and you pay the price  
Your money maybe AIDS, fool, and then your life

We got this tip on some new fresh bait  
Money in their heads and they could hardly wait  
My girls went to their room to make the play  
Two suckers at once, yeah, would make my day  
Now I'm outside some suckers walk up  
Talkin? real hard about smokin? my butt

Maybe he?ll let me work with him? Ssh

To my brothers in the game, my brothers  
Who are out there doin? what they feel they've got to do  
I wanna ask you one favor, let's let the young kids 10, 11, 12 years old  
Let's let them go on and do their thing at the schoolhouse

Let's give them a chance at a different life  
You doin? what you feel you have to do  
But they youngsters and they don't know any better  
So we want to give them a chance to live  
I mean life is precious, and you know that yourself  
And you try to make a better life for yourself  
So what I'm sayin? this from the bottom of my heart, let the kids be  
Help the children lead to another way  
And peace from you and I love you and I'm outta here

Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
I can't call it but I know I got started  
'Cause my mama was broke and I was broken hearted  
I can take tears and tears for years  
But the tears of my mama yo, they get me right here  
So I broke out in a military step, no deally, no dally  
I walked, I crept, I slept on a plan that I'd make it all good  
A young preacher if you could  
A young hustler from the hood  
Mama, don't you cry, don't you cry no more  
Ya baby boy's blowin' up and he's goin' to war  
My mind is playin' tricks and my dad is too  
High street bank boys, it's on, fools  
Gonna make my moves and my moves I make  
You betta not get broke 'cause if you broke, you break  
I don't hesitate that you can't see me  
It's gonna take the Lord to save you from me  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb

Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
I flipped the stress off, good, I let it rip  
Bank boys in the fat money grip, yeah  
Rollin' 5 deep and on fools we creep  
Half the town is down and you can't see me, really dough  
What's next? A young fool on a flex  
Tryin' to get a name, some props or rep  
I stepped right to him let 'em know it's all good  
Lights out, now his crib is wood  
Broke for the dough but now I can't see  
It's blood on my hands my dog, yo, G?'  
I hit the flo' but my heart didn't stop  
And now I see a vision of my son wit no pop  
My mama's on her knees  
Lord, Lord no please  
And I feel cold and my health is cheatin'  
It's gettin' dark but yet and still  
I'm half dead, half life, what's real?  
I can't breathe but now I'm startin' to choke  
Off my own blood and not that indo smoke  
No joke, straight up, on a serious tip  
I'm losin' my life, I'm losin' my grip, I slip, s-s-slip deeper still  
Help Lord, help Lord, I'm losin' my will  
To live, low, stuck at the bottom  
From winter to spring to summer to autumn  
Help Lord, the homies in the hood  
The squares, the G's, it's all good  
Help Lord 'cause in the hood we sprung  
And we stuck right here until you come  
And bless the children of the ghetto life  
No love, no hope, no hope, no life  
Help Lord, help Lord, help Lord, help Lord  
You hear me callin' Lord?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb  
Help Lord, won't You come?  
Tiddle-dee-dumb, tiddle-dee-dumb

And rolling out for mine working so hard for such a long time  
And life yes it's here and gone so pedal to the Hammer

T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
On a half shell, they're the heroes, four  
In this day and age who could ask for more?  
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious  
Our police and detective are furious  
'Cause they can't find the source  
Of this lethally evil force  
This is serious, so give me a quarter  
I was a witness, get me a reporter  
Call April O'Neil in on this case, and  
You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste  
We need help, like quick, on the double  
Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble  
We need heroes like the lone ranger  
When tonto came pronto, when there was danger  
They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour  
'Cause they displayed  
Turtle power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
Now, our miss reporter was hot on the trail  
Determined to put these crooks in jail  
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened  
But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught  
Yeah, she was all alone  
With no friends and no phone  
Now, this was beyond her worst dreams  
'Cause she was concerned by some wayward teens  
Headed by shredder, they were anything but good  
Misguided, unloved, they called them, the foot  
They could terrorize and be angry youth, and  
They mugged the people who needed proof?  
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound  
Shouted, "Cowabunga", as they hit the ground  
From the field of weeds, the heroes rescued the flower  
'Cause they possessed  
Turtle power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
T-you-are-t-l-e power  
Teenage mutant ninja turtle  
Do you stand for what you believe in?  
And find the strength to do what's right?  
That's turtle power  
Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission  
When there's a battle, got the enemy wishin'  
That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'  
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin'  
They were once normal but now they're mutants  
Splinter's the teacher, so, they are the students  
Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Donatello  
Make up this group with one other follow  
Raphael, he's the leader of the group  
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop  
Pizza's the food, that's sure to please  
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese  
Back to the story, it's not hard to find  
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind  
These are the words that their master instructed  
But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted  
That was the last straw, spring into action  
Step on the foot, now they're gonna lose traction  
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice  
Your shell is hard, so you shout, "They can't dust us", four  
Like some old coffee table  
Since you were young, you've been willing and able  
To defeat the snake, protect the weak  
Fight for rights and the freedom to speak  
Now the villain is showin', so you take a stand  
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand  
Remember the words of your teacher, your master  
"Evil moves fast, but good moves faster"  
Then light, shining for your illumination  
Good versus evil equals confrontation  
So when you're in trouble, don't give in and go sour  
Try to rely on your  
Turtle power
