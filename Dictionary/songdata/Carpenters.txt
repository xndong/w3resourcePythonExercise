Every night I get tired eyes  
  
My feet don't reach the ground  
  
Then I'm with you  
  
I get by 'cause I know that you're near me  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
  
  
Every night when the fire flies  
  
The walls come tumblin' down at the Bajou  
  
I get by 'cause I know that you're near me  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
  
  
I'll keep singin' my love song  
  
In my mind I'll sing a song for you  
  
You can see through the music  
  
That's in my mind  
  
So baby close your eyes  
  
I can sleep tonight  
  
All because of you  
  
All because of you  
  
All because of you

And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
He wouldn't think to make it rain  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes me sigh  
He doesn't have a point of view  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
  
And when he smiles he makes the sun shine  
And warms the day with morning dew  
Happiness runs in the family  
And he's a boy from the good old earth and the high tree forest  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  
And he's just about the happiest boy that I ever knew  

Poured the goldfish bowl into daddy's hat,  
Then I painted stripes on the family cat,  
Broke two teeth only yesterday,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
In department stores, do it "just because",  
Pull the whiskers off of the Santy Claus,  
I bite his leg and I run away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
Daddy laughs, he bends in half,  
When I wear angel hair,  
But wait until he takes a spill,  
My halo's on the stair.  
  
Well, I gotta go, before the mailman stops,  
And he feels that glue in the letter box,  
See you all when it's Christmas Day,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
Made a snowman holding a Christmas wreath,  
Used my grandpa's specs, and my grandma's teeth.  
Cut the hair off my dad's toupee,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
And in school today, brought a jar of ants,  
You should see my teacher do a dance.  
Hope she don't take my part away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.  
  
I put on my angel gown,  
And boy, did momma laugh,  
She didn't guess, it was her best dress,  
The one I cut in half.  
  
On the roof today, gave 'em all a scare,  
I put on my wings, tried to fly through the air.  
Hope that bump's gonna go away,  
I'm the angel in the Christmas play.

The moon that rose now descended  
  
And the love once shared now had ended  
  
And soon the day would come  
  
  
And when the day had come  
  
The light that fell at dawn was cold  
  
The warmth of you had gone  
  
A taste of loneliness  
  
Cut through the earliness  
  
And oh the winds sang of you  
  
Softly they said  
  
All of my favorite dreams were dead  
  
Leaving a cloud of sadness in my head  
  
And though I'm buried in  
  
A sad song of the morning wind  
  
I know the day would bring  
  
Another song for me to sing  
  
  
But when the day had come  
  
The light that fell at dawn was cold  
  
The warmth of you had gone  
  
Go-o-o-ne  

It's not the way you smile  
That touches my heart  
It's not the way you kiss  
That tears me apart  
Many, many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Can't help myself  
'Cause baby it's you  
  
You should hear what they say about you  
They say you've never  
Never, never been true  
Oh! Oh! Oh!  
Doesn't matter what they say  
I'm gonna love you any old way  
What can I do  
When it's true  
Don't want nobody  
'Cause baby it's you  
  
Many, many, many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Can't help myself  
'Cause baby it's you

Children, it was more fun to be children  
We just took life as it happened  
Run through the days, don't look behind  
Over wink of an eye and it's over  
What a surprise to discover  
We were people ourselves  
What kind of people did we want to be?  
No answer ever came to me  
I didn't sleep at all last night  
Mom, I've come to you like yesterday  
About today, mom, I'm afraid  
Hon, come and sit by my side  
Listen to me, words come so hard  
But what my heart says I will give you  
Because you are in love  
Your eyes begin to open  
As if you had awaken from a sleep  
Because you are in love  
You use imagination  
And lose your concentration  
When someone drops his name  
You're back in his arms as always  
Your day dreams work out that way  
It's all just a trick you mind plays  
The more love grows  
The more it says the same  
(Same little girl who's frightened)  
But I love him so  
(Same little girl who's sure)  
That she loves him so  
(Sees with a woman's vision)  
(Knows what a woman knows)  
Because we are in love  
We reach for our tomorrows  
And know we won't be lonely  
In laughter and in sorrows  
Where love abides  
There is the place we'll keep our hope forever  
You and I, because we are in love  
Because we won't be lonely  
In laughter and in sorrows  
When love abides  
There is the place we'll keep our home forever  
You and I, because we are in love  

You're up state, up late, and city fed  
I'm a california label  
From the top of my head,  
Forever, ah  
See a lot of open sky  
When the sun goes down  
There's a hot, lot of loving when you come  
Around, to free me, ah  
  
In a boat to sail, boat to sail, away, ah  
All those letters mailed from a  
Boat to sail, away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
  
Bare foot, coconut and supermild  
Jamaica take a look  
At your own child  
Forget not  
Brian wilson songs are never left behind  
Don't you worry baby, you're a friend of mine  
For so long  
  
From a boat to sail, boat to sail, away ah  
All those letters mailed, from a  
Boat to sail, away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
We are riding in a boat to sail  

You tell me that you're leavin',  
I can't believe it's true!  
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.  
Don't take your love away from me.  
Don't you leave my heart in misery.  
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
Remember when you held me tight,  
And you kissed me all through the night.  
Think of all that we been through,  
And breakin' up is hard to do.  
  
They say that breakin' up is hard to do,  
Now I know, I know that it's true.  
Don't say that this is the end.  
Instead of breakin' up I wish that  
We were makin' up again.  
  
I beg of you don't say goodbye,  
Can't we give our love just one more try?  
Come on baby, let's start anew,  
Breakin' up is hard to do.

Don't you ever invite your boyfriend here  
  
I like to be here alone  
  
You just answer the door and feed the deer  
  
And fight the telephone  
  
Got to learn these words and I know you will  
  
Or I'll send you right back to Guayaquil  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home  
  
  
  
Got to peel your eyes for the heat my dear  
  
You got to froth and foam  
  
Got to send away the mad puppeteer  
  
Who seems to think this is home  
  
I want you to speak the English right  
  
I want you to smile and be polite  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home  
  
  
  
I don't care if you drive my 350 honey  
  
Don't let'em steal my chrome  
  
I don't care if you spend all my money honey  
  
Long as you leave me alone  
  
I just want you to try and remember one thing  
  
If somebody knocks or the telephone rings  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home  
  
Say b'wana she no home, say b'wana she no home

Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year when the world falls in love

Why do birds suddenly appear  
Every time you are near?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
Why do stars fall down from the sky  
Every time you walk by?  
Just like me, they long to be  
Close to you  
On the day that you were born the angels got together  
And decided to create a dream come true  
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair  
Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue  
That is why all the girls in town

Druscilla Penny what a name.  
Are you sure you didn't make it up yourself.  
You're very pretty, yes you are, but with all the junk you wear it's hard to
tell.  
  
Man you must work hard to get your hair to look like that.  
I don't need a horoscope to tell me where you're at.  
Your family's probably given up on you  
Since you began to follow groups of long - haired rock and rollers.  
I can hear your mother crying for her daughter  
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny what a girl.  
Where's the purpose to the crazy life you lead.  
It doesn't matter after all you're so sure that instant love is all you tell.  
  
I've seen your face at least a thousand times,  
You're always standing there behind the stages at the concerts.  
Waiting for an offer to be with someone after.  
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny how's your head.  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the night.  
It isn't easy, for a girl when she can't decide if love is wrong or right.  
I hope I live to see a change.  
Could you ever really love, ever really care?  
Ever really get it together?  
No!

Echo  
By Tom Petty  
  
Put down your things and rest awhile  
You know we've both nowhere to go  
Yeah, daddy had to crash  
He was always halfway there you know  
And no, I don't pretend there's any more of that  
They say one day, you'll look up and laugh and hear  
  
The same sad echo when you walk  
Yeah, the same sad echo when you talk loud and clear  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here  
  
I promise you this winter  
I will worship you like gold  
And ride your train forever  
Electric fortunes to be told  
And I don't want to question or even celebrate  
All the joy you took and then gave back too late  
  
It's the same sad echo when you lie  
It's the same sad echo when you try to be clear  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here  
  
Well, I woke up right here  
In a pool of sweat  
With a box of pills and you  
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep my head  
I'm gonna keep my cool  
Oh, I'm so in love with you  
Yes and in another world nothing was like this  
There may have been a girl  
There never was a kiss  
  
The poison came in liquid  
She was naked all the time  
And no one could explain it  
It was all between the lines  
And I don't seem to trust anyone no more  
It could be faith I'm just not sure  
  
It's the same sad echo every day  
Yeah the same sad echo another way  
When you call  
It's the same as the same sad echo most of all  
  
Well you just got tired  
You just gave in  
You took it hard  
Then you just quit  
You let me down  
You dropped the ball  
You fell on your face most of all  
And I don't want to mean anything to you  
I don't want to tempt you to be true  
  
It's the same sad echo comin' down  
It's the same sad echo all around in my ears  
It's the same as the same sad echo around here

Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Was a day that we all waited for  
  
When it drifted to and frost  
  
Why you should've seen the snow  
  
It was near seven feet or more  
  
By the old barn door  
  
  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
What a joy for a boy to behold  
  
In each house you'll find a sleigh  
  
That was waiting for this day  
  
And of course, down the road a hill  
  
For each Jack and Jill  
  
  
  
Every winter breeze that scurries  
  
Sets the snowflakes up in flurries  
  
It's the good old sentimental season when  
  
Folks put runners on their surreys  
  
And forget about their worries  
  
When a man becomes a boy once again  
  
  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Jingle bells bring us spells ever dear  
  
Under wintry skies of gray  
  
It was snowing all the day  
  
And it showed no signs of stopping  
  
Every kid with eyes of popping  
  
Will soon be belly-whopping on his ear  
  
  
  
On the first snowfall of the winter  
  
Oh the first snowfall of the year  
  
The first snow of the year  
  
Is just about the best snow  
  
Well I'll say any snow  
  
Is a pretty good show

Love, look at the two of us  
Strangers in many ways  
We've got a lifetime to share  
So much to say and as we go from day to day  
I'll feel you close to me  
But time alone will tell  
Let's take a lifetime to say  
I knew you well  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow for all we know  
  
Love, look at the two of us  
Strangers in many ways  
Let's take a lifetime to say

Well, she got her daddy's car  
And she cruised through the hamburger stand, now  
Seems she forgot all about the library  
Like she told her old man, now  
And with the radio blastin' goes cruisin'  
Just as fast as she can, now  
  
And she'll have fun, fun, fun  
Till her daddy takes the T-bird away  
  
Well, you knew all along that your dad  
Was gettin' wise to you, now  
(Should'na lied now, should'na lied)  
And since he took your set of keys, you've been  
Thinkin' that your fun is all through, now  
(Should'na lied now, should'na lied)  
But you can come along with me 'cause we  
Got a lot a things to do, now  
  
And we'll have fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away  
  
Fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away  
  
Fun, fun, fun  
Now that daddy took the T-bird away

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Fear not said the angel  
Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a savior  
Of the pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him  
From Satan's power and might  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeled down  
And to the Lord did pray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day

Hey now don't let your empty room ever get you down  
You can fill the silence with a smile  
And don't let the crowds on the street  
Make you feel like you are just a stranger in town  
If you feel happy,  
Or if you wanna weep,  
Or you wanna warm word before you sleep  
  
Remember,  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are for keeps  
  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are for keeps  

No one in the world  
Ever had a love as sweet as my love  
For nowhere in the world  
Could there be a boy as true as you love  
All my love  
I give gladly to you  
All your love  
You give gladly to me  
Tell me why then  
Oh why should it be that.  
  
We go on hurting each other  
We go on hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Hurting each other  
Without ever knowing why.  
  
Closer than the leaves  
On a weepin' willow, baby, we are  
Closer dear are we  
Than the simple letters "A" and "be" are  
All my life  
I could love only you  
All your life  
You could love only me  
Tell me why then  
Oh why should it be that.  
  
We go on hurting each other  
We go on hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Hurting each other  
Without ever knowing why.  
  
Can't we stop hurting each other  
Gotta stop hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Breaking each other's heart  
Tearing each other apart.

I believe you  
When you say that you will reach into the sky  
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger  
I believe you  
Baby, I believe you  
  
I believe you  
When you say that every time that we make love  
Will be the first time we've made love  
And every act of love will please you  
Baby, I believe you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to  
Just ask me and I'll marry you  
You don't have to sell me  
Cause you overwhelm me  
I've made up my mind for a life time  
I believe you  
When you swear your love will keep on growin' strong  
And that forever isn't long enough to love me like you need to  
Baby, I believe you  
Baby, I believe you  
Honey, I love you  
  
Blind faith makes me follow you  
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to

I believe you

And that forever isn't long enough to love me like you need to

Honey, I love you  
  
I believe you  
When you say you'll fill my body with your soul  
And love will grow into a freckled little girl  
Who looks like we do  
Baby, I believe you

I have always been a dreamer  
Followed visions of my own  
I was born to belong  
To the lines of a song  
And make then my home  
  
I believe in happy endings  
Though I've only known a few  
For as rare as they are  
Like a bright falling star  
I found one in you  
  
Sometimes  
All the world can seem so  
Friendless  
And the road ahead so  
Endless  
And the dream so far away  
Sometimes  
When I'm almost  
To surrender  
Then I stop  
And I remember  
I have you  
To save my day  
  
Often my imagination  
Has me reaching out too far  
When I fell you were there  
With you hand in the air  
You knew from the start  
  
Sometimes  
After all you've done  
To save me  
Thru the love you freedly  
Gave me  
Every step along the way  
Sometimes  
People ask what keeps me  
Going  
And in truth, it comes from  
Knowing  
I have you  
To save my day  
  
Sometimes  
Feelng helpless  
When I held you  
Wishing words would come  
To tell you  
I have you  
To save my day

Dreamin', I must be dreamin'  
Or am I really lyin' here with you  
  
Baby, you take me in your arms  
And though I'm wide awake  
I know my dream is comin' true  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
Magic, it must be magic  
The way I hold you and the night just seems to fly  
Easy, for you to take me to a star  
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
And, oh, I just fall in love again  
Just one touch and then it happens every time  
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you  
  
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you

The hardest thing I've ever done  
Is keep believing  
There's someone in this crazy world  
For me  
The way that people come and go  
Through temporary lives  
My chance could come and I might never know  
  
I used to say "No promises,  
Let's keep it simple"  
But freedom only helps you say  
Good-bye  
It took a while for me to learn  
That nothin' comes for free  
The price I've paid is high enough for me  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find  
  
So here I am with pockets full of good intentions  
But none of them will comfort me tonight  
I'm wide awake at four a.m.  
Without a friend in sight  
Hanging on a hope but I'm alright  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find  
  
I know I need to be in love  
I know I've wasted too much time  
I know I ask perfection of  
A quite imperfect world  
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

Day after day, I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care, you're always there  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
So many times when the city seems to be  
Without a friendly face, a lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Trouble seems to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near  
When you're near, my love  
  
If all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind, just  
Hard to find  
One look at you and I know  
That I must learn to live without the rest  
I've found the best  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you

I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know  
  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
  
Please, have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

When I first saw you my heart said, "yes"  
You'd be the one to cure my loneliness  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
  
I see you everyday you say "hello"  
But I can't say a word  
I love you so  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
  
I love you so, but you will never know  
You think I'm just a friend, that all I'll ever be, I know  
  
I just a dreamer, it's nothing new  
But still I hope someday they'll all come true  
And so every night I pray,  
Pray that some day you will say  
Pray that you'll say you love me and then I'll be yours  
Say you'll love me and then I'll be yours  

It's Christmas time and time for a carol  
Time to sing about the little King  
To fill the bowl and roll out the barrel  
Have ourselves a fling  
  
We greet a friend or welcome a stranger  
Let him sing or cheer him on his way  
And celebrate the child in the manger  
Born on Christmas day  
  
Good cheer for you and for me  
With pleasure and glee to share  
Oh, we're so happy to be together  
On Yuletide square  
  
It looks like snow  
And falls like snow  
Take a moment  
Take a look around and say  
As snowflakes fall  
Merry Christmas to one and all

Take a moment

Merry Christmas to one and all

It's gonna take some time this time  
To get myself in shape.  
I really fell out of line this time,  
I really missed the gate.  
The birds on the telephone like, (next time)  
Are cryin' out to me, (next time)  
And I won't be so blind next time,  
And I'll find some harmony.  
  
But it's going to take some time this time,  
And I can't make demands.  
But, like the young trees in the winter time,  
I'll learn how to bend.  
After all the tears we've spent,  
How could we make amends?  
So, it's one more round for experience  
And I'm on the road again,  
And it's going to take some time this time!  
  
But it's going to take some time this time,  
No matter what I've planned.  
And, like the young trees in the winter time,  
I'll learn how to bend.  
After all the tears we've spent,  
How could we make amends?  
So, it's one more round for experience  
And I'm on the road again,  
And it's going to take some time this time!  

Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
O'er the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells in bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells  
Jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells  
Jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh

Mm--"Is she really going out with him?  
"Well, there she is, Let's ask her"  
"Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?"  
"Mm-hm"  
"Gee, it must be great riding with him"  
"Is he picking you up after school today?"  
"Mm-mm"  
"By the way, where did you meet him?"  
  
"I met him at the candy store  
He turned around and smiled at me  
You get the picture  
"Yes, we see"  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
My folks were always putting him down  
They said he came from the wrong side of town  
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad  
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
One day my dad said find someone new  
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through  
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry  
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack  
  
Do do  
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye  
The tears were beginning to show  
As he drove away on that rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,  
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!  
  
I felt so helpless, what could I do  
Remembering all the things we'd been through?  
In school they all stop and stare  
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care  
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack  
  
Ooh, the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone  
the leader of the pack now he's gone

When the morning sunrise  
Becomes a magic show  
Before your very eyes  
And all the sounds of life  
Begin to harmonize  
You hear a song of hope  
Surround your senses  
And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world  
Lose your defenses  
Unlock your mind  
Unwind and follow me  
Come let me help you see  
How to find the way to leave yesterday behind  
  
We should be together  
When we're this close we're bound to work it out somehow  
We found a dream to share  
Don't lose it now  
Just let my song of love  
Surround your senses  
And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world  
Lose your defenses  
Unlock your mind  
You know I love you  
(Love you)  
Come let me show you  
(show you)  
How to find the way to leave yesterday behind

Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've bought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!  
Let It Snow!

Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?  
Little alter boy, for I have gone astray  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
  
Little alter boy, I wonder could you ask your lord  
Ask him, alter boy, to take my sins away  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
  
Lift up your voice and send a prayer above  
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love  
Now I know my life has been all wrong  
Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong  
  
Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me?  
Could you tell our lord I'm gonna change my ways today?  
What must I do to be holy like you?  
Little alter boy, oh, let me hear you pray  
Little alter boy please let me hear you pray

I'm gonna wake you up early  
Cause I'm gonna take a ride wih you  
We're going down to the Honda shop  
I'll tell you what we're gonna do  
Put on a ragged sweat shirt  
I'll take you anywhere you want me to  
  
First gear it's all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster (it's all right)  
  
He climbs hills like the magic  
Cause my Honda felt really light  
When I go into the turn  
Stick with me and hang on tight  
I better turn on the lights  
So I can ride my Honda tonight  
  
First gear it's all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster (it's all right)

Talk about love  
How it makes life complete  
You can talk all you want  
Make it sound good and sweet  
But the words have an empty ring  
And they don't really mean a thing  
Without love you are not to be found  
You are not to be found  
  
[Chorus]  
For love is surrender  
You must surrender if you care  
You must surrender if you dare  
  
Shout about love  
Then the wars will all end  
You can shout "we're all brothers",  
And even pretend  
But you can't cover up the past  
Just pretending will never last  
Without love you are nothing at all  
You are nothing at all, huh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Dare!

We fell in love  
On the first night that we met  
Together  
We've been happy  
I have very few regrets  
The ordinary problems  
Have not been hard to face  
But lately little changes  
Have been slowly taking place  
You're always finding something  
Is wrong in what I do  
But you can't rearrange my life  
Because it pleases you  
  
You've got love me  
For what I am  
For simply being me  
Don't love me  
if what you intend  
Or hope that I will be  
And if you're only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
You're really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
If what you want  
Isn't natural for me  
I won't pretend to keep you  
What I am I have to be  
The picture of perfection  
Is only in your mind  
For all your expectations  
Love can never be designed  
We either take each other  
For ev'rything we are  
Or leave the life  
We've made behind  
And make another start  
  
You've got love me  
For what I am  
For simply being me  
Don't love me  
if what you intend  
Or hope that I will be  
And if you're only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
You're really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
And if you're only using me  
To feed your fantasy  
You're really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free  
  
You're really not in love  
So let me go  
I must be free

We've tried our hand  
At love before  
We've been around the game enough  
To know the score'  
But then is then  
And now is now  
And now is all that matters anyhow  
  
[Chorus]  
Make believe it's your first time  
Leave your sadness behind  
Make believe it's your first time  
And I'll make believe it's mine  
  
The door is closed  
It's you and me  
We'll take our time with love  
The way it oughta be  
This moment's ours  
Tonight's the night  
And if we fall in love  
Well, that's alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So close your eyes  
And hold me close  
And let our hearts pretend  
That love is ours to share tonight  
And it might never end  
  
[Chorus]

Maybe it's you  
Maybe it's me  
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea  
Maybe it's just that I've never been  
The kind who can pass a lucky penny by  
  
Maybe it's wise  
Maybe it's not  
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I'd forgot  
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way  
That you smile whenever I'm around  
  
Rising on the shore  
The ocean came  
Walks along the waves of velveteen  
His only thought  
Was love for me  
  
Couldn't we stay?  
Or must we go  
Couldn't we stay?  
And watch the splashing rock we throw  
Only a fool would want to leave this paradise  
That I find whenever you're around  
Only a fool  
  
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way  
That you smile whenever I'm around  
Rising on the shore  
The ocean's King  
Walks along the waves of velveteen  
His only thought  
Was love for me  
  
Couldn't we stay?  
Or must you go  
Couldn't we stay?  
And watch the splashing rocks we throw  
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise  
That I find whenever you're around  
Only a fool  
Only a fool

Greeting cards have all been sent  
The Christmas rush is through  
But I still have one wish to make  
A special one for you  
  
Merry Christmas Darling  
We're apart that's true  
But I can dream and in my dreams  
I'm Christmasing with you  
  
Holidays are joyful  
There's always something new  
But ev'ryday's a holiday  
When I'm near to you  
  
The lights on my tree  
I wish you could see  
I wish it ev'ry day  
Logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you Merry Christmas  
Happy New Year too  
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
  
The logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you Merry Christmas  
Happy New Year too  
I've just one wish on this Christmas eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you

Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
May I have a moment with you  
Because there is something I've got to say  
And please don't let it scare you away  
  
Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
I have seen you go through a day  
You're everything a robot lives for  
Walk in at nine and roll out the door at five  
  
You reflect the company image  
You maintain their rules to live by  
Shine your shoes let's keep a neat haircut  
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie  
  
Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
Some day soon may realize  
You spend your life just playing a game  
Where no ones wins but everyone stays the same  
  
You reflect the company image  
You maintain their rules to live by  
Shine your shoes let's keep a neat haircut  
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie  
  
Mr. Guder  
Say! Mr. Guder  
Some day soon may realize  
You spend your life just playing a game  
Where no ones wins but everyone stays the same  
The sa-a-a-me  
  
Please!  
Play your game!  
Stay the same!

You, you're driving me wild  
You're making me fall in love  
In love with you baby, I  
I'm losing control  
I don't want to let go yet  
Till you want me  
You, you're all that I need  
You're all that I want  
And I'd sure love to love you, I  
I gotta go slow  
Keep it under control now  
Till you want me  
  
(chorus)  
But my body keeps changing my mind  
Keeps changing my heart  
When we're dancing  
My body says love you tonight  
To drive me out of my mind  
When we're dancing  
  
(Verse 1)  
Well I know it wouldn't be right  
To say take me home tonight  
But when we get to dancing  
When I see you dancing  
When it comes to dancing  
My body keeps changing my mind  
You, it's you in my heart  
It's you on my mind  
And you just can't help it  
I should give it some time  
And wait for the right sign  
That you want me  
'Cause  
  
Repeat (chorus )  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
And we fly together across the floor  
My heart's crying out for more  
Cause I just can't resist you  
  
Repeat (Verse 1)  
  
You know  
  
Repeat (chorus)

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens  
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudel  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Girls in white dresses and blue satin sashes  
Snowflakes that stay on your nose and eye lashes  
Silver white winters that melt into springs  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
When the dog bites  
When the bee stings  
When I'm feeling sad  
I simply remember my favorite things  
And then i don't feel so bad

Now, now when I wake, I don't feel cold  
Now that I have your hand to hold  
The winds might blow through me  
But I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there  
  
And now, now when we touch  
My feelings slide  
Now when I'm smiling, I know why  
You light up my world like the morning sun  
You're so deep within me we're almost one  
And now all the feelings that I have start to fade  
I was always afraid life might forget me  
Love might let me down  
Then look who I found  
  
(The winds might blow through me, but I don't care  
There's no harm in thunder if you are there)  
  
And now, now when I wake, there's someone home  
I'll never face the night alone  
You gave me the courage I need to win  
To open my heart and to let you in  
And I never really knew how until now  
Until now  
  
No, I never really knew how until now

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Saviors birth  
  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
  
So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men from the Orient land  
  
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
  
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger  
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend  
Behold your King, your King, before Him lowly bend  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His Gospel is Peace  
  
Chains shall He break for the slave Is our brother  
And in his name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we.  
Let all within us praise His holy Name  
  
Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
His power and glory evermore proclaim

One love in my young life  
Took me somewhere I had never been,  
And I want to live again, breath again  
In the shelter of his brightly woven love song.  
So long I have wanted love  
To be sitting just this near to me.  
Now my waiting here is free.  
  
Few are the choices we are given,  
The sand of time pass quickly by.  
  
One dream of my young life  
Now stands holding out his hand to me,  
Now I can't help but believe  
That my whole life will be spent in one love.

I'm going way down south to Louisiana, tonight  
Well, I'll just close my eyes  
And everything's alright  
And though I'm really far away  
I'll make my get away  
And no one need really  
Know that I've been gone  
  
One more time for the good times  
That far out weigh the bad  
One more time for the good times  
When love was all we had  
  
I'm going way down south to Baton Rouge  
Well, I'll just close the door  
And turn out all the lights  
And all the images dance by  
Of folks and friends who lie  
Back home where things are slow  
And easy going  
  
One more time for the good times  
That far out weigh the bad  
One more time for the good times  
When love was all  
When love was all  
When love was all we had  
One more time  

Everybody always asks me  
How I got to play so fine  
And friends, I'm gonna tell ya  
It really did take some time  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And a case of real bad knees  
While the other guys were out playin' with the football  
I was home bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right were I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you, and I'll try and sing right too  
  
I guess I'm really very lucky  
That I've got this thing to play  
'Cause it can really make me feel good  
Even when it's cloudy and grey  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And awful allergies that made me sneeze  
And now the other guys are out playin' with their girlfriends  
And I was still bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right where I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you  
And I'll try and sing right too  

(Stop)  
Oh yes, wait a minute Mister Postman  
(Wait)  
Wait Mister Postman  
  
Please Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
(Oh yeah)  
For me to hear from that boy of mine  
  
There must be some word today  
From my boyfriend so far away  
Pleas Mister Postman, look and see  
If there's a letter, a letter for me  
  
I've been standin' here waitin' Mister Postman  
So patiently  
For just a card, or just a letter  
Sayin' he's returnin' home to me  
  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
(Oh yeah)  
For me to hear from that boy of mine  
  
So many days you passed me by  
See the tears standin' in my eyes  
You didn't stop to make me feel better  
By leavin' me a card or a letter  
  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
(Oh yeah)  
If there's a letter in your bag for me  
(Please, Please Mister Postman)  
Why's it takin' such a long time  
  
(Why don't you check it and see one more time for me, you gotta)  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
Wait a minute  
(Mister Postman)  
Mister Postman, look and see  
  
(C'mon deliver the letter, the sooner the better)  
Mister Postman

Talkin' to myself and feelin' old  
Sometimes I'd like to quit  
Nothin' ever seems to fit  
Hangin' around  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
What I've got they used to call the blues  
Nothin' is really wrong  
Feelin' like I don't belong  
Walkin' around  
Some kind of lonely clown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you  
Nice to know somebody loves me  
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do  
Run and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me)  
  
What I feel has come and gone before  
No need to talk it out  
We know what it's all about  
Hangin' around  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
  
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do (only thing to do)  
Run and find the one who loves me  
  
What I feel has come and gone before  
No need to talk it out  
We know what it's all about  
Hangin' around  
  
Nothin' to do but frown  
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down  
Hangin' around (hangin' around)  
Nothin' to do but frown  
  
Rainy days and Mondays always get  
Me down

Looking at you  
I'm almost home again  
Something in you  
Puts me at ease  
Yes, I know that you're  
Suspicious of me  
Do I mean the things I say?  
You know I've been in love before  
That much is true  
But though I've been in love before  
It wasn't with you  
  
Ooh, Sandy  
Could we spend the day together  
You know how rainy weather  
Gets me down when I'm alone  
You, Sandy  
You gotta be a friend today  
An hour with you would  
Chase the winter away  
  
Being with you  
I'm like a child again  
Your eyes can see  
Clearer than mine  
No one ever made me quite so aware  
No one ever took the time  
The time it took surprises me  
Nothing's the same  
As if my life began again  
Hearing your name  
  
Ooh, Sandy  
Could we spend the day together?  
You know how rainy weather  
Gets me down when I'm alone  
You, Sandy  
You gotta be a friend today  
An hour with you would  
Chase the winter away

You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
Round your virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm and bright  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Son of God  
Love's pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the down of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Silver Bells  
  
Silver Bells  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Silver Bells  
  
  
  
City sidewalks  
  
Busy sidewalks  
  
Dressed in holiday style  
  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing  
  
People passing  
  
Meeting smile after smile  
  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
  
  
Silver Bells  
  
Silver Bells  
  
It's Christmas time in the city  
  
Ting-a-ling  
  
Ting-a-ling  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Hear them ring  
  
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Sing, sing a song  
Sing out loud  
Sing out strong  
Sing of good things not bad  
Sing of happy not sad.  
  
Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple to last  
Your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not  
Good enough for anyone  
Else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song.  
  
Sing, sing a song  
Let the world sing along  
Sing of love there could be  
Sing for you and for me.  
  
Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple to last  
Your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not  
Good enough for anyone  
Else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling yoo-hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a Christmas party  
At the home of Farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending  
Of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing  
Without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop  
Pop pop pop  
  
There's a happy feeling nothing  
In the world can buy  
As they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling  
Ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Let's take the road before us  
And sing another chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you

There was a man, a lonely man  
Who lost his love through his indifference  
A heart that cared, that went unchecked  
Until it died in his silence  
  
And solitaire's the only game in town  
And every road that takes him, takes him down  
And by himself, it's easy to pretend  
He'll never love again  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
  
Another day, a lonely day  
So much to say that goes unspoken  
And through the night, his sleepless nights  
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken  
  
And solitaire's the only game in town  
And every road that takes him, takes him down  
And by himself it's easy to pretend  
She's coming back again  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
  
A little hope, goes up in smoke  
Just how it goes, goes without saying  
Solitaire  
And by himself it's easy to pretend  
He'll never love again  
Ohhh  
  
And keeping to himself he plays the game  
Without her love it always ends the same  
While life goes on around him everywhere  
He's playing solitaire  
Solitaire, solitaire

Somebody's been lyin'  
Somebody's been callin' me tellin' me he still loves me  
But not the way I thought it would be  
He's makin' fun of me and laughin' at my dreams  
And I know that he keeps...  
Sayin' not to worry  
He's tellin' me to just hold on  
But he's not here to learn on  
And words won't warm my bed now he's gone  
It isn't easy letting go of what we had  
And I guess I'm just scared  
And I still believe him though  
I'd be wiser to go on my own way  
Somebody's been lyin'  
And I know you're tellin' me only the things you want to  
I guess I lie as much as you do  
It seems so funny letting go of yesterday  
Guess we're much too afraid and we're much too alone  
Were we just too much in love

Someday, rested from hours of sleeping  
We'll stay safely behind what we're keeping  
You'll seem warmer than I had remembered you  
Lying so close I'll be able to feel you breathe  
I could never leave  
  
One day, when I am able to love you  
I'll come back from wherever I've been to  
I'll see you looking the same as you always have  
Lovely, so lovely, I'll cling to the love you give  
So I'll start to live  
  
Someday is coming  
If I believe it  
Someday always brings the good life you knew  
Ever back to you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
How I need you  
Someday, all I can give you is someday  
Someday, all I can offer is someday  
Please say that you'll be waiting when someday comes  
Promise me this and a kiss, to keep what you are  
Always close to me

I met my old lover on the street last night  
He seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of girl who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
(Crazy, I'm gonna crazy, I'm gonna crazy)  
  
Four in the morning, crashed out, yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage one fine day  
But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh, still crazy  
(Baby I'm crazy through all these years)  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years  

You're always in my heart  
From early in the mornin' til it's dark  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
When I wake up in the mornin'  
And I see you there  
I always whisper a little prayer  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
If my times are bringin' me down  
You're the only one that I want around  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday  
  
And if I'm all strung out  
You're the only one who can straighten me out  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile every day  
  
I gotta know that you love me  
And that you want me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
And I gotta feel your arms around me  
And that you need me  
And that you'll always be there  
I've gotta know that you care  
  
You're always in my heart  
From early in the mornin' til it's dark  
I gotta see your sweet, sweet smile everyday

There's always one of the girls that all  
  
The guys dream about  
  
And you hold her in your heart  
  
Imagining how you'll work it out  
  
So you meet her ev'ry place you can devise  
  
'Cause from the start you knew  
  
The one she wants is you  
  
  
  
I know it's right when it comes as easy  
  
As apple pie  
  
When you just can't do it wrong  
  
She's going for ev'rything you try  
  
If she chose you over all those other guys  
  
It must be luck or simply fate  
  
But it's sure worth the wait  
  
  
  
That's the way I feel about it  
And there's no one who should ever doubt it  
You can't stop a star  
When love is on the rise  
  
  
  
That's what I believe  
  
Love could be 'round the corner  
  
All you've got to do is dream  
  
And never compromise  
  
That's what I believe  
  
  
  
I found the world in my arms the moment  
  
I lost my heart  
  
And the bond is much too strong for  
  
Anyone else to put apart  
  
So I cherish ev'ry moment that she's near  
  
You see the best things in your lives  
  
If you just close your eyes  
  
  
  
That's the way I feel about it  
  
And she maybe out there  
  
Waiting just like you  
  
'Cause at the strangest time and place  
  
You'll find you're face to face  
  
That's the way I feel about it

Why does the sun go on shining?  
Why does the sea rush to shore?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world  
'Cause you don't love me anymore?  
Why do the birds go on singing?  
Why do the stars glow above?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world  
It ended when I lost your love  
I wake up in the morning and I wonder  
Why everything is the same as it was  
I can't understand, no, I can't understand  
How life goes on the way it does  
Why does my heart go on beating?  
Why do these eyes of mine cry?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said goodbye  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said goodbye

They say that you're a run around lover  
Tho' you say it isn't so  
But if you put me down for another  
I'll know, believe me  
I'll know  
'cause the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes can't help but see  
If you aren't true to me  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes  
One of these days you're gonna be sorry  
'cause your game i'm gonna play  
And you'll find out without really trying  
Each time that my kisses stray  
That the night has a thousand eyes  
And a thousand eyes will see me through  
And no matter what i do  
I could never disguise  
All those little white lies  
'cause the night has a thousand eyes  
So remember when you tell those  
Little white lies that the night  
Has a thousand eyes

Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?  
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.  
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.  
I know they're wrong wait and see.  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.  
The lovers, the dreamers and me.  
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered when wished on the
morningstar?  
  
Someone thought of that and someone believed it.  
Look what it's done so far.  
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see?  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.  
The lovers, the dreamers and me.  
All of us under its spell.  
We know that it's probably magic.  
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?  
I've heard them calling my name.  
  
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors.  
The voice might be one and the same.  
  
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.  
It's something that I'm supposed to be.  
  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and
me.  
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and
me.

Are we really happy with  
This lonely game we play  
Looking for the right words to say  
Searching but not finding  
Understanding anyway  
We're lost in this masquerade  
  
Both afraid to say we're just too far away  
From being close together from the start  
We tried to talk it over  
But the words got in the way  
We're lost inside this lonely game we play  
  
[Chorus]  
Thoughts of leaving disappear  
Each time I see your eyes  
And no matter how hard I try  
To understand the reason  
Why we carry on this way  
And we're lost in this masquerade  
  
We tried to talk it over  
But the words got in the way  
We're lost inside this lonely game we play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're lost in a masquerade

As a child I was known for make-believing  
All alone I created fantasies  
As I grew people called it self-deceiving  
But my heart helped me hold the memories  
  
As I walk through the world I find around me  
Something new, yet familiar's in the air  
I feel it ev'rywhere  
Like a child's eyes  
On a Christmas night  
I'm lookin' at you now  
Finding answers to my prayers  
  
(1) It's a new day for those good old dreams  
One by one it seems they're comin' true  
Here's the morning that my heart had seen  
Here's the morning that just had to come through  
Same old stage but what a change of scene  
No more dark horizons, only blue  
It's a new day for those good old dreams  
All my life I dreamed of lovin' you  
  
You're a spark of a long forgotten fire  
You're a touch of a slowly growing wind  
You're a taste of the ever-changing seasons  
Telling me there are some things that don't end  
We have left all the darkness far behind us  
All those hopes that we held along the way  
Have made it to this day  
Like an old love song  
Gone for much too long  
You hear it once again  
And it carries you away  
  
Repeat (1)  
It's a new day for those good old dreams  
And It's all because of you

Such a feeling is coming over me  
There is wonder in 'most everything I see  
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes  
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream  
  
Everything I want the world to be  
Is now coming true especially for me  
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here  
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen  
  
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation  
And the only explanation I can find  
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around  
Your love's put me at the top of the world  
  
Something in the wind has learned my name  
And it's telling me that things are not the same  
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze  
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me  
  
There is only one wish on my mind  
When this day is through I hope that I will find  
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me  
All I need will be mine if you are here  
  
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation  
And the only explanation I can find  
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around  
Your love's put me at the top of the world  
  
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation  
And the only explanation I can find  
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around  
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Play us a song we can slow dance on  
We want to hold each other  
Play us a groove so we hardly move  
Just let our hearts beat together  
Oh baby, 'cause it feel so good  
When we're close like this  
Whisper is my ear and let me steal a kiss  
  
Come on and touch me  
When we're dancing  
You know you've got that loving touch  
(Loving touch)  
Touch me when we're dancing  
I want to feel you when I'm falling in love  
  
Tonight's the night and it feels so right  
My heart is saying it to me  
You're the one I've waited for so long  
So let your love flow through me  
Oh baby, 'cause it feels so good  
Just to be this close  
You've got me up so high  
I could fly coast to coast

At any moment he'll be walking through that door  
But he won't find me behind it  
'Cause the feeling is gone and just won't come back any more  
I worked so hard to find it  
  
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
All around tryin' to get the feeling again  
That one that made me shiver  
Make my knees start to quiver every time he walks in  
I've look high, low, everywhere I possibly can  
But there's just no tryin' to get the feeling again  
It seemed to disappear as fast at it came  
  
[Chorus]  
Read every book, looked, for every meditation and poem  
Just to bring home that old sweet sensation  
But it ain't no use to me to try to get the feeling again  
  
When did it leave me  
How did I come to miss use such a beautiful bonnet  
But baby believe me, I've done everything I can do  
But somehow it's no returnin'  
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
Like a bloodhound searching for a long lost friend  
Could you help me rediscover  
The way to re-be his lover once again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to get that feeling again

I guess you know what it's all about  
All the answers seem so clear to you  
You know just exactly what do you want to do  
And never allow a feeling of doubt  
I guess you see where your road can lead  
And all the pain that you have in store  
For now you have chosen to lock every door  
And find on your own what you think you need  
(Think you need)  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll still be calling your name  
And if I tried to show you how  
Tomorrow is never like yesterday  
Would you change your mind and see things my way  
(Try and and see things my way)  
Or are you afraid that I'll bring you down?  
(Bring you down)  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  
Turn away, find a way of your own  
I'll be here waiting for you to say  
Turn away, find a way, your own  
(Turn away)  
I'll still be calling your name  

We've only just begun to live  
White lace and promises  
A kiss for luck and we're on our way  
(We've only begun)  
  
Before the risin' sun, we fly  
So many roads to choose  
We'll start out walkin' and learn to run  
And yes, we've just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us  
Workin' together day to day  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes, we smile  
So much of life ahead  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow  
And yes, we've just begun  
  
Sharing horizons that are new to us  
Watching the signs along the way  
Talkin' it over, just the two of us  
Workin' together day to day  
Together  
Together  
  
And when the evening comes, we smile  
So much of life ahead  
We'll find a place where there's room to grow  
And yes, we've just begun

What child is this layed to rest  
While Mary's man is sleeping  
Whom angles greet with anthems sweet  
While shepards watch their king  
  
Why lies he in such lowly place  
While cows and sheep are feeding  
Good christian fear for sinners here  
A silent word is pleeding  
  
Chorus  
This This is christ the King  
Whom shepards guard and angles sing  
Hast hast to bring him praise  
The baby son of mary  
  
  
So bring him insence, gold, and myrrh  
Come peasant King to owe him  
The king of kings salvation bring  
That loving hearts inthrone  
  
Chorus  
This this is christ the king  
Whom Shepards guard and angles sing  
Hast Hast to bring him praise  
The baby son of Mary

Maybe I'm old fashioned feeling as I do  
Maybe I'm just living in the part  
But when I meet the right one, I know I'll be true  
My first love will be my last  
When I fall in love, it will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before it's begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
When I give me heart, it will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
And the moment I can fell that you fell that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you

Sleigh bells ring  
  
Are you listening  
  
In the lane  
  
Snow is glistening  
  
A beautiful sight  
  
We're happy tonight  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
  
Here to stay is a new bird  
  
He songs a love song  
  
As we go along  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
  
He'll say are you married?  
  
We'll say no man  
  
But you can do the job  
  
While you're in town  
  
  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
  
As we dream by the fire  
  
To face unafraid  
  
The plans that we made  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland

When I was young I'd listen to the radio  
Waitin' for my favorite songs  
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile  
  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago  
How I wondered where they'd gone  
But they're back again just like a long lost friend  
All the songs I loved so well  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine  
  
When they get to the part  
Where he's breakin' her heart  
It can really make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by  
And the good times that I had  
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.  
  
It was songs of love that I would sing to then  
And I'd memorize each word  
Those old melodies still sound so good to me  
As they melt the years away  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
(All the oldies but goodies)  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine  
  
All my best memories come back clearly to me  
Some can even make me cry, just like before  
It's yesterday once more  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine  
  
Every sha-la-la-la  
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines  
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine

You are the one who makes me happy  
When everything else turns to grey  
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings  
And sends me out into the day  
You are the crowd that sits quiet  
Listening to me  
And all the mad sense that i make  
  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true  
How could anyone mean more to me than you  
  
Sorry if sometimes i look past you  
There's no one beyond your eyes  
Inside my head wheels are turning  
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise  
You are my heart and my soul my inspiration  
Just like the old love song goes  
  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true  
How could anyone mean more to me than you

Just take some loneliness  
And add a tear or two  
Throw in some emptiness  
Mix 'till you're bluer than blue  
Keep it all under cover  
Next to your broken dreams  
When you're through  
Then you'll know how I  
Sit alone and cry  
As the nights go by  
Makes you wanta die  
Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
Your baby doesn't love you anymore  
Your baby doesn't love you anymore  
  
You try to make believe  
It doesn't bother you  
For your own sake believe  
You'll make it through  
Just make a vow ev'ry morning  
That today you will change  
Your point of view  
But it's all a game  
That you play in vain  
And you live in pain  
Cuz it's very plain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And there's nothin' that you can do  
But just break down and cry  
It's over for you  
When  
  
[Chorus]

Ev'ry night, ev'ry day  
You're the one I always dream of  
Ev'ry line of your face  
Is sketched so plain inside my heart  
You've grown so deep inside of me  
You're everything I feel and see  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
All my life, all my love  
I can feel when you're beside me  
All that's right, all that's wrong  
Suddenly becomes so clear  
My heart has overtaken me  
With feelings you awake in me  
And you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
Only you could move me enough to believe in love one more time  
All I need to know for tomorrow is that you're mine  
Mine for a lifetime  
  
If our friends all around  
Find it hard to understand us  
You and I understand the other one so very well  
And that's what I've been looking for  
So I keep coming back for more  
'Cause you're the one, you're the one I love  
  
You're the one, you're the one I love
