Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her into your heart,  
Then you can start to make it better.  
  
Hey Jude, don't be afraid  
You were made to go out and get her  
The minute you let her under your skin,  
Then you begin to make it better  
  
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,  
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders  
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool  
By making his world a little colder  
  
Hey Jude, don't let me down  
You have found her, now go and get her  
Remember to let her into your heart,  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin  
You're waiting for someone to perform with  
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do  
The movement you need is on your shoulder  
  
Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her under your skin,

Will you have whiskey with your water  
Or sugar with your tea?  
What are these crazy questions  
That they're asking of me?  
This is the wildest party that there ever could be  
Oh, don't turn on the light 'cause I don't want to see  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said, "That ain't no way to have fun"  
  
Open up the window, let some air into this room  
I think I'm almost choking on the smell of stale perfume  
And that cigarette you're smoking 'bout to scare me half to death  
Open up the window, let me catch my breath  
  
The radio is blasting, someone's beating on the door  
Our hostess is not lasting - she's out on the floor  
I seen so many things here I ain't never seen before  
I don't know what it is - but I don't wanna see no more  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama said, "That ain't no way to have fun"

I got to have all your love, night and day.  
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar  
  
[Chorus]  
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.  
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.  
  
Don' t be led in the wrong direction.  
To start this thing off right,  
A man need a little love and affection,  
Yes he do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right. Lookie here,  
We got to bring it all down, start getting it right.  
We got to stop this messing around,  
And keep the thing up tight,  
Yes we do, now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All right, sugar.  
Got to have a hundred,  
Got to have a hundred.  
All right.  
Ooh, I must do, I must do,  
I must do now.  
  
Oh! Got to have a hundred!  
Got to have a hundred!  
Oh! Got to have a hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hundred, too right.  
Got to have a hundred, now. Oh

The night was clear and the moon was yellow  
And the leaves came tumbling down  
  
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark  
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' in the dark  
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late  
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight  
  
Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that"  
"You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat"  
Stagger Lee started off goin' down that railroad track  
He said "I can't get you Billy but don't be here when I come back"  
  
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four  
Said "I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe"  
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door  
He said "Nobody move" and he pulled his forty-four  
  
Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh he shot that poor boy so bad  
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass

Yes, sometimes it seems that I don't care  
Don't worry 'bout it, baby, don't you never, never, never fear  
That's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yes, it is, yes, it is, child  
  
One more thing, I know I buy you so many fancy things  
When you already have so much, you just can hardly find room enough  
But that's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yes, it is, yes, it is, child  
  
If I had to leave you and go away, you know what?  
I'd write you a letter each and every day  
One more thing, I know you get so tired of me callin' you on the phone  
But that's a man's way of sayin' you just don't wanna be all alone  
  
If you give me a million things to do, you know what?  
I'd do them all, baby, just to get back home to you  
That's a man's way, oh, that's a man's way  
(That's a man's way)  
Of lovin' you, yeah  
(That's a man's way)  
  
Yes, it is  
(That's a man's way)  
A real man's way  
(That's a man's way)

You're so fine, You're so fine, your mine  
Baby you're mine, oh yeah  
Well I walk and I talk about you  
I love you, I love you  
And I need you, Oh, by my side  
Alright, Well, I walk and I talk about you  
Well there's nothing in this world  
Sweet as your lips, you're so fine,you're so fine  
Every time we meet, my heart skips a beat  
You're my first cup of coffee, (chorus- My last cup of coffee)  
You're so fine,so fine, baby you're mine  
alright, all the time, Oh yes you is  
Well I walk and I talk about you  
Alright now, yeah, alright  
You're so fine you're so fine baby  
Oh, yeah oh oh, you're mine all the time  
Oh yeah, well I walk and I talk about you  
You know I walk, oh I talk  
Talk about you baby, one more time  
I walk and I talk, talk about you baby  
You know that I walk  
(fade)
