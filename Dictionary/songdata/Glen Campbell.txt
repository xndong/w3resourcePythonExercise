Ad-or-a-tion, Ad-or-a-tion  
Baby when will you-ou ge-et your-our-our-our fill  
Ad-you-la-tion, Ad-you-la-tion  
You know baby I don't thi-ink you-ou-ou ever will  
You're always talkin' about just livin' for the mo-oment 'n  
Bein' a romantic in you, you talk about freedom  
But you don't know what freedom i-is  
No you don't know where freedom li-i-i-ives  
  
You, you don't know, exactly what you fee-ee-ee-ee-ee-eel  
No-o you-ou, a-you don't know-ow, exactly what is rea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eal  
But I'm gonna show you how it feels  
To feel goodbye-hye  
  
Des-o-la-tion, Des-o-la-tion  
You finally brought it down to the same fore-ore-oreground  
Des-per-a-tion, Des-per-a-tion  
You don't know how crazy you-ou-ou-ou sound  
You're always talkin' about, my like o' class  
The way I, hold my glass  
And even though the way I smoke 'n  
Lord I didn't even smo-oke

But I, I met you, and you had to change my hair-air-air-air-air-hair  
And I-I, I met you-ou, and you had to show me what to wear-ear-ear-ear  
But I'm gonna show you how it feels  
To feel goodbye-hye....

You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
You say you want  
Your story to remain untold  
  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you'll give me  
A highway with no one on it  
Treasure just to look upon it  
All the riches in the night  
  
You say you'll give me  
Eyes in a moon of blindness  
A river in a time of dryness  
A harbor in the tempest  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you want  
Your love to work out right  
To last with me through the night  
  
You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
Your story to remain untold  
Your love not to grow cold  
  
All the promises we break  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You, all I want is,  
You, all I want is,  
You, all I want is,  
You

Today I may not have a thing at all except for just a dream or two  
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you  
Right now it may not seem like spring at all we're drifting and the laughs are
few  
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you  
No one knows better than I that love keeps passing me by that way  
But with you there at my side I'll soon be turning the tide just away  
As long as I've got arms to cling at all it's you I'll be clinging to  
And all the dreams I dream beg or borrow on some bright tomorrow will all come
true  
And all my tomorrows belong to you  
As long as I've got arms to cling at all...  
  
  

And I love you so, the people ask me how  
How I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know  
I guess, they understand, how lonely life it's been  
But life began again the day you took my hand  
And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evenin' get me down  
Now that you're around me  
And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do  
The book of life is brief and watch the pages with  
All but love is there, that is my belief  
And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I won't let the evenin' get me down  
As long as you're around me  

And the World Keeps Spinning  
Well, I never thought that I could make it alone  
Thought I would die but I seem to carry on  
And I thought my life would surely leave  
And, though almost, I have not ceased to be  
And even though I thought I lost everything  
Today I found that the birds still sing in the morning  
And the world keeps spinning 'round  
And the world keeps spinning 'round  
When someone says goodbye, another dream ends  
And just before you give up another dream begins  
Someone changed their mind, tears fall to the ground  
But you know that one man's smile is another's frown  
And the table will turn someday, that's how life is  
I have no doubt 'cause you know that time don't stand still  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round  
Dawn will find me here and I think about  
One that I thought I couldn't live without  
One day she was here, the next day gone  
But the love that was never clear was just alone  
And how can you lose something you only thought  
That you found so you wipe away the tears with a smile  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
All the world keeps spinning 'round  
  

I know I'll never meet another hunk of woman like my Ann  
'Cause she makes me feel like a great big man  
I'm a gonna go tell her mama what I think about her say thank you ma'am  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape  
Of her neck she's packed like a seed in a grape she's smooth as marble skin  
When I see her I believe I'm a real young guy  
And every time I go to work I think I might die if I can't hurry home again  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a makin' me a female plan  
I'd say no thanks Lord I'll just keep Ann  
  
How could I ever look at any other woman when I've got Ann  
Oh I feel so good when she takes my hand  
I'm a gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her say thank you man  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
When I come home and I feel like I've been run over  
By a ten-ton truck she can rub my shoulders and soothe my aches and pains  
If I lose my job and I'm down to a silver dollar  
And I feel like a dried up gourd in a holler she soothes my brow like summer
rain  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a making me a female plan  
I'd say no thanks you Lord I'll just keep Ann  
Oh no thanks you Lord I'll just keep Ann

Arkansas, land of opportunity  
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
All those boyhood memories  
Lakes and rivers and Backwood trees  
Gentle mountains, it reached to the sky  
Oh, how I hated to say goodbye to  
  
Arkansas, land of opportunity  
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
Dirt roads that lead nowhere  
Except the houses that need repairing  
And front porch people wearing a smile  
And they cover every mile of  
  
Arkansas, land of opportunity  
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
I can see my Dad back home  
Working Park County, sandy lawn  
Mama callin' me from the door  
Oh, how I wanna go once more to  
  
Arkansas, land of opportunity  
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
Arkansas, land of opportunity  
Arkansas, oh, what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas

(Dale Parker)  
As far as I'm concerned I don't believe the words  
They say about you as far as I'm concerned  
I think it's time they learn that nothing I have heard  
Could make me doubt you as far as I'm concerned.  
As far as I'm concerned I'd rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned.  
As far as I'm concerned I'd rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned...  
  
  

Well I'm fallin' just about as far as I'm gonna fall  
Well I've never been this slow before that I recall  
And I'm gettin' tired of people picking on me  
And I ain't a goin' down from here wait and see  
There's gonna be a new dawn and a new day  
From this moment on things are gonna break my way  
I'm gonna wear a new smile and a new face  
And then I'm goin' out and get back in the race  
  
Well the people been a walkin' on me way too long  
And the way I gotta figure I've been doin' it wrong  
So from now on I'm a gonna look out from me  
I'm gonna do what I want to be what I want to be  
There's gonna be a new dawn

Ain't been in Little Rock but two weeks and here I am now  
Packing up and disappearing into thin air  
Girls in Little Rock are cute but I can't make my heart take root  
'Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
  
I need lots of sunshine I need lots of raindrops and I need to breathe the
open air  
I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden  
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed  
  
My love is not the kind that you need  
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair  
Cause bad seed don't grow just anywhere  
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed  
  
Next stop is Jacksonville now I don't know but I've got the feelin'  
And I might just kinda like it somewhere round there  
Hear tell there's fertile land white pearly silver sand  
And bad seed won't grow just anywhere  
So honey kiss goodbye...  
Hmm let me tell you honey I'm the bad seed

Met the girl I I love in a town way down in Dixie  
Beneath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl I ever did see  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the guitars played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Guitar  
  
All the world was bright as I held her on that night  
And I heard her-er say  
Please don't you go away  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the bagpipe played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Bagpipe  
  
Well I met the girl I I love in a town way down in Dixie  
Beneath the stars up above  
She was the sweetest girl I ever did see  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while the fiddles played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Fiddle  
  
All the world wa-as bright as I held her on that night  
And I heard her-er say  
Please don't you go away  
  
So I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while everybody played  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
Everybody  
  
Yes I held her in my arms and told her of her many charms, I  
Kissed her while everybody's playin'  
The Bonaparte's Retreat  
  
Yes I held her in my arms, I told her of her many charms, and I  
Kissed her while everybody's playin'

Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air  
Feathered canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way  
Now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone  
  
So many things I could have done, but clouds got in my way  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow  
It's cloud's illusion I recall, I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels. The dizzy dancing way you feel  
When every fairytale comes real. I've looked at love that way  
Now that's just another show we've been laughing when you go  
  
If you care don't let them know don't give yourself away  
I've looked at love from both sides now from give and take and still somehow  
It's love's illusion I recall I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud say I love you right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I'd look at life that way  
Now old friends are acting strange. They shake their heads they say I've
changed  
  
But something's lost and something's gained in living every day  
I've looked at life from both sides now from win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusion I recall. I really don't know life at all

A man in Kentucky sure is lucky to love down in Bowling Green  
Bowling Green folks treat you kind better you think your own mind

Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind  
Let me run outside and tell the cab to keep his meter flyin'  
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
No I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine  
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord  
If you leave you're gonna leave a babblin' fool behind  
  
Oh baby oh baby let me keep your suitcase off of the scales in time  
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flyin'  
Cause if you say goodbye to me girl you're gonna break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
Baby break my mind break my mind

Found some letters  
You wrote me this morning  
They told of a love we once knew  
Now they're gone  
I burnt them to ashes  
Don't want nothin' to remind me o-of you  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's too late to tur-urn back now-ow-ow  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you some how  
  
Sold the house  
We once planned together  
Said goodbye  
To friends we once knew  
Then I moved  
To a far away city  
Trying hard to forget abou-out you  
  
Burning bridges behind me  
It's too late to tur-urn back now-ow-ow  
Burning bridges behind me  
All I want is to forget you so-ome how

By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising  
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all.  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her  
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so  
She just didn't know I would really go.

You can take all of the  
Money that you made  
And put it in a jar  
  
Dragged outta my  
That'll show you  
Is heaven very far  
You can take all of them  
Letters that you need til you  
Find out who you are  
  
And maybe you can figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just can't forget her  
Can you, fool  
  
Oh, the winter nights and city lights  
And the crying of the train  
Every day, the hate of rain  
Every memory's a pain  
  
And you finally used  
The sense God gave you  
To come out of the rain  
  
And still you can't figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just can't forget her  
Can you, fool  
  
Love is long and love is hard  
And love brings lots of pain  
For she was here and now she's gone  
Please bring her back again  
  
Now you can take all of  
The money that you made  
And put it in a jar  
Dragged outta my  
That'll show you  
Is heaven very far  
  
You can take all of that  
Medicine you need til you  
Find out who you are  
  
And maybe you can figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just can't forget her  
Can you, fool

Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Everywhere I wanna go, you don't wanna go  
Everything I wanna do. You don't wanna do  
Hy are you so hard to please?  
Must I wear out my knees?  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
I'll do anything to help you get your kicks  
But I'm scrapin' the bottom of my bag of tricks  
Oh, and I have needs to fulful an occasional thrill.  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'?  
  
Woh, Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you put me down  
And leave me cryin'  
  
Woh, Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Can't you see I'm tryin'  
Oh, why do you...

In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty I want to be  
In the warm hold of your loving mind  
To feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile  
And everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find  
For me to love you now t'would be the sweetest thing t'would make me sing  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears  
To help me leave all my blues behind  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind

A touch of April in your smile July and Agust in your yellow hair  
A sweet September in your eyes November notions in the clothes you wear  
You're every season's work of art but there's a cold December in your heart  
It seemed to me the day we met that all the flowers had begun to bloom  
I thought you'd help me to forget the dusty shadows of my lonely room  
I should have known right from the start about the cold December in your heart  
  
I loved you more and more each day through every season of the year  
Your lovin' laughter seemed to say your life was empty when I wasn't near  
Old love would lead you to the grave I was a fool to think you loved my too  
You always took but you never gave until you've taken all my love for you  
I feel a chill I must depart and leave the cold December in your heart  
In your heart in your heart

Livin' in the city  
Ain't never been my idea of gettin' it on  
But the job demands that you make new plans  
Before your big chance is gone  
  
You get a house in the hills  
You're payin' everyone's bills  
And they tell you that you're gonna go far  
But in the back of my mind  
I hear it time after time  
"Is that who you really are?"  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own  
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home  
  
Talkin' on the telephone  
Settin' up another day of people to meet  
You've gotta do what's right  
You've gotta spend the night  
Stayin' in touch with the street  
  
When you're surrounded by friends  
They say the fun never ends  
But I guess I'll never figure it out  
'Cause in the back of my mind  
I hear it time after time  
"Is this what it's all about?"  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own  
But now and then, my heart keeps goin' home  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
But your mind's on Tennessee  
Lookin' back, I can remember the time  
When I sang my songs for free  
  
Country boy, you got your feet in L.A.  
Take a look at everything you own

About five o'clock in the late afternoon sun's gettin' drowsy above me  
Tonight I walk neath the sparkling moon with the girl who is happy to love me  
She's my sweet country girl and she's all that I need  
The whole world wears the smile when she's talking  
Sweet country girl it's not hard to believe  
Pretty flowers bloom wherever she's been walking uh-huh  
  
Shadows erase in the last light of day night time is startin' to settle  
Red colored stone Lord is leading my way to her cottage way down in the meadow  
She's my sweet country girl...  
  
Green trees and golden hay and sunshine here every day  
Big cities far behind me well it's love with her to think I'm a gonna stay  
About five o'clock in the late afternoon...  
She's my sweet country girl yes she is  
She's my sweet country girl and I love her she's my sweet country girl

I was all right for a while I could smile for a while  
But I saw you last night you held my hand so tight as you stopped to say hello  
Oh you wished me well you couldn't tell  
That I'd been crying over you crying over you  
  
Since you said so long left me standing all alone alone and crying crying
crying crying  
It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying  
I thought that I was over you but it's true so true  
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do for you  
  
No don't love me and I'll always be  
Crying over you crying over you yes now you're gone but from this moment on  
I'll be crying crying oh crying crying yeah crying crying over you

I remember when I was a lad times were hard and things were bad  
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud  
Just poor people that's all we were tryin' to make a livin' out of black land
dirt  
We'd get together in a family circle and sing out loud  
(Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
Now one of these days and it won't be long I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join that family circle at the throne  
No the circle won't be broken by and by Lord by and by  
(Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there in the sky Lord in the sky  
  
I remember after work mama would call in all of us  
And you could hear us singin' for a country mile  
Now little brother has done gone on but I'll rejoin him in a song  
We'll be together again up yonder in a while  
(Daddy sang bass...

How long must I dream  
  
Sweet dream baby (dream baby ah-huh-huh)  
Sweet dream baby (dream baby ah-huh-huh)  
  
Sweet dream baby

Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if it's only in your mind  
Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Dreams of happiness and secret pleasures we have yet to find  
And though we're far apart won't you treat me in your heart  
Till I'm back in your arms where I belong  
And dream sweet dreams about me till I'm home  
  
The time has come and it won't keep that flame on the ground much longer  
I've got to say goodbye for a while  
So hold me one more time cause hon I'm gonna miss you oh I miss you  
So before I go just let me see your smile  
And baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me  
Let me share your love even if it's only in your mind  
And though we're far apart  
  
Baby won't you dream sweet dreams about me till I'm home

She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles  
That weren't there yesterday  
And thinks of the young man that she almost married  
What would he think if he saw her this way?  
  
She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion  
As something comes into her mind  
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood  
And all of the boys she had waiting in line  
  
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
The photograph album she takes from the closet  
And slowly turns the page  
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower  
The first one he gave her now withered today  
  
She closes her eyes and  
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears  
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown  
That broke all their minds back so many years  
  
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife  
Who gave up the good life for me  

There's a woman and she thinks I can do no wrong  
She's been waiting for me, all night long  
Still she forgives me, when I drag it home  
And tells me I belong  
For her this early morning song  
  
It's for Harry-why and the times that have go-one before  
We're still laughin' but I, I ain't that much fun no more  
Still he forgives me, in the mornin' light  
For keepin' him up to long  
For him this early morning song  
  
It's for all you cowboys, ridin' home alone  
It's for all you lovers, Tryin' to love a telephone  
It's for the children, And the hawk in the mornin' haze  
For the people that I, I don't see too much these days  
  
Will you forgive me, when we meet again  
For stayin' away so long  
I've just been out there in the dawn  
Singin' my early mornin' song  
  
So please forgive me, when we meet again  
For stayin' away so long  
I've just been out there in the dawn  
Singin' my early mornin' song

Hey... little one  
So far from home  
And so alone  
  
Hey... little one  
I'm just li-ike you  
I'm lonely too  
  
The road of life is a long long roa-oad  
When you walk alo-o-o-one  
Then I found you  
And I found a lo-ove  
A love I've never know-ow-ow-own  
A love I've never know-own  
  
Hey...  
Hey, Hey, Hey - little one  
Don't go away  
Tell me you'll stay  
  
Hey... Hey, Hey, Hey - little one  
I'm just like you  
I'm so-o lo-onely too...

Home again I turned my collar to the wind started home again  
Home again a place where I can find the friends that's home again  
Well I've seen everything that I wanted to see  
And I finally see what's important to me I'm going home I'm going home  
  
Home again I've been too long upon my way this way don't pay  
Home again too many names I can't recall it's coming home  
Well I've done everything I thought I wanted to do  
When each step I took took me far away from you I'm going home I'm going home  
  
Home again I can't extend by even time joys ain't crime  
Home again somehow I know there's time enough enough to love  
Well I've had everything that I thought I would need  
Now I'm going home I'm gonna try my hand of freedom  
I'm going home I'm going home I'm going home

I'm sittin' in the railway station got a ticket for my destination  
On a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand  
Every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band  
Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound  
Home where my thought's escaping home where the music's playing  
Home where my love was waitin' silently for me  
  
Now every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines  
And each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories  
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be  
Homeward bound...  
[ strings ]  
Tonight I'll sing my songs again I'll play the game and pretend  
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity  
Like emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort me  
Homeward bound...

I have to admit  
That no-one could love me like you did  
And there were more laughs  
Than tears any day  
Like children at play  
But somewhere and somehow  
We lost each other  
  
How high did we go-o  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hared  
For the first time I'm scare-ared  
  
I have no regrets  
Lookin' back  
I hold nothi-ing against you  
'Cause I learned to love  
And that's more than most ever know-ow-ow  
And I just can't belie-ieve  
That we've lost each other  
  
How high did we go-o  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hare-ared  
For the first time I'm scare-ared  
  
How high did we go-o-ho-ho  
When we loved each o-other  
How high did we go-o  
When we said we care-hare-are-hared

I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows  
And I believe for every one who goes astray someone will come to show the way  
I believe yes I believe  
  
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word  
Every time I hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
  
I believe above the storm...  
I believe yes I believe

I see you just like the movies  
I see your face  
Across a crowded room  
And I have learned through  
Simple trial and error  
Not to speak too soon  
  
Your eyes just like a magnet  
They're drawing my eyes around  
And I can't hear one  
Word of conversation  
I can't hear a sound  
  
I see you looking at me  
You see me looking at you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't wanna know your name  
And I don't wanna play this game  
Where two lovers meet  
And one lover parts in pain  
  
I feel this urge to meet you  
I feel this urge to run  
Repairing hearts so easily shattered  
Is never any fun  
  
I see you looking at me  
You see me looking at you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna know your name  
I don't wanna play this game  
I don't wanna know your name  
I don't wanna play this game

My baby's gone I have no one who needs me anymore  
I can't go on I have no one to love me anymore  
Time on my hands you on my mind giving in the broken dreams you left behind  
Wherever I go whatever I do my heart keeps blinding me reminding me we're
through  
My baby's gone...  
You took my hand and turned away leaving me within the walls of yesterday  
Wherever I go whatever I do there's no use trying I guess I'll never forget
you  
My baby's gone...  
  
  

Sailors have the seven seas and four strong winds that blow  
Drifters have the next town down the road.  
Gamblers have the chance to bet the ace that's in the hole  
Soldiers have the hope of coming home.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And the flowers have the early April rain,  
Believers have what they have never seen,  
And the dreamers have tomorrow if today does not come true.  
You have eyes that shine, and I have you.  
  
Heroes have their names engraved forever in a stone,  
Hermits have their peace of mind alone.  
Lovers have each other and a small slice of the moon.  
God still bless the child who has his own.  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Well funny it seems as how everyone knows him now  
Suddenly they have found someone who's been around  
Back to the fold they come seeking his wisdom from a far  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
Well you know I'm a believer in all that he's ever been  
Stories I've read of him things that were said of him  
Songs that they glorify I used to play on my guitar yes I did  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
I've known his goodness and mercy for all my days  
I've seen his blessings around me in every way  
In times of trouble when I had no hope in view  
Who brought the sunlight the one light that I knew  
Oh yes I knew he was always there answering every prayer  
Fame will not change him much he won't be out of touch  
Great as he is today big people stay the way they are yes they do  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
I've known his goodness...  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar  
  
  

Well, it'll just get you down  
If you let life get to you  
Cause everybody's saying something  
None of it's true  
  
Well, I just don't care  
When them times get hard  
Cause I got everything I need  
Right out in my yard  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love my truck  
She's right outside  
I ain't got much love  
But I sure got a ride  
It don't matter who lived  
It don't matter who lied  
I got my truck right by my side  
  
You got Sally and you got Sue  
And I got a Chevrolet  
She takes me home after work  
Don't ever miss a day  
  
She don't care what I am  
She don't care what I ain't  
But she ain't no cheap pickup  
She just needs a couple coats of paint  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
She don't care  
If I don't work a lick  
She'll start every time  
If the choke don't stick  
  
I know that she will  
Never doubt me  
Cause she never leaves home  
Without me  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
I got my truck right by my side, yeah  
I got my truck right by my side

Flowers have blooms  
The ocean has waves  
The sky has clouds  
People have babes  
I want to live  
Till I get old  
I want to watch all of this grow  
I want to live, live and let live  
I want all the love this life has to give  
I want to smile and be friendly with you  
I want to live and let you live some too  
  
Rover is big, Tabby is small  
Betty is short, Jimmy is tall  
They want to live, live and let live  
They want all the love this life has to give  
They want to smile and be friendly with you  
They want to live and let you live some too  
We want to live, but don't you

If not for you  
Babe, I couldn't even find the door  
And I couldn't even see the floor  
And I'd be sad and blue  
If not for you  
If not for you  
The night would see me wide awake  
The day would surely have to break  
But it would not be new  
If not for you  
If not for you the sky would fall  
And rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
I'd be lost if not for you  
If not for you  
The winter would have no spring  
I couldn't hear the Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
If not for you  
If not for you the sky would fall  
Rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
I'd be lost if not for you  
If not for you  
The winter would have no spring  
I couldn't hear the Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
If not for you  

If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and o-old time mo-ovie 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well  
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet  
You know that ghost is me  
And I won't ever be set free as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see  
  
If I could read your mind, love, what a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paper back novel, the kind the drug store sells  
When you reach the part, where the heartaches come  
The hero would be me, but heroes often fail  
And you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take  
  
I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script  
Enter number two  
A movie queen to play the scene f bringing all the good things out in me  
But for now, love, let's be real  
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't
get it  
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it
back  
  
If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like and o-old time mo-ovie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well  
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet  
Girl, but stories always end  
If you could read between the lines you'd know that I'm just tryin' to
understand  
The feeling's that you lack  
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't
get it  
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it
back

People see us everywhere they all think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive I know it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be some day you'll care for me but it's only make believe  
My hopes my dreams come true my life I give for you  
My heart or wedding ring my all my everything  
  
My heart I can't control you lure my very soul  
My plans my hopes my schemes you are my every dream but it's only make believe  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be that some day you'll care for me but it's only make
believe

If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This hour of love we share would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
To shine a morning light  
Make us realize our night  
Is over  
  
When you walk away from me there  
Is no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes against the sun  
That rises o'er the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
If you knew just how I really  
Feel you might return and yet  
There are so many times that people  
Have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
So I turn my back and  
Turn my collar to the wind  
Move along in silence  
Tryin' not to think at all  
Send my tired feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
It's over

Well this old lonely lonely street  
Reminds me of a dream that I once had and then I lo-ost my way  
And them years, they just roll and they're takin' their toll  
And I keep payin' the cost  
Well I'm not tryin' to please nobody but me  
But can't you see I tow the line, religiously  
Well you won't be here for ever, so just hang on to your heart  
And don't let them old de-emons tear you apart  
'Cause it's your world, boys and girls  
It's your world 'til your life is through  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldn't have anything  
It wouldn't be nothi-in' without you, hey, without you  
You can struggle and strive and you can handle your li-ife  
But they still want blood, yeah  
So just stroll like that river and stick to your ground  
A-just like this old mother earth  
Well I was born free and I'll prob'ly die young  
But I'll leave some happy people with some good songs that I've sung  
Well you won't be here forever, so just hang on to your heart, yeah  
And don't let them old de-emons tear you apart  
'Cause it's your world boys and girls  
It's your world 'til your life is throu-ough  
If it was gone tomorrow you wouldn't have anything  
It wouldn't be nothin' without you, hey, without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o no-othin'  
No, it wouldn't be nothin' without yall  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o nothin'  
Well it wouldn't be nothin' without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no-o no-othin'  
Well it wouldn't be nothin' without you  
Well it wouldn't be nothin', no it wouldn't be nothin'  
No, no, no, nothin', it would be nothin' without you, yeah  
Well it wouldn't be

It looked like any other piece of paper,  
But I thought there was love between the lines,  
But it was  
  
Just another piece of paper  
And it really didn't mean one little thing  
To you from the very start  
Just another piece of paper  
Now I got another piece of paper  
Your lawyer, he sent it in the mail today  
It looks like any other piece of paper  
But it says that you have gone away to stay  
And it is  
  
Just another piece of paper  
Blowing in an empty wind  
That slows into my heart  
Just another piece of paper  
Tearing us apart  
And it is

Feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now  
Love has looked at me but tried to change me  
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.  
  
Just for what I am I want someone to love me  
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old memory  
Just for what they see just for being me  
  
I want someone to love me just for what I am.  
Cry ain't just a sound it's a sadness  
Sadness that lives with me and follows me around  
Love wants me to be someone I can't be  
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.  
  
Just for what I am I need someone to love me  
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old memory  
Just for what they see just for being me  
I want someone to love me just for what I am

A lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand  
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand  
Are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left
behind  
I could have loved you better didn't mean to be unkind  
You know that was the last thing on my mind  
  
You've got reasons of plenty for going this I know Lord this I know  
For the weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go  
As I lie in my bed in the morning without you without you  
Each song in my breast dies a borning without you Lord without you  
Are you going away...  

Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe  
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away  
They both robbed and killed until both loved and died  
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde  
The poem that she wrote of the life that they led  
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead  
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame  
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game  
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day  
Their odds growing smaller with each get-away  
The end getting closer the harder they fought  
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught  
  
They drove back from town on one bright summer day  
When a man they be-friended stepped out in the way  
With no thought of dying they both took his side  
But the death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde  
Now two years of running was ended that day  
For robbing and killing they both had to pay  
We'll always remember how they lived and died  
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde

Moonlight and roses are the goin' thing  
Champagne, a little love, and a weddin' ring  
But every time she leaves it's gonna break your heart  
It's happened before, don't come to me, I don't want no part  
  
Let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
Let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
First time for both of you makes for urgent love  
It gives a feel that it's all unreal, it's from up above  
Tellin' some small secrets, dreamin' dreams by phone  
And terrified there'll be a time she won't be alone  
  
Well let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
Let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
Walk away, leave well alo-one, you know you should  
To be in love has as much that's bad as it has it's good  
To counsel friends ain't wise but you sure need to see  
You should know that before you, she di-id the same to me  
  
Well let me tell ya, let go, it ain't worth it if it hurts you  
And let go, you don't need it if-a she don't care  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go  
Like a good old wine or rock 'n' roll  
If it feels real good let it move your soul  
But if it hurts to say her name, baby let go, oh-oh (fade)

There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street  
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see  
They're all of your rich friends who you knew in the city  
And now they finally brought you home to me  
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'  
In a fancy car for all the town to see  
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream  
You're riding in a long black limousine  
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that
night  
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see  
And now you're in that long black limousine  
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by  
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine  
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams  
Are with you in that long black limousine

On a street in some big city lives the girl I love so well  
She left me for another now there's nothing much to tell  
As I try to fit my life in a different mode I find  
That love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
I took a plane to back when I was just a child that played  
Time sure changed this old town oh it's not the same today  
As I try to meet old friends none do I find  
Cause love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
  
There's trees along this river that are overgrown with pines  
There's pools along this river where the sun will never shine  
As I look into my heart and count my loss I find  
That love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind  
Yes love is a lonesome river running through the lonesome mind

Love is like a warm and tender rain  
Splashin' on the roof  
Beatin' on the window pain  
  
She was like a soft and gentle breeze  
Seemin' so sincere  
Pretty as you please  
  
Though the time we spent together was so small  
I keep wondering if I'll pull through it all  
But the way you held me close and call my name  
The pain I'm feelin' now  
Tells me love is not a game  
  
Every time I looked into her eyes  
I couldn't really see  
What was on her mind  
'Cause she'd been through this many times before  
I never realised I must have been a bore  
  
Now I believe in love to be  
Just simple truth and harmony  
Happiness both day and night  
No one wrong or right  
  
But the way you held me close and call my name  
And the pain I'm feelin' now  
Tells me love is not a game

Love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Take me out of this world tonight  
Take me make me forget my sorrow  
So when I wake tomorrow, I'll know our love was right  
  
Kiss me as though it were now or never  
Teach me all that our heart should know  
Just love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Oh my darling love me  
Don't ever let me go  
  
Please love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Oh my darling love me  
Don't ever let me go

Spring was never waiting for us girl it ran one step ahead as we followed in
the dance  
'Tween the parted pages and were pressed  
In love's hot fevered iron like a stripped pair of pants  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
Foaming like a wave on the ground around your knees  
And birds like tender babies in your hands  
And the old man playing checkers by the trees  
Mac Arturh Park is melting in the dark all the sweet green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don't think that I can take it cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never had that recipe again oh no  
  
There will be another songs for me for I will sing it  
There will be another dream for me someone will bring it  
I'll drink the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking in the
sun  
But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life you'll still
be the one  
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it  
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it  
I will have the things that I desire  
And my passions flow like rivers through the sky  
But after all the loves of my life oh after all the loves of my life  
I'll be thinking of you and wondering why  
Mac Arturh Park is melting

Marie  
You're a strange little one  
Marie  
Always on the run  
Marie  
Where do you belong  
Sometimes you act just like a woman  
Then you're childish as can be  
Now should I treat you like a woman  
Or maybe take you crossed my knee  
Marie  
You're a funny kind of girl  
Marie  
If I only knew your world  
Marie  
Then maybe I could play along  
With you  
Marie  
Sometimes you act just like a woman  
Then you're childish as can be  
Now should I treat you like a woman  
Or maybe take you crossed my knee  
Marie  
You're a funny kind of girl  
Marie  
If I only knew your world  
Marie  
Then maybe I could play along  
With you  
Marie

Far I have travelled and much I have seen  
The darkest of mountains with valleys of green  
And vast painted deserts, with sunset's on fire  
As they carry me home to the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin' in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre  
Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen  
It carries me back to the days I knew then  
And nights when we sang like a heavenly choir  
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin' in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre  
Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain  
They carry me back where my memories remain  
And flickerin' embers grow higher and higher  
As they carry me home to the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin' in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre

Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still  
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun the world has ended my baby's gone  
  
I wake up almost every night and realize you're gone  
I toss and turn and stare at darkness waiting for the dawn  
I try to tell my lonely heart we'll make it all alone  
  
But it cries the world has ended oh my baby's gone  
Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still  
Don't let that moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
  
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun  
Though they know the world has ended my baby's gone  
Though they know the world has ended cause my baby's gone

One last time let me love you one last time  
All I need is one more chance to say goodbye  
One last kiss then I swer I'll let you go baby I need you I've got to see you  
One more night stay with me till tomorrow  
  
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come (baby I need you)  
One last time loving you before the end I can't face never seeing you again  
One last look in your eyes to know we're through baby I need you I've got to
see you  
One more night stay with me till tomorrow  
Just tonight let's pretend that tomorrow will never come  
  
Baby I need you (one last time) I've got to see you (one last time)  
Baby I need you (one last time) baby I need you (one last time)  
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)  
Baby I want you (one last time) baby I want you (one last time)

Like a long lonely stream  
I keep running for the dream  
Moving on moving on  
Like a branch on a tree  
I keep reaching to be free  
Moving on moving on  
There's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
There's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Gotta find me a place in the sun  
Like a dusty old road  
I get weary from the load  
Moving on moving on  
Like this tired troubled earth  
I've been running since my birth  
Moving on moving on  
There's a place in the sun

I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
When you take you got to give so live and let live or let go  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
  
I could promise you things like big diamond rings  
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you better think it
over  
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true  
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it
matter  
  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy  
Come along and share the good times while we can  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine girl there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
  
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon  
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go  
But there's one thing I want you to know  
You better look before you leap still water runs deep  
  
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out  
And you know what I'm talking about  
So smile for a while...

Baby, you've been going so crazy,  
Lately nothing seems to be going right.  
So low, why do you have to get so low?  
You're so,  
You've been waiting in the sun too long.  
  
[Chorus]  
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,  
For the love you bring won't mean a thing,  
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing.  
  
Colder, crying over your shoulder,  
Hold her, tell her everything's gonna be fine.  
Surely, you've been going too early,  
Hurry 'cos no-one's gonna be stopped.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, there's something going on today,  
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing,  
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing...(fades out)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing,  
For the love you bring won't mean a thing,  
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing.

Sittin' in the mornin' sun  
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes  
Watchin' the ships roll in  
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah  
  
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Just sittin on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
I left my home in Georgia  
Headed for the Frisco Bay  
I have nothing to live for  
Look like nothing's gonna come my way, yeah  
  
So I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Watchin' the tide roll away  
Yes, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wastin' time  
  
Look like nothing's gonna change  
Everything still remains the same  
I can't do what ten people tell me to do  
So, I guess I'll remain the same  
  
Sittin' hear resting my bones  
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yeah  
But two thousand miles I roam  
Just to make this dock my home, yeah  
  
Now I'm sittin' at the dock of the bay  
Watching the tide roll away, yeah  
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay  
Wasting time

Well he can't be more than seventy  
She's not a day over sixty-five  
But they'd returned to a plane in forty-three  
And their fire's still burning bright  
  
They'll be found holdin' hands at the picture show  
Lookin' just like Juliet and Romeo  
The sad song won't steal the beat away  
They got a special kind of love that's here to stay  
  
See the romance on the port of sea  
Auburn hair grew a silver linin'  
There's something in their eyes  
You just don't see these days  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody, yeah  
  
I was head over heels in junior high  
And it lasted a week or two  
When my heart was destroyed I cried and cried  
'Til I found me somebody new  
  
Life without a real love is tragedy  
That's why I'm gonna find a love that's right for me  
I've gotta look beyond what my eyes can see  
Until my dreams are reality  
  
There's gotta be more to fallin' in love  
Than fallin' away when the stayin' gets tough  
I want my love to be young  
When I'm old and gray  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody, yeah  
  
I wanna love somebody like that, I wanna hold on forever  
Two heart's become one with a love like that  
I wanna love somebody like that  
I wanna love somebody  
I wanna love somebody like that

Now there's a young girl that I know and her age is twenty-one  
She comes from down in southern Colorado  
I just got out of the service and I'm looking for some fun  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
Her parents could not like me cause I rides the rodeo  
Her father thinks that I will leave her crying  
But I know she would follow me right down the roughest road  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
And when I come to call her pa ain't got a good word to say  
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days  
So blow you ol' blue northern and blow me on my way  
I'm driving in tonight from California  
I love my damned old rodeo almost as much as I love her  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon  
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon

See the birds unfolding on the tress see them blossom into leaves  
Wise men know someone above has made it so  
See the daffodil and crocus there as they bow their heads in prayer  
For they know someone above has made it so  
When the raindrops fall the flowers grow and the rivers kiss the sea  
But there'd be no rain no river flow if there live the fools like me  
Man can build his city plan his yard paint a picture called an art  
But I know someone above has made it so  
When the raindrops fall  
  
I know someone above has made it so

Well, I could search from now to the end of the time  
Never find another you  
I'm so glad because I know you're mine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I believe, my love, that you're one of the kind  
For there's no one else like you  
You're the light of my life, so let it shine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth  
For my place will be with you  
Well, I have taken you for better or worse  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Days of man-and-wife-time are precious few  
I will spend them all with you  
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Mm, mm, mm, mm  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
Shine on me my whole life through  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
I need someone like you

With Rita Coolidge  
  
I see you every day  
Walking down the avenue  
I'd like to get to know you  
But all I do is smile at you  
  
Oh, baby  
When it comes to talking  
My tongue gets so tight  
This sidewalk love affair  
Has got me high as a kite  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Well, I'm a slow walker  
But, girl, I'd race a mile for you  
Just to get there in time  
For my peek-a-boo rendezvous  
  
Well, maybe it's the way you  
Wear you're blue jeans so tight  
I can't put my finger on  
What you're doing right  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Well, I'm standing on a corner  
Smiling by a telephone  
I'd just love to check you over  
Get to know you like  
A fine tooth comb  
  
Oh, now when I go home  
I turn out the light  
And you come strolling through  
My dreams every night  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like  
  
Yeah, yeah, there's something  
Bout you, baby, I like

Southern nights  
have you ever felt a southern night?  
Free as a breeze  
not to mention the trees  
Whistling tunes that you know and love so.  
  
Southern nights  
just as good even when closed your eyes.  
I apologize to anyone who can truly say  
That he has found a better way  
  
Southern skies  
have you ever noticed southern skies?  
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.  
It goes running through your soul  
Like the stories told of old  
Old man  
he and his dog that walked the old land  
Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand.  
As he slowly walked by  
weeping willows  
Would cry for joy  
Joy  
  
Feel so good  
feel so good  
it's frigth'ning.  
Wish I could,  
stop this world from fighting.  
La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da  
  
Mysteries  
like this and many others in the trees  
Blow in the night  
in the southern skies.  
  
Southern nights  
they feel so good it's fright'ning . . .  
Wish I could stop this world from fighting  
La da da da da da la da da da da da  
da da da da da da da da da da da  

Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall  
Your love for me is over but sweet me'ries I still recall  
Each season brings its changes but in me there's been no change at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
I thought some day I'll forget you but the chances now seem very small  
There's too much of you still here with me to ever forget you at all  
Summer winter spring and fall these are the lonely times  
For the times I miss you most of all are summer winter spring and fall  
  
  

I had a dream and I saw you standin' and you were shinin' just like an angel  
I'd like to thank you for standing by me when things were darker you held the
candle  
Do you remember when we took a dream and then turned it into today together  
Dreamin' seems to carry me back to where I want to be  
  
Wrapped up in your arms and feeling better  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
I'll never treat you wrong won't make you cry  
Just sing you sweet love songs won't tell you lies  
Wouldn't you like to go ridin' with me into tomorrow oh sweet fantasy  
  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
Cherish what you sweet remember running through the sands of time  
Cherish it with all that's in you  
  
Rivers will run mountains will rise I love you more than the stars in the
skies  
Rivers will run eagles will fly I love you more than the stars in the skies  
Yes I love girl yes I love girl yes I love girl

I know I'm not your first love  
They're just a past memory  
I'm the one who's got you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
I know other arms have held you  
But I'm not jealous of these  
Mine are the arms that hold you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
I came alive when you came along  
Yes you've brought life back to me  
And I don't care what's in your past  
You're as far as I can see  
I know other lips have kissed you  
And I know you've been thrilled and pleased  
Mine are the lips that kiss you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
Yes mine are the arms that hold you now  
And that's all that matters to me

He got here and wrinkled scared and cryin'  
The she took him up and held him to her breast  
And he sure was glad to get what mama offered  
Then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest  
  
It didn't seem to matter what he needed  
He could always count on mama to supply  
And regardless of the sleep she might be losin'  
He always found a twinkle in her eye  
  
There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas  
Creation's most unique and precious pearls  
And heaven help us always to remember  
That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world  
  
She taught him all the attributes of greatness  
That she knew he couldn't learn away from home  
And by the time she wore the cover off her bible  
Her hair was gray and her little man was gone  
  
There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas  
Creation's most unique and precious pearls  
And heaven help us always to remember  
That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world  
  
Yes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world

The Impossible Dream  
Performed by Glen Campbell  
To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure a chaste from a far  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
This is my quest to follow that star  
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far  
To fight for a right  
  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march into hell  
For a heavenly cause  
And I know, if I'll only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To reach the unreachable star

The last time I saw her face  
Her eyes were bathed in starlight  
And her hair hung long  
The last time she spoke to me  
Her lips were like the scented flowers  
Inside a rain-drenched forest  
But that was so long ago  
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before  
And if time could heal the wounds  
I would tear the threads away  
That I might bleed some more  
The last time I walked with her  
Her laughter was the steeple bells  
That ring to greet the morning sun  
A voice that called to everyone  
To love the ground we walked upon  
Those were good days  
The last time I held her hand  
Her touch was autumn spring  
And summer and winter too  
The last time I let go of her  
She walked away into the night  
I lost her in the misty streets  
A thousand months, a thousand years  
When other lips will kiss her eyes  
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is  
The last time I saw her face  
Her eyes were bathed in starlight  
And she walked alone  
The last time she kissed my cheek  
Her lips were like the wilted leaves  
Upon the autumn covered hills  
Resting on the frozen ground  
The seeds of love lie cold and still  
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten  

He's five foot two and he's six feet four  
He fights with missiles and with spears  
He's all of thirty-one  
And he's only seventeen  
  
He's been a soldier for a thousand years  
He's a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist, a Jain  
A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew  
He knows he shouldn't kill  
  
But he knows he always will  
Kill you, my friend, for me and me for you  
He's fighting for Canada, he's fighting for France  
He's fighting for the USA  
He's fighting for the Russians  
  
And he's fighting for Japan  
And he thinks he'll put an end to war that way  
He's fighting for democracy, he's fighting for the Reds  
He says it's for the peace of all  
He's the one who must decide  
  
Who's to live and who's to die  
But he never sees the writing on the wall  
But without him how would Hitler have condemned them at Dachau  
Without him Caesar would have stood alone  
He's the one who gives his body  
  
As the weapon of the war  
And without him all this killing can't go on  
He's the universal soldier and he really is to blame  
His orders come from far away no more  
  
They come from him, and you, and me  
And brother, can't you see  
This is not the way to put an end to war

Where do I begin,  
To tell the story of how great a love can be?  
The sweet love story that is older than the sea.  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me.  
Where do I start?  
  
With her first hello!  
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine.  
There'd never be another love, another time.  
She came into my life and made the living fine.  
She fills my heart. ..  
  
She fills my heart with very special things,  
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings.  
She fills my soul with so much love,  
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely.  
With her along, who could be lonely?  
I reach for her hand, it's always there. ..  
  
How long does it last?  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?  
I have no answers now, but this much I can say,  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there. ..  
She'll be there. ..

Well I've been out walking  
I don't do that much talking these days  
These days,  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things that I forgot to do  
For you  
And all the times I had the chance to  
  
And I had a lover  
It's so hard to risk another these days  
These days,  
Now if I seem to be afraid  
To live the life I have made in song  
Well it's just that I've been losing for so long  
  
I'll keep on moving  
Things are bound to be improving these days  
One of these days,  
These days I sit on corner stones  
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend  
Don't confront me with my failures  
I had not forgotten them

This is what I wanna live for  
This is where I wanna live  
To give my life to you and to this feeling  
That's alive today  
And never let it go away  
No matter what this is  
  
This is, and how can I deny it  
This is, and will not be denied  
And you don't have to give an explanation  
For the way you feel  
I only wanna know it's real  
No matter what this is  
  
To give my life to you and to this feeling  
That's alive today  
And never let it go, never let it go away  
No matter what this is  
No matter, no matter what this is  
It's everything that is

Some people run, some people crawl  
Some people don't even move at all  
Some roads lead forward, some roads lead back  
Some roads are bathed in light and some wrapped in black  
Some people never get and some never give  
Some people never die and some never live  
Some folks treat me mean, some treat me kind  
Most folks just go their way and don't pay me any mind  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Sometimes I'm satisfied, sometimes I'm not  
Sometimes my face is cold and sometimes it's hot  
At sunset I laugh, at sunrise I cry  
At midnight I'm between and I'm wondering why  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go?  
Time, oh, good, good time  
Where did you go

Today is the greatest  
Day I've ever known  
Can't live for tomorrow,  
Tomorrow's much too long  
I'll burn my eyes out  
Before I get out  
  
I wanted more  
Than life could ever grant me  
Bored by the chore  
Of saving face  
  
Today is the greatest  
Day I've ever known  
Can't wait for tomorrow  
I might not have that long  
I'll tear my heart out  
Before I get out  
  
Pink ribbon scars  
That never forget  
I tried so hard  
To cleanse these regrets  
My angel wings  
Were bruised and restrained  
My belly stings  
  
Today is  
Today is  
Today is  
The greatest day  
  
I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you on  
I want to turn you  
  
Today is the greatest  
Today is the greatest day  
Today is the greatest day  
That I have ever really known

When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise  
And as its beauty struck the darkness from the sky  
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be  
And how lucky another day belongs to me  
  
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day  
All its silent beauties seemed to say  
So what my friend if all your dreams you have and realized  
Just look around you you got a whole new day to try  
  
Today is mine today is mine to do with what I will  
Today is mine my own special cup to fill  
To die a little that I might learn to live to take from life that I might
learn to give  
Today is mine  
  
Like most men I cursed the present to avoid the peace of mind  
And raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind  
But as I view this day around me I can see the fool I've been  
For today's the only garden we can tend  
Today is mine...

(Nothing else matters we're together again)  
Together again my tears have stopped falling  
And the long lonesome nights have come to an end  
The key to my heart yes you hold in your hand  
And baby nothing else matters we're together again  
(We're together again)  
Together again oh my grey skies are gone  
Cause you're back in my arms right back where you belong  
And the love that we knew yes all our love is living again  
And nothing else matters cause we're together again  
No baby nothing else matters as long as we're together again

Oh you tell me that you love me  
Yes you tell me that you care  
That tomorrow we'll be married  
But tomorrow's never there  
Many weeks have I waited  
Many many long nights have I cried  
Just to see that happy morning happy morning  
When I'd have you right by my side  
But tomorrow it never never comes  
No no no tomorrow ain't never ever gonna come  
Now you tell me you tell me you love me  
Can you say that you want me  
But tomorrow never comes

Well, I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas  
Well, a little place called Hamburger Den  
I heard that old jukebox start playin'  
A tune called truck driving man  
  
The waitress then brought me some coffee  
I thanked her but called her again  
I said that old song sure does hit me  
'Cause I'm a truck driving man  
Pour me another cup of coffee  
For it is the best in the land  
I put a nickel in the jukebox  
And played the truck driving man  
  
I climbed back aboard my old semi  
And then like a flash I was gone  
I got them old truck we used to roll in  
Now I'm on my way to San Antone  
  
When I get my call up to glory  
They'll take me away from this land  
I'll head this old truck up to heaven  
'Cause I'm a truck driving man  
  
Well, pour me another cup of coffee  
For it is the best in the land  
I put a nickel in the jukebox  
And play the truck driving man

If you see your brother standing by the road  
With a heavy load from the seeds he's sowed  
And if you see your sister falling by the way  
Just stop and stay you're going the wrong way  
  
You got to try a little kindness  
Yes show a little kindness  
Just shine your light for everyone to see  
And if you try a little kindness  
Then you'll overlook the blindness  
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets  
  
Don't walk around the down and out  
Lend a helping hand instead of doubt  
And the kindness that you show every day  
Will help someone along their way  
  
You got to try a little kindness  
Yes show a little kindness  
Just shine your light for everyone to see  
And if you try a little kindness  
Then you'll overlook the blindness  
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets  
  
You got to try a little kindness  
Yes show a little kindness

Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets

There is someone walking behind you,  
Turn around, look at me.  
There is someone watching your footsteps,  
Turn around, look at me  
  
There is someone who really needs you,  
Here's my heart in my hand.  
Turn around, (turn around), look at me, (look at me,)  
Understand,understand,  
  
That there's someone who'll stand beside you.  
Turn around, look at me.  
And there's someone who'll love and guide you.  
Turn around, look at me.  
  
I've waited, but I'll wait forever for you to come to me.  
Look at someone (look at someone)  
Who really loves you, yeah, really loves you.  
Turn around, look at me.

What a friend we have in Jesus  
All our sins and grieves to bear  
What a privilege to carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Oh, what peace we often forfeit  
Oh, what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Have we trials and temptations?  
Is there trouble anywhere?  
We should never be discouraged  
Take it to the Lord in prayer  
Can we find a friend so faithful  
Who will all our sorrow share?  
Jesus knows our every weakness  
So take it to the Lord in prayer  
Oh, what peace we often forfeit  
Oh, what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Everything to God in prayer  

Where do you go when there's nowhere to go  
And you don't want to be where you are  
Where do you run when there's no run to run and you've already run too far  
What good is love when you offer your love but nobody wants to buy  
Why do I cry and why am I wondering why  
What can you say when there's so much to say but nobody listens to you  
And what good are dreams if there's no more than dreams  
That don't have a chance to come true  
And what can you do when love that you do will ease your troubled mind  
And where do you go when you come to the end of the line  
What can you say...  
  
  

The end has come and found us here  
With our toys scattered all around us here  
The puzzle that we never found an answer for  
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for  
And here we stand in a box of sand  
Where's the playground Susie?  
  
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
The carousel has stopped us here  
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here  
And still you're not content with something about me  
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me  
To take your hand ?  
How would you stand?  
  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around?  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
Where's the playground Susie?  
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around?

Just another day  
And I think I'll die before it ends  
It's just another day  
And I sure like to go see my baby again  
  
Time was when I did not know  
What they meant when they said a man was blue  
But now I know because of you  
What I know because of you  
  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Right now, right now  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Somehow, somehow  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now  
  
Just another day  
There ain't nothin' going down  
Nothin' going down I already know  
'Cause I already called around  
  
I am worse, when I did not know  
Just what they meant when they said a day went wrong  
But now I know it's been too long  
Since I knew it had been too long  
  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Right now, right now  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again  
Somehow, somehow  
Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now

I know that it would make you cry to find that I have gone didn't even say
goodbye  
You'll hate me for a while because I promised love and left you just regret  
I know that I could never be the kind of man that you have in your mind of me  
Though you said we must part it would break your heart  
But you're young and you'll forget  
  
You're young and I know time will help you find a perfect man to really love
you  
And not a man like me who's like the wind and must be free  
But a man who's worthy of you  
  
For I could never settle down to just one way of life  
One woman and one town so sad to part this way  
You'll be glad someday for you're young and you'll forget  
You're young and I know time
