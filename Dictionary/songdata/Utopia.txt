Cry to me, those were your very words  
You said cry to me, cry to me  
There you stood, laughing at my tears  
You said, silly boy, forget your childhood fears  
But you don't realize how strange it makes me feel  
Now we're exchanging parts  
Stop, you're breaking my heart  
Who's the crybaby now  
Cry to me, cry to me, you're the crybaby now  
Cry to me, cry  
Who's the crybaby, who's breaking my heart  
  
Lie to me, you know that I know you too well  
So don't you lie to me, lie to me  
I watch you from afar, crying up your sleeve  
When they turn away,

Well, I've heard it, I've heard it all  
I've heard it all before  
I don't need no gypsy  
I don't need no crystal ball  
  
Since you started messin' round on me darlin'  
Now the phone's ringing off the wall  
And everybody says it's so  
I got a broken heart comin' and they want me to know  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball.  
I got a lady across the hallway  
I got another one way across town  
  
All the people at your birthday party  
You should hear the way they're puttin' me down?  
It seems the whole world's out to spy  
It's like the CIA meets the FBI  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball  
Well I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball  
  
Well I've heard it all  
It ain't no surprise to me  
I don't watch no television  
I don't read the daily news  
  
I'm afraid if I listen to the radio  
I'll hear about the latest things you do  
I don't want no explanation  
Nothin' you could say could be a revelation  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball.

At the edge of the world  
The sun pouring down  
We must be heading home  
I completely agree  
I've just been waiting for the right words to come along  
  
Everybody else is wrong  
Doesn't everyone concur, oh no  
Thank you for the vote of confidence  
I feel so much surer now that  
Everybody else is wrong  
  
In the prime of one's life  
One must be aware  
It's such a weary job  
But I've made up my mind  
I've just been waiting for the right choice to come along  
  
Please don't turn out the light  
My pen is on fire  
The masterpiece revealed  
Put your wallets in hand  
If you've been waiting for the answer to come along

Yeah  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Ya  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Smoke is in the air now  
It's been spreading just like wild-fire all over town  
Everybody wants to get in on the latest thing  
Going down to the bookstore - burn that mother down  
Ya  
Somebody has to do what's right  
Fahrenheit four fifty-one  
Burning black and white  
Well I got some education  
I go down to the library every night  
And I'm looking for somebody with a dream like mine  
We could share a few pages 'round the fire so bright  
Now it's spreading 'cross the nation  
And it's time to seize the moment, that's what they says  
'cause it's all been well reported in the daily news,  
You can read all about it before it turns to ashes  

Feel too good to go to work today  
I need a little more time so i can stay this way  
Let's go for a ride on the circle line  
Couldn't you use a day in the sunshine  
Mustn't let your bank payments get behind  
The bills may pile up, i just brush them off my mind  
  
I can't let debt collectors bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down  
  
I can't remember when i felt so high  
My mind is on vacation and i don't know why  
Wouldn't you like to go for a country drive  
Doesn't it make you feel good to be alive  
Luncheon by the roadside will do just fine  
I left the water running  
It just must have slipped my mind  
  
Can't let the little things bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down  
Someone's bound to bring you down  
  
There's a strange speaking man on the front lawn  
Making rude noises and gestures  
It's just the neighbor's got something on his mind  
Feel too good  
I can't let frenchie start to bother me  
Because i feel too good  
I feel so good that you just can't bring me down

Life goes on, the world keeps turning and life goes on  
Life goes on, the world keeps turning and life goes on  
He was a company man  
He put his faith in the union and his take-home pay  
A good republican man  
But they closed down the factory his retirement day  
Life goes on whether or not there's a reason  
Life goes on, enter another season  
She was the pride of her dad  
But she harbored a secret in her bureau drawer  
And when the news was too bad  
She would get into trouble with the boy next door  
In the dead of the night  
They escape to their fantasy without a sound  
Her father still burns a light  
But they never returned and they were never found

When she calls my name  
Nobody says it quite the same  
Gives me a feeling I never knew  
Makes me so happy loving her  
Love and love alone  
I'd wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that can't be wrong  
It's sometimes hard to see  
Love isn't bought well it's got to be  
There for a reason you want to share  
To show somebody you care  
Love and love alone  
Conquers the world that can be so cold  
Love is how we show just what we feel  
It's enough for me can't say I need anything else  
Love is here to be had by us all  
Don't cheat yourself  
I can say it now  
Someday we'll all be there somehow  
Everyone singing, love leads the way  
'Til then I'm counting every day  
Love and love alone  
I'd wait a life just to have it here  
Love is all I know and that can't be wrong

No place to hide  
And no where to run  
Nothing you can do because a change must come  
You can't stop it  
You got your tail in the air  
Your head in the ground  
Money, money, money makes your world go 'round  
You see  
You can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop, you can't stop  
You can't stop love in action  
You just joined the clan  
Your head's full of sand  
You need a bunch of friends to make you feel like a man  
But you can't stop it  
Yeah, you could be the last trace of the master race  
The Nazis really send you to another place  
Still you can't stop it  
You can't stop love in action

Name your price  
A ticket to paradise  
I can't stay here any more  
And I've looked high and low  
I've been from shore to shore to shore  
If there's a short cut I'd have found it  
But there's no easy way around it  
  
Light of the world, shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all, set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
We're all homeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
It's such a lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me, is it worth just another try?  
  
Tell me, are we alive, or just a dying planet?  
What are the chances?  
Ask the man in your heart for the answers  
  
And when you feel afraid, love one another  
When you've lost your way, love one another  
When you're all alone, love one another  
When you're far from home, love one another  
When you're down and out, love one another  
All your hope's run out, love one another  
When you need a friend, love one another  
When you're near the end, love one another  
We got to love one another  
  
Light of the world, you got to shine  
Love will be a means, yeah, yeah  
Shine on us all  
Know that love can save the day  
Just give it one more chance  
Lord you just can't let it stop lord  
Love is the answer  
Got to be free to let love into your life  
Let it shine

I gave the girls the eye  
I've given lust a try  
I'm just an average guy  
From the neck on down  
I used to have my fun  
When all was said and done  
I only wanted someone  
From the neck on down  
Maybe it's one too many mornings after  
Maybe I'm sick of my own nervous laughter  
  
Now I'm looking for heaven  
From the neck on up  
For a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up  
  
I was a typical man  
I had a master plan  
I thought that heaven began  
From the waist on down  
And I had always said  
That I could use my head  
But I was thinking instead  
From the waist on down  
Maybe it's one too many frozen shoulders or  
Maybe I haven't noticed getting older  
  
Trapped in a dream  
Something has to change in this endless stream  
Of ships that pass in the night  
Is this what I want out of life?  
I want to know what this game is about  
I want someone to try and figure me out  
  
I can't determine why  
But I'm a different guy  
Your modus operandi  
Turned me inside out  
It's not that I don't care  
About your fine hardware  
But you've got something else there  
I can't figure out  
Maybe I just can't finish what I've started or  
Maybe it's simply that I've been outsmarted  
  
Now I've found my heaven  
From the neck on up  
You're a perfect eleven  
From the neck on up

One world  
Whoa, it's our world  
Yeah, yeah, one world  
Whoa, it's our world  
Yeah, yeah  
When I walk on th  
Music comes a'ringin' out of every door  
I see faces I know and they give me a sign  
We got something between us and it feels all right  
I see Chrissy the clipper, she colors my hair  
Micky and Margaret make the clothes that we wear  
And there's Gene who runs the club where we dance all night  
When you live in our world everything's all right  
Politicians and dictators and the guys with the dough  
They think they run the world but they just don't know  
'Cause down here on the street we got it under control  
From Berlin to San Francisco, from New York to Tokyo

I could be jealous and grasping with greed  
I could pretend that I want something I don't need  
These are the things that go through my head  
But then, I could be an angel disguised as a man  
I could be the sun that shines in the midnight land  
If you would only stand in my corner  
Give that advantage to me  
Don't you feel something?  
You know what I'm thinking but  
I can't set it free  
We must  
Play this game, take the prize  
But not before you realize  
That win or lose, it's all the same  
Then maybe we can play this game  
I can't remember the reason I'm here  
Sometimes it seems like it's all out of habit or fear  
Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep  
But then, I'll have a dream with a beautiful end  
I'll wake up and feel alive, then I'm off again  
If I could only keep your connection  
Give me whatever remains  
Then I might win you total liberation  
But I can't break these chains  
We must  
Play this game  
Let's pretend that we could never reach the end  
For it would be a crying shame  
If we can't learn to play this game  
Stand in my corner  
Give that advantage to me  
Stand in my corner  
Pull down a message with me  
The answer that evades our brains  
We only think we're wearing chains

Well, I want to shake that thing wit'cha all night long  
Yeah, you're a princess baby, you can do no wrong  
Said you're a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
Yeah, you're a princess baby, you can name that song  
  
Well, they just couldn't touch you with a ten foot pole  
And they just couldn't  
You got so much juice, you make the telephone ring  
You make me jump right up, I want to shake that thing  
  
Wit'cha all night long  
You're the princess of the universe  
You're a princess baby, you can do no wrong  
You're the princess of the universe  
  
Well, I ain't seen nothing like it since the Sha got the rope  
You got a legion of liggers that would shame the Pope  
You just say the word and they run like hell  
You gotta take a cold shower, so your head don't swell  
  
But you can do no wrong  
You're the princess of the universe  
You're a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
You're the princess of the universe  
  
Well, you ain't got a man who can touch what you got  
But you're looking for a subject that can fill that slot  
When the count is down, I want to step in time  
And when your fingers pop, I want to tow that line

Ah, what happened to our little girl?  
She doesn't sing like she used to do  
Ah, why won't she say it to the world?  
She doesn't want us anymore. She is gone  
  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you  
Ah, when did her laughter fly away?  
She doesn't smile like she used to do  
  
Ah, where is her happy yesterday?  
She doesn't want us anymore. She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you  
  
You can't take our love away - no you can't  
You can't take our love away - please don't take  
You can't take our love away - no you can't now  
You can't take our love away - please don't take it  
You can't take our love away - no you can't  
You can't take our love away - please don't take  
You can't take our love away - can't take it away  
You can't take our love away - can't take it away  
You can't take our love away - you can't take it away  
  
Ah, will you be coming home again?  
She doesn't have somewhere else to go  
Ah, who will become your special friend?  
I will be taking her away. She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you

Hey Mister Exxon  
Won't you have pity  
Won't you have pity on the guiltless ones  
Hey Mister Chrysler  
Won't you think about it  
Won't you think about it? Judgment Day has begun  
What will become of tomorrow's children  
Who gives a damn for tomorrow's children  
Pay no mind, you just keep on takin'  
Keep on takin' 'til there's nothing at all  
Sit on your hands and don't say nothin'  
Cover your eyes, you won't see nothin'  
Cry for the innocent sent to war  
(Don't tell a soul)  
Shed a tear for the one's waiting at the door  
(They'll never know)  
It's the last generation of a world gone blind  
(You better watch your tongue)  
It's the violation of the unborn child  
It's the rape of the young  
Hey Mister General  
Can't you find something  
Can't you find something else to do for a buck  
Hey Mister President  
Nobody listens  
Nobody listens 'til we've run out of luck  
Nobody cares for unborn troubles  
Why should you care, it's too much trouble  
You got yours so it just don't bug ya  
It just don't bug ya 'cause you won't be around

I didn't call this meeting and  
I never heard such beating around  
Around the bush and  
You can't commit to something so  
  
You won't come up with nothing at all  
Unless you're pushed  
But I wanna get this straightened out  
I'm getting tired of waiting  
  
When I say when will you lay your love down for me,  
Don't say what  
When I say why won't you put out something for me,  
Don't say what, say yeah  
  
We had a good thing going but  
We never did quite know what it was  
But it was good so  
Why don't we just start over and  
  
Maybe I can help you lower your guard  
I think we should  
But you gotta stop resisting me  
I wanna get some kissing  
  
I don't believe in magic but  
You could avert a tragedy here  
I got to say that  
I think you've got the power and  
  
You know the final hour has come  
So don't delay 'cause  
I wanna get this straightened out  
I'm getting tired of waiting

Second Nature Lyrics  
Something tells me when something's wrong  
Seems like it's been such a long,  
Long time since I felt that one  
  
You have your ways and I have my ways  
And like the back of my hand I know it  
And I don't have to try to make you show it  
You don't have to show me how  
  
'Cause it's second nature to me now  
Something's taken hold of me somehow  
'Cause it's second nature to me now  
  
Nobody must explain to me your way of communication  
Give me the time to understand  
I always come around  
I have my ways and you have your ways  
  
And we need no elaboration  
We can just enjoy that sweet sensation

In the days when I was young I never had to cry  
If I wanted a lover I did not have to try  
But I must have set my expectations far too high  
Guess I'm just a silly boy  
  
I guess I'm just a silly boy  
There are some things about love that I don't understand  
When you promise your heart you do the best you can  
But no matter how I try behaving like a man  
  
Seems I'm just a silly boy  
I guess I'm just a silly boy  
This is the last time I'll wait to stand in line  
If you don't come see me I'm dropping the boom on you  
  
'Cause when you lose me  
Then everyone will see what a silly girl can do  
Don't you tell me that it's over  
Don't you make a sound  
  
'Til I get to the river or someplace I can drown  
'Cause I put my faith upon you and you let me down  
Guess I'm just a silly boy  
I guess I'm just a silly boy

Style must not be underrated  
Style is often overlooked  
Style is never in the papers  
I read it like an open book  
Style  
If you can't see the substance  
Style shows how it's organized  
Style is looking for your money  
It's in the way you paint your eyes  
There is always a way  
A way things are done  
I've been learning my ABC's  
I know what is 10, I know what is 1 in  
Style is a naked look  
Underneath your style  
Style of a different place  
Talking through your style  
Even the way you hide it  
Reveals the thing you hide  
Your style may never cause a riot  
It's still a style to have no style  
There is always a way  
To light up  
It's been a crazy year all around  
The check never came  
I can't let it cramp my  
Style is a world for sale  
You can't buy this style  
Style that you can't resist  
You won't cramp my style

Ritual dancer spins away  
Lost in a whirling dervish ballet  
Musicians playing  
Out of tune in perfect harmony  
  
Traveling down the sandy track  
Compass in hand, guitar on my back  
Trying to find the  
Secret truth inside the pyramid  
  
Foxy pharaoh knows all, won't tell  
Dangerous knowledge locked in a cell  
Method in madness  
Ancient logic, never ending mystery  
  
Anticipation fills the air  
As the natives gather 'round  
Watching the fiery sun go down  
In the technicolor sky  
Exploding mandala of light  
Disappearing into darkness  
A stunning sunburst finish  
Shatters the horizon  
  
Eye of the sphinx now winks at you  
What is he thinking? wish that i knew  
Wonder of wisdom  
Far beyond this mortal comedy  
  
Wind of the desert blowing strong  
Mist of the ocean kissed by the sun  
Tropical splendor  
Paradise is calling you away  
  
Make up your mind, don't make a scene  
Wake up to find your garden is green  
Please take your seat on board  
The destination is utopia  
  
Echoing across the canyon  
Hear the song of the gypsy caravan  
Magical voices in flight  
  
Looking for the next oasis  
'Neath the glow of the silver-shadow moon  
Radiant princess of night  
  
Stay forever, stay for a while  
Hypnotized by sight and sound  
Empty feelings bring a frown  
Only love can make you smile

Swing To The Right Lyrics  
Swing to the right  
Try to face the fact that I ain't that young no more  
Hair's short again and a suit is in,  
  
Better brush up on how to tie a Windsor knot  
Swing to the right  
Credit's hard to find and a dollar doesn't go so far  
What's more important when the count comes in  
  
A sell-out who's alive or a corpse that can't be bought?  
Stop the hand of time  
Think I see a sign  
Tables turning 'round  
  
Hear a different sound  
Stop the hands of time  
Looking out for mine  
Swing to the right  
  
Don't want to hear what the povertous expect from me  
Let 'em eat cake if they feel that way  
I gotta work why should I have to pay for that?  
And I don't want to be left holding the bag for them  
  
'Scuze me for living but I have to say,  
I've got some worries of my own, like staying fat

You can lead a horse to water  
You can lead a lamb to slaughter, oh yeah  
But the way she let me on her  
Well there ought to be a law girl  
  
But it's all over now 'cause I'm free born  
If you want my heart then it's yours  
My heart is my own,  
You can wrap it up and take it home  
  
If I take you for my lover  
You might break my heart all over, oooh yeah  
I can't stand to leave romances  
When you fall you take your chances  
  
But I don't care now 'cause I'm free born  
If you want my heart then it's yours  
My heart is my own,  
You can wrap it up and take it home

If you don't feel like dancing tonight  
Well that's all right  
And if you don't feel like holding me tight  
Well that's all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And you'll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
That's not right  
  
If you don't want to go anywhere  
Well I don't mind  
If you want to stay home and play with your hair  
I still don't mind  
Cause I know that you need me  
And you'll know how to please me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you want to leave me well baby  
Then I mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I know that I've been guilty of lying  
I know I had a whole lot of nerve  
But the way that you treat me since I begged your pardon  
Is something that I don't deserve  
  
And if you don't care to give me a date  
Well that's all right  
Cause I don't care how long I have to wait  
I've got all night  
Cause I know that you want to  
But you know that you're going to make me lose my mind  
And if you can not think of me baby  
That's not right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
feel like dancing tonight  
Well that's all right  
And if you don't feel like holding me tight  
Well that's all right  
Cause I know that you love me  
And you'll show that you love me  
In your own sweet time  
But if you feel like hurting me baby  
That's not right

On a day like no other  
In a time unique, in a place divine  
Keep your eye on the Ikon  
Shining in the light of eternal mind.  
  
I went to sleep a blind man  
But when I awoke I saw  
The legions of the lonely  
See their faces, hear them call.  
  
See how they hang on  
Each one in a world of his own design  
Listen to the Ikon  
Ringing in the sound of eternal mind.  
  
And the music plays forever  
And it captures every ear  
And the sound of barriers crashing down  
Is the sweet harmony you hear.  
  
Still, be still  
To strong, so be still  
Much too long, come down  
Be still, look around  
Listen here, be still  
Hear the sound, be still.  
  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Will we sing sweet  
Sing we will  
Still we are here  
We are still  
Nil is a fear all is nil  
Still we are here we are still  
Spill it let go let it spill.  
  
The question comes to mind  
About what should be done  
And how much of the old will die  
That the new may be begun  
But you don't have to be afraid  
Of being alone with nowhere to run.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
To look yourself in the eye  
You don't have to be afraid not to lie.  
  
Someone knows who you are  
Someone watches over you  
Someone knows how you feel  
And someone feels the same.  
  
So you don't have to be afraid  
Never fear, for you are living in eternal mind  
  
For those who still recoil  
For those who fear the pain  
Of peering o'er the edge of  
A new and different plane.  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
Whenever you go you come back again  
So you don't have to be afraid  
We live and we die  
You don't have to be afraid to know why.  
  
You do

Why, why was I born to know what I must know  
I can see the sky, but I can't see the ground below  
Where do I go  
Falling in a trap where traitors wait  
Lost love is the bait  
But the martyr never knows  
He is caught in a dream of his own  
When it's over where does he go  
Who really knows  
Time stands between me and my home  
So long ago  
I can't stand to wait  
But I can't force my body to go  
Where do I go  
Crying, he is blind to everyone  
And that's how it's done  
And the martyr never knows  
Who really knows  
I know in my heart  
I could change the world  
With just this guitar  
Who really knows  

I blink my eyes and then it happens again  
I lose my way but I discover a friend  
It's a typical day on the road to utopia  
  
I walk along until my feet are sore  
I rest a minute then I walk some more  
There's no time to delay on the road to utopia  
  
And my destination is the unknown  
But I'm never far away from my home  
  
It shines like laser light  
It's in my dreams at night  
'cause I've been all my life  
On the road to utopia  
  
I will be there to share your tragedy  
I know that you would do the same for me  
It's no trouble at all on the road to utopia  
  
When day is over and I'm trying to sleep  
It comes so easy 'cause I'm not counting sheep  
I am counting the smiles on the road to utopia  
  
And I may lose my way again and again  
But I'll cross that borderline in the end  
  
Trouble trouble trouble whirling all about  
But if we stick together we can stick it out  
Will we ever find the loves we lost again  
Does this crazy journey ever have an end  
  
And will I find what I'm after  
Do I know what I'm after  
Guess I'll join in the laughter  
On the road to utopia

My great grandfather was a satisfied man  
Contented in every way  
Such was the course of his everyday life  
'Til he heard of the seven rays (Repeat 3X)  
  
Every modern man, in the back of his mind  
Has a problem to face  
He wants security for the home in his head  
All he needs is the seven rays (Repeat 2X)  
  
And when you think about tomorrow  
What goes through your mind?  
Now don't nobody get uptight  
Do you think that we can put up  
With this shit one more night  
All you need is just six more rays (Repeat 2X)  
  
Take one beam of light  
Prism acquire  
Break the white light down  
Seven rays appear (Repeat)  
  
One, Red, the ruler seeking freedom  
Two, Gold, the father seeking unity  
Three, Orange, the thinker seeking understanding  
Four, Yellow, the poet seeking harmony  
  
Take the seven rays  
Pure as fire  
Focus anywhere  
White light will appear (Repeat 2X)  
  
Five, Green, the scientist seeking truth  
Six, Blue, the disciple seeking goodness  
Seven, Indigo, the artist seeking beauty  
  
This may sound like a bunch of trumped up words  
But we keep no secrets today  
The only hope for you is in your brothers, my friend  
All you need is just six more rays  
All we need is the seven rays (Repeat 3X)

Sometimes I wonder if I'm still alive  
How much abuse can someone stand and survive  
How long I've waited for this day to arrive  
When I won't be a fool no more  
Nobody knows how you push me around  
Nobody sees how you treat me like I'm your clown  
I never made a sound  
It's the very last time you will get on my case  
It's the very last time 'cause  
I won't be a fool no more  
It's the very last time you will step on my face  
It's the very last time 'cause  
I won't be a fool no more  
I still remember the look in your eyes  
Just a reflection of the things you despise  
But sooner or later I've got to get wise  
And I won't be a fool no more  
Nobody sees how you treat me like dirt  
Nobody knows just how badly a man can hurt  
You've got a lesson to learn  
I can still feel the sting of your words  
But I won't cry no matter how much it hurts  
My head may go crazy, my heart it may burst  
But I won't be a fool no more  
No I won't be a fool no more

They say pain can bring out the artist's best  
But since you've been gone, I just can't care less  
Common sense doesn't realize  
It can hurt so bad  
Everyday I sit in my garret staring at the floor  
But my heart isn't in it anymore  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
Me and Gaugin used to party down  
I was hung in the Louvre, I was Renoir's pal  
Vincent Van Gogh used to joke with me  
Now they don't come 'round  
It's all over town that the master's lost his touch  
I'm so lost I can hardly hold a brush  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
And now my palette is a sorry mix of grey and brown  
And all the other art lovers stay away 'cause I'm bringing them down  
  
Now I wander the Left Bank every day  
Searching for my muse in a sad cafe  
Peddle my oils to the galleries  
But they turn me down  
Everybody says I'm a master of technique  
But the style and the sentiment is weak  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye  
  
There goes my inspiration  
My reason for creation  
There goes my inspiration  
I felt it fly away when you said goodbye

Brother John saw visions of God  
So they put him in chains  
For acting too odd  
As the crowd shouted, "Off with his head"  
The priest said, "Have mercy  
Let's burn him instead"  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that he never made  
I woke up with my head on the floor  
In a windowless cell  
A room full of doors  
I got lost, now I'm so far behind  
Took so much advice  
Forgot my own mind  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that I never made  
We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip  
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip  
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today  
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away  
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive  
What makes you think that the weak survive  
And if you don't have the stomach  
For all this radical crap  
Then have the guts to stand for something  
Or you're gonna be trapped  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that you never made

There's too much music, too much light  
These endless broadcasts into the night  
Petty seizures of money and drugs  
By some official or unauthorized thugs  
Now it's gone, the whole world's gone  
There's the army at the front door, guerrillas in back  
Why do I always have to take up sides  
I had no plans to be conscripted today  
I am no use to them anyway  
So what the hell's going on  
When they took my bed for the good of the state  
I had to rest my head and took to levitation  
Welcome to my revolution  
Every morning they confer with the press  
Just to point a few fingers  
Fix the blame for this mess  
The spokesmen waffle and the jerk-offs complain  
In a stream of rhetoric  
Piss themselves down the drain  
Then it's time to go home  
Time to go home  
What will they say when it's gone  
The whole world's gone  
So they call a cease fire to bury the dead  
And just delay it for an hour or so  
Loose talk of cowards and leaders that lied  
What does it matter once we're vaporized  
Say what the hell's going on  
Then it got so bad I couldn't breathe the air  
So I became my own church and begged for sanctuary  
Welcome to my revolution  
This is the dream that I have every night  
I wake up screaming t  
Is this my vision of the end of the world  
The faces looked smoldered, the edges are curled  
Tell me what is the reason we can't look at ourselves  
And realize everybody creates his own hell  
And if we put it together to make them all real  
And then forget how to think, forget how to feel  
Until it's gone, the whole world's gone  
Are we damned if we do and damned if we don't  
Could we be suckered into thinking that  
Or get too greedy, afraid of the loss  
And wind up fighting for a worthless cause  
What if we died and had to come back  
How may times would we have to go 'round  
What if tomorrow was the end of the line  
Don't want to feel like I wasted my time  
So what the hell's going on  
When the noise gets so dense  
you can't hear yourself think  
We got the spirit world on a telephone link  
So welcome to my revolution

Said the world to the sun, "i must turn away,  
Cause my face is so ugly, I feel so ashamed  
Tell me where does the world go to hide?  
  
All the people down here, they fight everywhere  
They destroy and they poison  
They don't even care  
So where does the world go to hide?  
  
Nobody cares what will happen to me  
And nobody cares if I cry  
There must be a reason to carry on  
But the pain is so bad I could die  
  
Said the sun to the people, "now who is to blame?  
But like scared little children they all ran away  
But where can the world go to hide?  
  
Tell me where can the world go to hide?

Mommy told me she has everything I want  
Mommy told me that I should not worry 'bout nothing else  
Mommy told me that I can't do what I want  
Mommy told me  
But she's only thinking about herself  
Can  
I'm thinking about myself  
Time to leave and it's just as well  
'Cause I can't help thinking there's something else  
Wildlife  
So I told he that I must have something more than she offered  
And she should not worry about my health  
I'm a big boy, not her little boy no more  
I'm a big boy and I must learn how to protect myself  
Hold my own when they give me hell  
She can worry about herself  
Tiny eagles must leave their nest  
Wild horses withstand the test  
Old lovers become estranged  
Little boys who can't help but change  
Could be nothing but who can tell

You're always finding out  
About the things that people never talk about  
I didn't ask to know  
But now I'm compensating as I go  
I know the script I'm in  
I'm only thoughts of heaven trapped in flesh and skin  
And from the world of men  
I try to tighten up the code again  
And the code is a play  
A play is a song  
A song is a film  
A film is a dance  
Boot me up on the Zen Machine  
Log me onto the Zen Machine  
Load me down  
Everybody get ready  
Hook me into the Zen Machine  
Sharing time on the Zen Machine  
Load me up  
Everybody get ready  
Sometimes it's clear to me  
Then for a moment I'm in timeless ecstasy  
There are no reasons why  
And everyone's a passer-by  
But when they've gone to bed  
A fire's burning on the screen and in my head  
And on a windy day  
You can smell it from a mile away  
And the smell is a note  
A note is a taste  
A taste is a hue  
A hue is a touch
