This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, "I love you"  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?  
(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah  
  
Oh, I'm singing it to you right now  
Cause we're talking about  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
As time goes by  
  
Time goes by

Chorus x2:  
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl  
Standin round waitin for my queendom to fall  
Well I think not, styles are pipin hot  
Blazin, amazin, I give it all I got  
  
I'm tellin you straight up, all sleepin beauties better wake up  
Ill tear your state up, so set the date up  
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it  
Who did it, who does it  
From private to public  
Anywhere I'm in there and been there  
So recognize this, who the nicest  
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes  
Whatever you want I got  
Whether you ready or not  
Its about to get hot when I drop  
So notes, pause another spot  
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you  
Don't try to be me, do you  
Be coo to you and do you  
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane  
I am the queen, that's my name, time to explain  
That I spit game with dames  
Leave em all with shit stains  
Split frames, hopin you hopin that I'm jokin  
Don't know but still blink off like for-fos  
But so-so, slow mos comin in like the po-pos  
Don't want rocks comin at me the wrong way  
Packin much rocks, it's gonna be a long day  
And for real, spittin on imbessiles and spinnin wheels  
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted  
Ill take it to your stomach, run it, give me all  
Mic for mic, steppin to me you gonna fall, we brawl  
Throwin a two-piece so loose leafs  
Its the q-you-double-e-n  
You know how I'm mcin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
See physically you not ready  
Lyrically you not ready  
Mentally maybe  
Who talks tough, time to get the baby  
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on  
From dusk til dawn from night til mourn  
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks  
Til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk  
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker  
Thinkin I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor  
Are you out of your mind, doubtin mines, out of line  
Talkin out your behind, shoutin rhymes out of time  
Its all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now  
Now you hush, hush now, aint sayin too much now  
Thought so, haunt yo sleepin ass, creepin fast  
Like you was doin somethin, now I gotta ruin somethin  
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin in the air  
Like a chandilier, poppin off like a can of beer, understand is it clear  
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty  
Even though I'm low-key, you know me  
You be singin over my tracks like it's kareoke  
If you don't know the half you gon feel the wrath  
Represent the rugged path, the flavor unit staff  
Droppin mathmatics, layin you out like craftmatic  
Ill let you have it, so you don't want the static  
  
Chorus x2

Bring on that pecan pie  
Pour some sugar on it, sugar, don't be shy  
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl  
Don't be stingy, I'm a growing girl  
  
I offer big love with no apology  
How can I deny the world the most of me  
I am not afraid to throw my weight around  
Pound by pound by pound  
  
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful  
Face the fact, the simply irrefutable  
No one wants a meal that only offers the least  
When girl, we're serving up the whole damn feast  
  
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese  
Then take a look inside my book of recipes  
Now, don't you sniff around for something fluffy and light  
We need a man who brings a man-size appetite  
  
I'll use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice  
I'll let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice  
We'll keep it in a oven 'til it's good and hot  
Keep on stirring 'til it hits the spot  
  
Because I'm big, blonde and beautiful  
There is nothing 'bout us that's unsuitable  
Why sit in the bleachers, timid and afraid  
When Edna, you look like the whole parade  
  
They say that white has might and thin is in  
Well, that's just bull  
'Cause ladies, big is back and as for black  
It's beautiful  
  
All shapes and sizes, follow me  
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Prove it baby, prove

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
Away for a walk on a winter's day  
I'd be so safe and warm if I was in L.A.  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
I stopped into a church yes I did, that I passed along the way  
And I got down on my knees down on my knees  
And I pretended to pray, you know the preacher he likes it cold  
'Coz he knows I'm gonna stay, as he knows I'm gonna stay  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day, oh yeah  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a cold winter's day, yeah  
I'd be so safe and warm if I was in L.A  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
On such a winter's day, on such a winter's day  
California, California dreamin', California dreamin'  
Play that for me  
I know it's just a dream, dream of California dreamin'  

["Chicago" Soundtrack]  
  
[Intro: Queen Latifah]  
Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah, yes I'm here to testify  
No, I gotta speak on my behalf, you don't even know  
What happened  
Can I just tell you what happened?  
  
[Chorus: Macy] (Latifah)  
He had it comin' (He had it comin')  
He only had himself to blame  
If you'd a been there, if you'd a seen it  
I think that you would have done the same  
  
[Verse 1: Queen Latifah] (Macy)  
I mean imagine, why was he hittin' his woman?  
Why was she takin' that?  
Now picture her fightin' back, picture the ass kickin'  
Think of his ass flippin' down the stairs  
And me at the top smilin', he shoulda stopped wildin'  
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off?  
See why I pictured me on this side of the law  
High heels leave holes, you'd a thought I was gunnin'  
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin'  
(He had it comin')  
Girl you shoulda seen it, shoulda bobbed and weaved  
Before the cops came, got a coupla clean hits  
In word the??? Couldn't take the abuse  
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops  
But you know girl, yeah you go girl  
Plus I look real cute in orange jump suits  
This the story I'm tellin' and I ain't changin' nothin'  
I just needed you to know Your Honour  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim] (Macy)  
Aiight aiight, let's get this over with  
Take the mug shot, hurry up the fingerprints  
What the blood clot?  
Lil' Kim aka Sofia Luchiani  
Keep your jump suit, I'm rockin' Armani  
Yeah, I bust at him once, but that was just a warnin'  
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin'  
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mine  
It ain't my fault he ran into my knife 20 times (He had it comin')  
Just my luck the bastard ain't die  
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked ya eye?  
Broke ya nose 'til it started bleedin'  
Kicked you in ya ribs, chocked you 'til you stopped breathing  
(Fuck) that, I'm sick of bobbing and weaving  
Threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him  
I do a bid, 'cause ain't no way  
(Nigga) gonna do me like Ike and oj  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Verse 3: Queen Latifah]  
This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused  
How many of you been in my shoes before, aiight  
Or have you felt you caught the worse case  
Puttin' up wit his tired ass in the first place  
Why am I flippin'? I just bought them condoms  
I ain't used not one but there was two missin'  
Get a new mission, how to catch a cheater  
If he only use coach, you shouldn't smell???  
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer  
If you catch him cheatin' you shouldn't yell either  
Run up on him quietly, took him out silently  
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony  
So explain that, just came back off a trip  
And I come home to this, please  
He ain't followed the guidelines  
So forgive me Your Honour, he ran into my knife five times  
  
[Chorus 3x]

I don't even care  
No more  
That's my word  
That's for sure  
I don't even cry  
No more  
That's absurd  
I'm so cured  
  
I'm so secure  
With who I is,  
Oops, who I am  
And I'm a champion  
For sure boy  
I'm a champ  
Oh, yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh  
For now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know, I believe  
Ain't nobody gonna do  
It but me  
I'm fly, no lie  
I'm the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion  
  
What you say  
Don't stick  
I'm the best  
And I know it  
I know you tried  
To bring me down  
Look at me now  
Watch my smile  
  
I'm so secure  
With who I am  
And I'm a champion  
For sure  
I'm a champ  
Oh, yes I am  
  
But what  
I thought about  
When those people  
Put me down  
They can laugh for now  
But watch it  
When I turn  
This thing around  
I know, I believe  
Ain't nobody gonna do  
It but me  
I'm fly, no lie  
I'm the truth  
Baby ask me why  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion  
  
Keep your head up  
They hatin'  
Cause you  
Majored in minor  
Gonna celebrate  
Like you won  
The finals  
Hold your trophy up  
In your parade  
In your honor  
And pour some champagne  
And put your glass  
To the sky  
'Cause you a champion  
You're a champion  
  
I'm a champion  
I'm a champion

Something dreamy for dancing  
While we're here romancing  
It's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be right hear by your side  
So...

Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep  
Close your eyes  
And I will close mine  
Close your eyes  
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep  
Close your eyes  
This is divine  
Music play  
Something dreamy for dancing

It's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be near by your side  
So won't you close your eyes...

Hey old friend let's look back  
On the crazy clothes we wore  
Ain't it fun to look back  
And to see it's all been done before  
  
All those nights together  
Are a special memory  
And I can't wait for tomorrow  
Just as long as you're dancing next to me  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
What's gone is gone, the past is the past  
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend together  
Side by side and year by year  
The road was filled with twists and turns  
Oh, but that's the road that got us here  
  
Let's move past the bad times  
But before those memories fade  
Let's forgive but not forget  
And learn from the mistakes we made  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So don't give up and don't say when  
And just get back on the road again 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend come along for this ride  
There's plenty of room so jump inside  
The highway's rocky every now and then  
But it's so much better then where I've been  
  
Just keep movin' at your own speed  
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need  
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on  
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone  
We got so far to go  
  
Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So shine that light, take my hand  
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go

It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you  
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?  
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC  
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)  
This MC stands for "Microphone Commando"  
When I command that you take a hand  
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now  
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)  
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)  
A battle, put me in it, I win it  
The mission is music and rhythm  
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system  
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in  
Heart into the music, music I take part in  
One try, one God, and one destiny  
Just dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 2x)  
Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to  
My brother Lance said "Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet"  
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat  
Ample samples, this for example  
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel  
Your plans of moving to the front lines  
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine  
I hop, dip, and spend with the children  
So get down with the sound and you will lend  
To let me bring while I bring  
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating  
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit  
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it  
So if you want to know what the plan is to be  
I order you to dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 2x)  
My voice is your choice at a stage show  
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say "ho"  
With powerful lyrics I'm armed  
To let a sucker step up and get bombed  
By a beat created by my producer  
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to  
This here is a moment of truth  
So take the record to the DJ booth  
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb  
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some  
People dancing, I can spot 'em  
When I take control, you know I got 'em  
Stop the music? That's not a question  
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions  
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be  
I order you to dance for me  
"Dance to the music" (Repeat 6x)

CHORUS  
Elements that I'm among, these none. Fools be gettin' done, but over  
dumb  
reasons. y'all didn't Know. Elements that I'm among, these none. Betta

Now you said no tricks in '86 it's time to build, now we gone be pushin'

Because if a fifth was a fifth we all be drunk... nigga don't, put no

Niggas be on some black on black crime shit. And I can't let it slide  
cause I'm  
terrified that I might be the next homocide, the pound is on my side.  
  
CHORUS  
Elements that I'm among, these none. Fools be gettin' done, but over

Niggas be all in my face like government be in my check, every time I  
pick up the  
mic and begin to wreck. But right now my job is more important than a  
nigga,  
I'm in to peace, its so tricky this ain't the way I figured. An evident  
I wasn't  
raised that way, we kicks a grip to stay that way, and I'm tryin' to  
stay "forever  
free," like AZ... baskin' in the riches of this hip hop M you S I C.  
'Cause when the  
east is in the house, "Oh My God!" Is right. I know girls that's givin'  
niggas fair  
fights, so you damn right. Ima stick up for mine, like a queen at a bee,  
and Ima

need to  
run run, like a bee y'all get stomped, by my diggy dumps dumps, all  
because of ya  
tounge. And I'll be lampin' in the sun when the day is done.  
  
CHORUS  

You asked I came so behold the Queen  
Let's add a little sense to the scene  
I'm living positive not out here knocked up  
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up  
  
This rhyme doesn't require prime time  
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine  
Back again cause I knew you wanted it  
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it  
  
Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled  
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track  
From KRS to be exact  
  
It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking  
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking  
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you  
About the evil that men do  
  
Situations, reality, what a concept!  
Nothing ever seems to stay in step  
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers  
Here are some things I want to cover  
  
A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares?  
Because she's living on welfare  
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan  
So she's in no man's land  
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal  
  
KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom!  
  
Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident  
  
[KRS-One]  
But there's no response from the president  
  
Queen Latifah:  
Someone's living the good life, tax-free  
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free  
And that's just part of the message  
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do  
  
Tell me, don't you think it's a shame?  
When someone can put a quarter in a video game  
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street  
You can't treat him the same  
  
It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind  
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds  
You to a doom, a fate worse than death  
But there's still time left  
  
Stop putting your conscience on cease  
And bring about some type of peace  
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind  
It will benefit all mankind  
Then there will be one thing that will never stop  
And it's the evil that men do

Well it's almost nightfall  
And there's no forecast of rainfall  
And I'm in the mood for a party  
So I'm gonna go out to a club  
And give the dancefloor body  
So I jump in the car and go to the venue  
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu  
Guys in the house they're wacthing me  
They're clocking me there's no stopping me  
  
(Desire) I know you want me  
(You're fine) thank you  
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am  
I don't jump into the arms of every man  
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money  
(I love you) you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I ain't  
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint  
  
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys  
I always hear, yo, baby?  
I mean like what's the big idea?  
I'm a queen, nuff respect  
Treat me like a lady  
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby  
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere  
One with class and savoir faire  
I'm looking for someone who has to be  
Perfect for the queen latifah me  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
All my friends are in relationships  
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones  
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better  
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones  
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get  
I want a friend not just a lover  
Someone who is dedicated only to me  
Not to me and two or three others  
One who will not lie to me or think  
He can get my love by buying me  
I know I'll find him some day  
And when I find him  
He sure won't say  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
Lounging, sitting in the house  
And I'm cooling, first day of the week  
So there's nothing to do  
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss  
Momma never said there'll be days like this  
So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile  
  
It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year  
And this time I know I'm gonna hear  
  
Fly girl, fly girl, come here  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
(Desire) I know you want me  
(You're fine) thank you  
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am  
I don't jump into the arms of every man  
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money  
(I love you) you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I ain't  
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint  
  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl

I try to reason and tell myself you'll return  
But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby, you were gone  
  
Forgive and forget it that's not what I'll ask you to do  
'Cause I want you back, yeah  
You know, you know I want you back  
And in concluding my mental discussion  
I found I lost my prized possession  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby, you were gone  
  
You were mine for only a minute  
And if I hurt you I didn't intend it  
  
You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind  
You're not gonna stay  
And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby  
I lost you, baby and you were gone  
  
Lie, lies I told you baby  
I never meant to say  
  
But a desperate mind  
Does a desperate thing baby  
I can't loose you  
I do whatever I got to do  
  
I never loved like this before  
I don't mean to be so silly  
Such a little girl sometimes  
I really want to be your woman  
I just...  
  
It gets so heavy baby...  
It gets so heavy  
And I just want you...  
I just want you to think about  
Don't let me go

(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)  
(shoo-bop, shoo-bop)  
  
Hello, stranger  
(ooh) It seems so good to see you back again  
How long has it been?  
(ooh, seems like a mighty long time)  
(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh)  
It seems like a mighty long time  
  
Oh-uh-oh, I my, my, my, m  
I'm so glad  
You stopped by to say "hello" to me  
Remember that's the way it used to be  
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time  
(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh)  
  
Oh-uh-oh  
I'm so glad you're here again  
Oh-uh-oh  
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby  
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby  
  
Oh-ahh-uh-oh  
If you're not gonna stay  
(ooh) Please don't treat me like you did before  
Because I still love you so a-a-although  
It seems like a mighty long time  
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh  
It seems like a mighty long time  
  
Oh-uh-oh, I my, my, my, my  
I'm so happy that you're here again  
(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)  

(Chorus)  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
How Much Do I Love You  
Well, Multiply Your Love By Infiniti  
Picture A Vision Of Beauty  
As We Dance By The Light Of The Moon  
Your Passion So Often Consumes Me  
Like The Lick Of A Native Tongue Tune  
Reality Is Ours To Create  
Fantasy Is Ours To Mold  
Dream My Love Dream  
With My Body And My Soul  
Question Out My Faith  
I'm Pledged To Be Your Lover  
And After I Started Loving You  
I Knew I'd Never Love Another  
I'm Like A Child Within Your Arms  
Would You Come Inside And Play With Me  
Spend The Day With Me  
Have Your Way With Me.  
(Chorus)  
Remember This Always  
My Sweet One  
No Lie Is True  
And Dude It's Not A Lie  
When I Say That  
I Would Die For You  
You're So Deep Within Thee  
That Sometimes Your Just A Touch Away  
But I Can't Reach You  
I Seek You  
Come To Me  
But Then you're All Around Me  
You Just Surround Me  
And You Astound Me  
And I receive You  
'Fore I Complete You  
It Pleases Me  
To Have You Touch Me There  
I Think You Know It Gets To Me  
Stop  
Don't Stop  
Ecstacy  
(Chorus)  
So Sweet  
I Adore You  
Come To Me  
That's Right  
Come To Me  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
Reality Is Ours To Create  
Fantasy Is Ours To Mold  
Dream My Love Dream  
With My Body And My Soul  
Question Out My Faith  
I'm Pledged To Be Your Lover  
And After I Started Loving You  
I Knew I'd Never Love Another  
I'm Like A Child Within Your Arms  
Would You Come Inside And Play With Me  
Spend The Day With Me  
Have Your Way With Me.  
Please Don't Go  
Happiness Is Nothing Without You  
Stay.  
My Sweet One  
I Adore You  
Hold Me  
Come To Me  
Love Me  
Love Me  

Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side [Repeat: x 4]  
  
I know you want us both and I know the reason why.  
I can give you so much lovin ,  
But presents, she can buy you.  
Last night youre in my arms,  
Tonight Im all alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
How long will this game go on? How long?  
Oh, oh how long?  
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.  
I know you got a chick on the side.  
  
And its plain, plain enough to see that  
You're not the man for me.  
I can't keep playin' games that keep my heart in pain.  
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do  
Than it is to say.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure.  
Ill get over you, yes Ill find someone new.  
Each time I open up my heart,  
It seems to just get torn apart.  
  
Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick.  
I know you got a chick on the side. [Repeat: x 4]  
  
I saw you, don't you try to hide.  
Don't hide it from me, no, no. no. [Repeat several times]  
  
[Adlib line 2:]  
You thought you would hide it, hide it,  
Hide it from me.  
[Repeat several times]  
  
[Talking at the end]

There's a light in the darkness  
Though the night black as my skin  
There's a light burning bright showing me the way  
But I know where I've been  
  
There's a cry in distance  
It's a voice that comes from deep within  
There's a cry asking why  
I pray the answer's up ahead yeah  
'cause I know where I've been  
  
There's a road we've been travellin'  
Lost so many on the way  
But the riches will be plenty  
With the price, the price we had to pay  
There's a dream in the future  
  
There's a struggle that we have yet to win  
And there's pride in my heart  
'cause I know where I'm going, yes I do  
And I know where I've been, yeah  
  
There's a road that we must travel  
There's a promise that we must make  
Oh the riches will be plenty  
Oh the dream in the future  
Oh the struggle we must win  
Use that pride in our heart  
To lift us up  
Lord knows i know  
Where I've been

What you mean, wanna know how I feel about you, baby?  
Be poetic about it, alright  
  
I love the east, I love the west  
And north and south, they're both the best  
But I'll only go there as a guest  
'Cause I love being here with you  
  
I love the sea, I love the shore  
I love the rocks but what is more?  
With you they'd never be a bore  
'Cause I love being here with you  
  
Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour  
Life is such a breezy game  
Love all kinds of weather, as long we're together  
I love to hear you say my name  
  
I like good wine and fine cuisine  
And candle light, I like the scene  
But baby, if you know what I mean  
'Cause I love being here with you  
I love being here with you  
  
I like a dance by Fred Astaire  
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair  
But I think to tell you's only fair  
That I love being here with you  
  
And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day  
His utter charm takes me away  
But don't get me wrong, how do you say  
I love being here with you  
  
Oh, Basie's band's a-swingin', I like Ella singin'  
'Cause there's something else, you know  
They know how to say it, they know how to play it  
They wind it up and let it go  
  
I love the thrill of New York shows  
I'd love to Durante's nose  
But I'd like to say before I close, yeah, yeah  
I just love, baby I love, well, I love being here with you

[Inspired by Nina Simone's 1965 cover of Screamin' Jay Hawkins 1956 cult hit]  
I put a spell on you  
'cause you're mine  
You better stop the things you do  
I ain't lyin'  
No I ain't lyin'  
You know I can't stand it  
You're runnin' around  
You know better daddy  
I can't stand it cause you put me down  
I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine  
You're mine  
I love ya  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you anyhow  
And I don't care  
If you don't want me  
I'm yours right now  
You hear me  
I put a spell on you  
Because you're mine

Want a little sugar  
In my bowl  
I want a little sweetness  
Down in my soul  
I could stand some lovin'  
Oh so bad  
I feel so funny and I feel so sad  
  
I want a little steam  
On my clothes  
Maybe I can fix things up  
So they'll go  
  
Whats ya matter Daddy  
Come on, save my soul  
I need some sugar in my bowl  
I ain't foolin'  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
  
You been acting different  
I've been told  
Soothe me  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
I want some steam  
On my clothes  
  
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go  
Whats ya matter Daddy  
Come on save my soul  
I want some sugar in my bowl  
I ain't foolin'  
I want some - yeah - in my bowl.

[Inspired by Dinah Washington's 1955 recording of a song introduced by Rudy
Vallee in 1928]  
I could show the world how to smile  
I could be glad all of the while  
I could change the gray skies to blue  
If I had you  
I could leave the old days behind  
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind  
I could start my life anew  
If I had you  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burning desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
[Instrumental - first two verses]  
I could climb a snow-capped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burnin' desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king uncrowned  
Humble or poor, rich or renowned  
There is nothin' I couldn't do  
If I had you  
Baby, if I had you

Chorus: (1x)  
Just Another Day, living in the hood  
Just another day around the way  
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay  
Just another day, living in the hood  
Just another day around the way  
Feelin good today  
I hear the(gunshot), but I'm here to stay  
[Verse 1]  
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
A beautiful day in the neighbor-hood  
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good  
I'm wit whateva comes my way, hip-hop hooray  
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain on day to day  
I strap out, step out in every direction  
Glock, tech's, jimmy hat's, in case I need protection  
So I land cruise, play I want to be's  
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me  
So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger  
Don't want to get wet, so they step  
Cause mine's is slighty bigger  
But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk  
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't want to talk  
I stay true blue, I'm hopin it's you too  
I got the fever for the flava of a??????  
So it's back to the block time to play  
It's just another day around the way, hey  
[Chorus: 1x]  
[Verse 2]  
Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep it sight's  
Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's own tonight  
I'm doin the knowledge, it's not easy, easy  
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T.  
But it's home, so I flex, get pressure's off my chest  
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next  
Stomach ache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie  
Get a final call for the brother in a bow-tie  
I'm from little kid's, dream, and fiend for fun  
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playin wit her son  
I pass by a girl wake, they say she died at seven  
Hit by a stray, but I pray their's a hood in heaven  
Fake brother's claim their's no shame in they're game  
You know my name, show me a real nigga wit a brain  
Too it's back to the block time to play  
It's just another day around the way, hey  
[Chorus: 1x]  
[Verse 3]  
You know I gotta get props, I can't stop, wit out y'all  
I be nothin, no wreckin, no checkin, no rhymin, no cuttin  
No stages from pages, no phones, no beeper's  
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah  
I come with the real like respectin in rule  
Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool  
So it's back to the block time to play  
It's just another day, around the wha, around the muthafuckin way  
[Chorus until fade]

The ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked  
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted  
A woman can bear you break you take you  
Now it's time to rhyme can you relate to  
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream  
  
Ayo let me take it from here Queen  
Excuse me but I think I'm about do  
To get into precisely what I am about to do  
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue  
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you  
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed  
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed  
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes  
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)  
  
(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)  
  
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see  
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me  
Not for being one but for being with one  
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some  
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on  
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting  
We are the ones that give birth  
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First  
  
I break into a lyrical freestyle  
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles  
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two  
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do  
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)  
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)  
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse  
(With what?) With a little touch of "Ladies First"  
  
Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind  
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme  
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse  
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe  
A female rapper with the message to send the  
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen  
  
My sister, can I get some?  
  
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb  
  
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am  
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American  
You dig exactly where I'm coming from  
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some  
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid  
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay  
Pay me every bit of your attention  
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention  
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm  
Of which is now systematically given  
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister  
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another  
Plus one more, all four  
Have a job to do, we doing it  
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it  
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E  
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E  
  
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder  
Cooling on the scene with my European partner  
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax  
When I get there, that's when I tax  
The next man, or the next woman  
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming  
And I'll recite the chapter in verse  
The title of this recital is "Ladies First"

Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of  
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of  
Being forced to put suckers in their place  
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face  
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you  
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two  
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me  
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me  
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two  
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?  
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down  
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown  
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par  
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for  
This is Latifah's Law  
BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me  
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me  
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life  
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life  
Fire and desire make you go a little higher  
When I grab the wire of the mic  
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot  
Cause I roll like the homicide squad  
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and  
Left you in the litter to consider coping with  
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen  
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again  
Get a grip on the African way  
Cause there's a sucker born every day  
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw  
And this is Latifah's law  
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you  
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to  
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band  
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed  
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin  
A funky message from beginning to end  
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land  
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland  
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense  
In case you forgot, just check your conscience  
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine  
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine  
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew  
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do  
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call  
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all

I used to visit all the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails.  
  
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces  
With distant gay traces  
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales.  
  
Then you came along with your siren of song  
To tempt me to madness!  
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness  
Of a great love for me.  
  
Ah yes! I was wrong  
Again,  
I was wrong.  
  
Life is lonely again,  
And only last year everything seemed so sure.  
Now life is awful again,  
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.  
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,  
All I care is to smile in spite of it.  
  
I'll forget you, I will  
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.  
Romance is mush,  
Stifling those who strive.  
I'll live a lush life in some small dive  
And there I'll be, while I rot  
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

There I go, there I go, there I go  
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control  
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me  
I never can behave  
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic  
Music all around me, crazy music  
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you  
Turns me your slave  
Come and do with me any little thing you want to  
Anything baby, just let me get next to you  
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?  
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies  
How I worry about you  
Just can't live my life without you  
Baby come here, don't have no fear  
Oh, is there a wonder why  
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?  
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?  
So tell me why stop to think  
About this weather, my dear?  
This little dream might fade away  
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby  
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?  
That would make me strong and brave  
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid  
If there's a cloud up above us  
Go on and let it rain  
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane  
Oh my baby  
Won't you please let me love you  
And give a relief from this awful misery?  
Oh pretty baby, you make me feel so good  
Let me take you by the hand  
Come let us visit out there  
In that new promised land  
Maybe there we can find  
A good place to use a loving state of mind  
I'm so crazy daddy  
And I never knew what love's all about  
James Moody, you can come on in man  
And you can blow now if you want to  
We're through  

Get funky with it  
I told you before: you burn when you play with fire  
So take off your hats, matter of fact hail the new Sire  
You're hungry as hell, so i'm cookin up the chowder  
It's laced with ingredients, gon' come on like gunpowder  
Pom-pom! lick a shot, then I got to order  
I'm runnin for the border for causin disorder  
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses  
I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless  
The particular name of this queen is Latifah  
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher  
Collectively capture the heart of a nation  
Love my culture and show appreciation  
You're lookin for the black influ'?  
I do want too give it to you  
What are you mad?  
Give me some of what you had!  
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff  
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well  
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell  
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire  
Buckshot must be what you want and desire  
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin  
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin  
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang  
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'  
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?  
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?  
"Latifah's booty, yo, she could never succeed"  
Shiiit...  
You watch me do it and boom it, the Flavor Unit will snap necks  
You a-fi listen a likkle, you fi go buy the cassette  
You're starvin, cause you ain't had enough  
That's right, nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
You talk about flavor...  
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet  
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats  
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays  
I got flavor for days  
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and  
From me you know you get a worth for your money, and  
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance  
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance  
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'  
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'  
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse  
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'  
Not the typical female that tends to  
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'  
Small puff, I call your bluff  
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff  
  
(Ruff and tuff)  
(And all that stuff)  
  
Everybody know Latifah love positivity  
Now positivity erase negativity  
Mi comin inna di dance (?)  
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse  
As a black woman mi want equality  
Equality, and di freedom to be me  
Mi have a mother Rita, only call her Mommy  
Likkle brother and sister, Angelo and Kelly  
A brother in them laws, but mi call him Winki  
Lost mi daddy and (?) family  
(?) black (?) black country  
Believe in one God, one tribe, one destiny  
Cease!

[Repeat: x6]  
Refugees go 'head and do it  
Paper  
Go 'head and do it  
  
Ooh I betca' wondering how I knew  
That you been tryin' to infultrate my crew  
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U.  
Don't get it confused you ain't untouchable  
(Go 'head and do it)  
And while I been tryin' to keep my cool like a queen  
(Ooh like a queen)  
Without them bringin' the naughty girl outta me  
(Ooh, naughty girl outta me)  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cha know I heard you tryin' to take mine  
While I shine, you're living fake lives  
Don't ya know I heard you tryin' to take mine  
But while I shine ya lip and fake y'all styles  
All around me  
  
(Hata's tryin' to play La'  
But they know that they can't take her paper)  
Go 'head and do it  
Everybody talking see  
Spreadin' them lies about my friends and me  
They say that we're tighter than suppose to get  
That's because I haven't let ya chill wit me yet  
You make it hard for a girl to roll  
(Ooh, girl to roll)  
But make it easy so my pockets stay swol'  
(ooh, pockets stay swol')  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's right, yeah  
Check it, check it, why  
Check it, check it  
Come on, come on  
Yo, yo  
Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?  
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?  
  
As I look back on my life (check it)  
To get where I am I had to sacrifice  
You slammed my name in your magazine  
This business gets hard tryin' to stay a queen  
You're checkin' for me, you need to check yourself  
(Ooh, check yourself)  
And be someone, not someone else  
(Ooh, someone else)  
  
Refugees go 'head and do it  
Paper  
Go 'head and do it

You make me laugh  
Cause your eyes they light the night  
They look right through me  
You bashful boy  
You're hiding something sweet  
Please give it to me yeah, to me  
  
Talk to me some more  
You don't have to go  
You're the Poetry Man  
You make things all rhyme  
  
You are a genie  
All I ask for is your smile  
Each time I rub the lamp  
When I am with you  
I have a giggling teen-age crush  
Then I'm a sultry vamp  
  
Talk to me some more  
You don't have to go  
You're the Poetry Man  
You make things all right  
  
So once again  
It's time to say so long  
And so recall the cull of life  
You're going home now  
Home's that place somewhere you go each day  
To see your wife  
  
Talk to me some more  
You don't have to go  
You're the Poetry Man  
You make things all rhyme

Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me  
Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me  
Biting's against the law in the place that I live  
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib  
The call me the high priestess of this hasta  
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta  
There's never been a word I can't master  
I've always been, a piddly pastor  
I reign, the lesson of today  
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say  
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side  
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern  
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn  
Let me know now if you'd like to protest  
And proceeding a greeting, or would you rather progress  
Onto a higher plateau, to the peak and I'm taking it slow  
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know  
I'm the Q-you-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H  
Queen of the R.E. Posse the GLA which is  
Get Live Alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails  
Nervous, watching me doing the live thing  
Singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring  
I'm the Queen and you're the underling  
I'm never following, I follow none  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand  
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land  
It's a concoction, for my ability  
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility  
Cause they don't know I'm the one to fly one or two  
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to  
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip  
I'm kicking gold so grab a hold and get a good grip  
Stop the lying, the trying  
The time buying, you've been denying  
You're dependent on me, the princess of the posse  
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow  
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease  
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King to the posse  
Peace, got to let you know where I come from  
The princess of the posse is a cool one  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one  
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun  
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl  
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world  
Now take run the family  
Me say me have to do it for the R.E. posse  
You try to be down, you can't take the crown  
Maybe from someone else but not me (Repeat 2x)

Let me remind you on how to unwind your body  
So dance and shake and just keep in step  
Understand, draw a clear picture  
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def  
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom  
All competitors, I simply cream them  
One by one, I dust a rush them all  
If you have any more, bring them  
To the front so they can sho me what they got  
What they got, it better be hot  
Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box  
And they'll be put in a spot  
The style I use will surely amuse  
The party people to a state of gladness  
What I mean is I'm on the scene  
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H  
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates  
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise  
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys  
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking  
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking  
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred  
When you address me, address me as "Your Highness"  
One of hip-hop's finest  
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo  
It makes me no difference  
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me  
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?  
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic  
And draw attractions  
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles  
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them  
The result with a pen and a pad  
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness  
I can't wait until the party is jam-packed  
When I start to drop it, the people say "Damn, black"  
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly  
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be  
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell  
Guard as well as you can or step  
Off the premisis, in one minute it's  
Going to explode in a style that's limitless  
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move  
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool  
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss  
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust  
Literature that flows like liquid  
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it  
So don't say nothing  
Just listen up, follow instructions  
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said  
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads  
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands  
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams  
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery  
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me  
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this  
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness

Quiet nights 'n quiet stars,  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams,  
quiet walks by quiet streams  
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
  
  
[instrumental break]  
  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away . . . from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew,  
Became these quiet nights of loving you!  
[adlib quiet nights ect.]

There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that she turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although I may not be the man  
Some girls think of as handsome  
But to her heart  
I carry the key  
  
And this world would be like heaven, if she'd  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
Someone to watch over me

[Chorus]  
You ain't gotta be no superstar  
I only want to find out who you are  
And we gotta be no Superman  
So if you wanna talk to me, you can  
  
My girlies caught me on a good day  
I was (something) to move a job  
So we took it to a club  
Nigga we would make out a little  
And plus at the time I was single, a little  
So I said "Fine, we could meet up about nine"  
  
So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing  
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin'  
Some people in the joint is yellin' "Hurt me, Hurt me"  
I'm working my way over to the bar cause I'm thirsty  
And then I see this guy  
Oh no, I think he likes me  
I smile cause he's fly  
He smiles back, I think he likes me  
  
Well then it takes a twist  
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cause he's scared to get dissed  
I don't walk baby  
I don't bite neither  
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper  
The worst thing I'da said was "No"  
So maybe next time you better push a (something)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Saturday moving in the house  
Lookin' at the videos  
At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes  
First date (First Date) with the guy's name was Nate  
Was he fly?  
Yes he was  
Word up, the type you have on a plate  
Cause I only met him last night  
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right  
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo  
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?  
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand  
Now what was in your plan?  
I really didn't understand  
We're only going to the movies  
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony  
  
Listen baby, I don't want a condo  
You can make me smile a little and give me convo  
All I might require from my man is intelligence  
And all them other material things is irrelevant  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen  
And you know how to treat a queen  
Then step to the scene  
We can sit alone in a room and deal  
We can take a ride listening to music and chill  
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do  
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you  
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey  
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are  
Money ain't gone make me love ya  
And even with your car  
So cease with that attitude  
With that attitude you won't be getting far  
  
And I love all of my brothers with a passion  
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction  
(Yeah) If you cool like dat  
Take a trip to Jersey cause that's where I'm at  
  
[Chorus]

Come on now, I'm the one you love  
I'm the one you can't breathe without remember  
Why you wanna make me cry like this?  
Why is you wanna make me cry?  
Why me?  
Your love is like a chunk of gold  
Hard to gain, hard to hold  
Like a rose that's soft to touch  
Love has gone and it hurts so much  
Well then why...  
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?  
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain  
Think about it being a great big rock  
Won't you think before you started to roll it down  
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop  
I've given all I have to give  
And if you don't want me, baby  
I don't want to live  
Well then why...  
Oh, why  
Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?  
Why you wanna make me cry? [5x]  
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow  
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow  
Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry  
You use to be so soft and sweet to me  
And now you act so wrong and mean to me  
Now you get so wrong and mean to me  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Oh, why you wanna mess my pillow  
You got me cryin' like a weeping willow  
Wanna make me cry  
Oh, why, oh, why  
Why why why why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Ooh, why

I'm trav'lin' light  
Because my man has gone  
But from now on  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
He said, "Goodbye"  
And took my heart away  
So from today  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
No one to see  
I'm free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may come back again  
But until then  
I'm trav'lin' light  
  
No one to see  
I'm free as the breeze  
No one but me  
And my memories  
  
Some lucky night  
He may, he may come back again  
But until then  
I'm trav'lin' light

(talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me
from  
Heaven Watching my every move as usual....  
  
(chorus)  
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go  
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go  
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme  
  
But it's bustin from the seems  
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams  
I'm moving all around  
Oh yes,I'm making leaps an bounds  
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down  
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that  
I've overflowed my cup.  
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up  
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand  
There're things about all of ya'll have got to understand  
Latifah- never was a teacher  
Never was a preacher  
Never was a saint  
Never was conceited  
Never was defeated  
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.  
But I never shut up when things piss me off  
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across  
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be  
I've got an angel watching over me  
  
(chorus) 2 times  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
Yes he did, yes he did  
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world  
You don't hear me  
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world,world,world  
The light of my world, my world- AHHHHH yes he did...............

My mellow Latee was kicking flavor  
The R.E. posse said "Yo Latifah we can do this"  
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught  
And I agreed because I already knew this  
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect  
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set  
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free  
For God so loved the world he gave to me  
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin  
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin  
So prepare your mind for my lifeline  
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness  
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water  
And dive into the wrath of my madness  
(Latifah: rasta chorus)  
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Some MC's have gold and African vein  
And using each other to compete with  
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine  
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it  
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting  
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting  
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking  
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking  
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me  
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me  
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks  
Dying to have a lover of my likeness  
So release all your shyness, call me "Your highness"  
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness  
(Latifah: rasta chorus)  
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way  
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way  
Word of mouth is always everlasting  
And everlasting are the words that I bring  
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey  
And music is made by Mark the 45 King  
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass  
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace  
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs  
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug  
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging  
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving  
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping  
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness  
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it  
Feel the wrath of my madness  
(More rasta singing)  
I scene is mine cause I took it  
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun  
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste  
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one  
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?  
Because they want to be down with the  
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command  
I supply the concept for you to understand  
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss  
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus  
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me  
You wish that one day you could have this  
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme  
And get up on the wrath of my madness  
(Extended ragga outro)
