I dream of a place that's hedged with roses  
With a man in the middle don't talk in riddles  
You get hung on every single word  
Some call it high, some call it low  
  
And I hear about things you don't want to know  
But the truth is still a valuable thing  
Don't get caught with your pants down baby  
This world the criminal sing  
  
There is another world waiting  
But anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
  
You can hide your face  
Pull it into shades  
'Cause you can't escape the lie forever  
I dream of a place that's overrun by children  
  
And the lord is in the kitchen  
Do your work and you'll get your rewards  
'Cause what you are is all that really matters  
What is left you can easily scatter  
  
On the ground a head covered in mud  
Don't step on my principles baby  
In spite of what you have done  
One day you will have the wisdom  
  
I will tell you  
Everything straight  
Anyone can tell that I'm not lying  
You can hide your face  
  
You can change your shape  
'Cause you can escape the lie forever  
Anyone can tell  
Anyone can tell

Make your decision now  
Rely on no help from above  
Living is luxury  
I want everything you throw out  
I'll do anything you want to  
  
Please let me go with you  
I'll wear the smile on your face  
Big, black and beautiful  
I want it, everything you throw out  
There must be something you can do with out  
'Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
I pity the rhino  
Down there it's becoming extinct  
Killed for a love potion  
Sad thing looking like a dead flower  
I want it, everything that you throw out  
'Cause I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world  
  
Don't want to be there  
Don't want to be spared  
I'll wear the smile on your face  
I am as sure as I am  
  
I couldn't care less  
For what might go wrong  
And I'm as happy as sin  
In a fear shaken world, world,  
Couldn't care less

Somewhere deep inside, something's got a hold on you  
And it's pushing me aside, see it stretch on forever  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
Stripping back the coats of lies and deception  
Back to nothingness like a week in the desert  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
  
So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong  
'Cause when you get back home maybe I'll be gone, oh  
  
It would cause me pain if we were to end it  
But I could start again, you can depend on it  
And I know I'm right for the first time in my life  
That's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon  
Oh, that's why I tell you, you'd better be home soon

Black and white boy  
Black and white boy  
You're so extreme  
You're so confused  
Color me in whatever mood I'm in  
I could be still in touch with you  
And you're full of the wonder of spring  
It's all sweetness and lightness you bring  
And a room full of people fall to your infinite charm  
But when darkness should quickly descend  
You go quietly, my miserable friend  
To the depths of despair you will crawl  
Black and white boy  
  
Black and white boy  
Black and white boy  
You're so extreme  
You're so confused  
Color me in  
Whatever mood I'm in  
I could be still  
In touch with you  
  
When you shake off the shadows of night  
And your eyes are so clear and so bright  
You'll make fools of the liars and creeps  
Put a rose in my cheeks  
But when demons have climbed on your back  
You are vicious and quick to attack  
And you put on a wonderful show  
Do you really, really think I don't know?  
Black and white boy  
  
And you run like a cat to the cream  
And you're acting so nice it's obscene  
You put on a wonderful show  
Do you really, really think I don't know?  
Black and white boy

Why do I kid myself  
Why do I scream for pleasure  
It's four in the morning should know better  
But she can weave a spell  
Want it to last forever  
Making me feel like somebody special  
  
Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep)  
Before it gets too late (just go to sleep)  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again  
  
Though I look everywhere  
I never seem to find it  
Always a shadow around a corner  
Drown it in alcohol  
Stuck in the elevator  
Hard to remember in the morning  
  
Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep)  
Before it gets too late (just go to sleep)  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again  
  
Tell you about myself  
If you're in the mood to listen  
Baby you don't know who you're kissing  
This is a lonely world  
You are a strange companion  
When you get what you wanted  
You want to leave  
  
Honestly I want to free myself  
From the burden of inaction  
Honestly I want to raise myself  
To any plane I can imagine  
  
Can't carry on this way (just go to sleep)  
Before it gets too late (just go to sleep)  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again

No night to stay in  
Bad moon is rising again  
Dice rolls and you burn  
Come down I fear  
As that cold wheel turns  
I know what I know  
Sad Claude's been sleeping around  
To stroke the right nerve  
Whose needs do I serve  
As Catherine's wheel turns  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
  
Go kindly with him  
To his blind apparition  
His face creases up  
With age gone grey  
He'll back here one day  
  
She was always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Always the first to say gone  
She's got her Catherine wheels on  
Wheels on  
  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
Catherine wheels  
  
She's gone  
Vanished in the night  
Broke off the logic of light  
He woke  
Tore the covers back  
Found he was empty inside  
  
So they were told  
When the moon would rise  
The best time to leave with your soul  
She's gone  
But towards the light  
Watching her whole life unfold  
Bruises come out dark  
  
So strong was his hold on her  
Regarded by some as his slave  
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue  
Despair us and drive you away, hey  
Bruises come out dark

Not everyone in New York would pay to see Andrew Lloyd Webber  
May his trousers fall down as he bows to the queen and the crown  
I don't know what tune that the orchestra played  
But it went by me sickly and sentimental  
  
Can I have another piece of chocolate cake  
Tammy Baker's got a lot on her plate  
Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake  
Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave  
  
The band of the night take you to ethereal heights over dinner  
And you wander the streets never reaching the heights that you seek  
And the sugar that dripped from the violins bow  
Made the children go crazy, put a hole in the tooth of a hag  
  
Can I have another piece of chocolate cake  
Tammy Baker must be losing her faith  
Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake  
Andy Warhol must be laughing in his grave  
  
And the dogs are on the road  
They're all tempting fate  
Cars are shooting by  
With no number plates  
And here comes Mrs. Hairy Legs  
  
I saw Elvis Presley walk out of a Seven Eleven  
And a woman gave birth to a baby and then bowled .257  
The excess of fat on your American bones  
Will cushion the impact as you sink like a stone  
  
Can I have another piece of chocolate cake  
Tammy Baker, Tammy Baker  
Can I buy another cheap Picasso fake  
Cheap Picasso, cheap Picasso fake  
  
Can I have another piece of chocolate cake  
Kathy Straker, boy could she lose some weight  
Can I buy another slice of real estate  
Liberace must be laughing in his grave  
  
Can I have another piece of chocolate cake [x3]

Tell me all the things you would change  
I don't pretend to know what you want  
When you come around and spin my top  
Time and again, time and again  
  
No fire where I lit my spark  
I am not afraid of the dark  
Where your words devour my heart  
And put me to shame, put me to shame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
And dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
Still so young to travel so far  
Old enough to know who you are  
Wise enough to carry the scars  
Without any blame, there's no one to blame  
  
It's easy to forget what you learned  
Waiting for the thrill to return  
Feeling your desire burn  
And drawn to the flame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
And I'm lying on the table  
Washed out in a flood  
Like a Christian feeling vengeance from above  
I don't pretend to know what you want  
But I offer love  
  
Seven worlds will collide  
Whenever I'm by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
As time slips by  
  
As time slips by

There is freedom within, there is freedom without  
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup  
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost  
But you'll never see the end of the road  
  
While you're traveling with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they won't win  
  
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof  
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof  
In the paper today tales of war and of waste  
But you turn right over to the T.V. page  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they won't win  
  
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum  
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart  
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof  
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Don't dream it's over  
Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they wont win

Another pleasant day in the countryside  
Has ended up in tears on a stormy night  
'Cause you can't follow my directions home  
But don't stop now  
  
God knows where the satellite's taking us  
I can't tell what's right in front of us  
But I hang on every word  
And don't stop now  
No, don't stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
  
You get fooled by the lightning every time  
See the after-image of my outline  
And you turn the wrong way 'round  
Well, don't stop now  
No, don't stop now  
You give me something I can write about  
You give me something I can cry about  
  
In a church house ten miles out of town  
Is the devil gonna track me down?  
And travel through a tunnel in the trees  
Just remember that's how you get to me  
  
There's no number on the house  
The birds are heading south  
Sometimes you have to turn  
The wrong way 'round  
Sometimes you get too close to nowhere now  
  
This is helpful in the silence  
I wait with a blank piece of paper on the top of my head  
And all I want is something I can write about  
All I want is something I can cry about  
Ooo

Steam ship, sail down the river  
Fight the mosquitoes that fly in a swarm  
White smoke covers the jungle  
See Dr. Livingston land with a thunk  
Down where the sad willows gather  
Young women weep for their dying babies  
I am a white man in Africa  
If I were to stay here  
There'd be no one to save me  
  
I hear the drums  
I know it's urgent  
I hear survival in his hands  
Switch to record  
I get the picture  
But I will never understand  
  
Mad world, invisible army  
Blow up the bridges and come like a storm  
Young girl, eyes full of promise  
Carry the baby and keeping it warm  
  
Down where the sad willows gather  
Young men go down on their knees  
I am a white man in Africa  
With more than just my god to appease  
  
I hear the drums  
I know it's urgent  
I hear survival in his hands  
Switch to record  
I get the picture  
But I will never understand  
  
How there is love in his face  
'Midst of all this waste  
In the Mozambique sun  
Under the gun  
  
I hear the drums  
I hear survival in his hands  
I hear the drums  
There is a curse upon this land  
  
I hear the drums  
I know it's urgent  
I hear survival in his hands  
Hit record  
Get the picture  
I will never understand  
  
Carry the sound and the fury  
Left all alone in a war zone  
Carry the sound and the fury  
Hours later  
Thoughts of my bed  
Leave me tired and ready for sleep  
So tell me about all the places you go  
All the lives that you swallow, the people you keep  
Deep in a monastery  
That's where I want to be  
Wrestle my soul

See a man with a flag and he leads the procession  
And a woman shedding tears for a man locked in prison  
When the two locked eyes and for a moment I was taken  
And all paths lead to a single conclusion  
  
Everything is good for you  
If it doesn't kill you  
Everything is good for you  
One man's ending is another one's beginning  
Everything is good for you  
  
It's a nightmare jump into the restless ocean  
With a reckless calm to state their position  
And if you come undone it might just set you free  
  
Everything is good for you  
If it doesn't kill you  
Everything is good for you  
One man's ending is another one's beginning  
  
Bring back your head  
We'll come struggle to turn the angry words  
Cover you up  
  
Everything is good for you  
If it doesn't kill you  
Everything is good for you  
If it doesn't kill you  
Everything is good for you  
Is good for you

I'm really close tonight  
And I feel like I'm moving inside her  
Lying in the dark  
An' I think that I'm beginning to know her  
Let it go  
I'll be there when you call  
  
And whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain  
  
You're hiding from me now  
There's something in the way that you're talking  
Words don't sound right  
But I hear them all moving inside you  
Go, I'll be waiting when you call  
  
And whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain  
  
The finger of blame has turned upon itself  
And I'm more than willing to offer myself  
Do you want my presence or need my help  
Who knows where that might lead  
  
I fall  
Whenever I fall at your feet  
You let your tears rain down on me  
Whenever I fall  
Whenever I fall

Fork lightning in your hall  
Break the skin when you break the fall  
I'll be the one to fix it up  
  
Love children of the new age  
Just a hippy with a weekly wage  
There's no rebellion just a chance to be lazy  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You follow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
And hang on  
  
Now the rest of us are living in a daze  
Keep thinkin' 'bout the choice to be made  
Here come the handmaidens of end time  
  
Lost treasure from a primitive race  
All your lives written on your face  
Can't fill the canyons of your mind  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You follow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
And hang on  
  
Now you've changed  
You've jumbled the pieces you've changed  
You're better off before you talk  
To a roomful of strangers  
Here come the handmaidens of end time  
  
When fame is in your blood  
You swallow the science of love  
Wave the magic wand  
All of your stars will fall  
And all of your spells will break  
So look out for number one  
Fame is in your blood

Can you imagine that  
An itch too sensitive to scratch  
A light that falls through the cracks  
An insect too delicate to catch?  
  
I hear the endless murmur  
Every blade of grass that shivers in the breeze  
And the sound, it comes to carry me  
Across the land and over the sea  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I can't look back  
Fingers of love move down  
  
Color is it's own reward  
Color is it's own reward  
The chiming of a perfect chord  
Let's go jumping overboard  
  
Into waves of joy and clarity  
Your hands come out to rescue me  
And I'm playing in the shallow water  
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I won't be helped  
Fingers of love move everywhere  
And there is time yet  
To fall by the way  
  
From the cradle to the grave  
From the palace to the gutter  
Beneath the dying rays of the sun  
Lie the fingers of love  
  
Into waves of joy and clarity  
A fallen angel walked on the sea  
And I'm playing in the shallow water  
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps  
  
And I can't look up  
Fingers of love move down  
And I won't be helped  
Fingers of love move everywhere  
  
And there is time yet  
For you to find me  
And all at once  
Fingers of love move down

Four seasons in one day  
Lying in the depths of your imagination  
Worlds above and worlds below  
The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain  
  
Even when you're feeling warm  
The temperature could drop away  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
Smiling as the shit comes down  
You can tell a man from what he has to say  
Everything gets turned around  
And I will risk my neck again, again  
  
You can take me where you will  
Up the creek and through the mill  
Like all the things you can't explain  
Four seasons in one day  
  
Blood dries up  
Like rain, like rain  
Fills my cup  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
It doesn't pay to make predictions  
Sleeping on an unmade bed  
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain  
Only one step away  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
Blood dries up  
Like rain, like rain  
Fills my cup  
Like four seasons in one day

Plead with my saint  
Wash his hands and feet  
Find his complaints  
Make this world complete  
  
[Chorus:]  
And this heaven that I'm making  
It can't come quickly enough  
And the big wave that I'm taking  
It feels like I'm just waking up  
  
Find out, don't think  
I can't get used to it  
And right on the brink  
I end up losing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'll be there  
If all of creation is kind  
And each conversation I hear  
As I'm walking in through the crowd  
As if I could float through the air  
  
This Heaven...  
  
This is Heaven that I'm making  
This is Heaven...  
  
It can't come quickly enough  
And the people that I'm taking  
It can't come by quickly enough  
  
If there is Hell on Earth  
There must be Heaven, too  
Both in one place  
And not a second to lose

Help is coming  
I heard a whisper  
White caps turning  
Breath of summer  
  
Distant drummin'  
Lire birds callin'  
Escape the anguish of our past  
And pray  
  
Empires crumbling  
Callous winter  
Fear is running  
No longer with us  
  
We sail tomorrow  
For Ellis Island  
Escape, anger of our past  
And pray that peace will come at last  
And dream  
  
Release the anger of our past  
And pray that peace will come at last  
And stay  
Help is coming  
  
Help is coming  
We sail tomorrow  
For Ellis Island  
Help is coming  
  
Dreams come true  
We'll sail tomorrow  
Dreams come true  
Help is coming

There's a hole in the river where my auntie lies  
From the land of the living to the air and sky  
Left her car by the river left her shoes beside  
Through the thorns and the bushes I hope she was...  
  
Dreaming of glory  
Miles above the mountains and plains  
Free at last  
  
We were touched by a cold wind, my father and I  
The sound of desperate breathing her fear inside us all  
She was coming to see him but something changed her mind  
Drove her down to the river  
There is no return  
  
There's a hole in the river where a memory lies  
From the land of the living to the air and sky  
She was coming to see him  
But something changed her mind,  
Drove her down to the river  
There is no return

Escape is on your mind again  
Escape to a far away land  
At times it seems there is no end  
To long hard nights of drinking  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
I fell over on the couch again  
But you know not all sleep is wasted  
Your dreams are alcohol inspired  
I can't find a better way to face it  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
And you know I'll be fine  
Just don't ask me how it's going  
Gimme time, gimme time  
'Cause I want you to see  
Round the world, round the world  
Is a tangled up necklace of pearls  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in

Called out to prove my love  
You reply by getting defensive  
Called out o prove my love  
Now you should be able to sense it  
  
I'm full of your dreams  
I let you sleep with the lights on  
Stay with me might as well  
Be the kind of girl you want to beI am in love  
  
I am in love  
I am a fool  
Fell from above  
These things that I have done  
  
They would be a test of anyone  
How am I meant to see  
You dressed up like your mother  
They say you marry your father  
  
I hope that don't reflect on me  
They say you marry your mother  
I hope that don't put you in her company  
I am in love  
  
I am in love  
And I am a fool  
There is no other  
I am in love  
  
I am in love  
What I say is don't lie  
But it's enough to make you wonder  
I can't be one that you want to trust  
  
And not the one that you want to trample  
In the dust  
I am in love  
I am in love  
  
And I am a fool  
There is no other  
I am in love  
I am in love  
  
Into the fire  
Tears start coming  
Good stars surround us  
It's enough to want to make you wonder

She said I could never do that  
But I know you can, you are in my dream  
We are one person not two of a kind  
And what was mine is now in your possession  
I could feel you underneath my skin  
As the wind rushed in,  
Sent the kitchen table crashing  
She said nobody move  
Or I'll bring the house down  
I hardly know which way is up  
Or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
  
It was one of those times  
Wished I had a camera on me  
Six foot off the ground  
Well I know how that sounds  
Look above you and beyond me too  
That kind of view don't need an explanation  
I'm not lying, not asking for anything  
I just want to be there when it happens again  
  
I hardly know which way is up or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
  
Whenever you invade my home  
Everything I know flies out the window  
It's above you and beyond me too  
I don't want an explanation  
But I'll be there when you bring the house down  
  
I hardly know which way is up or which way down  
People are strange God only knows  
I feel possessed when you come round  
People are strange  
I feel possessed when you come round

I love you Dawn  
You understand  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
  
It was another time  
It was another place  
All is not lost  
And gone to waste  
  
Beneath the tall trees I believe  
There's nothing you and me  
Can't do together if we try  
The day is long and the nights are cold  
  
Just a song to warm your soul  
I don't want to see you cry  
I love you Dawn  
You understand  
  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
It was another tear  
It was another time  
  
All is not lost  
And we will shine  
Beneath the billboards and the hordes  
Magazines and rock awards  
  
We can't afford to pay our bills  
The day is long and the nights are cold  
Just a song to warm your soul  
I don't want to see you cry  
  
I love you Dawn  
You understand  
The strength of ten  
Men in your hands  
  
It was another tear, another year  
Another time  
All is not lost  
And we will shine

You came  
Out of this world to me  
My life  
Parted like the red sea  
We flowed  
Easy between the rocks and stones  
Never seemed to stop us  
The years  
Ended in confusion  
Don't ask me I don't know what happened  
But I am  
A man with a mission  
Must be the devil I don't know  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
Hurled from my home  
Into the unknown  
As I walk away from you  
  
Reveal whatever you desire  
To you it may be death defying  
Black day  
In the coldness of winter  
Black words  
Slipping off my tongue  
I say forget it - it's over  
As a dark cloud covered up the sun  
  
It's hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
The sun always sets  
With room for regrets  
As I walk away from you  
  
Give it to me  
Give it to me  
Your inspiration  
Give to receive  
Find all we need  
As I walk away  
  
Just a slave to ambition  
Tension your permanent condition  
So much you've always wanted  
Too much given' you a sore head

You're standing in a deep dark hole  
Beneath a sky as black as coal  
It's just the fear of losing control  
You know so well  
Don't miss it when the moment comes  
Be submissive just this once  
Imagine there is something to be done  
Some truth to tell  
  
I would love  
To trouble you in your time of need  
Lose your way  
It's a pleasure when you're in my command  
  
Juggle like a diplomat  
Struggle to hold onto your hat  
Swinging like an acrobat  
But time will tell  
The clock is dripping on the wall  
Listen to the rise and fall  
Close your eyes and hear the call you know so well  
  
Put on your wings  
You're responsible for everything  
  
Desolate in anger and safe in isolation  
You're about to be the victim of a holy visitation  
By the rites that I've been given  
  
Put on your wings  
You're not responsible for everything  
I would love  
To trouble you in your time of need  
Lose your way  
It's a pleasure when you're in my command  
When you're in my command  
In my command

Oh hell trouble is coming  
Out here in panic and alarm  
Black shapes gather in the distance  
Looks like it won't take long  
The first drops land on the window  
The first sign that there's something wrong  
Light rain and a head full of thunder  
Which way, which way  
Two days till I get to you  
I'll be late if I ever get through  
Where I go there'll be no kind welcome  
Coming down upon me  
Time will keep me warm  
Feel my face  
Now the insects swarm  
In the lowlands  
Fear will take the place of desire  
And we will fan the flames from on high  
Try for heavens sake  
The sky fell underneath a blanket  
The sun sank as the miles went by  
Sit back with your head on the pillow  
When you remember it makes you cry  
Ghost cars on the freeway  
Like friends that you thought you had  
One by one they are disappearing  
Time will keep me warm  
Feel my face  
Now the insects swarm  
In the lowlands  
Fear will take the place of desire  
And we will fan the flames from on high

You opened up your door  
I couldn't believe my luck  
You in your new blue dress  
Taking away my breath  
The cradle is soft and warm  
Couldn't do me no harm  
You're showing me how to give  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into temptation  
  
A muddle of nervous words  
Could never amount to betrayal  
The sentence is all my own  
The price is to watch it fail  
As I turn to go  
You looked at me for half a second  
With an open invitation for me to go  
  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into temptation  
Safe in the wide open arms of hell  
  
We can go sailing in  
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long  
Into temptation  
Right where you belong  
  
The guilty get no sleep  
In the last slow hours of morning  
Experience is cheap  
I should've listened to the warning  
But the cradle is soft and warm  
  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into your wide open arms  
No way to break the spell  
Don't tell

I bring you plates from Rome  
You say they look fantastic  
I say we're having fun  
Nothing like that Italian plastic  
  
I bring you rocks and flowers  
You say they look pathetic  
You pick me up at night  
I don't feel pathetic  
  
When you wake up with me  
I'll be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
Then you're my bella bambina  
  
I say we're on a trip  
Look's like we're on vacation  
I say we're having fun  
In our little constellation  
  
When you wake up with me  
I'll be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
  
Then I'll be your bella bambino, your man from the moon  
I'll be your little boy running with that egg on his spoon  
I'll be your soul survivor, your worst wicked friend  
I'll be your piggy in the middle, stick with you till the end  
  
When you wake up with me  
I'll be your glass of water uh huh  
When you stick up for me  
Then you're my bella bambina  
  
Who ya gonna take to the ball tonight?  
Who ya gonna take to the dance tonight?  
Who ya gonna take to the ball tonight?  
Who ya gonna take to the dance tonight, tonight, tonight?

I was standing on a wave  
Then I made the drop  
I was lying in a cave  
In the solid rock  
I was feeling pretty brave  
Til the lights went off  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon  
We left a little dust on his Persian rug  
We gathered up our clothes got the washing done  
In a long forgotten place who'll be the first to run?  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon  
I was floating on a wave  
Then I made the drop  
I was climbing the walls  
Waiting for the band to stop  
You can say the magic words  
I've got my sensors on  
And this is the only place  
That I always run from  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon

Kill eye tumbling come out of the sky  
Kill eye a fiery retreat from the stars  
Kill eye he came clambering over the wall  
Kill eye halfway to hell and beyond  
I want to be forgiven  
I want to laugh with children  
Won't you ever forgive me  
Please please forgive me  
I want to hug my mother  
And the sky above her  
I want the earth to open up  
And hold me  
Kill eye shoot your way out of the bank  
Kill eye watch the security guard  
Kill eye you separate a man from his life  
I want to be forgiven  
I want to laugh with children  
I want to ride the pony  
Be your one and only friend  
I will love you till the end  
Kill eye halfway to hell and beyond  
I want to hug my mother  
And the sky above her  
I want the earth to open up  
I want the earth to open up

It was typical of you  
To give it to me plain  
The sign on your door  
Said make your mind up or go away  
  
It was difficult for me  
To figure you out  
Left hand  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
We're free  
But there is nothing when I present  
It was typical of you  
  
To feather your nest  
Try to explain  
Me and my big mouth were laid to rest  
There's nowhere to go  
  
But I'm not hanging around  
Left hand  
Pick me up and then you put me down  
Left hand  
  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
We're free  
But there is one thing when I present  
  
Left hand  
Left hand  
Left hand  
Always wants to know what the right is doing

Saw my life go flashin' past  
In the eyes of a faithful friend  
Four legs, four lives  
And the screechin' tires never seem to end  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him  
He was nearly wiped away  
But he had good luck and strong bones  
  
You make me clench my teeth  
Us humans ain't got dignity  
Eat my plants and steal my things  
You're the head of security  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him  
He was nearly wiped away  
But he had good luck and strong bones  
Inside and behind him  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him

Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack  
But that was all he missed and he aint coming back  
  
At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car he made a stop  
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top  
  
Next stop Chi-town Lido put the money down, let it roll  
He says one more job oughta get it  
One last shot before we quit  
One for the road  
  
Lido whoa-ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waiting for another go  
Lido whoa-ooo  
He says one more job oughta get it  
One last shot before we quit  
One more for the road  
  
Lido been running, having great big fun, till he got the note  
Saying tow the line or blow it and that was all she wrote  
Hed be making like a V line heading for the borderline, going for broke  
Saying one more hand oughta do it  
This job, aint nothing to it  
One for the road  
Lido whoa- ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waiting for another go  
Lido whoa-ooo  
One more job oughta get it  
One last shot till we quit it  
One more for the road  
  
Lido whoa-ooo  
Heres for the money  
Heres for the show  
Lido be waitin for another go  
Lido whoaa-ooo

I been locked out  
I been locked in  
But I always seem to come back again  
When you're in that room  
What do you do  
I know that I will have you in the end  
And the clouds they are crying on you  
And the birds are offering up their tunes  
In a shack as remote as a mansion  
You escape into a place where nothing moves  
And I been locked out  
And I know we're through  
But I can't begin to face up to the truth  
I wait so long for the walls to crack  
But I know that I will one day have you back  
And the hills are as soft as a pillow  
And they cast a shadow on my bed  
And the view when I look through my window  
Is an altar piece I'm praying to for the living and the dead  
Twin valley shines in the morning sun  
I send a message out to my only one  
I been locked out and I know we're through  
But I can't begin to face up to the truth  
I wait so long for the walls to crack  
But I know that I will one day have you back  
And I work with the bees and the honey  
Every night I circle like the moon  
It's an act of simple devotion  
But it can take forever when you've got something to prove  
I been locked out

Seal my fate  
I get your tongue in the mail  
No-one is wise  
Until they see how it lies  
Love this life  
Don't wait till the next one comes  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round, turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When you'll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
And so they threw you in jail  
Whatever you've done  
It was a million to one  
And don't you just love this life  
When it's holding you down  
Pedal my faith  
The wheels are still turning round, turn round  
And maybe the day will come  
When you'll never have to feel no pain  
After all my complaining  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love this life  
There's something that you can do  
Even if you think that I hate you  
Stop your complaining, leave me defenseless  
When you love this life  
Gotta love this life  
Love this life though you'll never know why  
Gonna love this life  
Gonna love

There's closets in my head where dirty things are kept  
That never see the light of day  
I want to drag them out, go for a walk  
Just to see the look that's on your face  
Sometimes I can't be straight I don't want to hurt you  
So forgive me if I tell a lie  
Sometimes I come on cold but don't believe it  
I will love you till the day I die  
  
I believe in doing things backwards  
Take heed, start doing things in reverse  
  
Here comes trouble, there's nothing wrong when I relax  
I'm talking to myself you're coming with me  
Teaching you how to distort the facts  
Sometimes I can't be straight I don't want to hurt you  
So forgive me if I tell a lie  
Sometimes I come on cold but don't believe it  
I will love you till the day I die  
  
I believe in doing things backwards  
Take heed, start doing things in reverse  
  
Frost on the window pane, the sound of pouring rain  
All makes me glad of you  
Though I am far away I am always with you  
  
Know the answer before you know the question  
Pull yourself together, baby, push with all your might  
I'm all alone, always alone  
Though I am far away  
I am always with you

There's an empty place inside that is hurting me  
A place that keeps my heart out on it's own  
A disconnected function of my wretchedness  
That keeps me so hard pressed  
It's a place where words are spoken you  
Will never hear  
A broken bridge of lines that just won't come  
An empty lung that won't give the wind  
To speak at me  
How far can it be from home  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so mean to me  
  
Do you think that it got up and left  
For good this time  
A crowd of faceless strangers moving on  
A feeling that you left it all behind you now  
That it doesn't hurt somehow  
To know  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so mean to me  
  
So open up the book that you keep deep inside  
Let the pages yellow in the sun  
Show them that you're not afraid to let them see  
How far you can be From home  
  
Why you gotta be so mean to me  
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see  
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need  
So why you gotta be so fucking mean to me  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be  
Why you gotta be so mean to me

I don't wanna say I love you  
That would give away too much  
Hip to be detached and precious  
The only thing you feel is vicious  
  
I don't wanna say I want you  
Even though I want you so much  
It's wrapped up in conversation  
It's whispered in a hush  
  
Though I'm frightened by the word  
I think its time that it was heard  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
Now I wake up happy  
Warm in a lover's embrace  
No one else can touch us  
While we're in this place  
So I sing it to the world  
Simple message to my girl  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
Though I'm frightened by the word  
I think its time I made it heard  
So I sing it to the world  
Simple message to my girl  
  
No more empty self possession  
Visions swept under the mat  
It's no new years resolution  
It's more than that  
  
And there's nothing quite as real  
As the touch of your sweet hand  
I can't spend the rest of my life  
Buried in the sand

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,  
Vanished from my hand,  
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.  
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,  
I have no one to meet  
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,  
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,  
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels  
To be wanderin'.  
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade  
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,  
I promise to go under it.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,  
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run  
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.  
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme  
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,  
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're  
Seein' that he's chasing.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,  
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,  
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,  
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.  
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,  
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,  
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,  
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.  
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,  
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  

My life is a house  
You crawl through the window  
Slip across the floor and into the reception room  
You enter the place of endless persuasion  
Like a knock on the door  
When there's ten or more things to do  
Who is that calling?  
You my companion  
Run to the water on a burning beach  
And it brings me relief  
Pass through the walls  
To find my intentions  
Circle round in a strange hypnotic state  
I look into space  
There is no connection  
A million points of light  
And a conversation I can't face  
Cast me off one day  
To lose my inhibitions  
Sit like a lap dog on a matron's knee  
Wear the nails on your feet  
I woke up the house  
Stumbled in sideways  
The lights went on and everybody screamed surprise  
The savage review  
It left me gasping  
But it warms my heart to see that you can do it too  
Total surrender  
Your touch is so tender  
Your skin is like water on a burning beach  
And it brings me relief

Don't stand around like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
It could've been you  
Why do you weep for the passing of ages  
You slip with the back of your hand  
You're taking it out on the one you love  
I couldn't believe it  
  
[Chorus:]  
But we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
How long must I wait  
For you to release me  
I pay for each mistake  
While you suffer in silence  
  
I could still have an easy life  
But the lie ain't worth the living  
Once more will I hear you say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stand around  
Like friends at a funeral  
Eyes to the ground  
Don't suffer in silence  
  
Cause we might still survive  
And rise up through the maze  
If you could change your life  
And never be the same  
  
And every time I hear you  
Never be the same  
And every time I mess up  
Never be the same

And he goes down, now  
With his feet up  
He goes brown now  
In the southern sun  
  
He walks out there  
Knows where his friends are  
He walks out there  
Those have a heart  
He go  
  
I wanna break something  
Where you go  
I wanna break some heads  
Down before  
  
All the way down they call  
Crack the eggs right open now  
Rest your back  
Until your safe at home  
And it go  
  
I'm a paled [unverified]  
I'm in your sleep  
I can rest  
But I could not sleep  
  
Broken vows  
That made it in heaven now  
Ironclad promises  
That you can't keep  
And you go

Down on the ocean floor  
That's where I'm heading for  
Hold on to a sinking stone  
Until the worst is known  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it  
Nobody protects you  
  
They make it go away  
Pretending that it's all okay  
Broken pieces on the ground  
And everyone's tiptoeing 'round  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it  
No one protects you, yeah  
  
And we're losing some faith  
We used to cry  
We used to say why  
For all I know  
I might not get home  
But I found out  
If we opened it up, we could work this out  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it now  
  
What you suspected all along  
Everything he told you was wrong  
And you can see it if you want  
But nobody wants to

It never used to be that bad  
But neither was it great  
Somewhere in the middle than  
Content and much too safe  
Ooh tell me please  
Why it takes so long  
To realise when there's something wrong  
  
Lay me out with your heart  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Push me back to the start  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Take me out let me breathe  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
When I'm with you I don't care  
Where it is I'm falling  
  
There's money in the Bible belt  
Hugs for daddy too  
Three wishes for eternity  
We've got some work to do  
Ooh tell me please, tell me what went wrong  
Cause I believe there is something wrong  
  
Lay me out with your heart  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Push me back to the start  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Take me out let me breathe  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
When I'm with you I don't care  
Where it is I'm falling  
  
When you took me to your room  
I swear I said surrender  
When you opened up your mouth  
I saw the words fall out  
Though nothing much has changed  
I swear I will surrender  
There is pain in my heart  
We can choose what we choose to believe

Sweet madness it must be wrong  
What kind of fool imagines love  
With all this going on  
Stars burning in the empty sky  
And the city is aflame  
With a million lights  
And they come and they go  
In the blink of an eye  
People are like suns  
Science will enable us to hear  
To be crystal clear  
To make diamonds in the shifting sand  
Better take all the love that you got in a single hand  
And they come and they go  
In the fullness of time  
People are like suns  
They are burning up inside  
People are like suns  
Breathing into life  
All that's good in us  
To saints become  
And they come and they go  
Yeah they come and they go  
People are like suns  
People are like suns  
And we'll go out tonight  
Set the town alight  
All fade into white

Detective is flat, no longer is always flat out  
Got the number of the getaway car  
Didn't get very far  
As lucid as hell and these images  
Moving so fast like a fever  
So close to the bone  
I don't feel too well  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you  
  
Sleeping alone, for pleasure  
The pineapple head, it spins and it spins  
Like a number I hold  
Don't remember, if she was my friend  
It was a long time ago  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you  
  
Sleeping alone, for pleasure  
The pineapple head, it spins and it spins  
Like a number I hold  
Don't remember, if she was my friend  
It was a long time ago  
  
And if you choose to take that path  
Would you come to make me pay  
I will play you like a shark  
And I'll clutch at your heart  
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you, I'll clutch at your heart and
come flying like a spark to inflame you

No time, no place to talk about the weather  
Promise of love is hard to ignore  
Who said the chance wasn't getting any better  
Labor of love is ours to endure  
  
Highest branch on the apple tree  
It was my favorite place to be  
I could hear them breaking free  
But they could not see me  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
It feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
I have all I want, is that simple enough?  
A whole lot more I'm thinking of  
Every night about six o'clock  
Birds come back to the pond to talk  
They talk to me, birds to talk to me  
If I go down on my knees  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
It feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
And it's a pleasure that I have known  
And it's a treasure that I have gained  
And it's a pleasure that I have known  
  
It's a tight squeeze, but I won't let go  
Time is on the table and the dinner's cold  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe  
  
I will run for shelter  
Endless summer lift the curse  
Feels like nothing matters  
In our private universe

Say that again I won't forget  
The prase that turned in my head  
And at the start it makes no sense  
A long time left to understand  
There on the shore the girl that I adore  
She combs her hair on the sand  
  
And I know you got fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
Yeah I know you got be your own man  
You got to break the rules  
  
Say that again, the alphabet  
They dance a pihouette in my head  
A chance remark become the spark  
And maybe luck has come again  
The hint of a smile  
The accidental rhyme  
That captured me the first time  
  
I know you got to fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
I know you got to be your own man  
You've got to break the rules  
Midnite is standing in the shadows  
This haunting is a reckless escape  
Late nights of crawling on the sidewalk  
Lets stay on in the mansion for the weekend  
Lets go on making moments last a lifetime  
We live on in the promises we keep  
  
The hint of a smile  
The accidental rhyme  
That captured me the first time  
  
I know you got to fight the plan  
You got to bend the rules  
I know you got to be your own man  
You got to make your own rules  
  
Lets go on making moments last a lifetime  
We live on in the promises we keep

[Chorus:]  
She called up  
And gave me the news  
It made me so sad, sad, sad  
There was nothing I could do  
  
She's too far away  
And you had to leave  
I can never repay you now  
For what you gave to me  
  
A whisper that can blow a chasm wide  
It took us all  
It took us all  
Pushed apart the mountains and the tide  
It took us all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was so lost  
In delirious sleep  
Wasn't prepared for that position  
Yeah, maybe I was naive  
  
The truth is a mortal blow  
You know all there is to know  
The hurt that you have so close  
Is something better now  
  
And she called...  
  
And she called up  
And gave me the news  
It made me so sad, sad, sad  
There was nothing I could do  
  
She's too far away  
And you had to leave  
I can never repay you now  
For what you gave to me  
For what you gave to me  
  
She called up  
She called up  
She called up  
And gave me the news

Pretty soon you'll be able to remember her  
Lying in the garden singing  
Right where she'll always be  
The door is always open  
  
This is the place that I loved her  
And these are the friends that she had  
Long may the mountain ring  
To the sound of her laughter  
And she goes on and on  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
Till we see her once again  
In a world without end  
  
We owe it all to Frank Sinatra  
The song was playing as she walked into the room  
After the long weekend  
They were a lifetime together  
  
Appearing in the eyes of children  
In the clear blue mountain view  
We're coloring in the sky  
And painting ladders to heaven  
And she goes on and on  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
Till we see her once again  
In a world without end  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
And I always will remember  
In a world without end  
  
She goes on  
She goes on  
  
She goes on

Now you're heading down to get someone  
Should've done what he had to do years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that you're standing on  
All the people that you're standing on  
Now you're heading down to be someone  
Someone that you've seen in a magazine  
Your premonition is coming true  
Oh baby you're not so green  
No baby you're not so green  
No baby you're not so  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head  
Now you're heading down to find something  
Something that you buried in your back yard  
The position is coming through  
From all the dirt that you're digging up  
From all the dirt that you're digging up  
Now you're heading down to be somewhere  
Somewhere you imagined in your wildest dream  
The opposition is coming through  
From all the people that you're standing on  
From all the people that you're standing on  
Now you better you'd better take a firm hand  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head  
Now you're heading down to get someone  
Someone that you should've had years ago  
The position is coming through  
All the people that you're standing on  
All the people that you're standing on  
You're hard to get a hand on  
Sister madly waking up the dead  
You're systematically stepping on my head

Love can make you weep, it can make you run for cover  
Roots that spread so deep, bring life to frozen ground  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
Turning in my sleep, love can leave you cold  
The taste of jealousy, is like a lust for gold  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
(I've been) feeling so much older  
(Frame me) and hang me on the wall  
(I've seen) you fall into the same trap  
(This thing) is happening to us all  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
(Something so strong)  
(Something so strong)  
(Something so strong)  
Something something so strong

What'll I tell him  
When he comes to me for absolution  
Wouldn't you know it  
Hope I don't make a bad decision  
  
'Cause I'd like to believe  
That there is a God  
Why sinful angels suffer for love  
I'd like to believe  
In the terrible truth, in the beautiful lie  
  
Like to know you  
But in this town I can't get arrested  
If you know me  
Why don't you tell me what I'm thinking  
  
Hey don't look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he can't stand Beelzebub  
'Cause he looks so good in black, in black  
  
Hey don't look now  
But there goes God  
In his sexy pants and his sausage dog  
And he can't stand Beelzebub  
'Cause he looks so good in black, in black, in black  
  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
  
There is a God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God  
There goes God

Start in the way that you want to go on  
Tear down the fence that you sit upon  
It was good while it lasted but now it has gone  
So face up to what you have done  
For time immemorial, time immemorial, time  
  
A glorious contest to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your money  
And I will go anywhere you say if you take away all the cameras  
The house that we live in is falling apart  
There's no guarantee cause we got it for free  
And all the pretenders to somebody's throne  
Are finding it out on their own  
For time immemorial, time immemorial, time  
  
Will go on a mission to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your public  
And I will go everywhere you say if you don't charge admission  
Okay we're lucky but then again  
Time immemorial, time immemorial, time  
Will go on a mission to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your money  
And I will go anywhere you say  
Sell me the show the secrets of your house  
  
And I will know everything you say  
Take away all the cameras, the cameras  
And I will go anywhere you say  
If you don't charge admission, admission

Together alone  
Above and beneath  
We were as close  
As anyone can be  
  
Now you are gone  
Far away from me  
As is once  
Will always be  
  
Together alone  
  
Anei ra maua (here we are together)  
E piri tahi nei (in a very close embrace)  
E noha tahi nei (being together)  
Ko maua anake (just us alone)  
Kei runga a Rangi (Rangi the sky-father is above)  
Ko papa kei raro (the earth mother is below)  
E mau tonu nei (our love for one another)  
Kia mau tonu ra (is everlasting)  
  
Together alone  
Shallow and deep  
Holding our breath  
Paying death no heed  
  
I'm still your friend  
When you are in need  
As is once  
Will always be  
  
Earth and sky  
Moon and sea  
  
Anei ra maua (here we are together)  
E piri tahi nei (in a very close embrace)  
E noha tahi nei (being together)  
Ko maua anake (just us alone)  
Kei runga a Rangi (Rangi the sky-father is above)  
Ko papa kei raro (the earth mother is below)  
E mau tonu nei (our love for one another)  
Kia mau tonu ra (is everlasting)

Look at all the plans I made  
Falling down like scraps of paper  
I will leave them where they lie to remind me  
From the past a rumour comes  
Don't let it keep draggin' you down  
Throw the memory in an open fire  
You'll be free  
  
Roll back the tombstone  
Let the saints appear  
Roll back the tombstone  
Make a new man out of me  
  
Beware the passenger  
The train already left the station  
We are neither at home nor at work  
We are moving  
Listen to the howling of steel  
A face betraying no emotion  
Like you never had a chance to be  
Wild and free  
  
Roll back the tombstone  
Let the saints appear  
Roll back the tombstone  
Till the lone ranger rides again  
Rides again in your mind  
  
Rode across the open plain  
All the way and back again

She walked her way down  
It brought my mind back  
From where I was trapped  
How long will it take  
For tension to break?  
  
Feel it sliding off  
Shimmy-like cloth  
I left on the ground  
  
And I know what the answer is  
And I'm happy to be here tonight  
  
But when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
Before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
And the drummer's counting out the start  
She walked her way down  
  
In silver and black  
The tension is snapped  
I picked up the trace  
A scent I can't place  
Remembering desire  
Higher and higher  
Lift off the ground  
  
And I know what the answer is  
But I'm happy to be here tonight  
  
And when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
But before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
The drummer makes the same mistake, and my eyes are on the shape  
That is captured in the light  
All went quiet on the floor when she walked her way down  
  
As we happen to be here tonight  
But don't we make a beautiful sight  
  
And when you're in the moment, everything you want is right  
But before she takes a step she's waiting for the beat to arrive  
If you're tamed by all the pressure, everything you want to become  
The drummer always comes in late, and my eyes are on the shape  
That is captured in the light  
  
And I want to feel the weightless grasp upon my heavy life  
Yeah, uh, uh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh

All the times we slip  
Slither down the dark hole  
Fingers point from old windows  
An eerie shadow falls  
  
Walking on the spot  
Make sure that I'm alive  
Moving every bone in my body  
From side to side  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks?  
Can we look the milkman in the eye?  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes  
  
Walk around your home  
And pour yourself a drink  
Fire one more torpedo, baby  
Wash the kitchen sink  
  
Lounging on the sofa, maybe  
See the living room die  
Dishes are unwashed and broken  
All you do is cry  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks?  
Can we look the milkman in the eye?  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes  
  
Dishes are unwashed and broken  
All you do is cry  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks?  
Can we look the milkman in the eye?  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes

Walking 'round the room singing 'Stormy Weather'  
At fifty seven Mt. Pleasant St.  
Well it's the same room but everything's different  
You can fight the sleep but not the dream  
  
Things ain't cooking in my kitchen  
Strange affliction wash over me  
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire  
Couldn't conquer the blue sky  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Well there's a small boat made of china  
It's going nowhere on the mantelpiece  
Well do I lie like a lounge room lizard?  
Or do I sing like a bird released?  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go, (everywhere you go)  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go, (take the weather)  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go, (everywhere...)  
You always take the weather with you (... you go)  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather, you take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you

When you come across the sea  
Me like a beacon guiding you to safety  
The sooner the better now  
And when you come the hills  
Will breathe like a baby  
Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean  
The sooner the better now  
When you come to cover me with your kisses  
Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den  
I'll know you by the thunderclap  
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions  
And that is why  
I stumble to my knees  
And why underneath the heavens  
With the stars burning and exploding  
I know I could never let you down  
  
When you come like an iceberg float in darkness  
Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea  
I should know you better now  
When you come your majesty  
To entrap me  
Prince of light receding  
The sooner the better now  
And when you come to cover me  
With your kisses hard like armour  
The sooner the better now  
I'll know you by the thunderclap  
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions  
  
And that is why  
I stumble to my knees  
And why underneath the heavens  
With the stars burning and exploding  
I know I could never let you down  
  
She came out of the water  
Into my horizon  
Like a cumulo nimbus  
Coming in from a distance  
Burning and exploding  
Burning and exploding  
Like a slow volcano  
When you come  
Cover the ground with ashes  
When you come

It could spell my mere defeat  
You could find it's what you need  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
My condition is hard to define  
I'm thin and pale and I need to unwind  
See no future from where I stand  
For the present I am in your hands  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
And tears will fall and oceans will rise  
I feel the fear and I know I'm alive  
It is only passing through  
And you can touch me  
I won't hide  
You can touch me  
I won't die  
You can touch me  
I won't die
