All the lazy dykes  
Cross armed at the palms  
Then legs astride their bikes  
Indigo burns on their arms  
One sweet day, An emotional whirl  
You will be good to yourself  
And you'll come and join the girls  
  
All the lazy dykes, They pity how you live Just "somebody's wife"  
You give, and you give  
And you give, and you give  
Give, and you give  
And one sweet day  
An emotional whirl  
You will be good to yourself  
And you'll come and join the girls  
  
Touch me,  
Squeeze me,  
Hold me too tightly,  
And when you look at me you actually see me  
And I've,  
Never felt so alive,  
In the whole of my life,  
In the whole of my life  
  
Free yourself, Be yourself  
Come to the Palms and see yourself  
And at last your life begins  
At last your life begins  
At last your life begins  
At last your life begins

So : the choice I have made  
May seem strange to you  
But who asked you, anyway?  
It's my life to wreck  
My own way  
  
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
  
So the life I have made  
May seem wrong to you  
But, I've never been surer  
It's my life to ruin  
My own way  
  
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
In part, and in whole  
  
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
Part, and in whole  
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ...  
Alma matters  
In mind, body and soul  
Part, and in whole  
  
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...  
Oh yeah...  
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Were you and he lovers?  
And would you say so if you were?  
On a forecourt  
On a Friday  
Passing my way  
Oh...  
  
Were you and he lovers?  
And if you were, then say that you were!  
On a groundsheet  
Under canvas  
With your tent-flap  
Open wide  
  
A note upon his desk  
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"  
Leather elbows on a tweed coat  
-Oh!-  
Is that the best you can do ?  
So came his reply :  
"But on the desk is where I want you!"  
  
So I ask (even though I know):  
Were you and he lovers ?

Bolt-lock your doors  
Alarm your cars  
And still we move in closer  
Every day  
Top of the list  
Is your smiling kids  
But we'll be smiling too  
So that's ok  
Oh, and by the way  
Thank you, because you're  
Giving, giving, giving  
And we're receiving -  
No, no, we're taking  
Keeping the population down  
Your taxes paid, but  
Police waylaid  
And we knows  
When the school bus  
Comes and goes  
We're on your street, but  
You don't see us  
Or, if you do  
You smile and say Hello  
But don't underestimate us  
When you are  
Giving, giving, giving  
And we're receiving -  
No, no, we're taking  
We're just keeping  
The population down  
Giving, giving, giving  
Well, it's your own fault  
For reproducing  
We're just keeping  
The population down

America, your head's too big  
Because America  
Your belly's too big  
And I love you  
I just wish you'd stay where you is  
  
Oh...in America  
The land of the free, they said  
And of opportunity  
In a just and a truthful way  
But where the president  
Is never black, female or gay  
And until that day  
You've got nothing to say to me  
To help me believe  
  
Oh...in America  
It brought you the hamburger  
Oh well America you know where  
You can shove your hamburger  
And don't you wonder  
Why in Estonia they say  
Hey you big fat pig  
You fat pig, You fat pig  
  
Steely blue eyes  
With no love in them  
Scan The World  
And a humorless smile  
With no warmth within  
Greets the world  
And I, I have got nothing  
To offer you  
No-no-no-no-no  
Just this heart, deep and true  
Which you say you don't need  
  
See with your eyes  
Touch with your hands, please  
Hear through your ears  
Know in your soul, please  
For haven't you me with you now?  
And I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
And I love you  
I love you  
I love you

Angel, angel  
Don't take your life tonight  
I know they take  
And that they take in turn  
And they give you nothing real  
For yourself in return  
  
But when they've used you  
And they've broken you  
And they've wasted all your money  
And cast your shell aside  
  
And when they've bought you  
And they've sold you  
And they've billed you for the pleasure  
And they've made your parents cry  
I will be here  
Oh, believe me  
will be here  
...believe me  
  
Angel, don't take your life  
Some people have got no pride  
They do not understand  
The urgency of life  
But I love you more than life  
I love you more than life  
I love you more than life  
I love you more than life

Art-hounds look like nothing  
  
So Art-hounds write something  
And those that do are judged by those  
Who tried and found they couldn't do  
  
Art-hounds see the Greek ideal  
And gaze on what they'll never feel  
Oh, the pitiless revenge of those without friends  
The pitiless, the pitiless revenge  
  
Art-hounds know what's around  
Because they've seen it somewhere written down  
And everything they've seen on the moving screen  
Helps them fill up the page  
  
In European museums  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
Will I see you?  
In European museums  
Will I see you?  
  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
My life is opera  
  
Art-hounds in a restaurant  
They bring along their loving Aunt  
But when they can't find a table for their fat Aunt Mable  
They stamp their feet and cry

And below the belt is shriveled and small  
It functions only as a word

If you cannot stand this fake world

I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
Where the men and the women  
Are acquainted quite well  
  
And the drunkards keep on drinking  
And oh, my room is cold  
I'm disputing the bill  
I will sleep in my clothes  
  
And you, my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
"If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away"  
  
I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of this awful hotel  
Where the slime and the grime  
Gel  
  
And I cannot - or, I do not  
And oh, my room is cold  
And I'm envying you never having to choose  
  
And you, my invalid friend  
You slam the receiver when you say  
"If I had your limbs for a day  
I would steam away"  
  
I'm calling you from the foyer  
Of the Sands Hotel  
It's not low-life, it's just people  
Having a good time  
And oh, my invalid friend  
Oh, my invalid friend  
In our different ways we are  
The same

At last I am born  
Historians note  
I am finally born  
I once used to chase affection withdrawn  
But now I just sit back and yawn  
Because I am born, born, born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseur-oh-blah blah blah  
At last I am born  
Vulgarians know  
I am finally born  
I once thought that time accentuates despair  
But now I don't actually care  
Because I am born, born, born  
Look at me now  
From difficult child to spectral hand to Claude Brasseur-oh-blah blah blah  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
Leaving the one true free life born  
I once thought I had numerous reasons to cry  
And I did, but I don't anymore  
Because I am born, born, born  
At last I am born  
At last I am born  
It took me a long, long time  
But now I am born  
I once was a mess of guilt because of the flesh  
It's remarkable what you can learn  
Once you are born, born, born  
Born, born, born  
Born, born, born

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking  
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth  
In your head  
  
Oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking  
When I said by rights you should be  
Bludgeoned in your bed  
  
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
As the flames rose to her roman nose  
And her Walkman started to melt  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Bigmouth, la, bigmouth, la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And I've got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
  
Oh, bigmouth, la, bigmouth, la  
Bigmouth strikes again  
And I've got no right to take my place  
With the Human race  
  
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt  
As the flames rose to her roman nose  
And her hearing aid started to melt  
  
[Chorus: x4]

The one I love  
Is standing near  
The one I love  
Is everywhere  
I can woo you  
I can amuse you  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud, black cloud  
  
The one I love  
Roosts in the mind  
Can snap this spell  
Or increase hell  
I can chase you  
And I can catch you  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud, black cloud  
Oh, black cloud  
Oh, black cloud  
  
I play the game  
Of favorites now  
I can I must  
I will I do  
I can please you  
Or I can freeze you out  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud, black cloud, black cloud  
I can choke myself to please you  
And I can sink much lower than usual  
But there's nothing I can do  
To make you mine

Losing in front of your home crowd  
You wish the ground  
Would open up and take you down  
And will time never pass?  
Will time never pass for us?  
  
Your weary wife is walking away  
Your nephew is true  
Well, he thinks the world of you  
And I have to close my eyes  
Oh...  
  
Losing in front of your home town  
The crowd call your name  
They love you all the same  
The sound, the smell, and the spray  
You will take them all away  
And they'll stay  
Till the grave  
  
Your weary wife is walking away  
Your nephew, is true  
Well, he thinks the world of you  
And I have to close my eyes  
Oh...  
  
Losing in your home town  
Hell is the bell  
That will not ring again  
You will return one day  
Because of all the things that you see  
When your eyes close  
  
Your weary wife - walking away  
Your nephew, it's true  
He still thinks the world of you  
And I have to dry my eyes  
Oh...

The strange logic in your clumsiest line  
(It stayed, it stayed) it stayed emblazoned on my mind  
You say, break up the family  
And let's begin to live our lives  
  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
It wasn't youth, it wasn't life  
Born old, sadly wise  
Resigned (well, we were)  
To ending our lives  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those awful times  
I want to see all my friends tonight  
  
Yes, you found love, but you weren't  
At peace with your life  
Home late, full of hate  
Despise the ties that bind  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those younger years  
I'm in love for the first time  
And I don't feel bad  
  
Let me see all my old friends  
Let me put my arms around them  
Cause I really do love them  
Now does that sound mad?  
Captain of games, solid framed  
I stood on the touchline  
Hailstones, driven home  
In a car - no brakes? I don't mind  
I'm so glad to grow older  
To move away from those darker years  
Oh, I'm in love for the first time  
And I don't feel bad  
So wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
So wish me luck again  
Goodbye  
Wish me luck my friends  
Goodbye  
Mmm... wish me luck, my friends  
Goodbye  
Ahh...  
Ahh...

I am walking through Rome  
With my heart on a string  
Dear God, please help me  
  
And I am so very tired  
Of doing the right thing  
Dear God, please help me  
  
There are explosive kegs  
Between my legs  
Dear God, please help me  
  
Will you follow and know  
Know me more than you do  
Track me down  
And try to win me?  
  
Then he motions to me  
With his hand on my knee  
Dear God, did this kind of thing happen to you?  
  
Now I'm spreading your legs  
With mine in-between  
Dear God, if I could I would help you  
  
And now I am walking through Rome  
And there is no room to move  
But the heart feels free  
  
The heart feels free  
The heart feels free  
But the heart...feels free  
  
The heart feels free  
The heart feels free

Our unsleepable friend  
Gets the message on an ill wind  
"All your friends and your foes  
Would rather die than have to touch you"  
To say the least: I'm truly disappointed  
  
Truly, truly, truly, oh...  
Drank too much  
And I said too much  
And there's nowhere to go - but down  
  
Young boy - I want to help you  
See these lines? : truly disappointed  
  
Truly, truly, truly, oh...  
Don't talk to me, no  
About people who are "nice"  
'Cause I have spent my whole life  
In ruins  
Because of people who are "nice"  
Oh, this world may lack style, I know  
Each bud must blossom and grow, oh...  
  
Young girl, one day you will be old  
But the thing is, I love you now  
Mmm...  
  
This is the last song I will ever sing (yeah!)  
No: I've changed my mind again (aaw...)  
  
Goodnight  
  
And thank you

Compare the best of their days  
With the worst of your days  
You won't win  
With your standards so high  
And your spirits so low  
At least remember...  
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
  
See the best of how they look  
Against the worst of how you are  
And again, you won't win  
With your standards so high  
And your spirits so low  
At least remember...  
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair  
  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair  
Just do your best and don't...  
Don't worry, oh  
Do your best and don't...

I'm driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And she's saying  
How she never chose you  
"Turn left", she says  
I turn left  
And she says  
"So how did I end up  
So deeply involved in  
The very existence  
I planned on avoiding?"  
And I can't answer  
  
I'm driving  
Your girlfriend home  
And she's laughing  
To stop herself crying  
"Drive on", she says  
I drive on  
And she says  
"So how did I end up  
Attached to this person  
When his sense of humor  
Gets gradually worser ?"  
And I can't tell her  
  
I'm parking  
Outside her home  
And we're shaking hands  
Goodnight, so politely

East West  
Over the ocean  
Perpetual motion  
Traveling around  
  
No rest  
Singing and playing  
Night out and day in  
Doing the rounds  
  
What a great life this must seem!  
  
Swelled joints  
Everything classy  
Nothing is tacky  
Only the best  
  
Lush girls  
Older and dying  
Sighing and crying  
"This is success!"  
  
What a great life this must seem!  
  
But when I hear your voice  
Singing out  
The Bells Of Home  
Are ringing out  
And I feel all alone  
(And I think of my home)  
  
Cold times  
A wind through the houses  
The bleakness arouses  
A longing to leave  
  
Time flew  
I wanted to see you  
Somehow I could not do  
Because of success  
  
What a strange life this can be!  
  
But when I hear your voice  
Singing out  
The bells of home  
Are ringing out  
And I feel all alone  
(And I think of my home)

So then you've found your place  
You say I wanna be the first  
Stand up comedian in outer space  
But then in a fantastic bird  
Fantastic bird  
  
Space is gonna thrill you, space could even kill you  
But space will never love you like I do  
  
Reflecting light down to earth  
Oh yes and then some humor too  
Just enough to make us know we don't miss you  
Have you checked suspension in the fantastic bird?  
Fantastic bird  
  
Science can engulf you, science then propels you  
But science will never love you like I do  
  
What brings you down to earth?  
Ah yes, of course, yes, yes, it was a lack of applause  
Scrap metal for a fantastic bird  
Fantastic bird  
  
Science propels you, science still engulfs you  
But science will never love you like I do  
  
'Cause when you land all you do I hear is my voice  
Hello, welcome I love you, don't you see?  
Don't you see?

Use a weapon of words  
  
Or a fight with your fists  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
Stand your ground and persist  
And be the last one to blink  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will  
  
The black peat of the hills  
When I was still ill  
See this mess and forgive someone  
  
And then recall if you can  
How all this even began  
Forgive someone  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will  
  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me  
  
Shorts and supports and faulty shower heads  
At track and field we dreamt of our beds  
In the bleachers you sit with your legs spread, smiling  
"Here's one thing you'll never have"  
  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me  
Our truth will die with me

Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone who's worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone who's never  
Seeming scheming  
I've  
Found found found  
Found found found  
Someone who's worth it  
In this murkiness  
Someone who's never  
Seeming to be scheming  
  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
Oh, but if I'd never found  
  
I do believe that  
The more you give your love  
And I do believe that  
The more you give your trust  
The more you give your trust  
And the more you give your love  
The more you're bound to lose  
The more you're bound to lose  
  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
(Oh, but if I'd never found)  
Somebody who wants to be  
Who wants to be with me  
All the time

Friday mourning, I'm dressed in black  
Douse the houselights, I'm not coming back  
For years, I warned you  
Through tears, I told you  
Friday mourning, there comes a time  
Before that breaks this very smug mug of mine  
  
This dawn raid soon put paid to  
All the things I'd whispered to you  
At night time  
And I will never stand naked in front of you  
Or if I do, it won't be for a long time  
  
Look once to me, look once to me  
Then look away  
Look once to me, then look away  
  
And when they hold me down  
And when they kick me down the stairs  
I see the faces all lined up before me  
Of teachers and of parents and bosses  
Who all share a point of view  
You are a loser  
You are a loser  
  
Friday, Friday mourning  
Dressed in black  
I won't be coming back

Oh, you silly old man  
You silly old man  
You're making a fool of yourself  
So get off the stage  
  
You silly old man  
In your misguided trousers  
With your mascara and your Fender guitar  
And you think you can arouse us?  
  
But the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
Downstage, and offstage  
Don't you feel all run in?  
And do you wonder when they will take it away?  
This is your final fling  
  
But then applause ran high  
But for the patience of the ones behind you  
As a verse drags on like a month drags on  
It's very short, but it seems very long  
  
And the song that you just sang  
It sounds exactly like the last one  
And the next one  
I bet you it will sound  
Like this one  
  
So, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we get down off of the stage  
Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY !  
  
Get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
And when we've had our money back  
Then I'd like your back in plaster  
  
Oh, I know that you say  
How age has no meaning  
Oh, but here is your audience now  
And they're screaming:  
  
"Get off the stage"  
Oh, get off the stage  
Because I've given you enough of my time  
And the money that wasn't even mine  
Have you seen yourself recently?  
  
Oh, get off the stage  
Oh, get off the stage  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
For whom, oh...  
  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
Get off the stage  
  
For whom the bell tolls

How many times have I been around?  
Recycled papers paving the ground  
Well, she lives for the written word  
And people come second, or possibly third  
  
And there is no style, but I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh, deep in my heart, how I wish I was wrong  
But deep in my heart, I know I am not  
And there's enough gloom in her world, I'm certain  
Without my contribution  
  
So I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Page after page of sniping rage  
An English singe or an American tinge  
"There's a publisher," she said, "...in the new year"  
(It's never in this year)  
  
I do think this, but I can't admit it  
To the girl least likely to  
So one more song with no technique  
One more song which seems all wrong...  
And oh, the news is bad again  
See me as I am again  
  
And the scales of justice sway one way  
In the rooms of those least likely to  
Oh, deep in my heart, how I want to be wrong  
But the moods and the styles too frequently change  
From twenty one to twenty five, from twenty five to twenty nine  
  
And I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh, one more song about The Queen  
Or standing around the shops with thieves  
"But somebody's got to make it!" she screams  
"So why why can't it be me?"  
But she would die if we heard her sing from the heart  
Which is hurt  
  
So how many times will I shed a tear?  
And another stage of verse to cheer  
When you shine in the public eye, my dear  
Please remember these nights  
When I sit and support with a dutiful smile  
Because there's nothing I can say  
So chucking, churning, and turning the knife  
On everything (except their own life)  
And a clock somewhere strikes midnight  
And an explanation - it drains me  
If only there could be a way  
  
There is a different mood all over the world  
A different youth, unfamiliar views  
And dearest, it could all be for you  
So will you come down and I'll meet you?  
And with no more poems, with nothing to hear  
Oh darling, it's all for you...  
Darling, it's all for you...  
Oh darling, it's all for you...  
Oh darling, it's all for you...

Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's serious  
Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's really serious  
  
There were times  
When I could have  
Murdered her  
But you know  
I would hate anything  
To happen to her  
No I don't want  
To see her  
  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Oh  
  
Girlfriend in a coma  
I know, I know  
It's serious  
By, by, by, by  
By, by, baby, goodbye  
There were times  
When I could have  
Strangled her  
But you know  
I would hate anything  
To happen to her  
Would you please  
Let me see her  
  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Do you really think  
She'll pull through?  
Oh  
  
Let me whisper  
My last goodbyes  
I know  
It's serious

First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies  
First day with the jar  
You find  
Everyone lies, nobody minds  
  
Everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect?  
And where is the woman you love?  
Where's the woman you love?  
  
Third week with the jar  
You find  
Everything dies  
We won't vote Conservative  
Because we never have  
  
Everyone lies, everyone lies  
Where is the man you respect?  
And where is the woman you love?  
Where's the woman you love?  
  
Everything of worth  
On Earth  
Is there  
To share  
  
I used to dream, and I used to vow  
I wouldn't dream of it now  
We look to Los Angeles  
For the language we use  
London is dead, London is dead  
London is dead, London is dead  
London is dead, London is dead  
Now I'm too much in love  
I'm too much in love  
  
I know  
I'll go  
Empty hand  
From the land

I'm not running away  
I'm running to  
Corruption of the spirit isn't in it  
For a good looking man about town  
  
Are you afraid of someone alive?  
Are you feeling heartbroken  
Because you'll never be mistaken for a  
Good looking man about town?  
  
You got your degree  
Then you flew to Mars  
But you still feel wretched 'cause  
You'll never be naked with a  
Good looking man about town  
  
Are you afraid of someone alive?  
Are you scared to death  
Of even looking at the flesh of a  
Good looking man about town?  
  
Hear the gang say  
Marry me, marry me  
  
On the midnight street  
No moon and no stars  
No one around to calm you down  
And to soften the stings to my heart  
  
The dream is sand in my hands  
The dream becomes sand in my hands

Here is London, giddy of London  
Is it home of the free  
Or what?  
  
Can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And psychologically save me  
I've got faith in you  
I sense the power  
Within the fingers  
Within an hour the power  
Could totally destroy me  
(Or, it could save my life)  
  
Oh, here is London  
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"  
You are repressed  
But you're remarkably dressed  
Is it real?  
And you're always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy, busy  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
And you're just so busy  
Busy, busy  
Busy scissors  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
(Only the other day)  
  
Was a client, over-cautious  
He made you nervous  
And when he said  
"I'm gonna sue you"  
Oh, I really felt for you  
  
So can you squeeze me  
Into an empty page of your diary  
And supernaturally change me?  
Change me, change  
Oh, here in London  
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"  
You are repressed  
But you're remarkably dressed  
Is it real?  
And you're always busy  
  
Really busy  
Busy clippers  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
All around Sloane Square  
  
And you're just too busy  
To see me  
Busy clippers  
Oh, hairdresser on fire  
(Only the other day)

Ah, tom is young and tom is bold  
Tom is as bold as the knights of old  
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam  
There's nothing he won't do to get a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And he curses himself for the life he's led  
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed  
  
Ah, tom's old ma is a dying lass  
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass  
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag  
But still she's got the strength to have a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And she curses herself for the life she's led  
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed  
  
Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all  
You may take some but you never take it all  
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad  
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed  
  
Ah, the smart young ladies of the land  
Can't relax without a harry in their hand  
And they light one and they boast and brag  
So content because they got a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag  
So content because they got a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, harry rag  
I'll do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed

Have a go  
When the pubs all close  
And have a go when they open  
  
Then have a go by the traffic lights  
Cut up or shut up, you're alright !  
And as always I'm here right behind you  
And as always there's time, so have another go  
Oh...  
  
A small baby girl cradled in your arms  
Your one big contribution  
We'll never know  
We'll never know  
We'll never know

Ah, yes  
Ah, yes  
Oh...  
  
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha  
Ah, ah, ha ha  
  
A small girl runs crying, through the park  
So freely her daddy berates her  
Right now, so for the rest of her life  
She is convinced that her daddy hates her  
Oh...

Oh, oh, ha ha

I need you  
Simple words  
But words which had never been heard  
By the soul  
Stoned to death  
But still living  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
Ride our minds  
If you must  
But there's always a line you don't cross  
Time is short  
Don't be cruel  
Oh you don't know the power  
In what you're saying  
Oh...  
And so he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
People where  
I come from  
They survive without feelings or blood  
I never could  
Was stoned to death  
But I'm still living  
So he froze where he stood  
And he looked to the ground  
And he cried  
He cried  
  
So he froze  
And he looked, and he looked  
To the ground  
And he cried  
He cried

He knows (he knows)  
Or, I think he does  
'Cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world  
  
He knows, he knows  
He knows I'd love  
To see him happy  
(Or as close as is allowed)  
Oh, 'cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world...  
  
He knows, he knows  
He knows I'd love  
To see him happy  
(Or as close as possible)  
As close as possible  
As close as possible  
As close as is allowed  
  
Oh, my name still conjures up deadly deeds  
And a bad taste in the mouth  
And the police - they actually know me  
They said :  
  
"You're just another person in the world  
You're just another fool with radical views  
You're just another who has maddening views  
You want to turn it on its head  
By staying in bed !"  
  
I said : "I know I do"  
  
He doesn't know...

I came back to my old city  
With fierce determination  
And I couldn't find my way out of the station  
  
It's all changed  
You were there  
Departing, starting  
A trek I had once took  
With that "no-one's gonna stop me when I feel this way" look  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
I fell down in my old city  
Such sad degradation  
So I tried to make my way back to the station  
  
You were still there  
Gleaming and leaving  
Wide-eyed and awestruck  
Saying "How can anybody hate me  
If I love them first off ?"  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't  
But you may change minds with your winning smile  
  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
But you may be OK, I don't know  
  
I'll see you back here  
In a few bruised years  
Pray  
I'll see you here  
I'll see you here  
I'll see you here  
  
Apparent, apparent  
Heir apparent  
You say that you want it, I'm sure that you'll get it  
They'll seduce your heart and then they'll slap your arse  
  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir  
Heir, heir, heir

A bond of trust  
Has been abused  
Something of value  
May be lost  
Give up your job  
Squander your cash, be rash  
Just hold on to your friends  
  
There are more than enough  
To fight and oppose  
Why waste good time  
Fighting the people you like  
Who will fall defending your name  
Oh, don't feel so ashamed  
To have friends  
  
But now you only call me  
When you're feeling depressed  
When you feel happy I'm  
So far from your mind  
My patience is stretched  
My loyalty vexed  
Oh, you're losing all of your friends  
  
Hold on to your friends  
Hold on to your friends  
Resist or move on  
Be mad, be rash  
Smoke and explode  
Sell all of your clothes  
Just bear in mind  
Oh, there just might come a time  
When you need some friends

The future is around me  
I'm not gonna cry for the things that never occurred  
So do not remind me  
Happy to be as I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The envy is beyond me  
I'm not gonna pine for the things that can never be mine  
Do not expect me to  
I'm happy to be who I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The future is around me  
I see it, I seize it, I use it, I throw it away  
Because I'm happy to be like I was in the first place  
  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Running away from the mundane  
La la la la la la  
  
Oh honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you know where to find me  
Honey, you'll find how to know me  
Oh, la la la la la la  
  
Oh honey, you know how the land lies  
La la la la la la la la la

She told me she loved me  
Which means  
She must be insane  
I've had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel?  
The only one around here who is me  
Is me  
  
They said they respect me  
Which means  
Their judgment is crazy  
I've had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel?  
When they are they  
And only I am I  
  
He said he wants to befriend me  
Which means  
He can't possibly know me  
The voices of the real  
And the imagined cry:  
"The future is passing you by  
The future is passing you by"  
So how can anybody possibly think they  
Know how I feel?  
Everybody look and see pain and walk away  
And as for you in your uniform (we told you)  
Your smelly uniform (we told you)  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
Because you wear a uniform (we told you)  
A smelly uniform (we told you)  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
But even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I sick and depraved  
A traveler to the grave  
I would never be you  
I would never be you

I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does

Oh...  
Oh...  
  
There's a club, if you'd like to go  
You could meet somebody who really loves you  
So you go, and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home, and you cry  
And you want to die  
  
When you say it's gonna happen now  
Well, when exactly do you mean?  
See, I've already waited too long  
And all my hope is gone  
  
Oh...  
Oh...  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
Ok?

I love you  
It's murder  
  
I am two people  
One you know  
But don't like  
The other one  
You don't know

I am two people

It's pointless

I am two people

The other one  
You don't know

I have two faces  
One of which you know  
The other one  
For your sake  
I never would show  
  
It's just because I love you  
I cannot bear to be around you  
And if only one or the other  
Of us would drop down dead  
  
I am, I am...

I don't mind  
I don't mind if you forget me  
Having learned my lesson  
I never left an impression on anyone  
  
So now you send me your hardened 'regards'  
When once you'd send me 'love'  
Sincerely I must tell you  
Your mild 'best wishes'  
They make me suspicious  
  
I don't mind  
I don't mind if you forget me  
Having learned my lesson  
I never left an impression on anyone  
The pressure to change, to move on  
Was strange  
And very strong  
So this is why I tell you  
I really do understand  
Bye bye  
  
I don't mind if you forget me  
No no no no no no no  
  
You can only be strong for so long  
It may not eat you but it will beat you  
So this is why I tell you  
I really don't understand  
This time  
  
Rejection is one thing  
But rejection from a fool  
Is cruel  
Rejection is one thing  
But rejection from a fool  
Is cruel  
And I don't mind if you forget me  
I don't mind if you forget me

I was a good kid,  
I wouldn't do you no harm,  
I was a nice kid,  
With a nice paper round  
Forgive me any pain,  
I may have brung to you,  
With God's help I know,  
I'll always be near to you  
But Jesus hurt me,  
When he deserted me, but, I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all the desire,  
You placed in me when there's nothing I can do with this desire  
  
I was a good kid,  
Through hail and snow,  
I'd go just to moon you,  
I carried my heart in my hand  
Do you understand, do you understand  
  
But Jesus hurt me,  
When he deserted me, but, I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all of the love,  
You placed in me when there's no one I can turn to with this love  
  
Monday - humiliation,  
Tuesday - suffocation,  
Wednesday - condescension,  
Thursday - is pathetic  
By Friday life has killed me,  
By Friday life has killed me,  
Oh pretty one, oh pretty one  
  
Why did you give me so much desire,  
When there is nowhere I can go to offload this desire?  
And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world,  
When there is no one I can turn to  
To unlock all this love?  
And why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin?,  
Jesus do you hate me?  
Why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin?  
Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you hate me?, Do you
hate me?

Lord these words I beg of you  
As I kneel down at my bed  
Because soon I will be dead  
Let's face it soon I will be dead  
And I just want to  
I want to see the boy happy  
With some hope in his pale eyes  
Is that too much to ask?  
Before I die  
I have one final dream  
For my own life I don't care anything  
  
Lord these words I beg of you  
As I kneel down at my bed  
Let's face it soon I will be dead

Is that too much to ask?  
Before I die  
I have one final dream  
For my own life I don't care anything  
And I just want to  
I want to see this boy happy  
Why is this such a bad thing?

So what do you think I am?  
And how precisely could you tell  
A decent skin is all I am?  
People think badly of me  
But one day maybe they'll praise  
Oh but meanwhile...  
  
I knew I was next  
And I didn't mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due  
And when you've been down for the very last time  
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
The shadows of trees, they reach to me  
They know a decent skin is all I am

And I didn't mind  
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due  
And when you've been down for the very last time

Oh but meanwhile...  
  
I knew I was next

There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you  
  
I knew I was next

A child in a curious phase  
A man with sullen ways  
Oh, I know very well how I got my name  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone  
  
When thirteen years old  
Who dyed his hair gold ?  
Oh, I know very well, I don't need to be told  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone  
  
You were the only one  
Who's come and gone

Something in you caused me to,  
Take a new tact with you,  
You were going through something,  
I had just about scraped through  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With the things you say to me?,  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
No one I ever knew or have spoken to,  
Resembles you,  
This is good or bad, all depending on,  
My general mood  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With all the things you say to me?  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
Magistrates who spend their lives,  
Hiding their mistakes  
They look at you and I, and,  
Envy makes them cry,  
Envy makes them cry  
  
Forces of containment,  
They shove their fat faces into mine,  
You and I just smile,  
Because we're thinking the same lines  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With all the things you say to me?  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
You're not right in the head and nor am I,  
And this why,  
You're not right in the head and nor am I,  
And this why  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you,  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you  
Because you're not right in the head, and nor am I,  
And this is why,  
You're not right in the head, and nor am I  
And this is why,  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you,  
This is why I like you, I like you

When he first cried, his mother died.  
I had tried to be his guide  
When he was born I was too young  
The father searches for the son  
  
In Istanbul.  
Give him back to me  
In Istanbul.  
Give me back my brown eyed son.  
  
Moonlight jumping through the trees  
Sunken eyes avoiding me.  
From dawn to dusk the hunt is on  
The father searches for the son.  
  
In Istanbul  
Give him back to me  
In Istanbul  
Give me back my brown eyed son  
  
On secret streets in disbelief  
Little shadow shows the lead  
Prostitutes stylish and glum  
In amongst them you are one  
Oh what have I done...  
  
Rolling breathless off the tongue the vicious street gang slang  
I lean into a box of pine  
Identify the kid as mine

I can kill standing still  
It's easy  
I can scare with a stare  
It's easy  
  
Hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You walk as if you're falling  
  
I attack from the back  
Because it's easy  
And I can assail  
While wearing very nice jewelry  
  
Oh hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You spend your life crawling  
  
I burst into  
Public baths  
And I throw my weight around  
And no one can even see me  
No one can even see me  
Nobody can see me  
No one can see me  
  
Success is just a mess  
Hey Ringo  
It's sad though  
Because it's hard to walk tall  
When you're small  
Whether dressed in  
Disciplined style  
Never mind  
When you're small  
You're bound to look ???  
  
So compadre  
Please do this for me  
Compadre please read for me  
Compadre  
Compadre  
Please read for me

Oh, you look so tired  
Mouth slack and wide  
Ill-housed and ill-advised  
Your face is as mean  
As your life has been  
  
Crash into my arms  
I want you  
You don't agree  
But you don't refuse  
I know you  
  
And I know a place  
Where no one is likely to pass  
Oh, you don't care if it's late  
And you don't care if you're lost  
And oh, you look so tired  
(But tonight you presume too much)  
Too much, too much  
And if it's the last  
Thing I ever do  
I'm gonna get you  
  
Crash into my arms  
I want you  
You don't agree  
But you don't refuse  
I know you  
  
Crash into my arms  
I want you  
You don't agree  
But you don't refuse  
I know you  
Oh...  
  
Thank you.

Journalists who lie  
Stealing the money  
Prospering with spite  
Hate-in-a-hurry  
Oh, see how :  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
By spreading Biz myth-lies  
About the ones who've made their name  
Stick in the knife  
Stick in the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
The truth is, it happens  
Praise, then crucify  
Just follow this pattern  
And see how:  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
By spreading sickening lies  
About the ones who've made their name  
Mate, give us the knife  
Give us the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
So happy in malice  
Rock star - out of line  
So happy in malice  
Oh...  
  
Journalists who lie  
So sick and belabored  
They only want to be favored  
They only want to be favored  
See how:  
  
They're only trying to make their name  
With unprovable lies  
About the ones  
Who've made their name  
  
In the black hole  
Of your soul  
Still bargaining away the truth  
So easily  
Truth  
  
Journalists who lie

Prospering with spite  
And hate-in-a-hurry

Julie lie down in the weeds and see something new  
Something new  
Julie from now on all the pain of youth  
It will not trouble you  
It will not trouble you  
  
North, east, south, west  
No one has a clue  
Nobody quite knows what to do  
  
Julie lie down in the weeds and see  
How I look at you  
How I look at you  
  
North, east, south, west  
No one has a clue  
Nobody quite knows what to do  
  
There are some people  
Who live in order to tell others what to do  
Tell others what to do  
As long as there remains steel in my veins  
They will not trouble you  
They will not touch you  
Will not trouble you

Your boyfriend, he  
Went down on one knee  
Well, could it be  
He's only got one knee?  
  
I tried to surprise you  
With Vodka  
Or Tizer  
I can't quite quite remember  
But you didn't thank me  
You didn't even thank me  
Because you never do  
  
Your boyfriend, he  
Has the gift of the gab  
Or, could it be  
The gift of the grab?  
I tried to surprise you  
I lay down beside you  
And...nothing much happened  
And you didn't phone me  
You didn't even phone me  
Because it's not your style  
To dial  
  
Your boyfriend, he  
Has displayed to me  
More than just a  
Real hint of cruelty  
I tried to surprise you  
I crept up behind you  
With a homeless chihuahua  
You "coo"-ed for an hour  
You handed him back and said :  
"You'll never guess - I'm bored now"

Last night I dreamt  
That somebody loved me  
No hope, no harm  
Just another false alarm  
  
Last night I felt  
Real arms around me  
No hope, no harm  
Just another false alarm  
  
So, tell me how long  
Before the last one?  
And tell me how long  
Before the right one?  
  
The story is old, I know  
But it goes on  
The story is old, I know  
But it goes on  
  
Oh, goes on  
And on  
Oh, goes on  
And on

Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They cannot  
They cannot  
They cannot do what you want them to do  
Oh...  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old dreams die  
Let the wrong ones go  
They do not  
They do not  
They do not see what you want them to  
Oh...  
  
Let the right one in  
Let the old things fade  
Put the tricks and schemes (for good) away  
  
Ah...I will advise  
Ah...Until my mouth dries  
Ah...I will advise you to...  
  
Ah...let the right one slip in  
Slip in  
Slip in  
  
And when at last it does  
I'd say you were within your rights to bite  
The right one and say, "what kept you so long?"  
"What kept you so long?"  
Oh...

It's the same old S.O.S.  
But with brand new  
Broken fortunes,  
And once again I turn  
To you  
Once again, I do  
I turn to you  
  
It's the same old S.O.S  
But with brand new  
Broken fortunes  
I'm the same  
Underneath  
But this, you  
You surely knew  
  
Life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life, life is a pigsty  
  
and if you don't know this  
Then what do you know?  
Every second of my life  
I only live for you  
And you can shoot me  
And you can throw me off a train  
I still maintain  
I still maintain  
Life, life is a pigsty  
Life is a pigsty  
  
and I've been shifting gears all of my life  
But I'm still the same underneath  
And this you surely knew  
  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you anymore  
  
Can you please stop time?  
Can you stop the pain?  
I feel too cold  
And now I feel too warm again  
Can you stop this pain?  
Can you stop this pain?  
Even now in the final hour  
Of my life  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
  
Even now in the final hour  
Of my life  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
Again  
Again  
  
I'm falling in love again  
Again  
Again  
Again

An afternoon nostalgia  
Television show  
You spoke in silhouette  
(But they couldn't name you)  
Although the panel were  
Very polite to you  
But I remembered you  
Friday nights 1969  
ATV - you murdered every line  
Too old to be a child star  
Too young to take leads  
Four seasons passed  
And they axed you  
Nervous juvenile  
(Won't smile! )  
What became of you?  
Did that swift eclipse torture you?  
A star at eighteen  
And then-suddenly gone  
Down to a few lines  
In the back page of a faded annual  
Oh but I remembered you  
I remembered you.

Smoke  
Lingers 'round your fingers  
Train  
Heave on - to Euston  
Do you think you've made  
The right decision this time  
Oh...  
You left  
Your tired family grieving  
And you think they're sad because you're leaving  
But did you see jealousy in the eyes  
Of the ones who had to stay behind  
And do you think you've made  
The right decision this time  
You left  
Your girlfriend on the platform  
With this really ragged notion that you'll return  
But she knows  
That when he goes  
He really goes  
And do you think you've made  
The right decision this time

When your gift unfurls  
When your talent becomes apparent  
I will roar from the stalls  
I will gurgle from the circle  
The saints smile shyly  
Down on you  
Oh, they couldn't get over  
Your nine-leaf clover  
  
Oh, lucky lisp was not wasted on you  
Lucky lisp wasn't wasted on you  
  
When your name's with the best  
Will my name be on your guest list?  
And I will roar from the stalls  
Ooh, the balcony fool was me, you fool  
Jesus made this all for you, love (you, love)  
He couldn't get over  
Your Grandma's omen  
Oh, lucky lisp was not wasted on you  
Lucky lisp wasn't wasted on you  
  
Da-da-da...

On this glorious occasion...of the splendid defeat  
  
I want to start from  
Before the beginning  
Loot wine, "Be mine, and  
Then let's stay out for the night"  
Ride via Parkside  
Semi-perilous lives  
Jeer the lights in the windows  
Of all safe and stable homes  
(But wondering then, well what  
Could peace of mind be like?)  
Anyway do you want to hear  
Our story, or not?  
As the Fulham Road lights  
Stretch and invite into the night  
From a Stevenage overspill  
We'd kill to live around  
SW6 - with someone like you  
Keep thieves' hours  
With someone like you  
...As long as it slides  
You stalk the house  
In a low-cut blouse :  
"Oh Christ, another stifled  
Friday night!"  
And the Fulham Road lights  
Stretch and invite into the night  
Well, I was fifteen  
What could I know?  
When the gulf between  
All the things I need  
And the things I receive  
Is an ancient ocean  
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed  
Still I maintain there's nothing  
Wrong with you  
You do all that you do  
Because it's all you can do  
Well, I was fifteen  
Where could I go?  
With a soul full of loathing  
For stinging bureaucracy  
Making it anything  
Other than easy  
For working girls like me  
With my hands on my head  
I flop on your bed  
With a head full of dread  
For all I've ever said  
Maladjusted, maladjusted  
Maladjusted maladjusted  
Never to be trusted  
Oh, never to be trusted  
There's nothing wrong with you, oh  
There's nothing wrong with you, oh  
There's nothing wrong with you, oh  
There's nothing wrong with you  
There's nothing wrong with you

The kind people  
Have a wonderful dream  
Margaret on the guillotine  
Cause people like you  
Make me feel so tired  
When will you die?  
When will you die?  
When will you die?  
When will you die?  
When will you die?  
  
And people like you  
Make me feel so old inside  
Please die  
  
And kind people  
Do not shelter this dream  
Make it real  
Make the dream real  
Make the dream real  
Make it real  
Make the dream real  
Make it real

Heifer whines could be human cries  
Closer comes the screaming knife  
This beautiful creature must die  
This beautiful creature must die  
A death for no reason  
And death for no reason is murder  
And the flesh you so fancifully fry  
Is not succulent, tasty or kind  
It's death for no reason  
And death for no reason is murder  
And the calf that you carve with a smile  
Is murder  
And the turkey you festively slice  
Is murder  
Do you know how animals die?  
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely  
It's not "comforting", cheery or kind  
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench  
Of murder  
It's not "natural", "normal" or kind  
The flesh you so fancifully fry  
The meat in your mouth  
As you savour the flavour  
Of murder  
No, no, no, it's murder  
No, no, no, it's murder  
Oh... And who hears when animals cry?

Michael's bones  
Lay where he fell  
Face down on a sports ground  
Oh...  
  
He was just somebody's luckless son  
Oh, but now look what he's done  
Oh, look what he's done  
  
Your gentle hands are frozen  
And your unkissed lips are blue  
Your thinning clothes are hopeless  
And no one was mad about you  
  
Michael's bones  
Were very young  
But they were never to know  
Oh...  
Impetuous fun  
Mr. Policeman  
I don't know where you get such notions from  
  
His gentle hands are frozen  
And his unkissed lips are blue  
But his eyes still cry  
  
And now you've turned the last bend  
And see - are we all judged the same at the end?  
Tell me, tell me  
  
Oh, you lucky thing  
You are too brave  
And I'm ashamed of myself  
As usual  
  
Oh...

Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
I'll be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh, dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going  
I'm going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
I'm not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
We're after  
The same rainbow's end  
How come it's just around the bend ?  
It's always just around the bend ?  
  
Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
I'll be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh, dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going  
I'm going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
I'm not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
We're after  
The same rainbow's end  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
  
Oh!

We love them  
We mourn for them  
Unlucky boys of red  
  
I wish I'd gone down  
Gone down with them  
To where mother nature makes their bed  
  
We miss them  
Every night we kiss them  
Their faces fixed in our heads  
  
I wish I'd gone down  
Gone down with them  
To where mother nature makes their bed  
  
They can't hurt you  
Their style will never desert you  
Because they're all safely dead  
  
I wish I'd gone down  
Gone down with them

Your poor witness  
Crying so loudly on the floor  
Oh, well, she's only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her standing on the table  
With her small arms flailing  
And you feel such compassion  
In your soul for  
Your mute witness  
Still testing the strength  
Of our patience  
  
Oh, well she's only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her pointing to the Frisbee  
With a memory so fuzzy  
And her silent words  
Describing the fright of last night  
Four A.M. Northside, Clapham Common  
Oh, god, what was she doing there?  
Will she sketch the answer later?  
Well, I will ask her  
  
"Now dry your tears, my dear"  
Now see her mime in time so nicely  
It would all have been so clear  
If only she had never volunteered  
"Your taxi is here, my dear"  
  
La, la, la-la...

In the high life, I've got this feeling now  
I've got this horrible feeling  
On the escalator, they took it out on him  
As the ridiculous world went by  
  
Oh, he's gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
On the high wire, dressed in a leotard  
There wobbles one hell of a retard  
On the escalator, you shit paracetamol  
As the ridiculous world goes by  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh ...  
  
  
Oh, he is gone  
He's my insatiable one  
Oh, he is gone  
And he was my inflatable one  
Oh ...

Aah...  
Come on to my house  
Come on and do something new  
I know you love one person so  
Why can't you love two?  
  
Aah...  
Give a little something  
Give a little something  
To my love life  
To my love life  
My love life  
Oh...  
  
Aah...  
I know you love one person so  
Why don't you love two, love?  
Oh, love to...  
  
Give a little something

To my love life  
To my love life  
My love life  
Oh...

Why don't you love two, love?  
Love to...

Come on to my house  
Aah...

Say farewell to your fair weathered friends  
And not a second too soon  
To leave a life among ruins  
Well there was nothing left but to  
Cut ourselves loose  
These fascists and philistines  
Of violence and fashion  
These modern day philistines  
They stand on your hands  
They stand on my hands  
Any day now we'll perish  
These are nervous times  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to virtue and truth  
No one can hold a candle to you  
And I dim next to you  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to old-fashioned virtue  
Kingdom mine  
Open your eyes  
Make up your mind  
Am I Einstein?  
Or am I Frankenstein  
You said blow them away  
To kingdom come  
Or will the kingdom be one?  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to virtue and truth  
No one, no one can hold a candle to you  
And I dim next to you  
Hi-ro-shima  
Yes yes yes!

Nine times fined  
Never mind  
Things can only improve  
We are just stood here  
Waiting for the next great wound  
  
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes  
And to fluff our breaks, and to stuff our faces with cake  
  
All in all, imagine this :  
Nobody loves us  
Dab-hands at trouble  
With four days of stubble, we are  
Never loosen the grip on our hand  
Call us home  
Kiss our cheeks  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
People think all we do  
Is lie around and think of how  
Rich we'd be if we didn't think  
Life could improve  
  
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes  
And we just can't wait till the whole thing blows up in our face  
  
Call us home  
Kiss our cheeks  
Nobody loves us  
Dab-hands at Trouble  
With four days of stubble, we are  
So, never loosen the grip on our hand  
Call us home  
Make our tea  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
Call us home  
Tuck us in  
Nobody wants us  
Dreamers and schemers  
All pie-eyed, and bog-eyed, and cross-eyed  
Oh, never loosen the grip on our hand  
Whack us, then  
Hug us hard  
Nobody loves us  
So we...oh...we tend to please ourselves  
  
And we just can't stress, oh, how more the mess  
And complete distress won't make much difference to us  
  
Sing us our  
Favorite song  
Nobody loves us  
Born-again atheists  
Practicing troublemakers  
Make us our  
Favorite jam  
Nobody loves us  
Useless and shiftless  
And jobless  
But we're all yours

Hey kid, take my hand  
If only for awhile  
And tell me all over again  
You say noise, it's the best revenge  
Noise, noise, noise  
All you can say is noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming  
Noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming too  
Hey kid, let me cry  
And don't think any less of me  
I've been hawking this song for too long  
You say noise, it's the best revenge  
There's a right way, there's a wrong way  
And there's even a Victorian legal system  
But noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming  
Noise, it's the best revenge  
I know you're dreaming too, too  
Hey kid, let me die  
A short walk into the dark sky  
A final adventure if only I wasn't so tired  
You say I know why you're dreaming  
I know why you're dreaming  
You say I know why you're dreaming  
I know why you're dreaming  
'Cause it's the only escape  
I know why you're dreaming  
'Cause it's the only escape to, to  

There's gonna be some trouble  
A whole house will need re-building  
And everyone I love in the house  
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite soon  
Your father cracks a joke  
And in the usual way  
Empties the room  
  
Tell all of my friends  
I don't have too many  
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers  
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt  
Rush to danger  
Wind up nowhere  
Patric Doonan, raised to wait  
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So I won't even try to  
  
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt  
Every jammy Stressford poet  
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists  
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists  
Underact, express depression  
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you  
I was tired again  
I've tried again, and  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So I won't even try to  
  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Could you pass by?  
Oh  
  
Now my heart is full  
Now my heart is full  
And I just can't explain  
So so  
So so so so so

May this lovely letter  
Reach its destination  
If only  
Question one is why do you  
Pretend that you like me?  
Oh Phoney  
See how the outside  
Contradicts what's inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor?  
You do, oh Phoney you do  
  
You sing a lovely song to a scale  
And the words spell out my name  
Oh Phoney  
But then you kick me down below  
Cause you know it won't show  
How could you?  
  
See how the outside  
Contradicts what's inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor?  
  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do

Ooh, a working-class face glares back  
At me from the glass and lurches  
Oh forgive me, on the street's I ran  
Turned sickness into, popular song  
Streets of wet black holes  
On roads you can never know  
You never have them  
But, they alway's have you  
'Till the day that you croak  
(it's no joke)  
Ooh, a working-class face glares back  
At me from the glass and lurches  
Oh forgive me, on the street's I ran  
Turned sickness into unpopular song  
And all these street's can do  
Is claim to know the real you  
And warn if you don't leave  
You will kill or be killed  
Which isn't very nice  
Here everybody's friendly  
But nobody's friends  
Oh, dear God when will I  
Be where I should be?  
And when the Palmist said:  
"One Thursday you will be dead"  
I said "No, not me, this cannot be,  
Dear God, take him, take them, take anyone  
The stillborn,  
The newborn  
The infirmed,  
Take anyone  
Take people from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  
Just spare me!"

Always be careful  
When you abuse the one you love  
The hour or the day, no one can tell  
But one day goodbye will be farewell  
And you will never see the one you love again  
You will never see the one you love again  
  
I have been thinking, what, with my final brain cell  
How time grips you, slimming, in it's spell  
And before you know, goodbye will be farewell  
And you will never see the one you love again  
And the smiling children tell you that you smell  
  
Well, just look at me  
A savage Beast with nothing to sell  
And when I die, I want to go to Hell  
And that's when goodbye should be farewell  
One day goodbye will be farewell  
So grab me while you still can, goodbye

Standing at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He died saving my life  
He took the lead  
Aimed for my head  
Such love shown I'd never known  
  
Give me the gun  
I love you  
A job half done  
Isn't done  
  
Standing at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He took the plug  
And he hit the rug  
Such love shown I've never known  
Now I don't want to know tomorrow  
  
So, give me the gun  
I love you  
A job half done  
Isn't done  
  
Kneeling at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He took a round  
And he hit the ground  
He took the blast  
His very last  
I have no use for tomorrow  
  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for...  
No use for...  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No...

Ouija board  
Would you work for me?  
I have got to say hello  
To an old friend  
  
Ouija board, Ouija board, Ouija board  
Would you work for me?  
I have got to get through  
To a good friend  
Well, she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Ouija board, Ouija board, Ouija board  
Would you help me?  
Because I still do feel  
So horribly lonely  
  
Would you, Ouija board  
Would you, Ouija board  
Would you help me?  
And I just can't find  
My place in this world  
  
She has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Oh hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Oh hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")  
The table is rumbling...  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
"No, I was not pushing that time"  
It spells : S.T.E.V.E.N  
  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
"No, I was not pushing that time" :  
P.U.S.H.O. double F.  
  
Well, she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it

Papa Jack  
Wants to turn  
Back the clock  
And reach out  
To the kids  
He once had  
Who have flown  
  
Papa Jack  
In decline  
Feels inclined  
To reach out  
To the kids  
He once had  
Who have flown  
  
But there was a time  
When the kids reached up  
And Papa Jack just  
Pushed them away  
  
Looking deep  
In his heart  
Papa Jack  
Doesn't like  
What he sees  
Or the time  
On his hands  
  
The dying day  
The chilly sun  
Papa Jack  
All alone  
Sings slow  
Grieving and low  
  
But there was a time  
When the kids reached up  
Now you can't always  
Have it your way  
  
Papa Jack  
Ah...

Pashernate love  
In any form  
Whether real or a dream  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your system erupt  
Into wild blisters and boils  
  
Oh, as for me  
It still doesn't understand me  
It wouldn't lay one single finger on me  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your Grandmother zoom  
Roller-skating back from the grave  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your old Daddy feel  
Like he may have a reason to live  
  
Oh, as for me  
It still doesn't understand me  
And it wouldn't lay one single finger on me  
  
I'm always there  
It's always elsewhere  
  
Whoah, Pashernate love  
Oh, where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?

Good times for a change  
See, the luck I've had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
So please, please, please  
Let me, let me, let me  
Let me get what I want  
This time  
  
Haven't had a dream  
In a long time  
See, the life I've had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
So for once in my life  
Let me get what I want  
Lord knows  
It would be the first time  
Lord knows  
It would be the first time

Phlegm lapels for the last time  
Corn beef legs for the last time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you've finally decided  
  
But then you see someone new  
And you want someone new  
So you have someone new  
I don't blame you  
We would all do the same as you  
If ever we had the nerve to  
  
Chips with cream for the last time  
The people's friend for the last time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you've finally decided  
  
Tiny striped socks for the last time  
Pokes and prods for the last time  
And the doctor said  
"don't nod your head until june !"  
  
But then you see someone new  
And you want someone new  
So you have someone new  
I don't blame you  
We would all do the same as you  
If ever we had the chance to  
  
Sick at noon for the last time  
And who is going to clean up ?  
Would you be so kind ?  
Oh, everybody's staring  
At the strange clothes that you're wearing  
  
Bad advice for the last time  
And people being nice for the very first time  
Oh, we're so glad  
That you have finally decided !

You don't know a thing about their lives  
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive  
You shake as you think of how they sleep  
But you write as if you all lie side by side  
Reader, meet Author  
With the hope of hearing sense  
But you may be feeling let down  
By the words of defense  
He says "No-one ever sees me when I cry"  
  
You don't know a thing about their lives  
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives  
And if a fight broke out here tonight  
You'd be the first away, because you're that type  
And the year two thousand won't change anyone here  
As each fabled promise flies so fast  
You'll swear it was never there  
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life?  
  
So safely with your software, miles from the front line  
You hear the way their sad voice sings, and you start to imagine things  
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

Let it be known  
Dreaming hotel  
We just had a quarrel  
I sent you away  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone  
Called you on the phone  
But there was no answer  
Will you never return?  
Will you never want me?  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
Women all standing  
With shock on their faces  
Sad description  
Oh, I was looking for you  
  
Everyone was singing  
Girl is washed up  
On Redondo Beach  
And everyone is so sad  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Hey little girl  
Everyone cried  
How she was the victim of suicide  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
Women all standing  
With shock on their faces  
Sad description  
Oh, I was looking for you  
  
Desk clerk told me  
A girl is washed up  
Was small, an angel  
With apple blond hair now  
I was looking for you  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Picked up my key  
And I didn't reply  
I just went into my room  
And I started to cry  
It was morning, angel  
Are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean  
It was so dismal  
I was just standing  
With shock on my face though  
The hearse pulled away  
And the girl that had died it was you  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
You'll never return  
Into my arms  
'Cause you're gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Oh goodbye

(Go on!)  
He's romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
He'll be here  
Smiling on time  
He's romancing you  
And chancing his arm  
He'll be here  
Smiling on time  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladder's a planet  
Roy is a star, and  
I am a satellite  
(But that's alright)  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require (even longer)  
He can hold a smile for as long  
As you require (even longer)  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Back up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Dunking the chamois  
Just think of the goodwill  
The ladder's a planet  
Roy is a star, and  
I am a satellite  
I will be set alight  
Don't say you'll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Don't say you'll hold it steady  
Then you let it go  
Oh...  
  
You're up the ladder  
Into each corner  
Foot in a bucket  
We trust you to wreck it  
Even when it's under your nose  
Well, you just can't  
See it, can you?  
Well, it's here  
Right under your nose  
And you just can't  
See it, can you?  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
La la la la...  
Roy's keen, Roy's keen  
We've never seen a  
Keener window-cleaner  
Oh...  
La la la la...

Learn to love me, assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a listed crime  
My only weakness is well, never mind, never mind, oh  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, hand it over  
Hand it over, hand it over  
  
Learn to love me, assemble the ways  
Now, today, tomorrow and always  
My only weakness is a list of crimes  
But last night the plans of a future war  
Was all I saw run Channel Four  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, hand it over  
Hand it over, hand it over  
  
A heartless hand on my shoulder, a push and it's over  
Alabaster crashes down, six months is a long time  
I tried living in the real world instead of a shell  
But before I began, I was bored before I even began  
  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over  
Shoplifters of the world, take over

Sing your life  
Any fool can think of words that rhyme  
Many others do  
Why don't you?  
Do you want to?  
Oh...  
Sing your life  
Walk right up to the microphone  
And name  
All the things you love  
All the things that you loathe  
  
Oh, sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe  
Oh, sing your life  
Oh, sing your life  
  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
  
Others sang your life  
But now is a chance to shine  
And have the pleasure of  
Saying what you mean  
Have the pleasure of  
Meaning what you sing  
Oh, make no mistake my friend  
All of this will end  
So sing it now (sing your life)  
All the things you love (sing your life)  
All the things you loathe  
Oh, sing your life  
The things that you love  
And the things you loathe (sing your life)  
Oh, sing oh...  
Oh, sing oh...  
  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
La, la-la, la-la, sing your life  
  
Don't leave it all unsaid  
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head, oh  
Head, oh, head, oh, head, oh  
And make no mistake, my friend  
Your pointless life will end  
But before you go  
Can you look at the truth ?  
You have a lovely singing voice  
A lovely singing voice  
And all of those  
Who sing on-key  
They stole the notion  
From you and me  
So, sing your life (sing your life)  
Sing your life (sing your life)  
Oh, sing your oh...  
Oh, sing your  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Sing your life  
Oh, sing your oh...  
(Sing your life)  
(Sing your life)  
Sing your life  
(Sing your life)

All over this town  
Yes, a low wind may blow  
And I can see through everybody's clothes  
With no reason  
To hide these words, I feel  
And no reason  
To talk about the books I read  
But still, I do  
  
That's 'cause I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town  
  
Along this way  
Outside the prison gates  
I love the romance of crime  
And I wonder :  
Does anybody feel the same way I do?  
And is evil just something you are  
Or something you do?  
  
Sister I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town  
  
All over this town  
They pull over  
In their Citroen vans  
Not to shake your hands  
With Meths on their breaths  
And you with youth on your side  
All alone...lone...alone, waiting at the lights  
But not this time  
  
Sister I'm a...  
Sister I'm a...  
All over this town...  
All...oh  
Oh  
All over this town

Delight  
See our faces are both shining  
And I've never felt so wanted  
Than when you cling with arms and legs  
  
I tremble  
You crush my burning lips like ashes  
With so much skin to travel over  
While my head spins (and you knew it would)  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
I feel  
Feel your breath burn on my body  
You touch my senses, tingling brightly  
Slip-and-sliding into heaven  
  
Love could be a wonderful emotion  
With such a rush of pleasure motion  
When I'm dancing on our skin  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
And oh, what a storm!  
And oh, what a storm!  
  
We shelter in our skin storm

Six filthy children  
From six absent fathers  
  
And then you turn  
To us for succour  
Because you think  
We're just suckers  
  
We may be welfare, oh yeah,  
But we don't care  
And we get paid to despise  
Your council house eyes  
  
You can change your name  
You can bleach your skin  
Camouflage your accent  
So that even you don't recognise it  
  
But you won't escape  
From the slum mums  
Because you are one  
Because you live and breathe like one  
  
And the Labour government  
Can't stand the slum mums  
It's ingrained  
Underneath your fingernails  
  
The office of the  
Social Service  
Is strategically placed  
In a dowdy, rowdy part of town  
To discourage you  
From signing  
  
We make you feel  
As if you're whining  
When you claim  
What's legally yours  
  
You can change your name  
And you can bleach your skin  
Camouflage your accent  
So that even you don't recognise it  
  
But you won't escape  
From the slum mums  
Because you are one  
Because you live and breathe like one  
  
And the Labour government  
Can't stand the slum mums  
It's ingrained  
Underneath your fingernails  
  
Take you and your rat pack brood  
To the long grass of the meadow  
Administer seven doses lethal and illegal  
Which may render you elsewhere

See in me the side of you  
  
That sometimes makes you jump with fright  
Smiler with knife it's your big night  
  
Sinking bed, all warm and clean  
Only sadness waits for me  
Smiler with knife you're just in time  
You're just in time  
  
Press the blade against my skin  
Never to make love again  
Smiler with knife it's alright  
  
Surrender will I am before you  
I am sick to death of life  
Smiler with knife, alight  
Alight  
  
If such things weren't meant to be  
Then they would never come to me  
Smiler, oh, don't worry so  
  
Slamming one shots, gentle pain  
Someone calling out my name  
Sex and love are not the same  
Are not the same  
  
Time has frittered long and slow  
All I am and was will go  
But where to and why now?  
  
When my last breath falls away  
Smiler, trust me when I say:  
"You'll be OK" "You'll be OK"

I'm doing very well  
I can block out the present and the past now  
I know by now you think I should have  
Straightened myself out - Thank you, drop dead!  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no love in modern life  
  
I'm doing very well  
It's a miracle I even made it this far  
The motion of taxis excites me  
When you peel it back and bite me  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can barely describe  
There is no hope in modern life  
  
Something is squeezing my skull  
Something I can't fight  
No true friends in modern life  
  
Diazepam that's valium, Temazepam, Lithium, HRT, ECT  
How long must I stay on this stuff?  
Don't give me anymore  
Don't give me anymore  
Don't give me anymore  
Please don't give me anymore  
Don't give anymore  
Don't give anymore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Don't give anymore, don't give anymore...  
  
You swore, you swore, you swore  
You swore you would not give anymore  
Give anymore, give anymore, give anymore...

Legalized theft  
Leaves me bereft  
I get it straight in the neck  
(Somehow expecting no less)  
A court of justice  
With no use for truth  
Lawyer...liar  
Lawyer...liar  
You pleaded and squealed  
And you think you've won  
But sorrow will come  
To you in the end  
And as sure as my words are pure  
I praise the day that brings you pain  
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze  
Frantic for fame  
They're all on the game  
They just use a different name  
You lied  
And you were believed  
By a J.P. senile and vile  
You pleaded and squealed  
And you think you've won  
But sorrow will come  
To you in the end  
And as sure as my words are pure  
I praise the day that brings you pain  
So don't close your eyes  
Don't close your eyes  
A man who slits throats  
Has time on his hands  
And I'm gonna get you  
So don't close your eyes  
Don't ever close your eyes  
You think you've won  
Oh no

You were a boy before you became a man  
I don't see the joy  
And you ran with your pals in the sun  
You turned around and they were gone  
Again...  
  
A sick boy should be treated  
So easily defeated  
Oh, I just don't understand  
So you ran with your pals in the sun  
You turned around  
You were alone  
Again...  
And you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
Oh, you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
Oh, you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
  
And now, there is something that you should know  
There is something that you should know  
The girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
Girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
There is something that you should know  
There is something that you should know  
Girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and is all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and is feeling all alone  
Oh, there is something that you should know  
  
Help me, help me, help me...

And when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart?  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
So when you slam  
Down the hammer  
Can you see it in your heart?  
Can you delve so low?  
And when you're standing  
On my fingers  
Can you see it in your heart? Ah  
And when you try  
To break my spirit  
It won't work  
Because there's nothing left to break  
Anymore  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
  
You won't sleep  
Until the earth that wants me  
Finally has me  
Oh you've done it now  
You won't rest  
Until the hearse that becomes me  
Finally takes me  
Oh you've done it now  
And you won't smile  
Until my loving mouth  
Is shut good and proper  
Forever  
  
All of the rumors  
Keeping me grounded  
I never said, I never said that they were  
Completely unfounded  
And all those lies  
Written lies, twisted lies  
Well, they weren't lies  
They weren't lies  
They weren't lies  
  
I never said  
I never said  
I could have mentioned your name  
I could have dragged you in  
Guilt by implication  
By association  
I've always been true to you  
In my own strange way  
I've always been true to you  
In my own sick way  
I'll always stay true to you

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye  
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to"  
He takes on whoever flew through  
"Well, it's the normal thing to do"  
Aah  
  
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love  
Now kissing with his mouth full  
And his eyes on some other fool  
So many women  
His head should be spinning  
Ah, but no!  
Ah, but no!  
But no!  
Ah, no!  
  
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words :  
"There's no need to be so knowing  
Take life at five times the  
Average speed, like I do"  
Until Jim feels the chill  
"Oh, where did all the time go?"  
  
Once always in for the kill  
Now it's too cold  
And he feels too  
Old  
Too old  
Mmm, old  
  
La, la, la, la-la, la...

Staircase at the university

We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
Oh, and you've only just gone  
  
Oh, well, you punched and fell  
Then you felt embarrassed  
My heart goes out to you  
So I offered love  
And it was not required  
Oh, what else can I do?  
What else can I do?  
  
We're really missing you  
We're really missing you  
And you've only just gone  
  
So, Sunny, send at least one thoughtful letter  
My heart goes out to you  
Tell us all how things are so much better  
My heart, it left with you  
What else can I do?  
  
Oh, they're not forgiving you  
And you're not even wrong  
  
Oh, with your jean belt wrapped around your arm  
Oh, Sunny, my heart goes out to you  
And with a needle pressed onto tight skin  
Sunny, I cry when I see where it's taken you  
  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I won't move  
Aah...  
I'm here, I will not move  
Aah...

Sweetie pie  
I've fallen in love.  
And the joke is on me.  
And the sun's given up.  
I'm depending on you,  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time.  
  
Sweetie pie  
I'm ending my life.  
Because I've fallen in love.  
And nothing is enough.  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time  
  
Sweetie pie.  
How I feel in my mind,  
And how I live in he world,  
They are oceans apart.  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time.

You chase in the rat-race  
And you always feel so hollow  
You marry because it's expected of you  
And it only makes you feel more lonely  
But still you look down on the  
Teenage dad on his estate  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his baby and his modest home  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his Jensen Interceptor  
It's just a runaround  
  
You defer to the views of the television news  
Let someone do your thinking for you  
And you still buy a daily newspaper  
And you find everything there but the news  
And still you look down on the  
Teenage dad on his estate  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his baby and his modest home  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his Jensen Interceptor  
It's just a runaround  
  
You become your parents' parent  
And you love them  
But you can't help feeling used  
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate  
Because he's poor but he's happier than you  
They're all laughing at you  
You're a dipper, a slider, cart-horse provider  
Nobody cares about you  
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in  
Despising the grin on the face of the boy  
With the methadone ahh  
With his methadone  
He's happy - so leave him alone  
With his methadone  
He's happy - so leave him alone

Police car with a screaming siren  
Pneumatic drill on ripped-up concrete  
Baby wails, a stray dog howling  
Brakes screech as lamp light blinking  
  
That's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
  
Smash of glass and a rumble of boots  
Electric train and a ripped up phone booth  
A hot day and a sticky black tarmac  
A hot day and I'm wishing I was far away  
  
That's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
  
Days of speed and a slow time Mondays  
Wake up at six am and think about your holidays  
Open window and breathe in petrol  
Cold flat with damp on the walls  
  
Yes, that's entertainment  
That's entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
La, la, la  
  
Two lovers kissing over screams of midnight  
Two lovers miss the tranquility of solitude  
Read graffiti of slash-seat affairs  
Splattered walls and a kick in the balls  
  
Is all that you get - in the name of entertainment  
La, la, la  
La, la, la...

I was wasting my time  
Trying to fall in love  
Disappointment came to me and  
Booted me and bruised and hurt me  
  
That's how people grow up  
That's how people grow up  
  
I was wasting my time  
Looking for love  
Someone must look at me  
And see their sunlit dream  
  
I was wasting my time  
Praying for love  
For a love that never comes from  
Someone who does not exist and  
  
That's how people grow up  
That's how people grow up  
  
Let me live before I die  
Not me, not I!  
  
I was wasting my life  
Always thinking about myself  
Someone on the deathbed said  
"There are other sorrows too"  
  
I was driving my car  
I crashed and broke my spine  
So yes, there are things worse in life than  
Never being someone's sweetie  
  
That's how people grow up  
That's how people grow up  
  
As for me I'm o.k.  
For now anyway

The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A murderous desire for love  
  
How can they look into my eyes  
And still they don't believe me  
How can they hear me say those words  
And still they don't believe me  
  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever believe me?  
And if they don't believe me now  
Will they ever will they ever believe me?  
  
The boy with the thorn in his side  
Behind the hatred there lies  
A plundering desire for love  
  
How can they see the love in our eyes  
And still they don't believe us  
And after all this time  
They don't want to believe us  
  
And if they don't believe us now  
Will they ever believe us?  
And when you want to Live  
How do you start?  
Where do you go?  
Who do you need to know?

The edges are no, no longer parallel  
The edges are no, no longer parallel  
And there is no law of averages here  
If you feel down  
Then you're bound to stay down  
All of the things you said  
So meaningful  
They are all so suddenly meaningless  
And the looks you gave  
So meaningful  
They are all so suddenly meaningless  
Oh...  
And there is no law of averages here  
If you feel down  
Then you're bound to stay down

With no complications  
Fifteen generations  
(of mine)  
All honouring nature  
Until I arrive  
(with incredible style)  
  
I'm the end of the line  
The end of the family line  
The end of the line  
  
  
No baby pulled screaming  
Out into this seething whirl  
By chance or whim  
(or even love ? )  
  
  
Our family tree hacked into decline  
And I'm spared the pain  
Of ever saying  
("goodbye")  
  
  
I'm the end of the line  
The end of the family line  
The end of the line  
  
  
The decision is mine  
The end of the family line  
The end of the line

He can't dance or sing  
He can't do anything  
But, what the hell?  
The kid's a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And there you are  
Another nonsense non-star  
La la la da da da la la la...  
  
There's no pretense  
This kid is dense  
But, what the hell?  
The kid's a looker  
Just add cash and stir  
And the crass consumers line up  
Shoulder to shoulder  
La la la da da da la la la...  
  
Sometime through the night  
The kid she'd his life  
So very sad  
However do not call this number again  
We're busy molding the face  
Of the kid's replacement, yeah  
La la la da da da la la la...

A world war  
Was announced  
Days ago  
But they didn't know  
The lazy sunbathers  
The lazy sunbathers  
  
The sun burns through  
To the planet's core  
And it isn't enough  
They want more  
  
Nothing  
Appears  
To be  
Between the ears of  
The lazy sunbathers  
Too jaded  
To question stagnation  
The sun burns through  
To the planet's core  
And it isn't enough  
They want more  
  
Religions fall  
Children shelled  
Children shelled? That's all  
Very well, but would you  
Please keep the noise  
Down low?  
Because you're waking  
The lazy sunbathers  
Oh, the lazy sunbathers  
The lazy sunbathers

The more you ignore me  
The closer I get  
You're wasting your time  
The more you ignore me  
The closer I get  
You're wasting your time  
  
I will be  
In the bar  
With my head  
On the bar  
I am now  
A central part  
Of your mind's landscape  
Whether you care  
Or do not  
Yeah, I've made up your mind  
  
The more you ignore me  
The closer I get  
You're wasting your time  
The more you ignore me  
The closer I get  
You're wasting your time  
  
Beware!  
I bear more grudges  
Than lonely high court judges  
When you sleep  
I will creep  
Into your thoughts  
Like a bad debt  
That you can't pay  
Take the easy way  
And give in  
Yeah, and let me in  
Oh, let me in  
Oh let me  
Oh, let me in  
It's war  
It's war  
It's war  
It's war  
It's war  
War

Oh, let me in

Ah, you're asking for it  
Ah, the closer I get  
Ooh, the closer I

Reflecting from my deathbed,  
I'm balancing life's riches...against the ditches  
And the flat gray years in between  
All I can see are the never laid,  
That's the never played symphonies  
  
I can't see those who tried to love me,  
Or those who felt they understood me  
And I can't see those who  
Very patiently...put up with me  
  
All I can see are the never laid,  
Or the never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You were meant to be one,  
And you jumped into my face  
And laughed and kissed me on the cheek  
And then were gone, forever...not quite  
  
Black sky in the daytime  
And I don't much mind dying,  
When there is nothing left to care for...anymore  
Just the never laid  
The never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You knew you were one  
And you slipped right through my fingers  
No not literally,  
But metaphorically  
And now you're all I see...as the light fades...

You fight with your right hand  
And caress with your left hand  
Everyone I know is sick to death of you  
  
With a tear that's a mile wide  
In the kite that you're flying  
Everyone I know is sick to death of you  
Ever since  
You don't look the same  
You're just not the same, no way  
You say clever things and  
You never used to  
  
You don't catch what I'm saying  
When you're deafened to advice  
Everyone here is sick to the  
Back teeth of you  
  
With a tear that's a mile wide  
In the kite that you're flying  
Everyone here is sick to the  
Tattoo of you  
  
Ever since  
You don't look the same  
You're just not the same, no way  
You say pleasant things and  
There is no need to  
  
Still, you fight with your right hand  
And caress with your left hand  
Ooh, ooh...  
  
Sad to say...  
How once I was in love with you  
Sad to say...  
  
You don't catch what I'm saying  
When you're deafened to advice  
Ooh, ooh...  
  
Ever since  
You don't look the same  
You're just not the same, no way  
What the hell have  
They stuck into you?

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing  
Happy being no-one but themselves  
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes  
Who think it's very clever to be cruel to you  
  
For you were so different  
You stood all alone  
And you knew  
That it had to be so  
Avoiding ordinary boys  
Happy going nowhere, just around here  
In their rattling cars  
  
Ordinary girls  
Never seeing further  
Than the cold, small streets  
That trap them  
But you were so different  
You had to say no  
When those empty fools  
Tried to change you, and claim you  
For the lair of their ordinary world  
  
Where they feel so lucky  
So lucky, so lucky  
With their lives laid out before them  
They are lucky  
So lucky, so lucky  
So lucky, so...

(Take me back to dear old Blighty  
Put me on the train to London Town  
Take me anywhere, drop me anywhere  
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham,  
But I don't care!  
I should like to see my)  
  
(By land, by sea)  
  
Farewell  
To this lands cheerless marches  
Hemmed in like a boar between arches  
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling  
I'm truly sorry  
But it sounds like a wonderful thing  
  
I say Charles, don't you ever crave  
To appear on the front of the Daily mail  
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?  
  
And so,  
I checked all  
The registered historical facts  
And I was shocked into shame to discover  
How I'm the 18th pale descendent  
Of some old queen or other  
Has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Has the world changed, or have I changed?  
Some 9-year old tough peddles drugs  
(I swear to God I swear  
I never even knew what drugs were)  
  
And so, I broke into the Palace  
With a sponge and a rusty spanner  
She said:  
"Eh, I know you  
And you cannot sing"  
I said:  
"that's nothing  
You should hear me play piano"  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But when you're tied  
To your Mother's apron  
No one talks about castration  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
Like love and law and poverty  
These are the things that kill me  
  
We can go for a walk  
Where it's quiet and dry  
And talk about precious things  
But the rain that flattens my hair  
These are the things that kill me  
(All their lies about make up  
And long hair they're still there)  
  
Passed the Pub who saps your body  
And the church  
Who'll snatch your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Pass the pub that wrecks your body  
And the church  
All they want is your money  
The Queen is dead, boys  
And it's so lonely on a limb  
  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely  
Life is very long, when you're lonely

There's too many people  
Planning your downfall  
When your spirit's on trial  
These nights can be frightening  
Sleep transports sadness  
To some other mid-brain  
And somebody here  
Will not be here next year  
So you stand by the board  
Full of fear and intention  
And, if you think that they're listening  
Well, you've got to be joking  
Oh, you understand change  
And you think it's essential  
But when your profession  
Is humiliation  
Say the wrong word to our children...  
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you  
Lay a hand on our children  
And it's never too late to have you  
Mucus on your collar  
A nail up through the staff chair  
A blade in your soap  
And you cry into your pillow  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
Say the wrong word to our children...  
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you  
Lay a hand on our children  
And it's never too late to have you  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
  
I'm very glad the spring has come  
The sun shines out so bright  
All the birds that are on the trees  
Are singing for delight

You must be wondering how,  
The boy next door turned out,  
Have a care,  
But don't stare,  
Because he's still there  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen,  
Uniformed whores,  
They who wish to hurt you, Work within the law  
This world is full,  
So full of crashing bores,  
And I must be one,  
'Cos no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms,  
Take me in your arms,  
And love me  
  
You must be wondering how,  
The boy next door turned out,  
Have a care,  
And say a prayer,  
Because he's still there  
  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen,  
Uniformed whores,  
Educated criminals,  
Work within the law  
This world is full,  
Oh oh,  
So full of crashing bores,  
And I must be one, 'cause no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms,  
Take me in your arms,  
And love me,  
And love me  
  
What really lies,  
Beyond the constraints of my mind,  
Could it be the sea,  
With fate mooning back at me  
No it's just more lock jawed pop stars,  
Thicker than pig shit,  
Nothing to convey  
They're so scared to show intelligence,  
It might smear their lovely career  
  
This world, I am afraid,  
Is designed for crashing bores,  
I am not one, I am not one  
You don't understand,  
You don't understand,  
And yet you can,  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Love me,  
And love me  
  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Love me, love me,  
Take me in your arms and love me,  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Would you do,  
Would you do,  
What you should do,  
Oh oh oh, oh oh

Take me out tonight  
Where there's music and there's people  
Who are young and alive  
  
Driving in your car  
I never, never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one anymore  
  
Take me out tonight  
Because I want to see people  
And I want to see light  
  
Driving in your car  
Oh, please don't drop me home  
Because it?s not my home, it?s their home  
And I'm welcome no more  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine  
  
Take me out tonight  
Oh, take me anywhere  
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care  
  
And in the darkened underpass  
I thought, oh God, my chance has come at last  
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask  
  
Take me out tonight  
Oh, take me anywhere  
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care  
  
Driving in your car  
I never, never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one  
I haven't got one  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us, so what  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine  
  
Oh, there is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out  
There is a light, never goes out

Now, there  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You told me all the things  
That you think are wrong with me  
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me put them right  
But nevertheless:  
  
There...mm  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You listed all the things  
That people cannot stand about me  
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me to improve  
Because I've tried, I've tried  
Oh, I've really really tried  
  
You say I don't know how to live  
(And that's true)  
You say I don't deserve to live  
Oh, where would I be without my friends to help me?  
I just can't imagine where I'd be, can you?  
No

Road blocks and fire  
Barb wire upon barb wire  
This is not your country  
  
Armoured cars, corrugated scars  
Graffiti scrawls:  
"This is not your country"  
  
Home sweet fortress  
Gunshot - we hate your kind  
Get back!  
This is not your country  
  
I need some air  
And I'm stopped and repeatedly questioned:  
"Born and braised?"  
But this is not my country  
  
We're old news  
All's well  
Say BBC scum  
One child shot, but so what?  
  
Laid my son  
In a box, three feet long  
And I still don't know why  
  
A short walk home becomes a run  
And I'm scared  
In my own country  
  
We're old news  
All's well  
Say BBC scum  
Everybody's under control  
Of our surveillance globes  
  
We're old news  
All's well  
And thirty years could be a thousand  
And this Peugeot ad  
Spins round in my head  
British soldier pointing a gun  
And I'm only trying to post a letter  
A short walk home becomes a run  
And I'm scared, and I'm scared, I am scared  
  
Old news  
All's well  
BBC scum  
  
You've got more than the dead, so zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth  
Zip up your mouth (repeated)

Still drinking on the corner  
Just don't say I didn't warn you  
Always nagging big brother  
He's only looking out for you  
  
Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
  
You're still standing on the corner  
Just don't say I didn't warn you  
Old and jealous big brother  
You had your time and you spent it  
Crying  
  
Now, Tony the pony  
Tony the pony  
So, that's what they call you now?  
When you're free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And...  
There's a free ride on  
Tony the pony  
  
Oh, why do you always want to stop me  
From doing the things in life that make me happy?  
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly  
Why do you always want to stop me?  
  
Oh, I would never  
I would never  
  
But you will carry the can for anyone  
The free ride on  
Gullible Tony  
  
You're drunker quicker  
And you're sicker even quicker  
For something heavy is gonna fall on you  
Oh...  
  
And what do they call you now?  
When you're free outside  
So cold and hard and in control  
And, oh...been a lark  
There's a free ride on  
Fucked-up Tony  
  
I will never say I told you so  
Or how I knew that something bad  
Would happen to you  
I don't want to say I told you so  
Oh, but Tony, I told you so!!!  
I told you so

We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh, look at those clothes  
Now look at that face, it's so old  
And such a video !  
Well, it's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
[Chorus:]  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse  
And if we can destroy them  
You bet your life we will  
Destroy them  
If we can hurt them  
Well, we may as well  
It's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
You see, it should've been me  
It could've been me  
Everybody knows  
Everybody says so  
They say :  
  
"Ah, you have loads of songs  
So many songs  
More songs than they'd stand  
  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
We hate it when our friends become successful  
Oh, look at those clothes  
Now look at that face, it's so old  
And such a video !  
Well, it's really laughable  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just listen  
La, la-la, la-la

How sad are we?  
And how sad have we been?  
We'll let you know  
We'll let you know  
Oh, but only if, you're really interested  
  
You wonder how  
We've stayed alive 'till now  
We'll let you know  
We'll let you know  
But only if, you're really interested  
  
We're all smiles  
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles  
That make us hostile  
Oh  
  
We will descend  
On anyone unable to defend  
Themselves  
Oh  
  
And the songs we sing  
They're not supposed to mean a thing  
La, la, la, la  
  
Oh  
You're lonely  
Oh, you're lonely  
Oh  
Get off the roof!  
Oh  
  
Your arsenal!  
  
We may seem cold, or  
We may even be  
The most depressing people you've ever known  
At heart, what's left, we sadly know  
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know  
We are the last truly British people you will ever know  
You'll never never want to know

Names, secret names  
But never in my favor  
But when all is said and done  
It's you I love  
  
Cold loving prose  
We stole each other's clothes  
But when all is said and done  
It's you I love  
  
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes  
Oh no, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh...  
Yes, yes...  
  
Fights for rights  
Everyone's oh so quick with advice  
And when they've all said their piece  
It's still you I love  
Now just like then  
  
Then, then, then  
Then, then, yes, yes  
No, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, oh...  
Mmm...

The sanest days are mad  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the price  
Very closely  
  
Some men here  
They have a special interest  
In your career  
They want to help you to grow  
And then siphon all your dough  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass  
Hidden in the grass  
  
You'll never believe me, so  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Sick down to my heart  
That's just the way it goes  
  
Some men here  
They know the full extent of  
Your distress  
They kneel and pray  
And they say:  
"Long may it last"  
  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass  
Hidden in the grass  
Bad scenes come and go  
For which you must allow  
Sick down to my heart  
That's just the way it goes  
  
Don't rake up my mistakes  
I know exactly what they are  
And what do you do?  
Well you just sit there  
I've been stabbed in the back  
So many many times  
I don't have any skin  
But that's just the way it goes

I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you, but no  
I will live my life as I  
Will undoubtedly die alone  
  
I'm writing this to say  
In a gentle way  
Thank you  
I will live my life as I, oh  
For whether you stay  
Or stray  
An in-built guilt catches up with you  
  
And as it comes around to your place  
At five a.m., wakes you up  
And it laughs in your face  
  
Don't speak!  
Sing

World peace is none of your business  
You must not tamper with arrangements  
Work hard and sweetly pay your taxes  
Never asking what for  
  
Oh oh, you poor little fool  
Oh oh, you fool  
  
World peace is none of your business  
Police will stun you with their stun guns  
Or they'll disable you with tasers  
That's what governments for  
  
Oh oh, you poor little fool  
Oh oh, you fool  
  
World peace is none of your business  
So would you kindly keep your nose out  
The rich must profit and get richer  
And the poor must stay poor  
  
Oh oh, you poor little fool  
Oh oh, you fool  
  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Brazil, Bahrain  
Oh, Egypt, Ukraine  
So many people in pain  
  
No more you poor little fool  
No more you fool

Pasolini is me,  
Accattone, you'll be,  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me,  
Till you came with the key,  
And you did your best but?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
Piazza Cavour,  
What's my life for?  
  
Visconti is me,  
Magnani,  
You'll never be.  
  
I entered nothing and nothing entered me,  
Till you came with the key,  
And you did your best but?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
Who am I, that I, come to be here?  
  
As I live and breathe,  
You have killed me,  
You have killed me,  
Yes I walk around somehow,  
But you have killed me,  
You have killed me  
  
And there is no point saying this again,  
There is no point saying this again,  
But I forgive you,  
I forgive you,  
Always, I do forgive you.
