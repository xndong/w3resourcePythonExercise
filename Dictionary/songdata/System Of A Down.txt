Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
The cold insincerity of steel machines  
Have consumed our euphoria  
Transforming us into muted dreams  
Dreaming of the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Books illustrate what we already know  
Candles cry towards the sky  
Racing your flags along polluted coasts  
Dreaming of the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Attack  
Attack  
  
Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
  
Breathing each other's lives  
Holding this in mind  
That if we fall, we all fall  
And we fall alone  
  
What's the philosophy of displaced mines The bombing of all homes and  
Villages Truth is the only sword bleeding minds Bleeding till the day that  
  
We attack  
Attack, attack your fetal servitude  
We attack  
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide  
We attack  
All the years of propaganda  
We shall attack  
  
Attack all the homes and villages  
Attack all the schools and hospitals  
You attack all the rapes and pillages  
We shall attack  
  
We shall attack

I'm walking through your streets  
Where all your money's earning  
Where all your buildings crying  
And clueless neckties working  
Revolving fake lawn houses  
Housing all your fears  
Desensitized by T.V.  
  
Overbearing advertising  
God of consumers  
And all your crooked pictures looking good  
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye  
Designed for profit sharing  
Your neighbor, what a guy  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
  
Modern globalization  
Coupled with condemnations  
Unnecessary death  
Matador corporations  
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag  
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game  
The bottom line is money nobody gives a fuck  
  
4000 hungry children  
Leave us per hour from starvation  
While billions are spent on bombs  
Creating death showers  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Why must we kill our own kind?  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom, Boom, Boom,  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom  
Every time you drop the bomb

Jump, bounce, down, up  
  
I went out on a date,  
With a girl, a bit late,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.  
I brought my pogo stick,  
Just to show her a trick,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
  
Unannounced twister games,  
All players with no names,  
They lined up double quick,  
But just one pogo stick,  
Everyone gets to play,  
Runaway, expose',  
It was so exotic,  
But just one pogo stick.  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
  
Oh, I'd like to spread you out,  
Touching whoever's behind  
  
Jump pogo,  
Bounce pogo,  
Down, up  
Jump, bounce, up, down  
Bounce pogo,  
Down pogo, up pogo

Fish that don't drown,  
Life in a bubble jungle,  
I wouldn't frown,  
Not short another chuckle,  
Snake in the ground,  
But I was in there for you,  
Now leaving town,  
Life in a bubble jungle.  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
We're the power struck.  
  
Believing, then kneeling,  
Appeasing,  
The power struggle.  
  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle,  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
  
Wearing a crown,  
Life in a bubble jungle,  
Chasing a clown,  
Not short another chuckle,  
Snake in the ground,  
But I was waiting for you,  
Now we have found,  
Life in a bubble jungle.  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
We're the power struck.  
  
Believing, then keeling,  
Appeasing,  
The power struggle.  
  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle,  
We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
Left with no arms,  
In the power struggle,  
Left with no arms,

We're left with no arms,  
Right in the power struggle.  
Left with no arms,  
In the power struggle,  
Left with no arms,  
Right here in the power struggle.

Walk with me my little child,  
To the forest of denial,  
Speak with me my only mind,  
Walk with me until the time,  
And make the forest turn to wine,  
You take the legend for a fall,  
You saw the product,  
  
Why can't you see that you are my child,  
Why don't you know that you are my mind,  
Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,  
Take this promise to the end of you.  
  
Walk with me my little friend,

You saw the product,  
  
Why can't you see that you are my child,  
Why don't you know that you are my mind,  
Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,  
Take this promise to the end of you.  
  
Take this promise for a ride,  
You saw the forest, now come inside,  
You took the legend for its fall,  
You saw the product of it all,  
No televisions in the air,  
No circumcisions on the chair,  
You made the weapons for us all,  
Just look at us now,  
  
Why can't you see that you are my child,  
Why don't you know that you are my mind,  
Tell everyone in the world, that I'm you,  
Take this promise to the end of you.

I need not fear the love  
You love to love the fear  
I never want to be alone  
I've forgotten too  
The road keeps moving the clouds  
The clouds become unreal  
I guess I'll always be at home  
Do you want me to try?  
Directing your night  
  
An exit lights the sky  
The sky becomes complete  
Traveling hearts divine the throne  
I've forgotten too  
Friction, lines, bumps  
The highway song complete  
The signs are all turning right  
  
Do you want me to try?  
Directing your night  
Want me to try  
Directing your LIFE  
  
The purest forms of life  
Our days are never coming back  
The cannons of our time  
Our days are never coming back

(Mow down the sexy people)  
Every time I look In your eyes, every day I'm watching you die  
All the thoughts I see in you about how I  
  
Eat all the grass  
Eat all the grass that you want  
Accidents happen In the dark  
Eat all the grass that you want  
Accidents happen In the dark  
Eat all the grass that you want

All the thoughts I see in you about how I  
  
Why Why

So I felt like the biggest asshole  
When I killed rock n roll

Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth,  
Cursed Earth.  
  
I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart all  
Because we all live in the valley of the walls when we speak  
We can peak from the windows of their mouths to see the land  
The women chant as they fly up to the sun.  
  
You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.  
  
Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings  
Trying to soar by being a whore of life  
And almost everything the sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead  
But now's a bird able to fly able to die able to break your cursed earth  
(fuck your mother's earth)  
  
You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.  
  
On the other side, on the other side, the other side,  
Do you ever try to fly, Do you ever try to fly?  
Have you ever wanted to die, you ever want to die?  
  
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly,  
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side,  
Never try to die, you ever try to die.  
  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, You never think you know why,  
Know, Ever think you know why,  
Know.

Stretching, filing,  
Against her skin,  
Blessed are those,  
Who are not kin,  
In sin we breathe,  
In sex we tie,  
Duct tape her legs,  
To the red sky,  
Foolsome flesh allowances,  
The pansies raided the pantry of,  
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous,  
Delight, deny not the flavor,  
Custard dreams,  
Abusing, musing,  
Marmalade flesh  
Naked spread am I,  
  
Actors of the tragic fanthom,  
Extend your legs to great saturn,  
Brown table tops scream for cover,  
At the sight of your new lover,  
If today I die,  
And can't deny,  
The poison chosen,  
For tonight.  
Borrowed dreams,  
Hollowed reveries,  
Metal pillows,  
Pewter yellows,  
Furry roadkill,  
House on the hill,  
Pouring gravy,  
On her thighs still,  
If today I die,  
And can't deny,  
The poison chosen,  
For tonight.

I cannot disguise  
All the stomach pains  
And the walking of the canes  
When you, do come out  
And you whisper up to me  
In your life of tragedy  
  
But I cannot grow  
Till you eat the last of me  
Oh when will I be free  
And you, a parasite  
Just find another host  
Just another fool to roast  
  
Cause you  
My tapeworm tells me what to do  
You  
My tapeworm tells me where to go  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, Hey

I cannot deny  
All the evil traits  
And the filling of the crates  
When you, do come out  
And you slither up to me  
In your pimpin' majesty  
  
But I cannot grow  
Till you eat the last of me  
Oh when will I be free  
And you, a parasite  
Just find another host  
Just another stool to post

My tapeworm tells me what to do

With a needle in my hand  
Just waiting for the tomb  
Of some old dying man

When your stars are baked,  
And your rivers fly  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
When your castle breaks,  
And your feet are dry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
Do you believe, when you're high  
That your life is tried  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
  
When your moon is fake,  
And your mermaids cry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
When your tunnel fades,  
And your guide is shy  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
Do you believe, when you're high  
That your life is tried  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high

Perish it

Cold rust

Fair ways  
For us  
When the present can be sealed  
  
Away  
Cold rust  
For the mighty conquered meal  
  
Can't you look at my shamed ass?  
Now she's gone and got us once  
You can't see me Saturday

What you get and what you see  
Things that don't come easily  
Feeling happy in my vein  
Icicles within my brain  
Cocaine!  
  
Something blowing in my head  
Winter's ice, it soon will spread  
Death would freeze my very soul  
Makes me happy, makes me cold  
Cocaine!  
  
My eyes are blind, but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel there's no place freezing me  
  
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?  
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong  
You're the one who's really a loser  
This is where I feel I belong  
  
Crystal world with winter flowers  
Turns my day to frozen hours  
Lying snowblind in the sun  
Will my ice age ever come?  
  
My eyes are blind, but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel there's no place freezing me...

The piercing radiant moon,  
The storming of poor June,  
All the life running through her hair,  
  
Approaching guiding light,  
Our shallow years in fright,  
Dreams are made winding through my head,  
  
Through my head,  
Before you know, Awake,  
  
Your lives are open wide,  
The V-chip gives them sight,  
All the life running through her hair,  
  
The spiders all in tune,  
The evening of the moon,  
Dreams are made winding through my head,  
  
Through my head,  
Before you know, Awake  
  
Through my head,  
Through my head,  
Before you know,  
Before you know I will be waiting all awake,  
  
Dreams are made winding through her hair,  
Dreams are made winding through her hair.

I wasn't there for you  
I wasn't there for you  
I know weather's gonna be fine  
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline  
My love waits for me in daytime  
But I can't see you through the snow blind  
  
But I wasn't there for you  
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)

I can hand wrestle with the stormy night  
Because your love lasts a lifetime

Watching,  
From a post up high,  
From where you see the ships afar,  
From a well trained eye,  
The waves all keep on crashing by,  
If you are the light post,  
Then you own the working class,  
But if you want the answers,  
You better give a piece of ass,  
Give a piece of your ass  
  
Warning,  
Post hypnotic suggestions,  
Running the ships ashore,  
The orange light that follows,  
Will soon proclaim itself a God,  
If you point your questions,  
The fog will surely chew you up,  
But if you want the answers,  
You better get ready for the fire,  
Get ready for the fire  
  
The ships are multiplying day after day sir,  
And they're coming close to the shore sir, shore sir,  
We need to evacuate the light post,  
It's all over  
It's all over.

Had an out of  
Body experience  
The other day  
Her name was Jesus  
And for her everyone cried  
Everyone cried  
Everyone cried  
  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosophy die  
  
Crossed and terrored  
Ravages of architecture  
Lend me thy blades  
We're crossed and terrored  
Ravages of architecture  
Hoist around the spade  
  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosophy die  
  
Die, die, die, why  
Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go through our souls  
Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go all through our souls  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Die, like a motherfucker  
Why, like a motherfucker  
I want to fuck  
My way to the garden  
Cause everyone needs  
A motherfucker  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy  
Try her philosophy, try  
  
You die for her philosophy  
Die for her philosophy  
Die her philosphy die  
  
The following of a Christ [Repeat: x4]  
The falling of Christ [Repeat: x4]

Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Bombs overtaken by the signs of the light  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you talking all detached, so tell us  
  
Where you going,  
To the bottom?  
Do you hear us?  
We are rotting  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide  
The masked comforts to delusional,  
They're all in fright  
The true believer's head was bathed in sunlight  
While you are walking all detached, so tell us  
  
Where you going,  
To the bottom?  
Do you hear us?  
We are rotting  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No one's gonna save us  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No one's gonna save us now  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall

I'm alone, sitting with my broken glass  
My four walls follow me through my past  
I was on a Paris train  
I emerged in London rain  
And you waiting there swimming through apologies  
  
I remember searching for the perfect words  
I was hoping you might change your mind  
I remember the soldier standing next to me  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I was smiling as you took my hand  
Saw the mood we spoke in France  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
I can see you now smiling as I pulled away..  
Sorry  
  
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand  
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes  
I remember the night we walked along the Seine  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I remember a feeling coming over me  
The soldier turned, then walked away  
Fuck you for loving me  
Riding on the Metro

Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub  
Eating seeds as a pastime activity  
The toxicity of our city, of our city  
  
Now, what do you own the world?  
How do you own disorder, disorder  
Now somewhere between the sacred silence  
Sacred silence and sleep  
Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep  
Disorder, disorder, disorder  
  
More wood for the fires, loud neighbors  
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck  
Eating seeds as a pastime activity  
The toxicity of our city, of our city  
  
Now, what do you own the world?  
How do you own disorder, disorder  
Now somewhere between the sacred silence  
Sacred silence and sleep  
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep  
Disorder, disorder, disorder  
  
You, what do you own the world?
