Well, they say it's kinda fright'nin' how this younger generation swings.  
You know, it's more than just some new sensation.  
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep and he don't come home for half the week.  
You know, it's more than just an aggravation.  
  
And the cradle will rock.  
Yes, the cradle will rock.  
And I say, rock on!  
Rock on!  
  
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town.  
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."  
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets,  
and he's unemployed.  
  
And the cradle will rock.  
Yeah, the cradle will rock.  
And I say, rock on!  
Rock on!  
  
Have you seen Junior's grades?  
And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town.  
They say, "You coulda least faked it, boy."  
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets,  
and he's unemployed. His folks are overjoyed.  
  
And the cradle will rock.  
Yeah, the cradle will rock.  
And I say, rock on!  
  
Rock on!  
Rock on!  
Rock on!

Some say money is bad for the soul  
Bad for the rock, bad for the roll  
Bad for the heart, bad for the brain  
Bad for damn near everything, oh  
Yeah  
It must be good for something  
Come on pay the rent  
Telephone, telefax, telefunkin',  
Teletrash  
Tell a cop, tell a friend  
Think we've hit the stoney end  
Nothing left, nothing right  
Now they want a bigger bite  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants big money, oh yeah  
They want big fat money  
That's what I want  
Big fat money  
Too much temptation  
Enough to kill a generation  
Space station, starvation, premature  
Ejaculation  
This ain't groovin', this ain't funky  
It's on my back  
But it ain't my monkey, no  
Oh yeah, gimme some of that big big  
Money  
That's what I want  
Big fat money  
Big big money  
Smoke this, eat that  
My ol'lady's gettin' fat  
High rise, high rent  
Before it's earned, it's all been spent  
Where's it gonna come from?  
Who's it gonna go to?  
Ain't beatin', but I'm being eatin' by  
Money, oh yeah  
Big big money, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Some of that big money, alright

Gimme big fat money  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme some of that big fat money

Slip n' slide, push it in  
Bitch sure got the rhythm  
I'm holding back, yeah, I got control  
  
Hooked into her system  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
Well, you never know when love will come  
Gotta get it while you got it  
A little bit of everything, even when it hurts  
  
Sure feels good  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Yo mama!  
Black and blue  
Black and blue, yo mama!  
Black and blue  
Gotta, gotta, gotta, get it right  
Black and blue  
  
Don't draw the line  
Honey, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
We'll do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Don't draw the line  
Baby, I ain't through with you  
The harder the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
The wetter the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue  
  
Do it 'til we're black and blue  
The wetter the better  
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue

You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
I'm a lucid vision  
Of the unforgiven  
I'm your wave-toss guy  
  
King-size, we were crushin'  
Trouble by the dozen  
Stakes have never been higher  
Come back when you're younger  
'Cause I can feel the thunder  
1-800-GUITAR  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
It's a world of fools  
That's just what's expected  
None of 'em know it  
Or even suspect it  
God must love the lazy  
Shiftless and the crazy  
Puttin' so many in life  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
  
Now look at all of the people here tonight  
  
Forgotten empires  
Lost victories long past  
Every time I bloomed again  
I thought it was the last  
And then something crazy happens  
And boom!  
I'm doing the victory dance!  
  
Told ya I was comin' back  
(Told ya!)  
Say you missed me  
(Say it!)  
Say it like ya mean it!  
  
You can always tell the winners  
The saints and the sinners  
Down at the starting line  
  
Ooooh yeahhh  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire  
We came, we came, we came through blood and fire

I've been sitting here 'bout half the night.  
Oh, mama, fill my cup up.  
Said I came to waste some time.  
I think I'm gonna jump up.  
I'm singin', I'm dancin' most every night.  
And I want to do that with you babe.  
Let's do this bottle right.  
Oh, oh, baby, bottoms up.  
Pretty maids, all in a row, go on, set 'em up, up.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.  
I'm singin', I'm dancin' most every night.  
And I want to do that with you, babe.  
Let's do this bottle right.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.  
Come um um um um um, baby, bottoms up.

My karma just ran over your dogma.  
I can feel your pain.  
If everything is coming your way  
You're facing the wrong lane.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!  
  
How many roads must a man walk down  
Before he admits he's lost.  
And do you really, really drive this way  
Just to piss me off?  
  
Boldly going nowhere,  
Trouble busting through.  
Yeah, I'm rolling slowly  
But I'm ahead of you.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!  
  
Well I'm a lovin' the horn baby.  
Well I'm a bullethead.  
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come on baby  
Well I'm a bullethead.  
  
Hurt me!  
  
Traffic is giving you trouble?  
I can feel your pain.  
No light at the end of the tunnel  
Due to budget constraints.  
  
Some days you're the dog,  
Some days you're the hydrant.  
If everything is going your way  
You're facing the wrong lane.  
  
Bullethead,  
Bomb the moon until you're crazy dead.  
B-b-b-b-b-b-bullethead  
Got a different kind of true.  
Bullethead,  
Yes you are in danger.  
I drive just like you!

I've been to Rome, Dallas, Texas  
Man, I thought I'd seen it all  
Around the world, search in every corner  
Man, I thought I'd hit the wall  
There's a sleepy town, south of the Border  
If you go there once, you'll be there twice  
Lots of pretty girls, coming by the dozens  
The white sand sure makes a tan look nice  
We can crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
We gotta try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo  
It's alright by me  
Come on, let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
Land's end, you'd have to see it  
Ain't no picture ever say it right  
Walkin' the streets doing that ole, the Cabo Wabo  
Place comes to life every night  
I want to crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
It's all right there  
We don't have to chase it  
Fits paradise to a T  
Come on, let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
We drink Mescal right from the bottle  
Salt shaker, little lick a lime, ohhh  
Throwin' down, down tryin' to reach the bottom  
Where the guave worm, well he's mine all mine  
Come on, crash on the beach  
You know I want to make love in the sea  
Go try a little dance, so Cabo Wabo  
It's alright by me  
Let me take you down  
I will show you around  
Let me take you down  
Face down in Cabo  
Kissing the ground  
Face down,  
Down in Cabo  
Take me down,  
Down to Cabo  
Face down,  
Down in Cabo  
Doin' the Cabo Wabo  
Take me down,  
Down to Cabo  
Come on, get it, get it

Got me a date with a supermodel. Ha ha ha  
I know, I know I figured "Fuck it"  
Dinner at the hotel, champagne bottle  
Steak and potatoes, a feather in a bucket  
  
Tell me what is it we're pretendin'?  
Not to know, and who needs proof?  
I don't need so much to remember  
No, no. That's how it is, when you tell the truth  
Woo!  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
'Til patience (Ahh-ahh-ahh) runs her course?  
Keep that in mind, when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
That's the thing about self-improvement  
Don't get me wrong, I plan on gettin' some soon  
Outside the wire somethin's movin'  
The barn burnt down now I can see the moon  
  
A slice at a time, like a pizza pie  
You (Ahh-ahh-ahh) serve up the truth, don't want it anymore  
Keep that in mind, when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
Woo!  
  
How many times does somebody lie  
'Fore (Ahh-ahh-ahh) patience runs her course?  
Keep that in mind when we say goodbye  
'Cuz you can't (Ahh-ahh-ahh) get this stuff no more  
  
(A slice at a time) Wha-oh yeah!  
  
Wha-oh! (Ahh-ahh-ahh) Can't get that stuff no more!  
Better keep that in mind! (Keep it in mind)  
When we say our goodbyes  
'Cuz you can't get this stuff no more-ah!  
  
Not this stuff baby

There's a time and place for everything, for everyone  
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come  
Oh no, nothing's gonna change  
And if I asked you not to try  
Oh could you let it be  
I wanna hold you and say  
We can't throw this all away  
Tell me you won't go, you won't go  
Do you have to hear me say  
I can't stop lovin' you  
  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true, oh  
I can't stop lovin' you  
You can change your friends, your place in life  
You can change your mind  
We can change the things we say  
And do it anytime  
Oh no, but I think you'll find  
That when you look inside your heart  
Oh baby, I'll be there  
  
Hold on  
I'm holding on  
Baby, just come on, come on, come on  
I just wanna hear you say  
I can't stop lovin' you  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true, oh  
I can't stop lovin' you  
Oh, I'm twisted and tied  
And all I can remember  
Is how hard we tried  
Only to surrender  
  
And when it's over  
I know how it's gonna be  
And true love will never die  
No, not fade away  
I can't stop lovin' you  
And no matter what you say or do  
You know my heart is true, oh  
I can't stop lovin' you  
And I know what I got to do  
Hey ray, what you said is true  
I can't stop lovin' you, oh  
Oh, I can't stop lovin' you

Woo!  
Ah, yeah!  
Callin' out, around the world  
Are you ready for a brand new beat?  
Summer's here, and the time is right

(Dancin' in the streets)

Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow?  
So obscene, but to me it don't matter  
Her movies get down like you won't find in my hometown  
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein'  
Go see baby now!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
  
Daddy's little sweetie after some damn rainbow  
Got the big deal in the back of a limo  
Now showbiz is so thrillin', the camera rolls she's willin'  
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein'  
Go see baby now!  
  
Hey, you remember when that girl was prom queen?  
Oh wow! Take it off! Take it all off!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
  
Now they believe it, now that they've seen it  
Go see baby now!  
  
Pictures on the silver screen  
Greatest thing you've ever seen  
Now her name is up in lights  
Everything turns out all right  
Lights! Camera! Action!

No candidate would I support  
His platform could I endorse  
Another accomplice slinging dirt  
Campaign promises falling short  
I don't belong to any race  
Pledge allegiance to a place  
No borderline in the sand I'd trace  
I'm just a sucker for a pretty face  
Uncomfortable in the realm of the political  
Position's always been a little left of cynical  
I'm fundamentally for the individual  
Preoccupied purely with the physical  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a hound dog chasing a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see  
  
I don't want to find religion  
Or another man's opinion  
I can't choose what's not my decision  
When there's only one under the sun  
There's no need to be denied  
Chew before swallowing pride  
I want to live so let me die  
Oh by the way, what's your sign?  
  
Can't comprehend the meaning of the metaphysical  
I'd rather leave that to your so-called intellectual  
But what I do know I know feels only natural  
I'm just a red-blooded heterosexual  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see  
  
When heavy is the weight of the world  
And the river runs a little too deep  
Like a dirty water doggin' a bird  
Sometimes a certain tom's he gotta peep  
I'm a peek-a-boy, looking at girls  
And I think I like, like a hound dog, chasin' a bird  
  
And I think I like  
A dirty water dog  
And I think I like, I think I like, I like what I see

[Chorus:]  
Drop dead legs, pretty smile,  
Hurts my head, gets me wild.  
Dig that steam, giant butt,  
Makes me scream, I get nuh-nuh-nothing but the shakes over you  
And nothing else could ever do.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that you want it.  
I know what it is.  
You know that you want it, baby,  
When the night is through, will I still be loving you?  
Dig those moves, vam-pire  
Set me loose, get it higher.  
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop  
Nice white teeth, Betty Boop.  
Set it cool real heavy.  
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready.  
  
[Chorus]

You can't get romantic on a subway line.  
Conductor don't like it, says you're wastin' your time.  
But ev'rybody wants some.  
I want some too.  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
Baby, how 'bout you?  
I seen a lotta people lookin' for a moonbeam.  
Yeah, ya spent a lot. Ya got lost in the jet-stream.  
But ev'rybody wants some.  
I want some too.  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
Baby, how 'bout you?  
I like the way the line runs up the back of the stockings.  
I've always liked those kind of high heels too. You know, I...  
No no no no, don't take 'em off, don't take... Leave 'em on, leave 'em on.  
Yeah, that's it, a little more to the right, a little more....  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
I want some too.  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
Baby, how 'bout you?  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
Ev'rybody needs some.  
Ev'rybody wants some.  
Ev'rybody needs some.

Outta touch most the time  
Gotta lotta things on my mind  
Kickin' down, where to start  
It's the hardest thing  
Oh...  
Grow it long, shave it off  
Life is hard, never soft  
I need a change, I need it quick  
Before it makes me sick  
That's what's on my mind  
Pay attention, watch your back  
Pay your dues, stay on track  
Got no room to second-guess  
Puts me under stress  
Oh...  
If I were you, you were me  
I wonder who I'd want to be  
With just one wish you can't refuse  
I wouldn't know what to choose  
Feelin'...no, don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
Feelin' what no one else will ever  
Know I'm feelin'  
Oh...  
Now black is white and white is  
Black  
Got politicians smokin' crack  
And John Paul's all bullet-proofed  
It puts me through the roof  
Yea...  
I were you and you were me  
I wonder who I'd rather be  
If I had one wish I'd take it  
Feelin'...oh, I don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
And I'm seein'  
What no one else will ever know I'm  
Seein'  
Come on, feelin'  
Hey, I don't understand these things  
I'm feelin'  
No...  
Outta touch most all the time  
Too many things on my mind  
Shuttin' down, gotta stop this thing  
Feelin'...no, I don't like what I've been  
Told I'm feelin'  
I'm bleeding...like no one else will  
Ever know I'm bleeding  
Dealin'...I'm dealin' with these things  
I'm feelin'  
I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin', I'm  
Dreamin' things that show me what  
I'm seein'  
Seein'...I'm seein' things that I don't  
Know I'm feelin'  
I've been feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin'  
Things that I don't know  
I don't know, I don't know what I'm  
Seein'  
Hey, I don't understand

Yesterday I saw my love light shine  
Straight ahead in front of me  
You never really know  
When love will come or go  
But yesterday I was alone  
Suddenly I walked you home  
I never really knew  
What love could make me do  
I'll send the message in a bottle  
Trust in the mercy of the sea  
Stormy weather, oh yeah  
Waitin' for love to set me free  
Everyday I watch the tide roll in  
Stay until it rolls away  
Though nothing's on the shore  
I'm running back for more  
I'll send the message in a bottle  
Play for the mercy of the sea  
Stormy weather, oh yeah  
Waitin' for love to rescue me  
Feels so good, feels so nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good, so good, so good, so good  
It feels so nice, so nice  
Feels so good  
  
Feels so good  
Feels so nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good  
Gonna make her feel nice  
When love comes around  
I feel good  
So good, so good, so good  
Come on, baby  
Make me feel good

In a word to the wisdom tooth  
To tell, or not the truth (yeah)  
So open up and say ahh-men  
Rinse cup, and spit again  
Forked tongue in double speak  
Pretty soon you just might  
Spring a leak  
Inhale before you begin  
Your iron lung's a bag of wind  
  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire  
  
Sweet 'n' sour, filiblister  
Faucet pouring, fresh 'n' bitter  
Come on smile and say cheese  
On a count of three  
Ya got a mindful of decavities  
Hey!  
  
Chew your words, lest you choke  
You better watch your mouth  
Wash it out with soap. Yeah!  
Tongue tied in a tangled web  
Your bile inside better left unsaid  
  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire!  
Ah, shoot it!  
  
Hey-hey-yeah!  
Huh!  
Yeah!  
Hey-hey-yeah!  
  
(hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
There's a fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
Fire in the hole (hey hey hey hey hey)  
  
There's a fire, fire, fire  
A fire!  
  
Rudder of ship, which sets the course  
Does not the bit, bridle the horse  
Great is the forest, set by a small flame  
Like a tongue on fire, no one can tame

U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed  
Just grease it up and bring on the heat  
Throw it down and roll it over once or twice  
Then chow down  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's good enough, good enough to huh!  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough  
She's good enough to huh!  
  
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite  
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs  
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell  
Then it's three-six-nine times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight  
Me and the fellas might be interested in  
Rack a what  
Well I'll have some of that  
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world  
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see  
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing  
And she's comin' she's comin'  
So come on, come on, come on cause she's  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough  
Good, good, good enough ohhh!

Ain't got no money, got no house on the hill  
Tell me, honey, will your lovin' pay my bills?  
Neighbors gettin' crazy 'bout the noise next door  
It's a major violation, carried away for sure  
See, I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all  
I want a run for my money, that's all  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
Yeah, I'm walking, don't need no ride  
No explanation, just wasting time, yeah  
I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all  
I want a run for my money, that's all  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
I don't want to hear about it later  
I don't want to, baby I don't want to  
You can try me at home, if it feels all right  
But I ain't home at night  
You can try me at home, if it feels all right  
But I ain't home at night  
I don't want to, I'll do what I please  
I don't want to, I'll maybe do a look 'n move  
Yeah, don't look at me baby  
Yes, I better take my chances  
I, I been dreaming 'bout tomorrow  
I don't, I don't, I don't  
I don't want to hear about that, no

"Oh wow, man!"  
"Wait a second man. Whaddaya think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"  
"My butt, man!"  
T-T-Teacher stop that screaming, teacher don't you see?  
Don't want to be no uptown fool.  
Maybe I should go to hell, but I'm doin' well,  
Teacher needs to see me after school.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think of all the education that I missed.  
But then my homework was never quite like this.  
Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad,  
I'm hot for teacher.  
I got it bad, so bad,  
I'm hot for teacher.  
  
"Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!"  
"I brought my pencil"  
"Gimme something to write on, man"  
I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold.  
I know about this school.  
Little girl from cherry lane, how can you be so bold?  
How did you know that golden rule?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Oh man, I think the clock is slow"  
"I don't feel tardy"  
"Class dismissed"

Say you're gonna leave me cause I only tie you up.  
Always love you tender but you only like it rough.  
(???) why you're leaving me again.  
Gonna pack your bags and leave this house of pain.  
Heartaches all around me, how many times we cried.  
Said she tried to leave me but her hands were always tied.  
If I had it all to do I'd do it just the same.  
Gonna fix it so you never leave this house of pain

Are you ever so silent, when she wanted to talk?  
Or couldn't keep quiet, when she needed a hug  
Come on too strong, when a little's too much  
How many, how many, say I  
Go on and say yes, and really mean no  
Would you rather guess, when you just don't know  
And then say I love you, but aren't willing to show  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
  
Say live and let live, so quick to judge  
Slow to forgive, when you're holding a grudge  
Don't always believe, all you need is love  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
  
Have you ever looked down when the homeless walked by?  
Or changed the channel when you saw a hungry child?  
Know something to be true, then deny it  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
How many, how many, say I  
  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I  
How many say I, how many say I

Well, back in the past when I was treated so coldly,  
My love life was a darn disgrace.  
Needed someone to love and hold me.  
That's one of the reasons that I was out of place.  
So this is love! Well, she finally kissed me.  
Had me all worked up inside.  
I was in love, but Cupid missed me.  
She up and left, and I almost died.  
But I was young and I was far from lonely.  
I been that way for a long, long year.  
Needed a girl to call my one and only.  
Is that you?  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
'Cause you know I want to be  
Yours in a simple rhyme.  
Well, ain't life grand when you finally hit it?  
I'm always a sucker for a real good time.  
Woke up in life to find I almost missed it.  
Ain't I glad that love is blind?  
But I was young and I was far too crazy.  
Been that way for a long, long time.  
Needed a girl, but I was just too lazy.  
Now that I've found you:  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
I'm gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme.  
She made her mountains sing.  
Birds against an icy sky.  
And I heard bells ringin'  
I think I heard an angel sigh. And she said:  
There'll be times,  
There will be times  
You're gonna hear the angels singin'  
"Ah.  
Ah.  
Ah."  
You think you got the int'rest.  
C'mon and take the time.  
I'm gonna be  
Yours in a simple  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme,  
Rhyme.

She saw the look in his eyes, 'n' she knew better  
He wanted her tonight, ah, and it was now or never  
He made her feel so sad  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
  
Now Jamie wouldn't say, "All right", ah, she knew he'd forget her  
'N' so they said goodnight, ah, oh, 'n' now he's gone forever  
She want's to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah  
Uh just to try to make herself feel better  
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")  
But she knows what that'll get her  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
  
Now Jamie's been in love before (ahhh)  
And she knows what love is for (ahhh)

She want's to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah  
Just to try to make herself feel better  
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")  
But she knows what that'll get her  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'  
[repeat til outro]

Josephina, there's so much I want to know  
I've known you for all of mine  
But not all of yours  
You're not a stranger  
No, nothing could be further  
I look back and I wonder  
What you were like, long before  
Josephina, if I asked you, would you tell me?  
The fact from the fancy  
And the dreams in between  
Tell me a story  
All about yours truly  
Photographs from the past  
Imagine the mystery  
  
Didja get your head lost in a daydream?  
Cinderella, waiting for her charming  
Did ya break a heart, like little girls often do?  
Pigtails and painted toes  
All dressed up in your mother's clothes  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Oh, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
Josephina, would you lay down your defenses?  
So I can make sense of  
Those colors fading to grey  
It's not that you're hiding  
Something, I'd never imply  
Yesteryear I may be gone  
Can't say the same for today  
  
Yeah, Josephina!  
  
Ah, Josephina!  
  
How else am I to know, that all the while  
There was a mischievous look, behind that smile?  
It's hard to tell, when innocence comes and goes  
I'm sure that there were times, life could be unkind  
Without a shoulder to cry on  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)

The loss that you feel, I know that it's real.  
It's so hard when love is blind.  
You put your heart on the line.  
Now you feel like I'm wasting your time,  
  
But I know that someday, somehow, you'll learn to love.  
I know (ooh)  
  
[chorus]  
I'm learning to see  
But I don't have glasses  
You broke every heart  
By the masses  
I'm learning to see!  
I'm learning to see!  
  
That you weren't meant for me.... (oh)  
They said our love was out of sight,  
But you smashed my heart in two  
And that just wasn't right. (ooh)  
'Cause at the end of the day you could just walk away,  
When you find what you want isn't even the thing you need.  
I know. (uh huh)  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
And all that you've lost, it's not all that you've gained. (no)  
There's something that's left behind. (uh huh)  
If there's a tear in your eye,  
There will be a blue sky.  
Remember,  
The time of your life,  
When you were learning to see. (ooh)

They may talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Now no one's talkin' 'bout those  
Crazy days gone by  
No one talks about the  
Times you cried  
(Oooh) Little dreamer  
(Oooh) Uh, little dreamer  
And then they voted you  
Least likely to succeed  
I hadda tell them baby, you were armed with  
All you'd need  
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout those  
Crazy days gone past  
Weren't they amazed when you were  
Really last  
(Oooh) You are the little dreamer  
(Oooh) You were the little dreamer, yeah, yeah  
Yeah they talk about you cold when you were  
Headed for the skies  
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that  
Change with a wink of your eye  
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the  
Crazy days gone past  
Eren't they amazed when you were  
Really last  
(Oooh) You are the little dreamer  
  
(Oooh) Little dreamer, oh yeah, oh  
(Oooh) Little dreamer  
(Oooh) Little dreamer

Senorita I'm in trouble again and I can't get free  
(Senorita) You're exactly what the doctor ordered, come on talk to me  
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm out of the woods  
But there's exceptions to the rule  
(Ah-ah) Senorita, do you need a friend? I'm in love with you  
  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see, it's you and me  
Oooh-ooo-ooh  
Oooh-oooh  
  
You say you're lonesome, just getting by  
But you turn your eyes from me  
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly 'cause, you've got me  
  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see, you and me  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
When I see you, all your little guitars sing to me  
  
I can see you don't know which way to turn  
But the sun still shines  
(Senorita) Don't you know that you can dance with me, anytime?  
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm out of the woods  
There's exceptions to the rule  
(Ah-ah) Senorita, do you need a friend? I'm in love with you

Contact is all it takes  
To change your life to lose your  
place in time  
Contact! asleep or awake  
Coming around you may wake up  
to find  
Questions deep within your  
eyes,  
Now more than ever you realize  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange,  
love comes walkin' in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string  
  
Another world, some other time  
You lay your sanity on the line  
Familiar faces familiar sights  
Reach back remember with all  
your might  
Ohh there she stands in a  
silken gown  
Silver lights shining down  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange,  
love comes walkin' in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string, love  
comes walkin' in  
  
Sleep and dream is all I crave  
I travel far across the milky way  
To my master I become a slave  
Tel we meet again some other day  
Where silence speaks as loud  
as war  
And the earth returns to what it  
was before  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange,  
love comes walkin' in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string, love  
comes walkin' in

A little zen headed your way  
You'll get it halfway down the interstate  
Four days from now It all blows clear  
A Buddhist riff for your inner ear

At night I walk this stinkin' street past the crazies on my block  
And I see the same old faces and I hear that same old talk  
And I'm searching for the latest thing, a break in this routine  
I'm talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen  
This is home, this is Mean Street  
(This is) Yes-ah home, the only one I know  
  
An' we don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause we're sick of these four walls  
Now what you think is nothin' might be somethin' after all  
Now you know this ain't no through street, the end is dead ahead  
The poor folks play for keeps down here, they're the living dead  
  
Come on down, (Huh! Ow!) down (This is) to Mean Street  
They're dancin' now, look! Out on Mean Street  
Dance baby!  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
It's always here and now my friend, it ain't once upon a time  
It's all over but the shouting, I come to take what's mine  
We're searchin' for the latest thing, a break in this routine  
Talkin' some new kicks, ones like you ain't never seen  
  
This is home, (Ooh) this is Mean Street  
(This is) Yes-ah home, only one I know  
  
(This is home) See, a gun is real easy  
(This is Mean Street) in this desperate part of town  
(This is home) Turns you from hunted into hunter (Yeah)  
(This is Mean Street) You go an' hunt somebody down  
Wait a minute, ah (This is home) Somebody said "Fair warning", Lord  
(This is Mean Street) Lord, strike that poor boy down!

Forgive me father  
For I have sinned  
I've been through hell and back again  
Shook hands with the devil  
Looked him in the eye  
Looked like a long lost friend  
Anything you want  
Any dirty deeds  
He's got everything  
Except what I really need  
Keepin' me temporarily satisfied  
But not one thing I tried  
Filled me up inside  
Or felt like mine  
Mine, all mine  
Yeah, the search goes on  
The more I look  
My world keeps getting smaller  
Staring at the sun  
Searchin' for the light  
Almost ended up blinded  
Some only see  
What they want to see  
Claiming victory  
Oh, but that's not me  
Give me truth  
Give me something real  
I just want to feel  
Like it's  
Mine, all mine  
Oh really mine, all mine  
Come on give me something  
Something that's mine, all mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine  
All the words on the wall  
Look the same in the mirror  
Every riddle  
Every clue  
You got Allah in the east  
You got Jesus in the west  
Christ, what's a man to do?  
They'll find a cure for anything  
Just kill the pain  
Numb my brain  
We see a man  
Speaking the word of God  
Provin' to be a fraud  
His own church applauds  
Stop lookin' out  
Start lookin' in  
Be your own best friend  
Stand up and say  
Hey! This is mine  
All mine, all mine, all mine  
Baby, you got something  
And I got something  
And it's mine, all mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine  
Yes, I'm searching  
Mine, all mine  
Got to have it  
Mine, all mine  
Mine, all mine

Turn your radios on, I'll be a right there, yes I will  
Turn me up real loud, I'm in your ears, ah  
'N' I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave  
(Good God, y'all)  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
Oh yeah, one time  
Fire, fire, fire  
Lay your bodies down, I'm in your beds, your beds  
Pull your headphones on, I'm in your heads, ah  
'N' I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave  
(Good God, y'all)  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire  
[Repeat and fade]

I grabbed that telephone  
I thought we were alone  
Telling me there's company  
Your husband's comin' home  
I've been thinking about this Saturday night with you  
I've been thinking about it all week long  
And now I'm gonna lose it 'cause that  
Son-of-a-bitch got me singin' that same old song  
Got one foot out the door  
Tryin' to hit the road  
Ain't no match for your mean old man  
I think it's time to roll  
Got one foot out the door  
Got one foot out the door  
Think I'm gonna fight him?  
Don't you let him put down  
Put that to the floor  
Put the pedal to the metal  
And you beat it out of town  
No comin' back, back for more

Poor man, he just want a little  
Rich man, want a little bit more  
Superman, he looking for Lois  
Salesman, try and sell you his soul  
Fat man, he's ordering seconds  
Pizza man, just want to slice  
Badman, looking for attention  
A good man, he's hard to find  
Mailman, looking more like your daughter  
Straw man, don't have a leg to stand on  
Gay man, looking for another  
Candy man, yeah the candy man can  
Black man, he looking for justice  
White man, try to get a tan  
Woman, just want to fly in first class  
Holy man, take me to the promise land  
  
Everyone's looking for something  
Wanting their piece of the pie  
Searching for their slice of heaven  
I gotta have mine, yeah mine  
  
And you're the one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
Yeah, the one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
  
Boogieman, he giving me the creeps  
Sandman, kicking mud in your eye  
Piano man, in the mood for a melody  
Strongman, yeah he knows how to cry  
Ape man, ain't nobody's uncle  
A lucky man don't always know who they are  
Dead man, living for tomorrow  
Wise man, following a star  
  
Well I ain't saying I'm different  
Wanting my pie in the sky  
I'm just a little impatient  
Until I get mine, yeah mine  
  
And you're the one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
Yeah, yeah the one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
  
Yeah!  
The one I want!  
The one I want!  
  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
Yeah, yeah the one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
The only one I want (the one I want)  
Yeah, yeah the one I want (want)  
The only one I want (want)  
  
Yeah, the one I want (want)  
Want! Want! Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!  
  
Hey-hey-hey! Oh!  
Yeah!

I've heard it called by different names  
All over the world but it's all the same  
There are so many ways to make love  
A million ways I've been thinking of, oh yeah  
But there's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
So many things can get you high  
I'm gonna try 'em all just once before I die  
And you can analyze this situation  
To me it's all just mental masturbation  
But there's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock, yeah  
Check the hands on the clock it's 8:05, it's time to rock, F O  
And this world can disagree  
They don't understand how it can be  
And it's not my point of view, it's a fact  
We all know that it's true, oh yeah  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
Crank up the drums, and the bass  
Crank up my Les Paul in your face  
F O  

Now I know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened  
I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery  
Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it, so I followed it  
I'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles  
Into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Rooms without doors open for me, oh no  
Taking me miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome  
Oh man, I ain't got a clue, how you get out, or how to find this place  
I want my control back, but I'm afraid, I'll lose that feeling  
Lost in a world so far from home, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome  
  
Lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere  
Millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere  
Miles and miles and miles and miles, oh  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome, yeah  
Lost, lost
