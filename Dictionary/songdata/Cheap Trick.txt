You made me cry when you said good-bye.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
You broke my heart, now we're apart.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
Ah, yes you are,  
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.  
  
Ah!  
You made me cry when you said good-bye.  
Ain't that a shame...my tears fall like rain  
Ain't that a shame...you're the one to blame.

I'm in the right place just at the wrong time  
Oh, what am I gonna do?  
She left her name but she left no number  
Oh, what am I gonna do?  
  
I'm in the thick of it no one to turn to  
Let me explain [what I mean to do]  
Coming and going and going and coming  
I'm going to be coming the better I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
All I really wanna do is love you (ooh, ooh)  
Open up your heart and let me love you (ooh, ooh)  
I can't help it I can't stop it  
I can't keep my heart from saying  
All I really want to do is love you (ooh, ooh, ah yeah)  
  
I let her in but she couldn't stay well  
Oh what am I gonna do?  
I said the right thing just at the wrong time  
Don't know what I'm gonna do.  
  
Coming and going and going and coming  
I'm going to be coming the better I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(chorus repeat to fade)

You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Every night when I see your eyes  
You look like no other  
Even though the world has all kinds  
You can find friends and lovers  
  
[Chorus]  
Where have you been all my life?  
Why did you wait so long? (wait so long)  
I've been lookin' every night  
I'll be with you from now on  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
  
If you feel left out in the crowd  
You are not the only  
You can go where the music is loud  
And you won't be so lonely  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Hey, hey, hey  
You've got me all wound up and ready to go  
Ready to go

I hear voices inside my head  
All of them just want to talk to you  
I can feel your imagination  
Runnin' wild deep inside you know it's true  
This won't be a test of your religion  
You won't have to bang the bedroom walls  
Can you really hold and keep a secret  
I'll be right here anytime at all  
  
Anytime you want to call, call  
Anytime you want to come, come over  
Anytime you want to come, call  
Anytime you want to call, come over  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Well no one thinks that love lasts forever  
More than just a lonely day and night  
Never thought about the perfect answer  
But I've got a place where you can hide  
I can feel your lips all around me  
A wet kiss waitin' to explode  
  
Anytime you want to call, call  
Anytime you want to come, come over  
Anytime you want to come, call  
Anytime you want to call, come over  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
'Cause I need your love  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love  
Everyone inside my head wants to talk to you  
I can't eat I can't sleep  
Gotta leave nowhere to go  
Hidin' out oh no it's what I want  
Whatcha gonna do now  
'Cause I need your love  
I need your love

Sometimes I can tell early in the day  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny way  
When things aren't going right  
It looks like just another lonely night  
Wake me when it's over shake me when it's done  
Maybe when the sun comes up I'll find a place to run  
So don't lay there like a fool  
'cause all you have to do is call me  
  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
'travel 'round the world seen a million girls  
I know I've been around nothin' gets me down  
'cause there's someone out there just like you  
  
Someone's out there just like me too  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
Baby don't let it don't let it get ya  
Just say the word and I'll be your cover  
  
I'm gonna try to get there today  
Call me and tell me  
You don't need another day  
Lonely night (lonely tonight  
Sometimes I can tell you don't have to say  
  
Sometimes I can sense in an uncanny war  
When things aren't going right  
It looks like just another lonely  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight  
Well are you alone tonight  
Or are you lonely tonight  
Say you're lonely tonight

Au revoir, auf wiedersehen  
You won't see another morning  
You won't see another evening  
Good night  
  
Buenos noches o senor  
Senorita see ya later  
Buenos noches bye-bye  
There are many here among us  
  
You feel that life is a joke  
And for you we sing this final song  
For you there is no hope  
Sayonara oh suicide hari kari  
Kamikaze you won't  
See another evening  
  
Goodbye  
Bye-bye so long, farewell  
See you later, suicide  
Suicide  
Suicide  
Suicide

More and more I been thinkin' 'bout love  
Love ain't all I been thinkin' of  
Some people do and some people don't  
Some people will and say they won't  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
More and more I'm thinkin' 'bout s-s-sex  
The more I think the better it gets  
More and more I'm thinkin' bout s-s-sex  
The more I think the worse it gets  
  
But my baby loves to rock  
And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock

And my baby loves to roll  
My baby loves to all night long  
My baby loves to rock  
  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
In the morning, in the evening  
In the summer, in the winter  
In my car, in the night, in an airplane  
Not in russia!  
  
She loves to rock, she loves to rock  
She loves to rock, she loves to rock  
She loves to rock  
  
More and more I been thinkin' 'bout love  
Love ain't all I been thinkin' of

Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
'Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Then one day I hear you say hey  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
  
You buy a nickel you drop a dime  
Too much of nothin' every single time  
It's no surprise I've heard it all before  
I don't want to be your baby no more  
  
Don't want to be your slave no more  
I'll be last dog at your door  
'Cause I work so hard to get this far  
Don't want to be your baby no more no more no more  
  
Hidin' in the corner shoot what's goin' on  
Trouble down on Main Street can't get to a phone  
Problem after problem don't know what's the score  
I don't want to be your baby no more  
  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
Don't want to be your baby no more  
No more no more no more no more no more no more

Every night  
Caught up on the same old dream  
I hear your broken heart  
Crumbling down and haunting me  
And everyday  
Try to tell myself it ain't so hard  
But then I hear your name  
And it feels like a grip around my heart  
'till I change the way you feel  
'till I change the world  
So help me girl  
I'll show you wounds can heal  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell 'ya what I'm gonna do  
I'll be comin' back for you  
I'll move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
I'll be back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
  
Forget that girl  
She could never take your place  
It's hard enough  
When you look at me that way  
I know I was caught red-handed  
I wouldn't blame you if you twist the knife  
I swear I've come to my senses  
Tell me what to do  
Anyday I'll make it right  
I've got to change the way you feel  
If I have to I'll change the world  
So help me girl  
I'll beg borrow and steal  
If that's what it takes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
At 't-till make you believe me  
I'm prepared to make any sacrifice  
The shadow of our love keeps gettin' bigger  
Without your love I'll sure die  
  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
I keep comin' back for you  
I'll move the mountains  
Part the sea  
Anything for you  
I'll be back 'n blue back 'n blue  
  
Back 'n blue  
So help me girl  
Beg borrow and steal  
If that's what it takes  
I'll be back 'n blue back 'n blue  
I'm prepared to make any sacrifice  
Back 'n blue  
Back 'n blue  
So help me girl

When the moon came up  
And the sun went down  
All I could see was a national frown  
It was pounded flesh  
And harder than steel  
Pretty in pink that's just how I feel  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend  
If you wanna be with me I'll be there til the end  
Til the end of time and time again  
Just leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah yeah  
Cause I'm my best friend now  
Cause I'm my best friend now  
  
All I got is might and will  
If all I got is might and will  
Can't slow down cause down we'll go  
Where I stop you don't wanna know  
Round and round and round we'll go  
Where I stop is where I wanna go  
Go go go go  
Where I wanna be is where I wanna go  
  
Lofty thoughts and high ideals  
Lofty skirts is what appeals  
This baby is no baby ruth  
He was too smart for her  
She was so damned cute  
I'm sick and tired can't be late  
So damn mad I can't keep straight  
Time and time and time again  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah  
Leave me alone cause I'm my best friend yeah  
  
I'm my best friend yeah

It's not the way you look no-no  
It's not the way you walk  
Your eyes are somethin' good  
You know they're clear and bright  
It's not the color of your hair  
  
Big eyes  
I keep falling for those  
Big eyes  
They keep calling my name  
  
You're such a losin' cause  
Who says you write the laws  
Why don't you go get lost  
Who says you write the laws  
Go on get out of here  
  
Big eyes

Run out of money and runnin' out of luck  
Run into problem I never, never thought of  
It seems like I didn't run out of my dreams  
But we've got each other and tonight we're gonna leave  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles tonight  
  
A broken promise is a broken dream  
We've all had so many, too many for me  
Impossible to have freedom when things aren't free  
But we've got each other and tonight we're gonna leave  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles and hide  
  
To the borderline  
Leave our troubles tonight  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles  
Leavin' all our troubles  
At the borderline  
  
I want to go, I want to go  
Oh I'll go anywhere  
I want to go, I want to go away from here  
Is all I really care  
  
Runnin' away from the girl of my dreams  
Runnin' away from a life of broken dreams  
  
To the borderline  
Leavin' all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles tonight  
  
To the borderline  
Leave all our troubles behind  
At the borderline  
Forget all our troubles  
Leavin' all our troubles  
At the borderline  
  
At the borderline

You've been coming  
You've made it easy  
You've said just the thing  
  
Now I can't hold on  
To these words  
Don't mean that much to me  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
  
It's my sunset  
My sun's set  
  
Never thought it's come to this  
Now it seems the only way, to do it right  
Never thought it'd come to this  
Just can't hold on, oh no  
  
Feel out in the cold  
No one to turn to  
There's no way out  
Just can't hold on  
  
It's my sunset  
My sun will set  
  
I've been gone, gone, gone  
Can't hold on

  
Hey, little ladies, there's some cool young dude  
just standin' in line waitin' for you.  
There's a girl in the corner with a jacked up dress,  
she's got legs for miles, but her face is a mess.  
  
There's always somethin' for ev'ryone, but a love can be suicide.  
It's just what you've been waiting for, and I know it can't be denied, Yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreaming of?  
Who's that falling into love, who?  
Is it you I'm thinkin' of?  
  
Hey, rock'n rollers, what's a happ'nin' with you?  
Well, you've got the itch well, I've got it, too.

but I know you can take it, you can make it alright.  
  
It's time that you just can't hide, but I can't control myself.  
I know what you've been waitin' for, 'cause love can't be denied, yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreaming of?  
Who's that falling into love, who?  
Yeah, it's you I'm thinkin' of?  
  
There's always somethin' for ev'ryone, and I know what you mean in my eyes.  
I just can't control myself and I fall for it ev'ry time, oh, yeah.  
Can't stop fallin' into love.  
What's my heart been dreamin' up?  
No matter what I think or do or say,

'cause I'm here cryin'  
Don't have no pity, baby

And don't think I ever think about you with another man  
And don't think I care about you, honey  
You just don't understand  
That's why I say  
  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try  
Can't stop it but I'm gonna try

From the first time that I met you  
Till the last time that we talked

It's not the same anymore  
Let's face it, we've changed, yeah yeah

It was a masquerade at Mardi Gras  
That was the only trip that I recall  
Every time I turned around at all  
There was you  
  
Some days are easier said than done  
Always expecting something's wrong  
I'd rather live alone than drag this on  
  
Take your time, please lay your hands on me  
Don't wanna be alone, oh no  
A mask behind the face and then you're gone  
Oh,yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone  
You're on your own  
  
I've got a kaleidoscope of memories  
Visions of you locked up inside of me  
Can't you see  
  
We once collided like a broken wheel  
So undecided what was real  
Maybe a crash somehow has sex appeal  
Whatever turns you on  
  
Take your time- please lay your hands on me  
Don't wanna be alone, oh no  
A mask behind a face and then you're gone  
Oh yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone  
  
One down, one to go  
Oh no, playin' in a carnival  
Your time is gone  
  
One down- one to go  
Oh no, playin' in a carnival  
You're all alone  
  
One down, one to go  
Oh no, you're on your own

I want to be punished with you  
I know what you're goin' through  
You gave me a fatal bite  
I want to spend my time with you, you, you  
  
Don't you make our love a crime  
Please don't make our love a crime  
If you do we'll all regret it in time  
So don't you make our love a crime  
  
I know what you're goin' through  
It's happened to me once before  
And I know what you're gonna do  
I want to spend some time with you  
It's stronger than it was before  
And I've saved it up for you, you, you  
  
Don't you make our love a crime  
So please don't make our love a crime  
If you do we'll all regret it in time  
So don't you make our love a crime  
A crime, no

The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
You know that talk is cheap  
And rumors ain't nice  
And when I fall asleep  
I don't think I'll survive  
  
The night the night  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police  
They come to me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me  
Oh no  
  
Well I can't tell lies  
'Cause they're listening to me  
And when I fall asleep  
Bet they're spying on me tonight,  
Tonight  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
I try to sleep  
They're wide awake  
They won't let me alone  
They don't get paid to take vacations  
Or let me alone  
They spy on me  
I try to hide  
They won't let me alone  
They persecute me  
They're the judge and jury all in one  
  
'Cause they're waiting for me  
Looking for me  
Every single night  
(They're) driving me insane  
Those men inside my brain  
  
The dream police  
They live inside of my head  
The dream police they come  
To me in my bed  
  
The dream police  
They're coming to arrest me

It's 5 o'clock, I think I'll find my way downtown  
I try to turn my mind off, but I don't know how  
  
Let me dream the night, dream the night away  
Don't make me dream the night, dream the night away  
  
How can I help but hate the way I feel?  
Make sense of memories that won't make them real?  
  
Whoa!  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
Sometimes the love you make can break your heart  
Just when it seems so easy, then it all falls apart  
  
I feel so helpless when I think of you  
I never said those things I thought you knew  
  
Hey!  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
(You got to dream the night)  
  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
Dream the night, dream the night away  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Years ago, our love was told  
Reminded those of love  
Like in a storybook  
  
Now we're fighting every day  
This ain't love, This is hate  
Get it straight  
Take a break  
Storybook  
  
Years ago our love was told  
Reminisced and kissed  
The fifties flame  
So we've been told  
Now we're fighting every day  
This ain't love  
This is hate  
Get it straight  
Take a break

Pretty pictures of the queens themselves  
You had my 8 by ten on your shelf  
You sold me cheap  
And I cried for help  
  
You stayed with us through thick and thin  
You sat and watched with Quaalude and gin  
And clapped a lot  
  
Were you there  
When we were almost crucified and died  
A thousand deaths?  
No?  
Well, thanks a lot  
  
4 kings with an army strong  
You knew the words to all our songs  
You stayed with us all night long  
  
Pretty pictures of the queens themselves  
You had my 8 by ten on your shelf  
You sold me cheap  
And I cried for help  
Well thanks a lot

I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
I'm right on time  
For tonight's the night  
I need your love  
Oh yeah  
  
Caught in the act  
Had no alibi, no reason why  
To let you down, oh  
Stabbed in the back  
Though it hurt i let you go  
Will you take me back, oh  
What was right went wrong, oh  
It's alright to put the blame on me  
For after all blame it on my last affair  
It's alright, it takes two to make it love  
'cause love can be just a four letter word  
A four letter word  
  
I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
I'm right on time  
For tonight's the night  
I need your love  
  
Day turns to night  
I was wrong and you were right  
I feel like Mr. Hyde not Dr. J  
Sometimes I'm not myself  
I must be somebody else  
To jeopardize your love  
What went wrong was right, oh  
It's alright to put the blame on me  
For after all blame it on my last affair  
It's alright, it takes two to make it love  
'cause love can be just a four letter word  
  
I got a one track mind  
I got a twisted heart  
I need a lesson in love  
  
(thank you!)

Well the streets are all crowded  
Lots of people around  
And there's music playing  
But I can't hear a sound  
  
Just the sound of the rain  
Falling silently down  
Livin' ain't been livin'  
Since you put down  
  
Yeah, life goes on around me every day  
But it might as well be half a million miles away  
It's like a ghost town without your love  
Like a ghost town without your love  
  
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?  
It's a ghost town until you come back to me  
oh, oh, till you come back to me  
  
Well I wish I still had you  
Had you here next to me  
Baby, where did you go?  
Baby, why did you leave?  
  
Though the world, it keeps turnin'  
But it don't turn for me  
Without you in my life  
My life ain't no place to be  
  
There's only lonely days and empty nights  
Ain't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' right  
Darlin', I want to leave this town  
Don't want to be around  
  
I'm gonna leave this town

Don't call me baby  
Don't call me your inspiration  
Don't call me jealous  
I don't need you  
Don't try to use me  
You can use your own imagination  
Just a little bit of information before I leave you  
  
You gotta go for the throat (you can use your own imagination)  
You gotta do it alone (just a little bit of information)  
I am what I am (you can use your own imagination)  
When I go for the throat  
  
Don't try to please me  
You just give me idle conversation  
Doesn't give me any indication or reason  
Don't try to use me  
You can use your own imagination  
Must be some sort of explanation or reason  
  
And I go for the throat (you just give me idle conversation)  
And I do it alone (you can use your own imagination)  
And I am what I am (must be some sort of explanation)  
When I go for the throat  
  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
  
Get a grip on yourself try to do it in time  
Gotta say to yourself  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
  
I can't stand it no more (you can use your own imagination)  
I go for the throat (just a little bit of information)  
I do it alone (you just give me idle conversation)  
I am what I am (you can use your own imagination)  
'cause I go for the throat (must be some sort of explanation)  
I can't stand it no more (you can use your own imagination)  
I am what I am (just a little bit of information)  
I do it alone (you just give me idle conversation)

I am what I am (just a little bit of information)  
I do it alone (you just give me idle conversation)

Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Ambition? ha!  
If all i've heard is true,  
There's nothin' much i can do  
To change the world, it's irreversible.  
But in what it lacks,  
It's got a taste that smacks of somethin' irresistible.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
  
Submission? yes!  
Now i won't name names, and a secret's a secret,  
But a hint's a hint or a clue.  
You really want to know, you really want to go,  
There's only two things you got to do.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
  
Mother, mother.  
Mother, mother.  
Mother, mother.  
  
My mission? ah, yes!  
Everybody hear? everybody here,  
It's a fate i all agree.  
Sometimes you win, i never lose,  
To me it's no mystery.  
  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.  
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell.

Some girls do some girls don't  
Don't mean type don't mean smoke  
Lay me down can't seem to sleep  
My mind's been thinkin' real deep  
(bridge 1)  
All my thoughts are runnin wild out of control-outta my mind  
[Chorus:]  
'cause good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
Late at night when she comes out  
The lady moves prowls the town  
A perfect match of looks and charm  
Where she goes it's light and dark  
She's so hot I burn my tongue when I kiss her lips she turns me on  
Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
(solo)  
Made my choice made it well had my pick of heaven or  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven all bad girls go everywhere they like  
Good girls they've got manners bad girls got what matters  
Good girls leave at home bad girls come with the singer  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere that they like

Would you like to, would you like to,  
Would you like to do a number with me?  
  
Cheap trick says goodnight!

I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I'm telling all the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
When I dream of you  
All my dreams come true  
You are my night, my day  
I'm lost when you're away  
Can you hear my heart  
It's calling you (it's calling you)  
Oh girl, oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I'm telling all the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I thought you'd like to know  
You've heard this all before  
So even if I'm wrong  
I'm right where I belong  
Can't you hear my heart  
It's calling you (it's calling you)  
Oh girl, oh little girl  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to tell the world  
That you're my little girl  
You know I must be mad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
I've wasted all this time  
You know that I'm so glad  
Just to have your love  
  
I had to make you mine  
I had to make you mine

I've had enough, I'm tired of waiting  
The time has come to pass  
Why do you do what you do to me  
Why can't you say what you want to say  
  
Is it not worth investigating  
I thought (i'd been harassed)  
Why do you go if you want to stay  
How will I know what you mean to say  
Undoubtedly I'm all over you  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not that easy baby  
It's not that hard to tell  
It's not that easy baby  
Life is hell but I'm doing fine.  
It's hard to tell  
  
I'm not good at contemplating  
The odds are it won't last  
Why do you do what you do to me  
When will I hear what I want to hear  
  
Been so long anticipating  
You put me to the test  
Why won't you say what you want to say  
How will I know if you mean to stay  
Undeniably I'm all over you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We'll now preside to file  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's hard to tell  
I do it well  
It's hard to tell  
Hard to tell

Down the line, don't go over  
There's a limit, you went over  
So much time, time runs out  
Time ran out, make it down  
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?  
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Downed the line, couldn't get much  
Couldn't get much, higher if you tried  
And tried and tried, you're as guilty  
It's the crime, oh, oh, it's a crime  
  
You can never come down, you can never come down  
You can never come down, you can never come down  
Down inside-you're getting nervous  
You've never been this high before, oh no

I will believe  
What I want to believe  
Nobody needs  
To do my thinkin' for me  
I know the score, I'm always out of line  
It's as if I was born in the wrong place in time  
And nobody understands just what's in my mind  
But when I face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Speak your mind  
You know you've got the right  
You're not afraid  
You're goin' with me tonight  
Everybody stops, they whisper and stare  
"'Cause tonight we're free to do  
The things they wouldn't dare  
But they will never know  
The little secrets we share  
And when you squeeze my hand  
I know you understand  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
In a world only for lovers and fools  
Schemers and dreamers  
Who don't follow the rules  
We gotta run  
Our legs are still young  
We gotta run  
Until our heaven comes  
And when we face the light  
Somehow it all seems right  
(Don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
(don't) you know it feels like  
Heaven's falling  
Down on me  
And I can hear the  
Angels calling  
Calling me  
Heaven's falling, down on me  
Angels calling, calling me  
Angels calling, calling me  
Angels calling, calling me

It's been a long time, baby  
High priest of rhythmic noise  
Living inside of me  
I been goin' round in circles  
And I've considered first degree  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song don't change the choir won't sin  
Won't sing the same song forever  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
You look strange, that's what I like  
You look strange like me  
Fit to be tied, a little bedtime story  
Next position please  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song don't change the choir won't sing  
Won't sing the same song forever  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(i'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Forever is a long long time  
If you can...  
I'm a ...little tiny plastic pills  
From my little plastic pills  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(I'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(i'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)

Jump in my love car  
Don't have to go very far  
Just far enough to show you a thing or two  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you  
  
I'm in the mood for love  
You're all I'm thinking of  
I'll make you feel alright when we're alone  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller, is that you?  
I knew you'd be here tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I'll take real good care of you  
I'll tuck you in tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you

We had a special way of talkin'  
Oh, a language all our own  
We always knew the latest dances  
But we liked old-fashioned love  
Now something seems the matter  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
  
I don't have a lot of patience  
When someone's lit my fuse  
So don't you try to reason  
Me, I don't want no excuse, no!  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
  
You (you)  
Don't (don't)  
Play (play)  
By the rules  
I (I)  
Won't (don't)  
Love here anymore  
  
You don't want to play by the rules  
(you don't want to play by the rules)  
'cause I don't want to love here anymore  
(I don't want to love here anymore)

I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate those friends  
  
That fat cat frank got a heart of gold  
He's got a head of lead, he's young but he acts old  
That limp wristed two-fisted diplomat  
Better draw a map, to see where he's at  
Around and round when he rambles on  
'bout the latest deal we should be in on  
We shouldn't give him the time of day  
He doesn't give a damn if we sink or swim  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
Did some toot, yeah we had a blow  
Look man, no holes, real nose  
When he says hi he really means the moon  
He was there long before armstrong  
He stays loose, he says, fill her up  
For eternal youth from those swiss docs.  
He's thirty but he feels like sixteen  
Check it out: yep, hundred-n-sixteen!  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey, let's dance  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
Let's see, there's miss tique and miss informed  
General disaster, mister know-it-all  
Missus a lot and private stock  
Corporal punishment 'bout to blow his mind  
Mister mock, mister completely,  
Miss de plot, miss story,  
Mister call, mister de gaulle,  
The aging mister martin and that ain't all  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate those friends  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
I love you honey but they'll be the end of me  
Oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
  
I love you honey but i hate your friends  
They love your money  
But they'll be the end of me, oh yeah  
I love you honey but i hate your friends

You must be dreamin'  
You think I love you  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
  
I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
Goin' down down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
You must be dreamin'  
To think I love you  
  
Yeah you had me once  
Oh once and maybe twice  
Gonna break your heart  
Let you down down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
When I (take it up) again  
Now I'm out on a limb  
I know I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
  
Oh my God god  
Down down down down down  
  
You must be dreamin  
To think I love you  
  
Gotta get out of here  
If I'm gonna last  
I know I'm losin' fast  
I'm goin' down for the count  
  
Couldn't face the day  
I couldn't face another night  
I'm sick of this shit  
You bring me down down down  
  
When I (take it up) again  
Now I'm out on a limb  
I know I'll never do it again  
There I've said it again  
Really mean it this time  
Goin' down down down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You must be dreamin'  
You must be dreamin'  
You must be dreamin'  
(to coda)

I need love  
There's nothing to do  
Don't need better  
Like a kick in the head  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
Our eyes met  
In the evening  
Now I want to see you everyday  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
I need love  
  
I need love  
As much as you do  
Don't need better  
Like a kick in the head  
No doubt about it  
You're an angel  
And little angel  
This is what I say  
I want to you hold you  
I want you to touch my hand  
Don't think about it  
For a minute  
'Cause there's no time like now  
I need love

I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
I don't like living inside  
This metal plastic shell  
It's no way to treat your help  
They'll tell you go to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
Faster master  
I've got better things which I can do  
Hey I don't like livin' in this fleshy human shell  
As much as I abuse it, it's really gone to hell  
  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
I want be man  
  
I'd rather be a robot  
So I don't have to think  
'cause then I could be programmed  
Where I don't have to dream  
I'd rather be a man  
Instead of a machine  
Flesh and blood life and death  
It's a mystery  
Nothing to be programmed  
Nothing is for sure  
And least there's a reason  
A reason for my life  
I want be man  
You want be me  
  
I want to live in your body (hey)

Going to write a three act play  
So I can be with you  
Produce, direct, and also act  
But who will I cast as you?  
  
I'm gonna find her, I'm gonna find her  
It won't be easy but I don't care  
I'll go to London, new york or Hollywood  
I'll search the world for a girl  
  
I want you  
I don't want nobody else  
I want you  
I should have known it all along  
I want you  
Just tell me when and where  
I want you  
Why don't you just give me a call?  
  
She went west so religiously  
She took a vow  
Not to return until she learned  
What to do and how  
  
I'm gonna find her, I'm gonna find her  
It won't be easy but I don't care  
I'll go to London, new york or Hollywood  
I'll search the world for a girl  
Exactly like you  
Uh huh, I'd rather have you, oh yeah

If I could then I would  
But I can't so I ask  
Cause I really wasn't ready for you  
  
If I knew what you knew  
Shouldn't do what I do  
Cause I really wasn't ready for you (thinkin' of you)  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least I'll never have to see you cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
If I am what I am  
And it's all that I can  
I mighta had some pity for you  
  
What I choose  
What I ooze  
What I bet  
Win or lose  
But I'd still be waitin' on you  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least you'll never have to see me cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The more I think about  
The less it matters  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The less I think about  
The more it matters  
  
As I go 'round the world  
And I stop in the whirl  
As I whirlwind the world  
With you-oou-ou-ou-ou  
  
If I could then I would  
But I can't so I ask  
Cause I wasn't really ready for you  
  
I wasn't ready to say goodbye  
But goodbye was ready for me  
Least you'll never have to see me cry  
Cryin' is over for me  
  
Who's cryin' now  
The more I think about  
The less that matters

Ah  
Ah  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want my love you got it  
When you need my love you got it  
I won't hide it  
I won't throw your love away, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I thought you were a mystery girl  
A special girl in this crazy old world  
You couldn't see me when I laid eyes on you  
  
'Cause lonely is only a place  
You don't know what it's like  
You can't fight it  
It's a hole in my heart, in my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You hold the secrets of love in this world  
I'm hypnotized by your every word  
A special face, a special voice  
A special smile in my life  
  
'Cause lonely is only a place  
You don't know what it's like  
You can't fight it  
It's a hole in my heart, in my heart  
  
[Chorus x3]

Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
You got me burnin', burnin' with desire,  
You got me burnin', burnin' like a fire, oh yeah.  
  
You got me thinkin', thinkin' what I'll do,  
No doubt about it, I want it with you.  
Though you're not my first love,  
You just might be my last.  
My heart is poundin' like a drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, yeah.  
Tonight will be the first night that I've been in love with you.  
You get me so excited, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.  
Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to.  
Tonight is all I really want, I really want from you.  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight, I'll be with you tonight.  
Tonight, tonight.  
  
Everything about you is more than everything  
You make me crazy, I'm doin' crazy things, oh yeah.  
Tonight when I first saw you I knew it had to be,  
Why'd you have to be so right for me?  
Though you're not my first love, you just might be my last.  
My heart is poundin' like a drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, yeah.  
Tonight will be the first night that I've been in love with you.  
You get me so excited, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.  
Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to.  
Tonight is all I really want, I really want from you.  
Tonight, from you, from you.

Oh, tonight, be with ya, I'll be with ya, I'll be with ya, I'll be with ya
tonight, tonight.  
  
I'll be with ya.

Going down the road with a friend or two  
Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do  
You thought you'd seen it all, you ain't seen nothing new  
Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do  
  
I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller  
And I can't control myself  
  
Big city, big lights can see it up ahead  
No one can stop me, I'm driving in your head  
Make a name for myself and I'll be number one  
And I'll turn around and turn around and know that I', the one  
  
I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller  
And I can't control myself  
I can really rock, really rock 'n' roll  
And I can't control myself  
  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am

I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am

Lonely days and lonely nights  
Seeming so much longer with the phone lines  
Torn between decisions wrong or right  
Ooh I wish I knew the stars tonight  
'cause you could look around and see  
The moving pictures of my mind's eye  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
There we meet at some forgotten point  
On the streets of new york or was it london town  
Maybe we were daydreaming out loud  
Or maybe we nowhere  
It doesn't matter now 'cause  
You mean more to me than any hope or any dream  
I know now  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
  
When I say I miss you then I mean that I need you  
When I say I need you then I mean that I miss you now  
  
It's only loveit's a miracle  
It's a wonder  
It's only loveit's a miracle

To be back home  
No no no no no no no no

There is somewhere, someplace  
In this world I want to take you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
I am one boy, one boy in a thousand  
That wants to make you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
If you're hiding and I'm hiding  
From some bum that wants to get you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
If you're lonely and I'm lonely  
And I'm near you I can hear you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
Sea over yonder when the rights are read your name-ah  
You search for the riddle to the clue the river she came  
Look out on the land to the south  
To the east three said-ah  
Cancel Colorado in the march  
By request  
Don't go on the look out of a whim  
Aye she said

Love comes 'round just in time  
Something that's hard to find  
Oh, no one knows what i've been goin' through  
Same old song, how does it go?  
Same old line, is it all we know?  
And love comes 'round  
In time to rescue me  
  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Just in time  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
  
Love comes 'round just in time  
Something that's hard to find  
Oh kiss me now  
You know i want you to  
  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Just in time  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Yes it does  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
  
Sometimes it slips on in slowly  
Sometimes it makes itself lonely  
Under the cover of darkness  
Sometimes it feels oh so heartless  
Oh love! (love comes around)  
  
Save my heart  
Love comes around (love comes around)  
(love comes around) yes it does  
Love comes to save my heart (save my heart)  
Oh love!  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)  
Love comes around  
Love comes to save my heart

Tell you a story not a little white lie  
Wasn't long tall sally it was no surprise  
That's right, tell me that's right  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news  
That night, tell me that's right  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down, oh yeah yeah  
  
All shook up and bent out of shape  
Wasn't Johnny B. Goode but it sounded great  
That night, tell me that's right  
From the cabaret to the highway of hell  
Had a monkey on his back it was easy to tell  
That night, tell me that's right  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah yeah  
  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
Love comes a-tumblin' down oh yeah!  
  
I'm wishing to live longer aided by the supreme healing force of music  
It most definitely overcomes all weakening aspects of the body  
I've felt quite lost and distraught without those wonderful vinyl productions  
I'm convinced it's an addiction, too. I feel just great again  
(band, get ready)  
  
When you see the train come  
Then you'll know what to do  
A tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
That's right, tell me that's right  
(love came) a-stumblin' and a-tumblin' down  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
That night, tell me that's right  
  
The band was singin' and playin' a tune  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Tough act to follow not too good in your shoes  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
You see the train come you know what to do  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Johnny b. goode it sounded just great  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Long tall sally it was no surprise  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
A whole lotta shakin' was terrible news  
(love comes a-tumblin')  
Not a pretty picture when the body was found  
(love comes a tumblin')  
Mama mama mama mama

Some girls are so fine, sister sister  
Don't wanna change your mind but  
Some girls run home so optimistic  
About the love in their lives  
  
See the girls on parade  
In high-fashion magazines  
And like some x-rated movie  
Oh, that fashion on the screen  
Enough for everyone to see  
I know that she's not ever going back again  
  
Well some girls you meet and  
Then you kissed her and she taste so sweet  
This girl, you find out, looks like her sister  
Yeah she's been coming around  
I see her backfield's in motion  
She puts me under her spell  
She's got some weird magic potion  
Some concrete cloud over you  
And I know it's burnin' hell  
I know that she's not ever going back again  
You see one, she's coming with her new-found friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
And she's not ever going back again  
You see one, she's coming with her new-found friend  
  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Oh love me for a minute, stay with me tonight  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
I'll show you what it's like on the other side of love  
Take me in your arms and hold me  
Oh bye, bye, bye, bye baby bye bye  
I wanna be your lover, baby  
Bye, bye, bye, bye baby bye bye  
I love you like I own you, baby

Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me  
  
You're not the first one  
You're not the last one  
You're not even the in between  
You've got the power, this is your hour  
You crawl through Harlem  
On your hands and knees  
It's not the way you look  
The way you walk and the color of your hair  
It's not the way you look  
The way you talk and the color of your hair  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me  
  
Well there is something I feel about you  
A feelin' that just won't let go  
Well in an hour, you have the power  
The power of love over me  
It's not the way you look  
The way you walk and the color of your hair (no)  
It's not the way you look  
The way you talk and the color of your hair  
  
Then you threw it away, you threw it all away  
As you walked right out the door  
You threw it away, you threw it all away  
As you walked right out the door  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
  
It's got a hold on me  
It's got a hold on me  
It's got a hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on me  
  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me  
Your love has got me  
It's got a hold on me, a hold on me

I, I can hear you laughing  
You're a million miles away or you're here  
I, I will never leave you  
I'm a million miles away or I'm near  
I, I, the thoughts you're thinking  
But you're a lifetime away from your home or you're here  
I, I can see you crying  
You're a million miles away or you're here  
Look at me like I look at you  
Think of me like I think of you  
Speak to me like I speak to you  
Dream of me like I dream of you  
I, I can hear you thinking  
You're a million thoughts away  
I, I'm the dreams you're dreaming  
I'm a million dreams away or I'm here  
We can go down slowly like the rain  
I could leave and be with you again, oh  
I could be your lover, let's pretend

It's just a ball of dust  
Underneath my feet  
It rolls around the sun  
Doesn't mean that much to me  
  
I take a chance on the edge of life  
Just like all the rest  
I look inside and dig it out  
Cause there's no points for second best  
  
There's a raging fire in my heart tonight  
Growing higher and higher in my soul  
There's a raging fire in the sky tonight  
I want to ride on the silver dove  
Far into the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Till I make you take me  
On your mighty wings  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky  
Take me on your mighty wings  
Take me on your mighty wings tonight  
  
With just a little luck  
A little cold blue steel  
I cut the night like a razor blade  
Till I feel the way I want to feel  
  
There's a raging fire in my heart tonight  
Growing higher and higher in my soul  
There's a raging fire in the sky tonight  
I want to ride on the silver dove  
Far into the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky  
  
Take me on your mighty wings  
Take me on your mighty wings tonight  
On your mighty wings  
  
Make you take me  
On your mighty wings across the sky

You changed your view  
Cause what you see  
Is black and blue  
  
White on the left  
Black on the right  
Nothing seems to fit  
On a new york night  
Have you heard the news  
Are you talking to me  
I said "hey there honey do you like what you see"  
  
Read about it, it never fails  
We don't doubt it, it's in the mail  
So you want to be in my gang  
You'd better think it through  
Yeah you want to be in my gang  
You have to pay your dues  
  
We sleep at night  
On a bed of nails  
All i know  
Baby's got some thrills  
  
White on the left  
Black on the right  
Nothing seems to fit  
On a new york night  
Have you heard the news  
Are you talking to me  
I said "hey there honey do you like what you see"  
  
Read about it, it never fails  
We don't doubt it, it's in the mail  
So you want to be in my gang  
You'd better think it through  
Yeah you want to be in my gang  
You have to pay your dues

Pour out your heart  
The feelings never fade away  
So where are you now  
I loved you more than I can say  
You wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true  
  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession  
All the things we did  
What's left is just a photograph  
Everything I held so close  
Was never meant to last  
  
You're in my heart  
It's never gonna fade away  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession  
  
If I could find all the dreams I've made  
I'd turn the clock back to yesterday  
To hold onto what I got with you  
Shine bright like all the stars  
Unlock every dream I've made  
I'd turn tomorrow into yesterday  
All the things we did  
  
What's left is just a photograph  
You wouldn't see couldn't touch can't believe it's true  
Your love feels like home  
You're my obsession

No one believes me  
Someone conceived me  
A fluke in the night of obscurity  
Played by millions simulcast by a few  
A city no lights such a great view  
It's all very strange it's the name of the game  
  
It's all the same it's never gonna change  
It's the name of the game  
Over and over and over again  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over again  
Love is the name of the game  
  
Come around and see me analyze or analogy  
I'll give you a clue what you really need  
If things get bad then things can get worse  
Remember "surrender" remember the verse  
It's all very strange it's the name of the game  
It's all the same it's never gonna change  
  
It's the name of the game  
Over and over and over again  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over again  
Love is the name of the game  
  
I say hold on tight  
Say hey you're doin' it right  
As i wish for a full dream flight  
Night after night i'm a knight  
Over and over and over and over  
And over and over again  
  
Time after time after time  
Over and over and over and over  
Love is the name of the game  
And then it came to me  
It's just a game to me  
Love is the name of the game

Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
Fell apart, broke my heart, need your love, need your love  
If I could go around the world  
I couldn't find another girl, need your love  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
  
You make me lonely  
Why should you care  
I give you everything  
That's hardly fair  
I give you lovin'  
It's what you need  
I give you everything  
Everything in me  
It might surprise you  
But that's not the reason  
  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
Fell apart, broke my heart, need your love, need your love  
If I could go around the world  
I couldn't find another girl, need your love  
Need your love, need your love, need your love, need your love  
  
You make me lonely  
Why should you care  
I give you everything  
That's hardly fair  
I give you lovin'  
It's what you need  
I give you everything  
Everything in me  
It might surprise you  
But that's not the reason  
  
Need your love

I don't need no money, honey  
Fortune and fame  
'Cause I got all the riches, baby  
That one man can claim  
So take off your coat and close the door  
Forget about your pride  
I'm not afraid of falling down  
Or staying up all night  
You're gonna see it my way now  
Don't try to bring me down  
My life's a circus, an insane chain of circumstances  
  
I never had a lot to lose  
I never let it slow me down  
I never had a lot of love now, honey  
Never had a lot to lose  
  
I can't explain the time it takes  
To make you understand  
I know you'll get to like it  
If you only get the chance  
I hope I get some time tonight  
To see you comin' 'round  
What can I give you in return  
For one night on the town  
My life's a circus, an insane chain of circumstances  
  
But not till daylight, not till daylight, not to daylight  
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight,  
Daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight  
  
I tried to tell you  
It's a pain you can't hide  
My life's a circus  
An insane chain of circumstances  
  
I never had a lot of love  
I never had too much money  
I never let it slow me down now, honey  
I never had a lot to lose

People all over the world  
They get up they get down  
They get in they get out  
They get pushed, they go back  
Start all over again  
Till they get to the end  
  
I'm from a small town  
Had a poor family  
Mama was sick, papa worked the factory  
I led a rich life  
Never had to work hard  
House in the country  
Horses in my backyard  
  
Next position please  
Do I have to get down on my knees  
Next position please  
I'm in a hurry, so hurry please  
  
Read between the lines  
Learn a new message  
Read the latest book  
It's a new twist  
Be the first one to have a new ideal  
You'll never get bored with mirrors on the ceiling  
  
Next position please  
Do I have to get down on my knees  
Next position please  
I'm in a hurry, so hurry please  
  
People all over the world  
They get up they get down  
They get in they get out  
They get pushed, they go back  
Start all over again  
Till they get to the end  
  
I want to move up within the company  
I can do better with an opportunity  
Why don't they use me instead of abuse me?  
I'm ten out of ten, not some whore in some movie  
I want to be the biggest gun in the world  
I want to see the tits on every girl  
  
Next position please  
You have to get down on your knees  
Next position please  
I'm in a hurry, so hurry please

Bye bye, love, goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
I'll see you on the other side  
  
Hurry on, home to bed  
O Claire, you're much younger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire, it's so lonely when you're not there  
Anyone can take me where  
The places, they weren't there, O Claire  
  
I hear your heart from here  
But now you're much stronger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
I swear, gone a place beyond compare  
So lonely when you're not there  
I can step to watch and stare, O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something 'tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love, goodbye  
O my love, goodbye  
  
Hurry on home to bed  
Claire you're much stronger  
Than I'd ever hoped to be  
  
O Claire, the nights when you're not there  
Is more than I can bear  
Something only we can share, O Claire  
  
Just between the two of us  
Something 'tween the two of us  
Is more than just the two of us  
Just between the two of us  
O my love, goodbye  
O my love, goodbye  
  
Bye bye, love, goodbye

O my love  
  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
See you on the other side  
Bye bye, love, goodbye  
I'll see you on the other side

Oh Candy why did you do it  
You should've called me on the telephone  
I didn't expect for you call me  
'Cause I didn't think that you were alone  
So alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, Candy worked so hard  
At doin' what he thought was right  
It really, really doesn't mean a thing  
Oh, Candy worked so hard  
At doin' what he thought was right  
It really, really doesn't mean a thing  
  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
You didn't stick a needle in your vein  
You just got so damned depressed  
We all liked you except yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You, you won't be comin' around no more  
You, you won't be comin' around no more  
Oh Candy why did you do it  
I didn't think you heard a word that I said.

On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
It's what they're playing  
When the radio's on and you  
And me get crazy  
  
Hey, mister on the radio  
Please play my favorite song  
The one where she didn't go away  
Hey, mister on the radio  
You're really my best friend  
Please play my favorite song for me  
Hey, mister on the radio  
You're with me every day  
  
And late at night I turn you on  
On the radio  
I love the music  
On the radio  
It's what they're playing  
When the radio's on and you  
And me get crazy  
All of the rock and roll dj's  
Got their fingers on the world  
'cause they play the songs  
That make you and me feel so good  
Turn up your radios  
And hear the music  
  
On the radio  
This song is playin'  
When the radio's on  
And you and me get crazy  
Radio DJ monologue  
  
One minute the back side of midnight it's me captain gonzo  
Ready to roll hot wax anything you want to hear  
All night its a balmy 73 degrees in fog city,  
71 in the valley 80 in Santa Cruz, but remember if you snooze you lose  
I'm gonna hang with you, I'll crank it on  
So let me know what you want to hear phone lines are open now  
You say it you know I'm gonna play it  
And be ready to win when I tell you to call in and whatever you do  
Remember the phrase that pays puts your brain on vacation  
And let your toes take over keep your pedal to the metal  
I'll be back in sixty seconds, in the meantime go with it,  
Go for it, go nuts, go completely wild

You're on top of the world  
On top of the world and you can't  
Get any higher-you're on top of the world  
You're on top of the world tonight  
It wasn't easy- it was hard as hell  
You didn't get luck in a wishin' well  
Never worked so hard- had so much pain  
Wouldn't change for anything  
Learned love from a movie screen  
He was tough, she was wild at fifteen  
Quit school and had no dreams  
Wasn't going very far  
  
Then he got religion and she got a god  
It's on her back and it's in his job  
And it costs lots of money, honey- oh, no  
Breakdown nearly every day  
Shoulda known- couldn't get away  
Got lucky with the girl next door  
She was lonely and didn't care  
  
She was young, she was dark, she was fair  
Wrapped herself around you with her stare  
You'd explode if she would touch you there  
Touch you there- touch you there  
Tonight, tonight-tonight-tonight  
You're on top of the world  
On top of the world and you can't  
Get any higher  
You're on top of the world  
You're on top of the world tonight  
  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight  
(can you hear me, can you see me) you're on top of the world tonight

Reputation is a fragile thing  
Fame and money don't mean much to me  
Oh, don't go change to prove the point  
It doesn't matter, oh no  
  
We've had our problems and we've had our fun  
Did a lot of livin' on the run  
Oh don't go cover up the truth  
Cause we're together, oh yeah  
  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
Head is spinning and your mouth is dry  
Happiness you couldn't find or buy  
Oh, ever want something so bad you could taste it?  
  
Made the deadline and you passed the test  
Sabotage seems safer than success  
Put it off until tomorrow  
I've hear it all before  
  
But it's one on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
I need some time to think the whole thing over  
You say you want to save the world alone  
I want to taste and test the waters with you  
It's not so easy when you're on your own  
  
Don't lie to me is all i ask of you  
No excuses i just want the truth  
Reputation is a fragile thing  
I know you know it, well it's  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one  
  
One on one, one on one  
It's you and me against the world  
It's one on one

Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
I gave you just about the best years of my life  
I might be lax on my views of the world  
I can't explain the politics of your affairs  
But there is one thing that I know and say each day  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
Life ain't so easy  
I know you've heard it all before  
When you stop movin'  
There's always something more  
Closed up in front of you  
And closin' up in back  
Don't you stop givin' up  
When now you should attack, attack  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
Don't have a clue to know what's going on  
You say you need some time to live alone  
Tell me you're sorry so you say  
I don't believe a single word you say  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la

I woke up kinda sick  
The air is getting kind of thick  
And I'm tired of everyone  
Like a book on a rainy day  
I'm the one left off the page  
Well it's too much time in the sun  
  
Have you ever wanted to try  
When everything's going right by  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(it's time for you to change)  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning of my life  
(the meaning of my life)  
  
So when did yes turn into no  
Should you stay or should you go  
Well you're always stuck in between  
I tried to fake a laugh or two  
But my mistakes were all for you  
Too much pain, it's hard to swallow  
You'll be there and gone tomorrow  
  
I can't spend another night or day  
I can't hear another word you say  
The words you say  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(time for you to change)  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning to my life  
(the meaning to my life)  
  
If not for you  
Oh, if not for you  
We all started strangers  
And I know I'm perfect without you  
We all started strangers  
My world is perfect without you  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(it's time for you to change)  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
Shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning of my life  
(the meaning of my life)  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Ringing in my ear  
Yelling and screaming, I don't wanna hear  
(don't wanna hear)  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
Trying to run my life  
Constantly pushing  
I don't want your advice  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger

If I ever get back home again  
If I ever get back to you  
I won't care if the sun never shines  
You're all I want to do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Won't get left behind  
'Cause I can see just fine around you-  
Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanna do-  
I can see just fine around you  
You're all I ever wanted to do-  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanted to-  
Sorry I"m just blind around you  
All I want is you  
  
If I ever get back home tonight  
If I ever get lost in you  
I won't care if the moon never shines  
You're all I wanna do  
  
All that lays in front of us  
Won't get left behind  
'Cause I can see just fine around you-  
Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
You're all I wanna do-  
I can see just fine around you  
You're all I ever wanted to do-  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine

Sorry I'm not colorblind  
I can see just fine  
I can see just fine around you  
Maybe I'm just colorblind  
I can see just fine  
Sorry I'm just blind around you

No one's going to give it away.  
They make it hard for the people today.  
To get what you want, you've got to do it yourself.  
Don't be afraid to drive the nail in the wood.  
Or drink the bottle if it tastes so good.  
You'll go the distance. You never thought that you could.  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it, oh, yeah!  
  
Cough up the cash when you go over and over.  
Before the old one's gone, you've got a new owner.  
You need assistance when your head's in the clouds.  
You could live easy if life stood still.  
You could be faking and breaking and taking it all.  
But then you know you're gonna fall.  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
  
Don't have to take it so hard.  
Don't have to take it so, so hard.  
Don't have to take it so hard.  
Don't have to take it so hard!  
  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
Reach out and ta-ta-ta take it.  
Reach out and take it.  
  
Reach out, reach out.  
Take what you want.  
Reach out, reach out.  
Take what you want.

When I drove into that parking lot  
For the first time peepers round was on the dot  
By the stink of that cop, ain't got a lot  
Well we were lookin' for a place to play  
We high-tailed over to one-eyed Jack  
With a cheap guitar strung over my back  
Well I looked pretty nervous, I can't turn back  
This guy was everything the driver said, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well lazy Jack, doesn't move too well  
Play it back real loud, a real rebel yell  
Buy a rock and roll record and make it sell  
I'm gonna make it to the top today  
Now I got pulled in some big demand  
And they all keep telling me be a one-man band  
Unless I get big stuff and a real cool band  
And boy you gotta hear me play, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
Well they heard some sounds in the songs we wrote  
Welcome back by paying you note for note  
Been a long time playin' that rock and roll  
Not a thing's gonna touch me now  
Gonna rock your town if anybody could  
Drive a big limousine down to Hollywood  
Even bought a nice home in your neighborhood  
But we have to keep the curtains drawn  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well we were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight  
Hey knock, don't lean on the record machine  
Or mess around with the big red light  
Well it was all right  
We gotta rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's got her jeans too tight  
We were all right  
We're gonna rock and roll tonight, rock and roll tonight  
And Bun E's on the ground  
Goin' round and round  
'Cause his baby's cut her jeans too tight  
  

Now woman, scent of a woman  
  
A man don't add up to much, next to a woman  
A man can't ever forget the taste of a woman  
A man is half the test, a man is half the best  
A man can't understand the reasons why  
  
A man's just a day in the life of a woman  
Just a few minutes a night to a woman  
See what a woman can do  
To the man inside of you  
It's more than the sum of the sun and the moon  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just don't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't see what a woman can do  
A man is no man hiding next to you  
A man don't add up to much next to a woman  
Oh, the scent of a woman  
  
The world would never be, except for a woman  
It's hard for a man to see what makes a woman  
Even harder to impress, cause she expects the best  
She never makes it easy to pass the test  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just won't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't do what a woman can do  
A man is not a man lying next to you  
And man will just give up next to a woman  
Oh yeah, here she comes now  
(here she comes now, she comes now, here she comes now)  
Here she comes now  
(here she comes now, she comes now, here she comes now)  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just won't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't do what a woman can do  
A man is a man if he can get to you  
All a man wants to do is get to a woman, yeah  
  
[Repeat: x16]  
Yeah yeah  
  
Yeah, the scent of a woman

Met the girl said to me  
What is it you want to see?  
See the world a different view  
Trip around the world with you  
See it all, special view  
Over, under, sideways with you  
Took a chance, umm some romance  
It was good for me was it good for you?  
  
She's got motion, motion, motion  
A love potion (for me)  
Yeah, she's got it (i like it a lot)  
I've got the motion  
She likes it hot  
  
Then I touched her on the spot  
On the trigger, it was hot  
She said "don't stop. don't stop, don't stop"  
  
She's got motion, motion, motion  
A love potion (for me)  
Yeah, she's got it (i like it a lot)  
I got the notion  
She likes it hot  
So hot

When I'm down I make a call.  
Got the number written on the wall.  
First it's busy then I try again.  
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?  
  
I got the number and it starts to ring.  
I get excited and I start to dream.  
I start to fantasize of memory lane.  
Then she answers and she says right way.  
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
I have something got to say to you.  
Amnesia and my train of thought.  
On the tip, tip of my tongue.  
I had a vision when I was young.  
  
You floated in, we floated up.  
Through the window and down the hall.  
I had a smoke and went upstairs.  
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...  
I'm on my own, home all alone.  
So I got off the phone.  
  
(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time.  
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind.  
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl.  
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight.  
  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the go.  
(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign.  
(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights.  
(She's tight.) Pull down the shades.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra.  
(She's nice, she's tight.) And getting ready for action.  
  
Turn off the radio.  
Turn on the video.

Take want you want  
Giving back a steely stare  
Eyes black as night, I  
Can feel a shiver in the air  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
Time everlasting  
As a mother's blood runs cold  
Blast everyone  
There's no forgiveness  
When your soul is sold  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
No one will be there  
To pick you up if you should fall  
Burned every bridge  
Your only friends  
The shadow on the wall  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy

You push hard, you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love, I need my mental stimulation  
  
If I'm not there, defend my reputation  
Well, that don't mean that there's a real negotiation  
Take a longer look, this could be privacy invasion  
What makes you think you've got that fascination?  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I know you're burnin' with anticipation  
Hold on, here comes your education  
Make sure it's love not just infatuation  
Tell me why you always lead me to that destination  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
  
You push hard, you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love, I need my mental stimulation  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I need space, oh, oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well I can't stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I don't want to hear it  
Don't want to hear it no more  
No more  
  
I can't stop the music  
I could stop it before  
Now I don't want to hear it  
Don't want to hear it no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
Hey, livin' with you  
Is all I wanted before  
I've changed, you didn't  
Don't want to see you no more  
  
All I want to do is stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Oh, stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
Well we were walkin' before we could crawl  
And you were lovin' just emotion just all  
It's just emotion wasn't music at all  
Now I can't stop the music  
Now I don't want to hear it no more  
No more, no more, no more  
  
Stop this game  
It's gonna really end  
Stop this game  
It's such a touchy, touchy thing  
  
I can't stop the music (stop this game)  
I could stop it before (it's gonna really end)  
Now I don't want to hear it (stop this game)  
Don't want to hear it no more (it's such a touchy, touchy thing)

Mother told me, yes she told me  
I'd meet girls like you  
She also told me stay away  
You'll never know what you'll catch  
  
Just the other day I heard  
Of a soldier's falling off  
Some Indonesian junk  
That's going 'round  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Father says your mother's right  
She's really up on things  
Before we married Mommy served  
On the WACs in the Philippines  
  
Now I had heard the WACs recruited  
Old maids for the war  
But Mommy's neither one of those  
I've known her all these years  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Whatever happened to all this season's  
Losers of the year  
Every time I got to thinking  
Where'd they disappear  
  
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad  
Are rolling on the couch  
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling  
Got my Kiss records out  
  
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright  
They just seem a little weird  
Surrender, surrender  
But don't give yourself away  
  
Away

You walked in the room  
I saw your face and i saw you smile  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You've got a new approach  
And the time is right  
  
You think you're so fine, oh so fine  
And it so excites me  
Come six with my nine  
You're my perfect partner  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me I'm yours  
Take me I'm yours  
Come on now and take me  
Take me amour  
Take me I'm yours  
Come on now and take me  
  
Oh don't you be so nice to me  
Oh you can't be serious  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You'll be my perfect partner  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love the way you wear your hair  
I saw the way you stopped and stared  
When i looked at you, oh no oh no  
Well maybe girls like you aren't free  
But baby, baby can't you see  
I just want to be with you.  
  
You walked through the room  
Continental style and sweet perfume  
A pretty girl like yourself  
You've got a new approach  
And the time's good tonight  
  
[Chorus]

We go back a long long way  
And it seems like yesterday  
When the words are spoken  
Or whispered in your ear  
Things have changed since we first met  
You alone are more than I expect  
But the good outweighs the bad  
  
By 110 per cent  
You take me to the top  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling  
  
Oh all the way  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling oh  
Some things go in circles  
Something's in the air  
  
You know just what I'm feeling  
You can make the difference  
You know I really care  
You take me to the top  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling oh all the way  
  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling  
Oh ah ah oh  
If I could dream a dream  
With a happy end  
You'd be in it every night  
  
Again and again  
Right here by my side  
You'd never go away  
But I'm awake  
I sing I say  
You take me to the top  
  
You're everything I've got  
You catch me if I'm falling  
Oh all the way  
You take me to the top  
You catch me if I'm falling oh

You work hard, you make money  
There ain't no on in the world who can stop you  
You work hard, you went hungry

You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
Break your back sweat a lot  
Well, it's just not fair  
  
He hates you, he loves money  
And he'll steal your shit and think that it's funny  
Like the Beatles he ain't human  
Now the Taxman is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
You played  
And you played and played for years  
  
Taxman, Mr. heath (he's a thief)  
He's looking for run-in, yeah

If I could have what I want I'll just want what I've got  
I told myself a million times that's the truth but it's not.  
I could give you some lessons on how to cry all night  
I know the hurting's only started and it might never stop  
  
[Oh Angeline] you want some help from me now  
Now since he left you alone.  
Don't say it ain't so, [you betray people here]  
It's not so long ago that  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I don't know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything.  
  
So pardon me if I don't cry 'cause your love is on the shelf  
After all, you're so good at looking out for yourself  
You might hate me for saying so but that's all right  
You can hate the whole world but it ain't gonna help.  
  
[Oh, Angeline] you're only wasting your time  
Looking for my sympathy  
I hope you're satisfied ' cause I only want to laugh  
When I hear you cry  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
Now he's done it to you  
Like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything  
  
I guess you never thought that you'd be falling in love  
You've lost everything that you're dreaming of  
I can't let you go without letting you know  
  
You were everything to me  
You were everything to me  
I don't know why but your pain  
Is such a pleasure to see  
So baby tell me everything  
  
Baby tell me everything (everything to me)  
Baby tell me everything  
Someone did it to you like you did it to me  
So baby tell me everything.

Yeah  
Yeah  
  
If I knew what I wish I knew  
I could've seen what I'm going through  
When I first laid eyes on you  
You blew me away, yeah yeah  
  
If the timing's oh so right  
I'd fear for you every night  
It blew me away, yeah yeah  
  
Innocence seems to fade away  
Disappear, poof you're gone  
Thought I'd lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
[Chorus]  
This time we got it  
Yeah, what I've been looking for  
Reached out and got it  
I shouldn't ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
'Bout time you got it  
(This time we got it)  
This time we got it  
Let's take it away  
  
Now I tried for something new  
Wasn't rich enough to pay my dues  
Was I in the right direction?  
I was aiming at you, yeah yeah  
  
If the timing's oh so right  
I'd fear for you every night  
It just blows me away, yeah yeah  
  
Thought I'd lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't lose it  
Can't have enough  
Won't lose it  
Can't get enough  
Don't lose it  
Don't have enough  
Won't lose it  
I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This time we got it  
Yeah, what I've been looking for  
Reached in and got it  
I shouldn't ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
This time you got it  
(This time we got it)  
'Bout time we got it  
Let's take it away  
This time we got it  
(This time we got it)  
'Bout time we got it  
Let's take it away  
  
Take it away  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't have to hide  
All the things you say or feel inside  
I can always tell that love is alive  
When I look in your eyes  
With just one kiss you see the ways of love  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Time is on our side  
Never had to wait for reasons why  
Two can play this game better than one  
Alone in the night  
Oh, and you could see a world of love  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Don't blow it away  
'Coz you can't deny the love inside  
Oh baby, don't be afraid  
  
Been said a million times before  
Gonna say it once again  
You will see a world of love through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it through the night  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night

Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
Help all my dreams come true  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Here comes the night  
Gone are the days yeah  
When we could just sit here and talk for hours  
Didn't have much to say  
  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
Help my dreams come true  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Now everything seems so serious  
We all had our fun in the sun  
We all want to take too much out of life  
Fooling ourselves in the long run  
  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
Help my dreams come true  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Tryin' to beat the clock  
It never stops tickin' the time away  
Tryin' to beat the clock it  
Never stops, never stops night or day  
  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
And my dreams come true  
Time is runnin' out of control, ooh  
You make my dreams come true

Don't wanna see you again,  
You're takin' a little too much.  
Maybe it's my fault, OK,  
You've taken away too much.  
Swimmin' in sorrow all day,  
Well fakin' it doesn't do much.  
Maybe you've fallen from grace,  
It's takin' a little too much.  
I couldn't be you, my friend,  
You're makin' a lie of your love,  
My love  
  
I-I swear-you had it all,  
Diamonds and pearls,  
In time  
You've taken all mine.  
  
I couldn't be you my friend,  
You've taken a little too much.  
Don't wanna hold you again,  
And fall for the tricks in your touch.  
No one can charm like you can,  
You're makin' a lie of our love,  
My love  
  
You'll be there without a care,  
I'll go alone-I'll fall into life all over again.  
  
In time I will find a girl  
Who knows just how to be kind.  
Some days the power's so bright-my love,  
I can't find no easy way out.  
  
I-I swear-a light, a voice,  
Tells me to stop.  
Something inside screamed out:  
Get my life back again.  
  
Don't wanna see you my friend,  
You've taken a little too much.  
Maybe it's my fault, OK,  
You've taken away too much.  
  
I couldn't be you my friend,  
'Cause none of your riches mean much.  
I couldn't stand to pretend,  
You're makin' a lie of our love.  
My love, come on, come on,  
You're takin' a little too much, too much.  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la, la la la la la la

Watch it!  
  
Just like the one's that got away,  
Supposedly if so far.  
I threw my hook into the water,  
I nearly gotta.  
House design now  
[I'm up the creek]  
Although I lost a little ground  
[I'm up the creek]  
I know that time is on my side  
[I'm up the creek]  
Don't you go pull the plug on me.  
[I'm up the creek]  
There more than one fish in the sea.  
I'm not about to let it be.  
I know that I am up the creek.  
  
Hey, hey  
  
The foreign legions always there. I need a holiday.  
Daydream in the dessert, with no pressure, that's the way, cause  
[I'm up the creek]  
Although I've lost a little ground.  
[I'm up the creek]  
I know that time is on my side.  
[I'm up the creek]  
Don't you go pull the plug on me.  
[I'm up the creek]  
There more than one fish in the sea.  
I'm not about to let it be.  
I know that I'm up the creek.  
  
[I'm up the creek]  
Without a paddle.  
[I'm up the creek]  
But that don't matter at all.  
[No matter at all]  
No matter at all.  
[No matter at all]  
[I'm up the creek]  
Without a paddle  
[I'm up the creek]  
I'm learning to paddle it all,  
[Don't mention at all]  
[Don't mention at all]  
Paddle it all.  
[Don't mention at all]  
  
Oh  
  
Hey, hey  
  
I'm, up the creek  
I'm, up the creek  
[I'm, up the creek]  
Here I go! You want to go?  
[I'm, Up the creek]  
Help me! Help me! Help me!  
[I'm, up the creek]  
[I'm, up the creek]  
  
Watch it! Wow!  
  
[I'm, up the creek]  
[I'm, up the creek]

You think that it's funny  
You think I'm a fool  
It's nothin' I needed  
Just somethin' to do  
Out of touch out of time  
It's not easy to find, well  
These two hearts are  
Broken before they start, so  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk away walk away  
I don't mind I don't mind  
Don't act like you're worried  
I'm feelin' no pain  
You got what you needed  
Your fun little game  
  
Stoned and confused  
I know  
It ain't easy  
To hold on  
We've been hidin'  
Pretendin' cheatin' and lyin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Don't know what to thank  
Who to blame  
We were lovers just the same, well  
Startin' stoppin'  
Over and over and over  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Walk away walk away

Welcome to this world

Welcome to the world

I'd like to see you  
I'll take your hand  
And when I pull out  
You'll understand  
See me when you're lookin' for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
I've been around  
Since I don't know when  
I've got some lovers  
That you could rent  
I seek you when I'm diggin' for gold  
I feel alive since my soul was sold  
  
I'm scared thinkin' about the 4th of July  
Can't seem to fight it, it can't be denied  
I've got more than that on my brain  
I've got so much, it'll drive you insane  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
You want a real look  
At paradise  
Simple pleasures  
Just won't suffice  
See me when you're lookin' for love  
A naked lie from the heavens above  
  
I'm in color, and you're black and white  
Let's start the rumors from heaven tonight  
I've got a penthouse in Manhattan Place  
Come up and see me if you want a taste, yeah  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
Sitting pretty  
Sitting pretty  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
'Cause when I get to the top  
And I don't want to stop  
'Cause I like it, like it  
I love it, love it  
I like it a lot, wooo  
  
You drive, I'll steer  
Everybody else, steer clear  
'Cause I'm sitting pretty  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
Yeah when I get to the top  
And I don't wanna stop  
'Cause I like it, I love it, I like it  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  
I'm in the lap of luxury  

So how does it feel  
To stand so close  
And never understand  
How do you feel  
When you mean so much  
But you don't even give a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
You let a lotta people down  
You let a lotta people down  
You've got a lot to learn  
You can't do that  
Just who the hell do you think you are  
You can't do that  
  
Well you rode upon a wicked fence  
Could've fallen either way  
But you've chosen other losers  
In your sick sick game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just how can you keep goin'  
With all that's goin' on  
The best thing about knowing you  
Is knowin' when you're gone  
You let a lotta people down  
  
Your conscience has ghost writers  
Your dirty hands are clean  
Flesh and blood and life and death  
No it's no mystery  
  
[Chorus]  
You can't do that  
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' til a man starts comin' with a gun  
No you ain't seen nothin' til some nut starts comin' with a gun

You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear father, don't mother me  
Dear mother, don't bother me  
If I ever needed your advice, oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
I've been wrong maybe once or twice  
And that's when I was listenin' to you  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much to me  
  
Dear preacher, you won't reach me  
Dear teacher, don't preach to me  
If I ever needed your advice, oh  
I would have called you on the telephone  
I've only been wrong maybe once or twice  
And that's when I was listenin' to you  
  
Oh, shut up!  
  
You talk too much  
You talk too much  
You talk too much, oh yeah

Try to bend me, try to shake me  
Try and turn my head around  
Oh try to change me, rearrange me  
I think you know about the boy you found  
A fantasy like this is hit and run  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
I had a dream about girls like you  
You said call us, you'll get two  
One for your money, two for the show  
I'll give you something more  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
It's hard enough to make you want to cry  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
It's hard enough to make you want to cry  
And it drives me out of my mind  
I'm in love with you, baby  
My poor innocent baby  
Don't you say maybe  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
  
Feels so good, let me in  
I might jump right out of my skin  
Don't you ever grow up little girl  
Sweet young thing, not so innocent  
  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls  
Younger girls  
Oh how I love those younger girls

I just want to see  
What it's like to be  
Caught in your eyes  
I wish you'd talk to me  
I'm not cut out to be the one lonely child  
  
I always wanted a youger sister  
One who'd always be drawn to me  
I'm going crazy tonight  
I'm going crazy tonight  
'cause you're all I want to do anytime  
  
Baby you're all I wana do  
With my time  
Baby you're all I want to do anytime  
Baby you're all I want  
You're all I really want to do  
  
When you stay next to me  
It's not so hard to see  
What's burning my eyes  
It's always hard to see  
When you're cut out be the one lonely child  
  
I look at you and your younger sister  
There's always something that smile on you  
I know you're crazy tonight  
I know you're crazy tonight  
Do you in the morning  
  
Do you up right  
Don't want to stop  
'til the middle of the night  
Every single minute  
Baby while I'm thinking of you  
(anytime) I've got a thing about you  
(anytime) I can't live without you  
  
Why why why why  
Baby baby baby you're all I need  
Maybe baby baby I'll be thinking of you  
'cause you're all I want to do  
  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do  
You're all I want to do
