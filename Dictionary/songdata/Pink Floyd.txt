Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket  
Feeling good at the top  
Shopping in sharp shoes  
Walking in the sunshine town  
feeling very cool  
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores  
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
  
Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly  
To meet the people  
She's on time again  
And then  
I catch her by the eye  
then I stop and have to think  
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
  
I love she  
She loves me  
See you  
  
See you  
  
Thought you might like to know  
I'm the lorry driver man  
She's on the run  
Down by the river side  
feeding ducks by the afternoon tide  
(Quack quack)  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges  
Apples and oranges

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby  
Collecting clothes  
Moonshine washing line  
They suit him fine  
On the wall hung a tall mirror  
Distorted view, see through baby blue  
Oh, Arnold Layne  
It's not the same, takes two to know  
Two to know, two to know  
Why can't you see?  
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne  
  
Now he's caught, a nasty sort of person  
They gave him time  
Doors bang, chain gang, he hates it  
Oh, Arnold Layne  
It's not the same, takes two to know  
Two to know, two to know  
Why can't you see?  
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne  
  
Don't do it again

Lime and limpid green, a second scene  
A fight between the blue you once knew.  
Floating down, the sound surrounds  
Around the icy waters underground.  
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.  
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.  
Lime and limpid green, a second scene  
A fight between the blue you once knew.  
Floating down, the sound surrounds  
Around the icy waters underground.  
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.  
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.  
Blinding signs flap,  
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.  
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?  
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around  
The icy waters under  
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around  
The icy waters underground.

In the sad town  
Cold iron hands clap  
The party of clowns outside  
Rain falls in gray far away  
Please, please, Baby Lemonade  
  
In the evening sun going down  
When the earth streams in, in the morning  
Send a cage through the post  
Make your name like a ghost  
Please, please, Baby Lemonade  
  
I'm screaming, I met you this way  
You're nice to me like ice  
In the clock they sent through a washing machine  
Come around, make it soon, so alone...  
Please, please, Baby Lemonade  
  
In the sad town

Send a cage through the post

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.  
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and  
Things to make it look good.  
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.  
  
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  
  
I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.  
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.  
I've had it for months.  
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.  
  
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  
  
I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.  
I don't know why. I call him Gerald.  
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.  
  
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  
  
I've got a clan of gingerbread men.  
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.  
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.  
  
You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.  
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.  
  
I know a room full of musical tunes.  
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.  
Let's go into the other room and make them work.

The lunatic is on the grass.  
The lunatic is on the grass.  
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.  
Got to keep the loonies on the path.  
  
The lunatic is in the hall.  
The lunatics are in my hall.  
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor  
And every day the paper boy brings more.  
  
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon  
And if there is no room upon the hill  
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too  
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.  
  
The lunatic is in my head.  
The lunatic is in my head  
You raise the blade, you make the change  
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane.  
You lock the door  
And throw away the key  
There's someone in my head but it's not me.  
  
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear  
You shout and no one seems to hear.  
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes  
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

Breathe, breathe in the air  
Don't be afraid to care  
Leave but don't leave me  
Look around and choose your own ground  
  
Long you live and high you fly  
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry  
And all you touch and all you see  
Is all your life will ever be  
  
Run, rabbit run  
Dig that hole, forget the sun  
And when at last the work is done  
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one  
  
For long you live and high you fly  
But only if you ride the tide  
And balanced on the biggest wave  
You race towards an early grave

Oh, my girl sitting in the sky  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Lay back  
Don't talk to me  
Please, just fuck with me  
Please, you know I'm feeling frail  
It's true, sun shining very bright  
It's you, I'm gonna love tonight  
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon  
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon  
Don't touch me child  
Please, know you drive me wild  
Please you know, I'm feeling frail  
Don't try another cat  
Don't go where other you must know why  
Very, very, very frail  
Oh, my girl sitting in the sun  
Go buy candy and a currant bun  
I like to see you run  
Like that  

Down, down. Down, down. The star is screaming.  
Beneath the lies. Lie, lie. Tschay, tschay, tschay.  
[sound of Waters blowing into the microphone]  
[light screaming from Waters]  
Careful, careful, careful with that axe, Eugene.  
[very loud and prolonged scream]  
[another very loud and prolonged scream]  
[Waters blowing into the microphone]  
[light screaming from Waters]  
The stars are screaming loud.  
Tsch.  
Tsch.  
Tsch.  
[low groaning sound from Waters]

All movement is accomplished in six stages  
And the seventh brings return.  
The seven is the number of the young light  
It forms when darkness is increased by one.  
Change returns success  
Going and coming without error.  
Action brings good fortune.  
Sunset.  
  
The time is with the month of winter solstice  
When the change is due to come.  
Thunder in the Earth, the course of Heaven.  
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all.  
Change returns success  
Going and coming without error.  
Action brings good fortune.  
Sunset, sunrise.

Hello?  
  
Is there anybody in there?  
Just nod if you can hear me.  
Is there anyone home?  
Come on now  
I hear you're feeling down.  
Well I can ease your pain  
Get you on your feet again.  
Relax.  
I'll need some information first.  
Just the basic facts.  
Can you show me where it hurts?  
  
There is no pain you are receding  
A distant ship smoke on the horizon.  
You are only coming through in waves.  
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.  
When I was a child I had a fever  
My hands felt just like two balloons.  
Now I've got that feeling once again  
I can't explain you would not understand  
This is not how I am.  
I have become comfortably numb.  
  
O.K.  
Just a little pinprick.  
There'll be no more, ah!  
But you may feel a little sick.  
Can you stand up?  
I do believe it's working, good.  
That'll keep you going through the show  
Come on it's time to go.  
  
There is no pain you are receding  
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.  
You are only coming through in waves.  
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.  
When I was a child  
I caught a fleeting glimpse  
Out of the corner of my eye.  
I turned to look but it was gone  
I cannot put my finger on it now  
The child is grown,  
The dream is gone.  
I have become comfortably numb.

Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg  
He won it in the war, in 1944.  
Corporal Clegg had a medal too  
In orange, red, and blue  
He found it in the zoo.  
Dear, dear were they really sad for me?  
Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?  
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him.  
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin.  
Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain  
He's never been the same  
No one is to blame  
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream  
From Her Majesty the queen  
His boots were very clean.  
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him  
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin.

He made his way to the border  
In the shadow under the trees  
Down by a stream in a hollow  
Turn your head feel the breeze  
  
And the red Queen was waiting for the news  
For the white King to move  
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried  
To stay within the shadows  
And keep his undercover secret tight  
  
They let him in by a back way  
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen  
She took the note that he gave her  
Opened it slowly and started to read  
  
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold  
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried  
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong  
And all the courtiers crowded her  
And this is what she told the gathered round  
  
Go to the store by the dungeon  
Take all the red paint take all the white  
Make up a newborn color  
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right  
  
There will be no game today, she cried across the board  
Everyday will be a holiday  
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad  
And the Pink Queen sat  
And smiled at the cat who smiled back.

In a while I'll find the time to make the sunshine mine  
In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky  
Wheeling, soaring, gliding high  
On a hill there lived a man with many shining things  
Shiny gold, shiny car and shiny diamond rings  
Wining, dining, shining king  
Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies  
Drinking in the clear blue well  
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies  
But fifty more come rolling off the floor production line  
Then a man commuting like a village on the sand  
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land  
Screaming, dealing, movie man  
Here we go, hold your breath to see if something blows  
Close your eyes, count till ten and see the sunrise rise  
Gliding high into the sky  
By the holy mansion, let the guardian rise  
Upon the finger of the king  
On high the eagle flies, that glitter all of gold  
Then wheeling in a cloudy sky, he flies into the sun

Overhead the albatross  
Hangs motionless upon the air  
And deep beneath the rolling waves  
In labyrinths of coral caves  
An echo of a distant time  
Comes willowing across the sand  
And everything is green and submarine.  
  
And no one called us to the land  
And no one knows the where's or why's.  
Something stirs and something tries  
Starts to climb toward the light.  
  
Strangers passing in the street  
By chance two separate glances meet  
And I am you and what I see is me.  
And do I take you by the hand  
And lead you through the land  
And help me understand  
The best I can.  
  
And no one called us to move on,  
And no one forces down our eyes.  
No one speaks and no one tries  
No one flies around the sun  
  
Cloudless everyday you fall  
Upon my waking eyes,  
Inviting and inciting me  
To rise.  
And through the window in the wall  
Come streaming in on sunlight wings  
A million bright ambassadors of morning.  
  
And no one sings me lullabys  
And no one makes me close my eyes  
So I throw the windows wide  
And call to you across the sky

Alone in the clouds all blue  
Lying on an eiderdown.  
Yippee! You can't see me  
But I can you.  
  
Lazing in the foggy dew  
Sitting on a unicorn.  
No fair, you can't hear me  
But I can you.  
  
Watching buttercups cup the light  
Sleeping on a dandelion.  
Too much, I won't touch you  
But then I might.  
  
Screaming through the starlit sky  
Traveling by telephone.  
Hey ho, here we go  
Ever so high.  
  
Alone in the clouds all blue  
Lying on an eiderdown.  
Yippee! You can't see me  
But I can you.

The memories of a man in his old age  
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.  
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom  
And talk to yourself as you die.  
  
Life is a short, warm moment  
And death is a long cold rest.  
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye:  
Eighty years, with luck, or even less.  
  
So all aboard for the American tour,  
And maybe you'll make it to the top.  
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know  
You may find it hard to get off.  
  
You are the angel of death  
And I am the dead man's son.  
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole.  
And everyone is still in the run.  
  
And who is the master of fox hounds?  
And who says the hunt has begun?  
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?  
And who beats the funeral drum?  
  
The memories of a man in his old age  
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.  
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom  
And talk to yourself till you die.

Grooving around in a trench coat  
With the satin on trail  
Seems to be all around in tin and lead pail, we pale  
Jiving on down to the beach  
To see the blue and the gray  
Seems to be all and it's rosy-it's a beautiful day!  
  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!  
Yes I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!  
  
Heading down with the light, the dust in your way  
She was angrier than, than her watershell male  
Life to this love to me - heading me down to me  
Thunderbird shale  
Seems to be all and it's rosy - it's a beautiful day!  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt  
  
Grooving on down in a knapsack superlative day  
Some wish she move and just as she can move jiving away  
She made the scene should have been-superlative day  
Everything's all and it's rosy, it's a beautiful day  
Will you please keep on the track  
'cause I almost want you back  
'cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt...

Heavy hung the canopy of blue  
Shade my eyes and I can see you  
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore  
  
She lay in the shadow of the wave  
Hazy were the visions of her playing  
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry every time  
  
Green is the color of her kind  
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind  
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

Hey you out there in the cold  
Getting lonely getting old  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you standing in the aisles  
With itchy feet and fading smiles  
Can you feel me?  
Hey you don't help them to bury the light  
Don't give in without a fight.  
  
Hey you out there on your own  
Sitting naked by the phone  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you with you ear against the wall  
Waiting for someone to call out  
Would you touch me?  
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?  
Open your heart, I'm coming home.  
  
But it was only fantasy.  
The wall was too high,  
As you can see.  
No matter how he tried,  
He could not break free.  
And the worms ate into his brain.  
  
Hey you, out there on the road  
Always doing what you're told,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,  
Breaking bottles in the hall,  
Can you help me?  
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all  
Together we stand, divided we fall.

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary  
The ringing of the division bell had begun  
  
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before times took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground  
To a life consumed by slow decay  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
When friends surrounded  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side  
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again  
Dragged by the force of some inner tide  
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition  
There's a hunger still unsatisfied  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon  
Though down this road we've been so many times  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dawn mist glowing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
  
Forever and ever

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here  
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear  
That I'm not here.  
And I never knew we could be so big  
And I never knew the moon could be so blue  
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes  
And brought me here instead dressed in red  
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.  
  
I don't care if the sun don't shine  
And I don't care if nothing is mine  
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you  
I'll do my loving in the winter.  
  
And the sea isn't green  
And I love the queen  
And what exactly is a dream  
And what exactly is a joke.

Sunlight bright upon my pillow  
Lighter than an eiderdown  
Will she let the weeping willow  
Wind his branches round  
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams  
Every night I turn the light out  
  
Waiting for the velvet bride  
Will the scaly armadillo  
Find me where I'm hiding  
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams  
Will the misty master break me  
Will the key unlock my mind  
Will the following footsteps catch me  
Am I really dying  
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams

For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals  
Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination  
We learned to talk  
  
There's a silence surrounding me  
I can't seem to think straight  
I'll sit in the corner  
No one can bother me  
  
I think I should speak now  
Why won't you talk to me  
I can't seem to speak now  
You never talk to me  
  
My words won't come out right  
What are you thinking  
I feel like I'm drowning  
What are you feeling  
  
I'm feeling weak now  
You never talk to me  
But I can't show my weakness  
  
What are you thinking  
I sometimes wonder  
What are you feeling  
  
Where do we go from here  
  
It doesn't have to be like this  
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking  
  
Why won't you talk to me  
I feel like I'm drowning  
You never talk to me  
You know I can't breathe now  
  
What are you thinking  
We're going nowhere  
What are you feeling  
We're going nowhere  
  
Why won't you talk to me  
You never talk to me  
What are you thinking  
Where do we go from here  
  
It doesn't have to be like this  
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Well, I'm a King Bee  
Buzzing around your hive  
Yes, I'm a King Bee, child  
Buzzing around your hive  
  
I can make good honey  
Let me come inside  
I'm young and able  
To buzz all night long  
You know I'm young and able  
To buzz all night long  
  
When you hear me buzz, little girl  
You know some stinging's going on  
(Well, buzz some) I'll sting (yeah)  
  
Well, I'm a King Bee  
Can buzz all night long  
Yes I'm a King Bee  
Can buzz all night long  
  
Well, I buzz better baby,  
When your man is gone.

Far, far, far away, way  
People heard him say, say  
I will find a way, way  
There will come a day, day  
Something will be done.  
  
Then at last the mighty ship  
Descending on a point of flame  
Made contact with the human race  
And melted hearts  
  
Now, now, now is the time, time  
Time to be, be, be aware  
  
Carter's father saw him there and  
Knew the road revealed to him  
The living soul of  
  
Oh, my, something in my eye, eye  
Something in the sky, sky  
Waiting there for me  
  
The outer lock rolled slowly back  
The service men were heard to sigh  
For there revealed in glowing robes  
Was Lucy in the sky  
  
Oh, oh, did you ever know, know  
Never ever will they  
I cannot say  
  
Something in his cosmic art  
And glowing slightly from his toes  
The psychic and the nations fly

I was spending my time in the doldrums  
I was caught in a cauldron of hate  
I felt persecuted and paralyzed  
I thought that everything else would just wait  
  
While you are wasting your time on your enemies  
Engulfed in a fever of spite  
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades  
Like shadows into the night  
  
To martyr yourself to caution  
Is not going to help at all  
Because there'll be no safety in numbers  
When the right one walks out of the door  
  
Can you see your days blighted by darkness?  
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?  
Stuck in a world of isolation  
While the ivy grows over the door  
  
So I open my door to my enemies  
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean  
But they tell me to please go fuck myself  
You know you just can't win

There was a king who ruled the land.  
His majesty was in command.  
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle  
Showers silver on the people.  
Oh Mother, tell me more.  
  
Why'd'ya have to leave me there  
Hanging in my infant air  
Waiting?  
You only have to read the lines  
They're scribbly black and everything shines.  
  
Across the stream with wooden shoes  
With bells to tell the king the news  
A thousand misty riders climb up  
Higher once upon a time.  
  
Wandering and dreaming  
The words have different meaning.  
Yes they did.  
  
For all the time spent in that room  
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume  
And fairy stories held me high on  
Clouds of sunlight floating by.  
Oh Mother, tell me more  
Tell me more.

Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb?  
Mother do you think they'll like the song?  
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls?  
Oooh, ahh  
Mother should I build the wall?  
Mother should I run for President?  
Mother should I trust the government?  
Mother will they put me in the firing line?  
Oooh ahh,  
Is it just a waste of time?  
  
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.  
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true.  
Mama's gonna put all her fears into you.  
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing.  
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.  
Mama's gonna keep baby cosy and warm.  
Ooooh baby, ooooh baby, oooooh baby,  
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.  
  
Mother do you think she's good enough, for me?  
Mother do you think she's dangerous, to me?  
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?  
Ooooh Ma,  
Mother will she break my heart?  
  
Hush now baby, baby don't you cry.  
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.  
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through.  
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in.  
Mama will always find out where you've been.  
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.  
Ooooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby,  
You'll always be baby to me.  
  
Mother, did it need to be so high?

It's no good trying to place your hand  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
And you're rocking me backwards  
And you're rocking towards the  
Red and yellow mane of a stallion horse.  
  
It's no good trying to hold your love  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
The caterpillar hood won't cover the head of you  
Know you should be home in bed.  
  
It's no good holding your sequin fan  
Where I can't see because I understand  
That you're different from me  
Yes I can tell  
That you can't be what you pretend  
Yes you're spinning around and around in a car  
With electric lights flashing very fast...

"Alright, I'll take care of them part of the time, but there's somebody else
that needs taking care of in Washington"  
"Who's that?"  
"Rose Pilchitt!"  
"Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?"  
"36-24-36 does that answer your question?"  
"Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!"  
"Who's she?"  
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961 ... "  
  
I've got a little black book with my poems in.  
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.  
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.  
  
I got elastic bands keepin my shoes on.  
Got those swollen hand blues.  
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from.  
I've got electric light.  
And I've got second sight.  
I got amazing powers of observation.  
And that is how I know  
When I try to get through  
On the telephone to you  
There'll be nobody home.  
  
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.  
And the inevitable pinhole burns  
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt.  
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.  
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.  
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.  
  
I've got wild staring eyes.  
And I've got a strong urge to fly.  
But I got nowhere to fly to.  
Ooooh, babe when I pick up the phone  
  
"Surprise, surprise, surprise..."  
There's still nobody home.  
  
I've got a pair of Gohills boots  
But I got fading roots.

"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?  
"I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!"  
"This place is bigger than our apartment!"  
"Let me know when you're entering a room"  
"Yes sir!"  
"Um, Can I get a drink of water?"  
"I was wondering about..."  
"You want some, huh?"  
"Yes"  
"Oh wow, look at this tub? Do you want to take bath?"  
"I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for
her main..."  
"What are watching?"  
"If you'll just let me know as soon as you can ... Mrs Bancroft" "Mrs
Bancroft..."  
"Hello?"  
"I don't understand..."  
"Are you feeling okay?..."  
  
Day after day, love turns grey  
Like the skin of a dying man.  
And night after night, we pretend its all right  
But I have grown older and  
You have grown colder and  
Nothing is very much fun any more.  
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.  
I feel cold as a razor blade,  
Tight as a tourniquet,  
Dry as a funeral drum.  
  
Run to the bedroom,  
In the suitcase on the left  
You'll find my favorite axe.  
Don't look so frightened  
This is just a passing phase,  
One of my bad days.  
Would you like to watch T.V.?  
Or get between the sheets?  
Or contemplate the silent freeway?  
Would you like something to eat?  
Would you like to learn to fly?  
Would'ya?  
Would you like to see me try?  
  
Would you like to call the cops?  
Do you think it's time I stopped?  
Why are you running away?

A restless eye across a weary room  
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin  
The music played and played as we whirled without end  
No hint, no word her honour to defend  
  
I will, I will she sighed to my request  
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test  
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire  
I lead the way to the funeral pyre  
And without a thought of the consequence  
I gave in to my decadence  
  
One slip, and down the hole we fall  
It seems to take no time at all  
A momentary lapse of reason  
That binds a life for life  
A small regret, you won't forget,  
There'll be no sleep in here tonight  
  
Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?  
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?  
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown  
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone  
  
One slip, and down the hole we fall  
It seems to take no time at all  
A momentary lapse of reason  
That binds a life for life  
A small regret, you will never forget,  
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

On a distant shore, miles from land  
Stands the ebony totem in ebony sand  
A dream in a mist of gray...  
On a far distant shore...  
  
The pebble that stood alone  
And driftwood lies half buried  
Warm shallow waters sweep shells  
So the cockles shine...  
  
A bare winding carcass, stark  
Shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...  
Dry tears...  
Crisp flax squeaks tall reeds  
Make a circle of gray in a summer way, around man  
Stood on ground...  
  
I'm trying  
I'm trying to find you!  
To find you  
I'm living, I'm giving,  
To find you, To find you,  
I'm living, I'm living,  
I'm trying, I'm giving

Last night I had too much to drink  
Sitting in a club with so many fools  
Playing to rules  
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty  
I had another drink  
Drink, a, drink, a, drink, a, drink  
  
What a way to spend that evening  
They all turn up with their friends  
Playing the game  
But in the scene I should have been  
Far away  
Away, away, away, away, away  
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before  
I open the door to an empty room  
Then I forget  
  
The telephone rings and someone speaks  
She would very much like to go out to a show  
So what can I do, I can't think what to say  
She sees through anyway  
Away, away, away, away, away  
  
Out of the front door I go  
Traffic's moving rather slow  
Arriving late, there she waits  
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be  
Be, a, be, a, be, a, be, a, be  
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before  
I open the door to an empty room  
Then I forget

Button your lip. Don't let the shield slip.  
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask.  
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions  
You can hide, hide, hide,  
"I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five"  
"Ta! You was unlucky there son"  
"Time gentleman!"  
Behind paranoid eyes.  
  
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar.  
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar,  
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world  
With the boys in the crowd  
You hide, hide, hide,  
Behind petrified eyes.  
  
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory.  
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age  
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high.  
And you hide, hide, hide,  
Behind brown and mild eyes.

Big man, pig man  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
You well heeled big wheel  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
And when your hand is on your heart  
You're nearly a good laugh  
Almost a joker  
With your head down in the pig bin  
Saying 'Keep on digging'  
Pig stain on your fat chin  
What do you hope to find  
Down in the pig mine?  
You're nearly a laugh  
You're nearly a laugh  
But you're really a cry  
  
Bus stop rat bag  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
You fucked up old hag  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass  
You're nearly a good laugh  
Almost worth a quick grin  
You like the feel of steel  
You're hot stuff with a hatpin  
And good fun with a hand gun  
You're nearly a laugh  
You're nearly a laugh  
But you're really a cry  
  
Hey you, White House  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
You house proud town mouse  
Ha, ha, charade you are  
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street  
You're nearly a real treat  
All tight lips and cold feet  
And do you feel abused?  
You got to stem the evil tide  
And keep it all on the inside  
Mary you're nearly a treat  
Mary you're nearly a treat  
But you're really a cry

Did you know, it was all going to go so wrong for you  
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me  
Why did we tell you then  
You were always the golden boy then  
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes  
  
Hey you, did you ever realize what you'd become  
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from  
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway  
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes  
  
The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty  
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me  
And did you know  
  
I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes

Raving and drooling  
I fell on his neck with a scream  
He had a whole lotta  
Terminal shock in his eyes  
That's what you get  
For pretending the rest are not real  
  
Babbling and snapping  
At far away flies  
He will zig zag his way back  
Through memories of boredom and pain  
  
How does it feel  
To be empty and angry and spaced?  
Split up the middle  
Between the illusion of safety in numbers  
And the fist in your face

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better make your face up in  
Your favorite disguise.  
With your button down lips and your  
Roller blind eyes.  
With your empty smile  
And your hungry heart.  
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.  
With your nerves in tatters  
When the conch shell shatters  
And the hammers batter  
Down your door.  
You'd better run.  
  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,  
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.  
You better run all day  
And run all night.  
Keep your dirty feelings  
Deep inside.  
And if you're taking your girlfriend  
Out tonight  
You'd better park the car  
Well out of sight.  
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat  
Trying to pick her locks,  
They're gonna send you back to mother  
In a cardboard box.  
You better run.  
  
"Hey, open up!"  
"Hammer, hammer"

As I reach for a peach  
Slide a rind down behind  
The sofa in San Tropez.  
Breakin' a stick  
With a brick on the sand.  
Ridin' a wave  
In the wake of an old sedan.  
  
Sleepin' alone in the  
Drone of the darkness,  
Scratched by the sand that  
Fell from my love,  
Deep in my dreams and I  
Still hear her callin'  
"If you're alone,  
I'll come home."  
  
Backward and homebound,  
The pigeon, the dove,  
Gone with the wind  
And the rain, on an airplane.  
Owning a home  
With no silver spoon,  
I'm drinking champagne  
Like a good tycoon.  
  
Sooner than wait for  
A break in the weather,  
I'll gather my far-flung  
Thoughts together.  
Speeding away  
On the wind to a new day.  
And if you're alone  
I'll come home.  
  
And I pause for a while  
By a country style  
And listen to the things they say.  
Diggin' for gold  
With a hoe in my hand.  
Open a book  
Take a look at the way things stand.  
  
And you're leading me down  
To the place by the sea.  
I hear your soft voice  
Calling to me.  
Making a date for  
Later by phone  
And if you're alone  
I'll come home.

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers  
What'll be to crunch in your sisters  
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter  
Flack chap chau fauses, mouses, houses  
Flittin and hittin and fittin quack quack  
Watching the teley till all hours big time  
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers  
What'll be coming to crunch in your sisters  
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  

Mighty waves come crashing down,  
The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye  
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind,  
Is calling sailors to the deep  
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear  
Surf is high an' the sea is awash  
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads  
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun  
That was hot to touch  
And the sea was emerald green  
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear  
And I can see you smile  
Surf comes rushing up the beach  
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall  
Catfish dappled silver flashing  
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep

Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh  
She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow  
There is no other day  
Let's try it another way  
  
You'll lose your mind and play  
Free games for may  
See Emily play  
Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh  
  
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow  
There is no other day  
Let's try it another way  
You'll lose your mind and play  
  
Free games for may  
See Emily play  
Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh  
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily  
  
There is no other day  
Let's try it another way  
You'll lose your mind and play  
Free games for may  
  
See Emily play

Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn't mind  
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land  
All the way she smiles  
She goes up while he goes down, down  
Sits on a stick in the river  
Laughter in his sleep  
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit  
He doesn't know so then  
She goes up while he goes down, down  
Another time, another day  
A brother's way to leave  
Another time, another day  
  
She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon  
  
Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care  
All can see he's not there  
She grows up for another man, and he's down  
Another time, another day  
A brother's way to leave  
Another time, another day  
Another time, another day  
A brother's way to leave

Little by little the night turns around.  
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn.  
Lotus's lean on each other in union.  
Over the hills where a swallow is resting.  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
  
Over the mountain watching the watcher.  
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine.  
Morning to birth is born into shadow  
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine.  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.  
  
Who is the man who arrives at the wall?  
Making the shape of his questions at asking.  
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening.  
Will he remember the lesson of giving?  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.  
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.

They disembarked in '45  
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled  
There were too many spaces in the line.  
And gathered at the cenotaph  
All agreed with the hand on heart  
To sheath the sacrificial knives.  
But now  
She stands upon Southampton dock  
With her handkerchief  
And her summer frock  
Clings to her wet body in the rain.  
In quiet desperation knuckles  
White upon the slippery reins  
She bravely waves the boys Goodbye again.  
  
And still the dark stain spreads between  
Their shoulder blades.  
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves.  
And when the fight was over  
We spent what they had made.  
But in the bottom of our hearts  
We felt the final cut.

Stay and help me to end the day.  
And of you don't mind,  
We'll break a bottle of wine.  
Stick around and maybe we'll put one down,  
Because I want to find what lies behind those eyes.  
Midnight blue burning gold.  
A yellow moon is growing cold.  
  
I rise, looking through my morning eyes,  
Surprised to find you by my side.  
Rack my brain to try to remember your name  
To find the words to tell you good-bye.  
Morning dues.  
Newborn day.  
Midnight blue turned to gray.  
Midnight blue burning gold.  
A yellow moon is growing cold.

Would you like to say something before you leave  
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel  
We said good-bye before we said hello  
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all  
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud  
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year  
And I would like to know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Not a single word was said, delights still without fears  
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need  
I felt the cold far too soon - the wind of '95  
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there  
Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you  
Have you time before you leave to greet another man  
Just you let me know  
How do you feel, how do you feel, how do you feel?  
  
Good-bye to you  
Charlotte Kringles too  
I've had enough for one day

Swan lee got up at the running foot pow-wow,  
Heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.  
Chattering squaw untied the wigwam door,  
The chief blew smoke rings two by two!  
  
The land in silence stands...  
  
Swan lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,  
Loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.  
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,  
Pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,  
His eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.  
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested  
Tropic, swan lee had a bow by his side  
  
The land in silence stands  
  
Swan lee kept time, half on land, half on water,  
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.  
He followed his ears to the great water fall,  
Swan lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!  
  
The land in silence stands....  
  
Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,  
Confronted swan lee as his song he sang,  
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards  
It was all written down by long silas lang.  
  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands...  
The land in silence stands.

Doctor Doctor I'm in bed  
Doctor Doctor aching head  
Doctor Doctor gold is lead  
Doctor Doctor choke on bread  
Doctor Doctor underfed  
Doctor Doctor gold is lead  
Doctor Doctor Jesus bled  
Doctor Doctor pain is red  
Doctor Doctor dark doom  
Gruel ghoul greasy spoon  
Used spoon June gloom  
  
Music seems to help the pain  
Seems to motivate the brain  
Doctor kindly tell your wife  
That I'm alive  
Flowers thrive

Dogs of war and men of hate  
With no cause, we don't discriminate  
Discovery is to be disowned  
Our currency is flesh and bone  
Hell opened up and put on sale  
Gather 'round and haggle  
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive  
Even our masters don't know the web we weave  
  
One world, it's a battleground  
One world, and we will smash it down  
One world, one world  
  
Invisible transfers, long distance calls,  
Hollow laughter in marble halls  
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar  
Has unleashed the dogs of war  
You can't stop what has begun  
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion  
We all have a dark side, to say the least  
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast  
  
One world, it's a battleground  
One world, and we will smash it down  
One world, one world  
  
The dogs of war don't negotiate  
The dogs of war won't capitulate,  
They will take and you will give,  
And you must die so that they may live  
You can knock at any door,  
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before  
Well winners can lose and things can get strained  
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain.  
  
One world, it's a battleground  
One world, and we will smash it down  
One world, one world

Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes  
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time  
And far from flying high in clear blue skies  
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.  
  
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive  
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes  
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,  
Dial the combination, open the priest hole  
And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.  
  
There's a kid who had a big hallucination  
Making love to girls in magazines.  
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.  
Could anybody love him  
Or is it just a crazy dream?  
  
And if I show you my dark side  
Will you still hold me tonight?  
And if I open my heart to you  
And show you my weak side  
What would you do?  
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?  
Would you take the children away  
And leave me alone?  
And smile in reassurance  
As you whisper down the phone?  
Would you send me packing?  
Or would you take me home?  
  
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,  
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.  
I held the blade in trembling hands  
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang  
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.  
  
"Hello? Listen, I think I've got it. Okay, listen its a HaHa!"

Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere  
And build them a home, a little place of their own.  
The Fletcher Memorial  
Home for Incurable Tyrants and Kings.  
  
And they can appear to themselves every day  
On closed circuit T.V.  
To make sure they're still real.  
It's the only connection they feel.  
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig,  
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher, and Paisly,  
"Hello Maggie!"  
Mr. Brezhnev and party.  
"Who's the bald chap?"  
The ghost of McCarthy,  
The memories of Nixon.  
"Good-bye!"  
And now, adding color, a group of anonymous latin-  
American Meat packing glitterati.  
  
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?  
They can polish their medals and sharpen their  
Smiles, and amuse themselves playing games for awhile.  
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.  
  
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye  
With their favorite toys  
They'll be good girls and boys  
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial  
Wasters of life and limb.  
  
Is everyone in?  
Are you having a nice time?  
Now the final solution can be applied.

I want to tell you a story  
About a little man  
If I can.  
A gnome named Grimble Crumble.  
And little gnomes stay in their homes.  
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.  
  
He wore a scarlet tunic,  
A blue green hood,  
It looked quite good.  
He had a big adventure  
Amidst the grass  
Fresh air at last.  
Wining, dining, biding his time.  
And then one day, hooray!  
Another way for gnomes to say  
Oooooooooomray.  
  
Look at the sky, look at the river  
Isn't it good?  
Look at the sky, look at the river  
Isn't it good?  
Winding, finding places to go.  
And then one day, hooray!  
Another way for gnomes to say  
Oooooooooomray.  
Ooooooooooooooomray.

Come on, my friends,  
Let's make for the hills.  
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills.  
You can get your hands on whatever we find,  
Because I'm only coming along for the ride.  
  
Well, you go your way,  
I'll go mine.  
I don't care if we get there on time.  
Everybody's searching for something, they say.  
I'll get my kicks on the way.  
Over the mountains, across the seas  
Who knows what will be waiting for me?  
I could sail forever to strange sounding names.  
Faces of people and places don't change.  
  
All I have to do is just close my eyes  
To see the seagulls wheeling on those far distant skies.  
All I want to tell you, all I want to say  
Is count me in on the journey.  
Don't expect me to stay.

Floating down through the clouds  
Memories come rushing up to meet me now.  
In the space between the heavens  
and in the corner of some foreign field  
I had a dream.  
I had a dream.  
Good-bye Max.  
Good-bye Ma.  
After the serng slowly to the car  
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air  
You hear the tolling bell  
And touch the silk in your lapel  
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band  
You take her frail hand  
And hold on to the dream.  
A place to stay  
"Oi! A real one"  
Enough to eat  
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street  
Where you can speak out loud  
About your doubts and fears  
And what's more no-one ever disappears  
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.  
You can relax on both sides of the tracks  
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control  
And everyone has recourse to the law  
And no-one kills the children anymore.  
And no one kills the children anymore.  
  
Night after night  
Going round and round my brain  
His dream is driving me insane.  
In the corner of some foreign field  
The gunner sleeps tonight.  
What's done is done.  
We cannot just write off his final scene.  
Take heed of his dream.  
Take heed.

Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?  
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape.  
When I was their age all the lights went out.  
There was no time to whine or mope about.  
And even now part of me flies over  
Dresden at angels one five.  
Though they'll never fathom it begind my  
Sarcasm desperate memories lie.  
  
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.  
Cause that's the only time that I can really speak to you.  
And there is something that I've locked away  
A memory that is too painful  
To withstand the light of day.  
  
When we came back from the war the banners and  
Flags hung on everyone's door.  
We danced and we sang in the street and  
The church bells rang.  
But burning in my heart  
My memory smolders on  
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom.

Following the path as it leads towards the Darkness in the North  
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy  
They've seen that hope before  
And if you want to stay for a little bit  
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit  
Before you the night is beckoning  
And you know you can't delay  
You hear the night birds calling you  
But you can't catch the words they say  
Close your aching eyes beyond your name  
Mist is swelling, creatures crawling,  
Hear the roar get louder in your ears  
You know the folly was your own  
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears  
And if you want to stay for a little bit  
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit  
Before you the night is beckoning  
And you know you can't delay  
You hear the night birds calling you  
But you can't catch the words they say  
Close your aging eyes beyond your name  
Throw your thoughts back many years  
To the time when there was life in every morning  
Perhaps a day will come  
When the nights will be as clear as on that morning  
And if you want to stay for a little bit  
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit  
Before you the night is beckoning  
And you know you can't delay  
You hear the night birds calling you  
But you can't catch the words they say  
Close your ancient eyes beyond your name

Tell me true tell me why was Jesus crucified  
Is it for this that daddy died?  
Was it for you? was it me?  
Did I watch too much t.v.?  
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?  
If it wasn't for the nips  
Being so good at building ships  
The yards would still be open on the clyde  
And it can't be much fun for them  
Beneath the rising sun  
With all their kids committing suicide  
What have we done maggie what have we done  
What have we done to England  
Should we shout should we scream  
"What happened to the post war dream?"  
Oh Maggie Maggie what have we done?

The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows  
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.  
He didn't care.  
He stood in a field where barley grows.  
  
His head did no thinking  
His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up  
Rough and mice ran around on the ground  
He stood in a field where barley grows.  
  
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me  
But now he's resigned to his fate  
'Cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind.  
He stood in a field where barley grows.

In my rear view mirror the sun is going down  
Sinking behind bridges in the road  
And I think of all the good things  
That we have left undone  
And I suffer premonitions  
Confirm suspicions  
Of the holocaust to come.  
  
The wire that holds the cork  
That keeps the anger in  
Gives way  
And suddenly it's day again.  
The sun is in the east  
Even though the day is done.  
Two suns in the sunset  
Hmm  
Could be the human race is run.  
  
Like the moment when the brakes lock  
And you slide towards the big truck  
"Oh no!"  
"Daddy, Daddy!"  
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear.  
And you'll never hear their voices  
And you'll never see their faces  
You have no recourse to the law anymore.  
  
And as the windshield melts  
My tears evaporate  
Leaving only charcoal to defend.  
Finally I understand the feelings of the few.  
Ashes and diamonds  
Foe and friend  
We were all equal in the end.  
  
"And now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers  
Spreading from the east with an expected high of 4000 degrees  
Celsius"

Us and them  
And after all we're only ordinary men.  
Me and you  
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do.  
  
'Forward' he cried from the rear  
And the front rank died.  
The general is sat and the lines on the map  
Move from side to side.  
  
Black and blue  
And who knows which is which and who is who.  
Up and down  
And in the end it's only round and round. And round.  
  
'Haven't you heard it's a battle of words'  
The poster bearer cried.  
'Listen son' said the man with the gun,  
'There's room for you inside.'  
  
"Well I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick
sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he got off
light, 'cause I coulda given 'im a thrashin' but I only hit him once. It's
only the difference between right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't
cost nothing do they, eh?"  
  
Down and out  
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.  
With, without.  
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?  
  
Out of the way, it's a busy day  
I've got things on my mind.  
For want of the price of tea and a slice  
The old man died.

From morning to night I stayed out of sight  
Didn't recognize what I'd become  
No more than alive I'd barely survive  
In a word, overrun  
  
Won't hear a sound  
From my mouth  
I've spent too long  
On the inside out  
My skin is cold  
To the human touch  
This bleeding heart's  
Not beating much  
  
I murmured a vow of silence and now  
I don't even hear when I think aloud  
Extinguished by light I turn on the night  
Wear its darkness with an empty smile  
  
I'm creeping back to life  
My nervous system all away  
I'm wearing the inside out  
  
Look at him now  
He's paler somehow  
But he's coming round  
He's starting to choke  
It's been so long since he spoke  
Well he can have the words right from my mouth  
  
And with these words I can see  
Clear through the clouds that covered me  
Just give it time then speak my name  
Now we can hear ourselves again  
  
I'm holding out  
For the day  
When all the clouds  
Have blown away  
I'm with you now  
Can speak your name  
Now we can hear  
Ourselves again  
  
He's curled into the corner  
But still the screen is flickering  
With an endless stream of garbage to  
Curse the place  
In a sea of random images  
The self-destructing animal  
Waiting for the waves to break  
  
He's standing on the threshold  
Caught in fiery anger  
And hurled into the furnace he'll  
Curse the place  
He's torn in all directions  
And the screen is still flickering  
Waiting for the flames to break

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.  
Where have you been?  
It's alright we know where you've been.  
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,  
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'.  
You brought a guitar to punish your ma,  
And you didn't like school, and you  
Know you're nobody's fool,  
So welcome to the machine.  
  
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.  
What did you dream?  
It's alright we told you what to dream.  
You dreamed of a big star,  
He played a mean guitar,  
He always ate in the Steak Bar.  
He loved to drive in his Jaguar.  
So welcome to the Machine.

Shall we buy a new guitar?  
Shall we drive a more powerful car?  
Shall we work straight through the night?  
Shall we get into fights?  
Leave the lights on?  
Drop bombs?  
Do tours of the east?  
contract diseases?  
Bury bones?  
Break up homes?  
Send flowers by phone?  
Take to drink?  
Go to shrinks?  
Give up meat?  
Rarely sleep?  
Keep people as pets?  
Train dogs?  
Race rats?  
Fill the attic with cash?  
Bury treasure?  
Store up leisure?  
But never relax at all  
With our backs to the wall.

It was just before dawn  
One miserable morning in black '44,  
When the forward commander  
Was told to sit tight  
When he asked that his men be withdrawn.  
And the generals gave thanks  
As the other ranks  
Held back the enemy tanks for a while,  
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price  
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.  
  
And kind old King George sent mother a note  
When he heard that father was gone.  
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll,  
With gold leaf and all.  
And I found it one day  
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away,  
And my eyes still grow damp  
To remember  
His majesty signed  
With his own rubber stamp.  
  
It was dark all around,  
There was frost in the ground  
When the tigers broke free.  
And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers, Company Z.  
They were all left behind,  
Most of them dead,  
The rest of them dying.  
And that's how the high command  
Took my daddy from me.

Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...  
  
Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...  
  
Chalk underfoot, life I should prove  
Dancing in heat, our love and you...  
  
Wined and dined, oh it seemed just like a dream!  
Girl was so kind.  
Kind of love I'd never seen  
Only last summer, it's not so long ago...  
Just last summer, now musk winds blow...
