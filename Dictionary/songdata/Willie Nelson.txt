All my tears have fallen, I can cry no more.  
I've cried so mmuch since you have said goodbye.  
The pressure keeps on building up, within my heart.  
It grows and grows but still, my eyes are dry.  
Though my heart is breakin', tears refuse to start,  
So I've got to find a new way to cry.  
  
I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.  
It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.  
And until I forget you and can smile again,  
I've got to find a new way to cry.  
  
[Instrumental break]  
  
I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.  
It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.  
And until I forget you and can smile again,  
I've got to find a new way to cry.

I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme  
I've acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby  
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see  
There's no one more important to me  
So darling can't you please see through me  
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes  
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby  
We were alone and I was singin' my song,  
Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song  
Singin' my song

There's a land where I've been told every street is paved with gold  
And it's just across the borderline  
When it's time to take your turn here's a lesson that you must learn  
You could lose more than you'll ever find  
When you reach the broken promiseland every dream slips through your hand  
You'll know it's too late to change your mind  
'Cause you paid the price to come so far just to wind up where you are  
And you're still just across the borderline  
  
Up and down the Rio Grande a thousand footprints in the sand  
Reveal the secret no one can define  
The river flows on like a breath in between our life and death  
Who's the next to cross the borderline  
  
Hope remains when pride is gone and it keeps you moving on  
Calling you across the borderline  
When you reach the broken promiseland...  
And you're still just across the borderline

Afraid to tell you how much I care  
Afraid I'll need you  
And you won't be there  
I'd love to take you into my heart  
But something tells me  
We would only part  
I loved and lost  
Just one love ago  
I paid the cost and it hurt me so  
A heart gets careless  
When vows are made  
I want to love you but I'm so afraid  
  
I loved and lost  
Just one love ago  
I paid the cost and it hurt me so  
A heart gets careless  
When vows are made  
I want to love you but I'm so afraid

WAYLON:  
It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago  
She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights  
There in the darkness with the radio, playin' low  
The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove  
JOHNNY:  
And I remember what she said to me  
How she swore that it would never end  
I remember how she held me oh, so tight  
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then  
CHORUS (ALL):  
Against the wind  
We were running against the wind  
We were young and strong  
But just running against the wind  
WILLIE:  
And the years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone  
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home  
I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads  
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live  
Never worrying about paying or how much I owed  
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breakin' all of the rules I could bend  
I began to find myself searchin'  
Searchin' for shelter again and again  
CHORUS (ALL):  
Against the wind  
We were running against the wind  
I found myself seekin'  
Shelter against the wind  
WILLIE:  
All those drifter's days are passed me now  
I've got so much more to think about  
JOHNNY:  
Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in, what to leave out  
CHORUS (ALL):  
Against the wind  
We were running against the wind  
Well I'm older now and still  
Running against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  

You can't break your eggs to count your chickens  
And you can't break your neck to keep your ducks all in a row  
But don't think every chance you take, has to mean a new mistake  
It ain't necessarily so  
Now depending on the soil and the season  
You can plant a seed and you can watch it grow  
But you can't have a guarantee 'cause everything that aught to be  
Ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so  
I'd like to have more faith in human logic  
Basin' all the rules on the proof that you can show  
But I can't take my guesses back that I based on all those facts  
That ain't necessarily so  
And every time I follow what I'm feelin'  
I end up in the same place my heart would have me go  
If there's one rule of life I trust, it's everything outside your gut  
Ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so  

There is nothing I can do  
Nothing I can say  
That folks don't criticize me  
But I'm gonna do  
Just what I want to anyway  
Don't care if they all despise me  
  
If I go to church on Sunday  
And I honky tonk all day Monday  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
And if I should get a feeling  
I wanna dance upon the ceiling  
Ain't nobody's business, oh it ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
If I stay out all night  
Spend all my money, well that's all right  
It ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
You try to tell me I got no right to sing the blues  
What gives you the right to tell me what I should do?  
It ain't nobody's, ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
Well it ain't nobody's business  
It ain't no it ain't nobody's business  
You know it ain't nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business what I do  
Whoa what I do  
You know it ain't nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business if I do

Big Jim Butcher was the king of the hill he ran his business with a deadly
will  
His foreman John had a pretty wife the way she looked cut Jim like a knife  
John was weak and his wife was too her name was Kate and she fell in too  
She let Big Jim do what he had to do and John stood by and his life was
through  
  
It was all in the name of love all in the name of love  
You can't change the stars above all in the name of love  
John took a bottle one drink at a time atared off in space as he lost his mind  
Knew who it was on the telephone he saw it all and he felt so alone  
  
One dark morning John stood up like a man he took his shotgun with a steady
hand  
He went to the motel broke the door in he left two holes where two hearts had
been  
He called the preacher and he called the law  
And when they got there it was pretty raw  
He said boys you better come and take me away  
I've done all I can do in the name of love today

I'll be loving you, always  
With a love that's true, always  
When the things you plan  
Need a helping hand  
  
I will understand, always, always  
Days may not be fair, always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year, but, always  
Days may not be fair, always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
And, not for just a year, but, always

Always late with your kisses  
Won't you come to my arms  
Sweet darling and stay  
Always late with your kisses  
Why oh why do you want to do me this way  
How long do you think that I can wait  
When you know you're always late  
Always late with your kisses  
Why why why do you want to do me this way  
  
How long do you think that I can wait  
When you know you're always late  
Always late with your kisses  
Why why why do you want to do me this way

Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could have  
And maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should have  
  
If I made you feel second best  
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
And I guess I never told you  
I'm so happy that you're mine  
  
Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me  
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me  
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied  
I'll keep you satisfied

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relived  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hours I first believed  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Now when we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
That when we first begun  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see

O beautiful for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above thy fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
O beautiful for pilgrim feet  
Whose stern, impassioned stress  
A thoroughfare for freedom beat  
Across the wilderness  
  
America, America  
God mend thine every flaw  
Confirm thy soul in self control  
Thy liberty in law  
  
O beautiful for heroes proved  
In liberating strife  
Who more than self their country loved  
And mercy more than life  
  
America, America  
May God thy gold refine  
Till all success be nobleness  
And every gain divine  
  
O beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
O beautiful for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above thy fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea

Many's the time I've been mistaken and many times confused  
Yes and I've often felt forsaken and certainly misused  
Oh but I'm alright I'm alright just weary to my bones  
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home so far away from home  
  
Don't know a soul who has not been battered  
Don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees  
Oh but it's alright it's alright for we've lived so well so long  
Still when I think of the road we're traveling on I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
Looking back down at me smiled reassuredly  
I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The statue of liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower come on the ship that sails the
moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hours and sing an American tune  
Oh but it's alright it's alright can't be forever blessed  
Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day and I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying to get some rest

Angel eyes angel eyes  
The ways of the world are feeble  
Don't give up on simple people  
Angle eyes stun those nights  
The blues you can live without  
It's not what you song's about  
Angel eyes angel eyes  
Tell me what would we're doin'  
Without the light from angel eyes  
  
You can move the hearts of men  
Just with a phrase you're turning  
Since hearts ever have been yearning  
Bear with us bear so alone  
Thin lines you've been living on  
Are so close to the danger zone  
Angel eyes angel eyes  
Tell me what would we're doin'  
Without the light from angel eyes

If you had not have fallen  
Then I would not have found you  
Angel flying too close to the ground  
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while  
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down  
  
I knew someday that you would fly away  
For love's the greatest healer to be found  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground  
  
Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound  
I'd rather see you up than see you down  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground.  
  
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember  
Angel flying too close to the ground.

I'd like to rush into somebody's arms  
And lose myself inside  
But just any arms won't do  
They must belong to you  
I'd like to know the soothing comfort  
Of a love that never dies  
But just any old love won't do  
That love must come from you  
I've tried so hard to find someone to love  
Since I lost you,  
But they only make me realize  
How much that I need you  
I'd like to know when I grow older  
Someone's heart will still be true  
But just any old heart won't do  
It must belong to you

Oh, look around you  
Look down the bar from you  
The lonely faces that you see  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
These are your friends  
But are they real friends  
Do they love you the same as me  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
You seem in such a hurry to live this kind of life  
You've caused so many tears and misery  
  
Look around you, take a good look  
And tell me what you see  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be  
  
Don't let my tears persuade you, I had hoped I wouldn't cry  
But lately, teardrops seem a part of me  
  
Oh, look around you, take a good look  
At all the lonely used-to-be's  
Are you sure that this is where you want to be

Away in a manger  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down His sweet head  
  
The stars in the bright sky  
Looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus  
Asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
The poor Baby wakes  
But little Lord Jesus  
No crying He makes  
  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my side  
'Til morning is nigh  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus  
I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with Thee there

I guess my heart has settled back to Earth.  
I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth.  
But true love is both a blessing and a curse.  
Today my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago.  
But the dream for you had ended and you let me know.  
So I bounced from sky to sky,  
Tryin' to keep the dream alive.  
But everything I did just made it worse.  
Guess my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Love created songs that I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters ring  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.  
  
Songs our love created I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters?red?.  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.  
  
Our song will never have a final verse,  
Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth

No won't you come along with me  
Down the Mississippi  
We'll take trip to the land of dreams  
Floatin' down the river down to New Orleans  
  
And the band'll be there to meet us  
Oh, friends to greet us  
That's where the light and the dark folks meet  
A heaven on earth - they call it Basin Street  
  
Basin Street is the street  
Where the elite always meet  
Out in New Orleans, the land of dreams  
You'll never know how nice it seems  
Or just how much it really means  
And I'd rather be, yes-sir-ee  
New Orleans the land of dreams  
Where I can lose my Basin Street blues  
  
Now ain't you glad you came with me  
We went down the Mississippi  
We took a trip  
To the land of dreams  
We floated down the river  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Basin Street - that's the street  
Where the elite always meet  
Down in New Orleans, the land of dreams  
And you'll never know how nice it seems  
Or just how much it really means  
I'd rather be, yes-sir-ee  
New Orleans the land of dreams  
Where I can lose my Basin Street blues

It's the way that you kiss me  
It's the way that you don't  
It's the way that you'll miss me  
When you swear that you won't  
  
There's a feeling you give me  
When we talk on the phone  
God, I hope you outlive me  
So I'm never alone  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there, I'll be there for you  
  
I may lack social graces  
But I won't swallow my pride  
There are millions of places, places  
I could be but I'm here by your side  
  
And whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there for you  
  
Though there's nothing to guide us  
We will weather the storm  
Till the heavens divide us  
I will keep you from harm  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
And whatever you do, I will promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there  
  
Whatever you do, I will be there for you  
Through the thunder, the wind and the rain  
(Be there for you)  
I will always be true, this I promise to you  
I will be there  
(Be there)  
I'll be there for you  
  
Show, show, show, show, show

I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me  
I'll have a blue Christmas for certain  
And when that blue blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas  
[ guitar ]  
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'  
I'll have a blue mem'ry for certain  
You'll be doing alright...  
You'll be doing alright...  
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'd like to say that I tried  
It fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tables  
With food untouched,  
I couldn't see the future.  
I liked the past too much  
I've been going door to door like I got something to sell,  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
So go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up, I give up.  
  
Something about her that's cold.  
She's blowing through the trees,  
Leaving me raw  
As the words come out,  
I get confused.  
I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon.  
She's inside me like a secret  
And I got no one to tell.  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
Go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up.  
I give up.

Blue skies smilin' at me  
Nothin' but blue skies do I see  
Bluebirds singin' a song  
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long  
  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never saw things goin' so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on  
(Blue skies smilin' at me  
Nothin' but blue skies do I see)  
  
Never saw the sun shinin' so bright  
Never saw things goin' so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on  
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

When you're weary and feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all  
I'm on your side when times get rough and friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
When you're down and out when you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you  
I'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
  
Sail on silver girl sail on by  
Your time has come to shine all your dreams're on their way  
See how they shine if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind  
I will ease your mind

(yeah)  
  
(Come on now, bring it on down to my house, boys, right)  
  
Bring it on down to my house honey, there ain't nobody home but me  
Bring it on down to my house honey, I need your company  
Tom cat sittin' on the railroad track  
Well he hollered at the Mama cat, she answered back  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
  
(Oh, yes)  
  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
Bring it on down to my house honey, I need your company  
My gal Sal, she makes good pie  
I eat so much I could nearly die  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
  
(yes)  
  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
Bring it on down to my house honey, I need your company  
Say old man, can ya play the fiddle  
Yes, by crackies I can play a little  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me

Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
Bring it on down to my house honey, I need your company  
Bot-do, noddleaten do, sh'bodleaten do, whoa  
Bring it on down to my house honey, ain't nobody home but me  
  
Oh yes babe, aint' nobody home but me

I made myself a promise, the day you put me down,  
That I wouldn't see you if you came around.  
But here you are, within my arms, the way you used to be.  
And I broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
They told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go:  
I made myself a promise that I'd only say hello.  
I knew you'd only hurt me, but it's such sweet misery,  
So I broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,  
And I know who that someone's bound to be.  
And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,  
And broke the promise that I made to me.  
  
A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,  
And I know who that someone's bound to be.  
And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,  
And broke the promise that I made to me.

Tonight in a bar alone  
I'm sitting apart from  
The laughter and the cheer  
Scenes from the past  
Rise before me while  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone  
Who loved me brings  
Along salty tears to my eyes  
And I know that my life's  
Been a failure  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
  
I'm seeing the road  
That I've traveled  
A road paved  
With heartaches and tears  
And I'm seeing the past  
That I've wasted  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone who loved me...

Laugh with me, buddy  
Jest with me, buddy  
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
If I ever needed you, buddy  
You know how I really do, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
  
I cry at the least little thing, buddy  
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy  
Talk to me, buddy  
Stay with me, buddy  
Let's don't let her get away, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
  
Let's talk about things as they were, buddy  
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy  
Laugh with me, buddy  
Jest with me, buddy  
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

Each time that I hold you close, here in my arms  
I'm building heartaches  
Each time that I kiss your lips, so sweet and warm  
I'm building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know it's a lie  
An' just a dream from which I must awake  
  
That each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So I'm building heartaches  
  
When people ask me what I'm doin', here's what I tell  
I'm building heartaches  
And each kiss you give me is a tear that hasn't fell  
So I'm building heartaches  
  
And when you say you love me  
We both know it's a lie  
An' just a dream from which I must awake  
  
And each sweet word you tell me  
Is a heartache in disguise  
So I'm building heartaches

Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong  
  
Don't know why but the one I love left me  
Left me lonely and cold and so weak  
And I need someone's arms to hold me till  
I'm strong enough to get back on my feet  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong  
  
Can I sleep in your arms tonight  
Lady, it's so cold lying here all alone  
And I have no hold to hold on you  
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong

One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay  
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid  
The memory of the that night of love is lingering yet  
And I know I never will forget  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me

  
The Cisco Kid was a friend of mine  
The Cisco Kid was a friend of mine  
He drink whiskey, Poncho drink the wine  
He drink whiskey, Poncho drink the wine  
  
We met down on the fort of Rio Grande  
We met down on the fort of Rio Grande  
Eat the salted peanuts out of can  
Eat the salted peanuts out the can  
  
The outlaws had us pinned down at the fort  
The outlaws had us pinned down at the fort  
Cisco came in blastin', drinkin' port  
Cisco came in blastin', drinkin' port  
  
They rode the sunset, horse was made of steel  
They rode the sunset, horse was made of steel  
Chased a gringo last night through a field  
Chased a gringo last night through a field  
  
The Cisco Kid was a friend of mine

Riding on the city of New Orleans  
Illinois central Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along the southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out at Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' trains that have no names  
Freight yards full of old black men  
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
[Chorus]  
Good morning, America  
How are you?  
Don't you know me? I'm your native son  
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans  
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done  
  
Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman Porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel  
Mothers with their babes asleep  
Are rockin' to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nighttime on the city of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee  
Half way home, we'll be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness  
Rolling down to the sea  
And all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This trains got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
[Chorus]

Way down in Columbus Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee  
Way down in Columbus Stockade friends have turned their backs on me  
Go on and leave me if you wish to never let me cross your mind  
In your heart you love another leave me little darlin' I don't mind  
Way down in Columbus Georgia...  
[ fiddle - guitar ]  
Way down in Columbus Georgia...  
Leave me little darlin' I don't mind leave me little darlin' I don't mind  
  
  

I can hear the wind blowing in my mind  
Just the way it used to do through the Georgia pines  
And you were there to answer when I called  
You and me, Lord knows, we had it all  
  
Remember how I used to touch your hair, baby  
Looking for the feeling, it was always there  
You're the best thing in my life I can recall  
Yeah baby, you and me, we had it all  
  
I know that we can never live those times again  
And I get old feelings that I'll be there back again  
And I'll stay with you girl just as long as I can  
'Cause it was so good, oh, it was so good, you know  
Yes, it was so good when I was your man  
  
And I'll never stop believing in your smile  
Even though, you didn't stay, it was all worth while  
And I know that beneath of it all, baby  
Just you and me, we had it all  
  
You and me, we had it all  
You and me, we had it all

You called me country Willie  
The night you walked away  
With the one who promised you a life of joy  
You thought my life too simple  
And your was much too gay  
To spend it living with a country boy  
I'm writing you this letter  
I write you every day  
I hope that you've received the ones before  
But I've heard not one word from you  
And every day I pray  
That you will not forget your country boy  
While you're living in the city  
With riches round your door  
Is this your love  
Is this your kind of joy  
Or do you find  
There's something missing  
Does your heart cry out for more  
And do you sometimes miss your country boy  
  
A cottage in the country  
With roses round the door  
Could not compete  
With flashing city lights  
But it's all I have to offer  
Except for one thing more  
A heart so filled with love  
That it could die  
Well it's time to end this letter  
The light of dawn is near  
A lonely night has passed  
But there'll be more  
Just one more thing in closing  
For all the world to hear  
Come home I love you  
Signed your country boy

Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)  
Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas.  
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.  
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.  
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.  
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.  
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.  
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.  
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?  
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his
brother.  
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.  
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.  
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.  
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.  
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?  
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his
brother.  
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out.  
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.  
  
  
  

I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely  
I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue  
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted  
And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry  
Wondering what in the world did I do  
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you  
I'm crazy for thinking

If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye  
It's no secret you feel better if you cry  
When waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real  
But it's only false emotions that you feel  
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long  
And your blues keep gettin' bluer with each song  
Remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky  
So let your head down and go on and cry  
If your heartaches...  
[ guitar ]

The morning that you left me was just another day  
How could I see the sorrow that had found me  
Then you left and told me that I was in your way  
And I turned and ran as heaven fell around me  
I stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure  
I live within a world that had no sunshine  
When you left me darling my world came to an end  
And there was darkness on the face of the earth  
The stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found  
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around  
Why did you ever leave me you knew how it would hurt  
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth  
  
The stars fell out of heaven...  
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth

When you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talking to those rich folks that you know  
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company  
You know that I could never be alone  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
Well when you're sitting back in your pink rose Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Days  
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon  
And another girl can take my pain away  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by US mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flower by the US mail  
Send me dead flowers at my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
No I won't forget to put roses on your grave  

Headed down life's crooked road lot of things I never knowed  
And because of me not knowin' I now pine  
Trouble got in the trail spent the next five years in jail  
Should have read that detour sign  
Detour there's a muddy road ahead detour paid no mind to what it said  
Detour oh the bitter things I find should have read that detour sign  
  
I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud  
And I thought that my heart strings were made of twine  
But the father I go the more sorrow I know should have read that detour sign  
Detour there's a muddy road ahead...  
Should have read that detour sign should have read that detour sign

Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love don't fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me out forever but I ask you please don't fence me in  
Just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses  
Can't look at hubbles and I can't stand fences don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose...  
Don't fence me in don't fence me in

Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on the Rock 'n' Roll  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Down at the corner beer joint, dancin' on a hardwood floor  
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before  
Than they did before, than they did before  
Her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before  
  
Down at corner beer joint dancing to the Rock 'n' Roll  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Likes to move her soul, move her soul  
Sister likes to do it Lord, sister likes to move her soul  
Sister comin' home, Momma gonna let her sleep the whole day long  
Sister comin' home, Momma gonna let her sleep the whole day long

This was my last mistake  
That's all her heart could take  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
Her lips won't kiss me now  
The lips that I taught how  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye  
What can I tell her  
That I haven't told her  
That would change her mind  
'Cause she heard that line before  
Now all that's left for me  
Is just the memory of all  
Those happy days gone by  
Now we're down to our last goodbye

I just thought, that you would like to know  
That I would, do anything, just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams
come true  
Well I just thought, that you would like to know, that I... I would climb the
highest tree  
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams, come true  
I know, that it seems like, I am full of hot air  
But my heart is in the right place  
I swear, I swear  
I just thought that you, would like to know, that I... I would do anything  
Just to make your dreams, just to make your dreams come true  
Now I know that it seems like, I'm full of hot air

Come true

I've traveled o'er the country wide a seekin' fortune fair  
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere  
From Portland East and Portland West and back along the line  
I'm goin' now to a place that's best that old home town of mine  
Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view  
Eight more miles on this old road and I 'll never more be blue  
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start  
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart  
  
There's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all  
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall  
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land  
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand  
Oh eight more miles and Louisville...  
  
Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home  
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam  
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills  
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville  
Eight more miles to Louisville...

Each time you hurt me, you say you're sorry.  
I try to understand, and say: "OK."  
But there must be an end to understanding,  
And the end of mine can't be too far away.  
  
I try to understand that you're "only human".  
And "we all make mistakes" every day.  
But there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know that I just can't go on this way.  
  
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:  
Ask too much of one and both will die.  
And there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.  
  
Don't you know that love and understanding go together:  
Ask too much of one and both will die.  
And there must be an end to understanding,  
And I know, someday, I'll reach the end of mine.

Everybody's talkin' 'bout me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes in my mind  
Everybody stops to starin'  
I don't even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the fallin' rain  
Going where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
And sailin' on summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' 'bout me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes of my mind  
Everybody stops to starin'  
I don't even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I won't let you leave my love behind  
I won't let you leave my love behind  
I won't let you leave my love behind

When I look out over a green field of clover  
Or watch the sunset at the end of the day  
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
I see a fountain flow from a mountain  
Or see April showers bring flowers to May  
I can't help but ponder, life is such a wonder  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
Words can't describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm  
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away  
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger  
The storm's even beautiful in it's own way  
  
When I see the leaves drop from off of the treetops  
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day  
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder  
God, made all things beautiful in their own way  
  
Words can't describe what I feel inside  
When I see the beauty in each coming day  
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold  
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way  
  
In it's own way  
In it's own way

I know why I waited  
Know why I've been blue  
I've been waiting each day  
For someone exactly like you  
  
Why should I spend some money  
On a show or two  
When nobody sings these love songs  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I wanna give this world to you  
You make me understand  
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming  
And schemes I'm scheming  
  
Now I know why my mama  
She taught me to be true  
She knew just around the corner  
Was somebody like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I wanna give this world to you  
Baby you make me understand  
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming  
And schemes I'm scheming  
  
Now I know why my mama  
She taught me to be true  
She knew just around the corner  
Yes she knew just around the corner  
Was somebody like you

These lines in my face, caused from worry,  
Grow deeper as you walk out of sight.  
Mine is the face of a fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.  
  
Round one: you told me you loved me,  
An' I felt my heart falling there an' then.  
The last round: you walked tall an' left me,  
An' I guess my heart's losing again.  
  
Mine is the face of a fighter:  
I fought for your love with all my might.  
Mine is the face of fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.  
  
Yes, mine is the face of a fighter:  
I fought for your love with all my might.  
Mine is the face of fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.

When I look at the letter that you wrote to me  
It's you that I'm thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet  
I remember our faded love  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you darlin' more and more every day  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past and all the pleasure we had,  
As I watch the mating of a dove,  
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.  
I remember our faded love.  
  
[Chorus]

There's a family Bible on the table  
Each page is torn and hard to read  
But the family Bible on the table  
Will ever be my key to memories  
At the end of day when work was over  
And when the evening meal was done  
Dad would read to us from the family Bible  
And we'd count our many blessings one by one  
I can see us sittin' round the table  
When from the family Bible dad would read  
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages cleft for me  
  
Now this old world of ours is full of trouble  
This old world would also better be  
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables  
And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me  
I can see us sittin' round the table  
When from the family Bible dad would read  
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages  
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

If the sun's too hot cool it if you can  
Better go out and get yourself a five cent fan  
And fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
Just met myself a new girl and her name was Sue  
She said, "To make love to you, honey tell you what to do"  
You gotta fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
My mamma's in the kitchen, I just heard that back door slam  
Come out of that kitchen honey, quit scorching that ham  
And let's just fan it, fan it, you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
Well, I got six months in jail, my back turned to the wall  
Fannin' that thing was the cause of it all  
So fan it, fan it, gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home

Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind  
You know I'll always love you and I can't forget the days when you were mine  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy  
Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me  
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mind  
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
  
The years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young man's
dreams  
Of all the golden years and growing old together you and me  
You asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mind  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time

Out where the bright lights are glowing  
You're drawn like a moth to a flame  
You laugh while the wine's overflowing  
While I sit and whisper your name  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting  
But my walls have nothing to say  
I'm made for love not for hating  
So here where you left I stay  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me  
  
One night with you is like heaven  
And so while I'm walking the floor  
I listen for steps in the hallway  
And wait for your knock on my door  
Four walls to hear me  
Four walls to see  
Four walls too near me  
Closing in on me

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and have some fun now before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye saying don't you cry I'll be back again some day

Why do I still write why do I still call  
Why do I still think there's hope for us at all  
These are the tings I hate but they're the things I do to get over you  
Sunsets make me cry old pictures make me grin  
But I don't really care to see your face again  
These are the things I say but they're so hard to do like gettin' over you  
You gotta believe that there's a reason that we surrender up our hearts  
But there's a vantage point and it takes some time to find  
Where you can see how all the pieces fit as you watch 'em fall apart  
  
Now I don't think it's right and you don't know what's wrong  
My heart keeps asking me just where do we belong  
It's not as though my life ain't hard enough to do try gettin' over you  
  
You gotta believe that there's a reason...  
  
Now other people say stop living in the past  
But when there's nothin' left it's your memory that lasts  
It's later than you think but still this isn't through this gettin' over you  
Now it's later than you think and still this isn't through this gettin' over
you

The closer I get to my home Lord the more I want to be there  
There'll be a gatherin' of loved ones and friends Lord you know I want to be
there  
There'll be a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours  
Bout how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there  
  
Well there's old Charlie Toll they threw away the mold when they made him  
And Jimmy McCline it looks like the wine's finally laid him  
And Billie McRae that I could any day in a card game  
And Bessie McNeal but her tears are real I can see pain  
There's a mixture of teardrops...  
  
Lord thanks for ride I got a feeling inside that I know you  
And if you see your way you're welcome to stay 'cause I'm gonna need you  
There's be a mixture of teardrops....

From old Montana down to Alabam' I've been before and I'll travel again  
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down  
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way  
Goin' board the Golden Rocket and leave this town  
  
I was a good engine a runnin' on time but baby I'm switchin' to another line  
So honey never hang your signal out for me  
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track  
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back  
  
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away  
Hear that lonesome whistle blow that's your cue and by now you know  
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee  
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my
trail  
  
This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away  
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right  
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me  
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your
flame  
  
And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away  
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low  
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line  
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be
long  
  
This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind  
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl let's rise and shine good
mornin' ya all  
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day  
When I kissed my baby in the station door the whistle blew like it never
before  
Of the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away

A long time forgotten are dreams that just fell by the way  
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today  
But she never complains of the bad times or the bad things he's done  
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come  
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man  
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand  
And through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in
hand  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man  
  
Now he likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends  
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again  
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can  
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man  
She's a good hearted woman...  
She's a good hearted woman...

Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA  
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leavin' town  
Some caught a freight some caught a plane find the sunshine leave the rain  
They said this town'll waste your time I guess they're right it's wastin' mine  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
  
You know my heart keeps telling me you're not a kid at thirty-three  
You play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life  
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain  
I'd love to try and settle down but everybody's leavin' town  
Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues

When I ran to the store with a penny  
And when youth was abundant and plenty  
Classify these as good times good times  
When I rolled rubber tires in the driveway  
Pulled a purse on a string across the highway  
Classify these as good times good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm  
Good times are coming humming hmm  
  
Go to school  
Fight a war  
Working steady  
Meet a girl  
Fall in love  
For I'm ready  
Classify these  
As good times  
Good times  
  
Here I sit with a drink and a mem'ry  
But I'm not cold I'm not wet and I'm not hungry  
So classify these as good times good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm good times

All the years combine, they melt into a dream,  
A broken angel sings from a guitar.  
In the end there's just a song comes cryin' up the night  
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years.  
Stella blue. Stella blue.  
  
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,  
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.  
  
In the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind.  
Down every lonely street that's ever been  
Stella blue. Stella blue.  
  
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying.  
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,  
Gonna make them shine, shine  
  
It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,  
There's nothing you can hold, for very long.  
And when you hear that song come crying like the wind,  
It seems like all this life was just a dream.  
Stella blue. Stella blue

I'm sorry but you come to the wrong house  
But I know who those flowers are for  
The flowers that you have are for  
Someone who's happy  
And happiness lives next door  
Someone sends her flowers each evening  
And her young heart is flooded with joy  
So don't keep her waiting  
Deliver her flowers to happiness  
Who lives next door  
The only one who would send flowers to you  
Is gone to return no more  
But there's some consolation to know  
Someone is happy  
And happiness lives next door  
The only one who would send flowers to you  
Is gone to return no more

Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem  
  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
  
Hail the Heaven born Prince of peace  
Hail the Son of righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings  
Risen with healing in His wings  
  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that Man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King

Have I stayed away too long  
Have I stayed away too long  
If I came home tonight  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
The love light that shone so strong  
Sweet love light that shone so strong  
If I came home tonight  
Would that same light be shining  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
I'm just outside of town  
And I'll soon be at your door  
But maybe I'd be wrong  
To hurry there  
I'd best keep out of town  
And worry you no more  
Maybe someone else  
Has made you care  
  
Have all of my dreams gone wrong  
My beautiful dreams gone wrong  
If I came home tonight w  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long  
  
If I came home tonight  
Would you still be my darling  
Or have I stayed away too long

Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told you how with all my heart  
And soul I need you  
Well darling I'm telling you now  
My heart would break in two if I should lose you I'm no good without you
anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping  
Every dream that I dream is you somehow  
And have I told you how my every thought  
Is in your keeping  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now  
My world would end today if I should lose you  
'Cause I'm no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now

He was a friend of mine  
Every time I think of him  
I just can't keep from cryin'  
'Cause he was a friend of mine  
  
He died on the road  
He died on the road  
He just kept on moving  
Never reaped what he could sow  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
I stole away and cried  
I stole away and cried  
'Cause I never had too much money  
And I never been quite satisfied  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
He never done no wrong  
He never done no wrong  
A thousand miles from home  
And he never harmed no one  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
He was a friend of mine  
He was a friend of mine  
Every time I hear his name Lord  
I just can't keep from cryin'  
'Cause he was a friend of mine

They're working while I'm missing you those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine  
They'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind  
My future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time  
They let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time  
And soon they'll let me sleep again those healing hands of time  
So already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time  
I'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time

I want to live  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold  
Its these expressions I never give  
That keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
I've been to Hollywood  
I've been to Redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, its such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
  
Keep me searching for a heart of gold  
You keep me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

Heartache number one was when you left me  
I never knew that I could hurt this way  
And heartache number two was when you came back again  
You came back and never meant to stay  
  
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score  
Every day you love me less  
Each day I love you more  
  
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win  
But the day that I'll stop counting  
That's the day my world would end  
  
Heartache number three was when you called me  
And said that you were coming back to stay  
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door  
I waited, but you must have lost your way  
  
Now I've got heartaches by the number  
And the day that I'll stop counting  
That's the day my world will end

Started out with the dreams  
And the plans of a wise man  
And ended up with the heartaches of a fool  
  
As a boy I would walk through the valley  
Gazed at the world all around  
Made a vow that somehow I would find fame and fortune  
I found it but look at me now  
  
I had a sweetheart who would love me forever  
Didn't need her, I would reign all alone  
And look at me, I'm the king of cold lonely castle  
The queen of my heart is gone  
  
So get around me, you fools for a dollar  
Listen to me, a lesson you'll learn  
Well there's happiness and love sent from heaven above  
And the fires of ambition will burn  
  
Started out with the dreams  
And the plans of a wise man  
And ended up with the heartaches of a fool

There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
And the bankers are taking my home and my land from me  
There's a big achin' hole in my chest now where my heart was  
And a hole in the sky where God used to be  
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
There's a well where the water's so bitter nobody can drink  
Ain't no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I can't speak  
Don't they know that I'm dyin' why's nobody cryin' for me  
My American dream fell apart at the seams  
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means  
  
There's a home place under fire tonight in a heartland  
And bankers are taking the homes and the land away  
There's a young boy closin' his eyes tonight in a heartland  
Who will wake up a man with some land and a loan he can't pay  
His American dream fell apart at the seams  
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means  
My American dream...  
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland  
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland

Hello walls (hello hello) how things go for you today  
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away  
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me  
But lonely walls I'll keep you company  
Hello window well (hello hello) I see that you're still here  
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared  
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane  
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain  
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned  
Yes we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can  
Hello ceiling (hello hello) I'm gonna stare at you a while  
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me awhile  
We gotta all stick together or else I'll lose my mind  
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long long time (hello hello)

Take the ribbons from your hair shake 'em loose and let 'em fall  
Let 'em fall against your chin like the shadows on the wall  
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light  
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night  
  
Well I don't care who's right or wrong and I won't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow cause tonight I need a friend  
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night  
  
Well I don't care who's right or wrong...  
I can't stand to be alone help me make it through the night

Let's give thanks to the Lord above cause Santa Claus comes tonight  
  
  

I thought if I could be with you  
Maybe I'd feel better  
But I'm afraid I took advantage of your love  
I thought if you'd just hold me tight  
Maybe I'd forget her  
But I don't suppose as yet  
You've held me tight enough  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
Put your arms around me  
Hold me close, hold me tight and long  
Please hold me tighter  
I still remember  
And I can't love again  
Until her memory's gone  
  
Please hold me tighter

Haven't got a worry  
Haven't got a care  
Haven't got a thing to call my own  
Though I'm out of money  
I'm a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
When I greet my neighbor with a hi y'all  
I'm as welcome as a king upon a throne  
But when I feel like braggin'  
I just up and say  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
  
Well I travel around the country on my merry way  
I've been to crowds and felt I was alone  
But when I feel like braggin'  
I just up and say  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
  
And there's a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday she's goin' to be my very own  
And we'll buy a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
Well I haven't got a worry  
Haven't got a care  
Haven't got a thing to call my own  
And though I'm out of money  
I'm a millionaire  
I still have my home in San Antone  
  
And there's a sweet somebody by the Alamo  
Someday she's goin' to be my very own  
And then I'll build a high chair in a year or so  
For our little home in San Antone  
  
I'm a native son of San Antone  
For our little home in San Antone

High on a mountain in western Montana  
A silhouette moves cross a cinnamon sky  
Ridin' along on a horse he called Music  
With a song on his lips, and a tear in his eye  
  
He dreams of a time and a lady that loved him  
And how he would sing her sweet lullabye  
But we don't ever ask him, and he never talks about her  
I guess its better to just let it slide  
  
And he sings oooh to the ladies  
And oooh he makes 'em sigh  
Now he rides away on a horse he called Music  
With a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye  
  
Now he rode the Music from Boston to Bozeman  
For not too much money, and way too much ride  
But those were the days when a horse he called Music  
Could jump through the moon and sail across the sky  
  
Now all that's left is a old time worn cowboy  
With nothing more than the sweet bye and bye  
Trailin' behind is a horse with no rider  
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride  
  
But he sang oooh to the ladies  
And oooh he damn near laid down and died  
Now he rides away on a horse he called Music  
With a pain in his heart and a tear in his eyes  
  
High on a mountain in western Montana  
Two crosses cut through a cinnamon sky  
Marking a place where a horse he called Music  
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet bye and bye

I've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun can shine  
I've turned away from everyone and everything that wanted to be mine  
Somehow I always shot my eyes and heart to everything that I could share  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
  
And every path I've taken I have turned around and quickly closed the door  
It seems as though I knew if I ever stop to feel I want more  
I kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhere  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
  
How long have you been standing there protecting me from love that shouldn't
be  
Knowing all alone that I could realize that you were meant for me  
Now I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burned  
I've got to clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learn  
  
For I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to care  
Now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there  
And now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there

I fell too hard and much too deep in love with you  
I let you come and go at will it seems  
You're back again this time you say forever  
But I wonder just how long forever means  
How long is forever this time  
How long until one night you don't come home again  
How long is forever this time how long until I'm all alone again  
  
People say I'm foolish when I take you back  
And it could be they're right but who can say  
You'll be welcome here within my arms forever  
Even when forever ends for me today  
How long is forever this time...

When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
My head is in a spin since she left me behind  
I pass a million people I can't tell who I meet  
I pass a million people don't know tell who I meet  
Cause my eyes are full of tears where can my baby be (make it son)  
I went to see a gypsy and I had my fortune read  
I went to see a gypsy had my fortune read  
Then I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said (what she said
honey)  
Now I can tell you people the news was not so good  
Now I can you people the news was not so good  
She said your baby's done and quit you this time she's gone for good

I'll always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees  
I'm empty without you so come grow within me  
For I am the forest and you are the trees  
And the heavens need romance so love never dies  
You'll be the stars dear and I'll be the sky  
And should any of this find us let them all be forewarned  
That you are the thunder and I am the storm  
And I'll always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest and you are the trees  
I'll always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees  
  
I'll always be with you for as long as you please  
For I am the forest but you are the trees

On a rainy Wednesday morning that's the way that I was born in  
That old sharecropper's one room country shack  
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me  
Said she hit the road and never once looked back  
And I just like to mention my grandma's old age pension  
Is the reason why I'm standing here today  
I got all my country learning a milking and a churning  
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay  
I been to Georgia on a fast train honey I wouldn't born no yesterday  
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education  
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way  
  
Now sweet Carolina I don't think I'll ever find  
Another woman put together like you are  
I like your wiggle in your walking and your big city talking  
And your brand new shiny Plymouth ragtop car  
Well it's hurry up and wait in this land of give and take  
It seems like haste it makes for waste everytime  
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll  
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
There ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

It's good to see that I can cry again  
Now I return to life and live again  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
I'm glad to say that I can cry again  
So long my pride would not let my tears to fall  
I walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
I'm glad to say that I can cry again  
  
So long my pride would not let my tears to fall  
I walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all  
As the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man  
It's good to know that I can cry again  
I'm glad to say that I can cry again

I can see clearly now, the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
  
I think I can make it now, the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
  
Look all around, there's nothin' but blue skies  
Look straight ahead, nothin' but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright  
(Bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-shiny day  
Oh, what a bright, (bright)  
Sun-shiny day

I can't begin to tell you  
How much you mean to me.  
My world would end if ever we were through.  
I can't begin to tell you  
  
How happy I would be  
If I could speak my mind like others do.  
I make such pretty speeches  
Whenever we're apart,  
  
But when your near  
The words I choose  
Refuse to leave my heart.  
So take the sweetest phrases  
  
The world has ever known  
And make believe  
I've said them all to you.

I've searched through each moment of each passing hour,  
But your memory grows stronger, I find.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.  
  
They tell me, in time, I'll find another,  
An' happiness, again, will be mine.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.  
  
Somethin' each moment reminds me of you:  
You always end up on my mind.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.  
  
Somethin' each moment reminds me of you:  
You always end up on my mind.  
Oh, they tell me, in time, I'll forget you,  
But somehow, I can't find the time.

Last night I came home  
And I knocked on my door  
And I called to my love  
As I often had before  
And I knocked and I knocked  
But no answer there came  
No kisses to greet me  
No voice called my name  
And I couldn't believe it was true  
Oh Lord, I couldn't believe it was true  
And my eyes filled with tears  
And I must have aged ten years  
And I couldn't believe it was true  
  
The shock was so great  
I am quivering yet  
I'll try to forgive  
But I cannot forget  
My heartbreaking loss  
Is another man's gain  
And her happiness always  
I hope will remain  
And I couldn't believe it was true  
Oh Lord, I couldn't believe it was true  
And my eyes filled with tears  
And I must have aged ten years  
And I couldn't believe it was true

I built a big pile of peanut shells on the sawdust floor  
I winked at every pretty girl comin' in and out the door  
Yellin', 'Hey bartender, how 'bout two more''  
  
Bottle by bottle I'm clearin' off that shelf  
And I feel so good that I'm not quite myself  
Now, they're tellin' me that I gotta find someplace else  
Well, guess what  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
If you wanna pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Well, I spent my dollar and drank up my last dime  
Now, they're actin' like havin' fun is some kind of crime  
If it'll make you feel better mister, I'll tell you one more time  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
Why don't you pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Now, you can call me a taxi  
And you can call me a cab  
I know you're gonna call me something  
When I can't pay this tab  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
If you wanna pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
Why don't you pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss

Didn't sleep a wink last night,  
'Cause you walked out the night before.  
Just been sittin' here, rottin', hoping you'd come knockin',  
Knocking at my door.  
  
Watched the moon pass by my window,  
The stars faded out of sight.  
The sun came into view, an' still I thought of you,  
An' I didn't sleep a wink last night.  
  
Tryin' to remember what I'd done,  
To make you treat me so.  
What have I been guilty of?  
Well, I'd just like to know.  
  
Thought if we could talk it over,  
Maybe I could make things right.  
'Cause until I'm forgiven, I'm exisitin', I'm not livin',  
An' I didn't sleep a wink last night.  
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

You treated me like a doggone dog for so long  
But I went along to keep peace in our home  
But there's some things that I just won't do  
I think it's time that I told them to you  
I don't do windows and I won't go to hell for you  
  
Although honey, hell is what you put me through  
I'll do the clothes if you won't come unglued  
And I'll clean the stove to keep you in a good mood  
But you've been mean to me sometime  
I think I better tell you what's on my mind  
I don't do windows and I don't come to work 'til nine  
And if you make me mad, I won't come to work any time  
  
I want Sundays off so I can go out and play golf with all the boys  
Honey, I'm tired of being just one of your toys  
And there's one more thing that you don't understand  
I wanna be treated like a natural man  
I don't do windows and I don't play second hands  
I said I don't do windows and I won't play second fiddle in your band

I don't feel anything what was I worried for  
I don't feel love or hate or anything that I felt before  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything  
How I must have loved you once upon a time  
And I can't seem to feel emotion now of any kind  
Why was I so afraid of seeing you again  
'Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything  
  
You look the same as always time's been good to you  
But I must confess that time has done a few things for me too  
Why was I so afraid  
But it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything

Well I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what I'm gonna do  
I'll start to spend my money  
Call everybody honey  
And wind up singing the blues  
I'll spend my whole paycheck  
On some old wreck  
And brother I can name you a few  
But I gotta get drunk  
And I sure do dread it  
Cause I know just what I'm gonna do  
  
I gotta get drunk I just can't stay sober  
There's a lot of good people in town  
Who'd like to hear me holler  
See me spend my dollars  
And I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down  
There's a lot of doctors that tell me  
That I'd better start slowin' it down  
But there's more old drunkers  
Than there are old doctors  
So I guess we'd better have another round  
Well now I gotta get drunk  
  
Well I gotta get drunk

You say your heart will never break:  
I hope so, for your sake.  
But happiness is sometimes hard,  
For hearts to cling to.  
You say he'll always be with you:  
I hope so, for your sake.  
But should he find somebody new,  
What would you do?  
  
If you were wrong, would you confess?  
I wouldn't know, but I could guess,  
That you would act the same as I,  
An' cry.  
And should these things ever come true,  
When love is gone, what will you do?  
Will you accept my love for you?  
I hope so, for my sake.  
  
If you were wrong, would you confess?  
I wouldn't know, but I could guess,

And should these things ever come true,  
When love is gone, what will you do?  
Will you accept my love for you?  
I hope so, for my sake.

I had not planned on seeing you  
I was afraid of what I'd do  
But pride is strong, here am I  
And I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Please have no fear, you're in no harm  
As long as you're here in my arms  
But you can't leave so please don't try  
But I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
What force behind your evil mind  
Can let your lips speak so unkind  
To one who loves as much as I  
I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
The flesh around your throat is pale  
Intended by my fingernails  
Please don't scream and please don't cry  
Cause I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Your voice is still, it speaks no more  
You'll never hurt me anymore  
Death is a friend to love and I  
Cause now you'll never say goodbye
