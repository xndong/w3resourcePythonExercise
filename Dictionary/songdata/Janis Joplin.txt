This whole thing that's happened to me, you see, this whole success thing, er,
it hasn't yet really compromised the position that I took a long time ago in
texas, that was to be true to myself  
Be the person that I f... That was on inside of me and not play games. You
see, actually what I'm trying to do mostly, if I, in the whole world, is to
not bullshit myself, and not bullshit anyb  
Lse. To be righteous to myself, I mean to be real, you know what I mean? And
so far, you know I'm, I'm just tryin' to... I'm doin' that, I am, you know.
I'm not wearin' cardboard eyelashes, an  
D, you know, and girdles, and playin' in las vegas. By still bein' janis, I
just happens to be on a slightly different level or somethin' now. And... You
know I suppose it's because I've never  
Premeditated enough in show-business that I was worried about putting on a, a
face, you know what I mean? So I can sit here and tell you the truth. You
know? Otherwise it's slightly inhibiting  
Lly, it doesn't, it doesn't f  
Orce a game on me, because I refuse to let it force a game on me. So I can sit
here and be just as honest as I would be in a bar, although I'd be a lot
happier in a bar!

Dear landlord  
Please don't put a price on my soul.  
My burden is heavy, dear,  
And my dreams are beyond my control,  
Oh yes, they are.  
  
But when that steam-boat whistle blows,  
Oh, honey I'm gonna give you everything I ever had to give, yeah,  
And I do hope that you can receive it well,  
I know that it must be dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Whoa, landlord,  
Please heed these words that I try to speak.  
I know you must have suffered much,  
But honey you ain't alone, you ain't so unique.  
No no no, no, no.  
  
All of us at times, I said, we might have worked too hard  
Or too heavy, too fast and way too rushed, yeah!  
But everyone can fill their life with anything  
You can look around, but baby you just cannot touch.  
  
Whoa, my dear landlord,  
Please don't you dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue with you,  
And honey I'll tell ya, I'm ain't gonna move to no other place.  
'cause I just ain't gonna do it, no, no, no.  
  
Each of us must have their own special gift,  
Oh honey, don't you know that it's got to be true  
And if you don't underestimate me, I'll tell you one thing,  
I said that I won't underestimate you, no!

You said when you met you'd never forget me  
And I thought my problems were gone  
But you changed all the while and you did it in style  
How could I think that this was wrong  
  
Some times it stops we can't compromise that  
But I think back to all the relations we had  
That we had  
  
They say things could change neither one of us claims  
That the other was wrong at all  
But you blend different bits 2 complete opposites  
And you're asking for both to fall  
  
Some times it stops we can't compromise that  
But I think back to all the relations we had  
And remember this moment opinions we mine  
You put up all these changes i'll fall back in line  
But I can't make my thoughts just go away  
  
Some times it stops we can't compromise that

Now when I go to work, I work all day,  
Always turns out the same.  
When I bring home my hard-earned pay  
I spend my money all on mary jane.  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane.  
Oh if a man should look tame now, mean and mature,  
They all turn out the same.

Like my old mary jane.

One that can lend me some change.  
And he never questions my reason why,  
'cause he too loves mary jane.  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord, my mary jane.

Some that wanted to stay.  
But I never knew what happened in this world  
Till I met up with mary jane,  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord my mary jane.  
Oh, when I'm feelin' lonesome and I'm feelin' blue,  
There's only one way to change.  
Now I walk down the street now lookin' for a man,  
One that knows my mary jane,  
Mary jane, mary jane, lord my mary jane.  

Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train  
And I's feeling nearly as faded as my jeans.  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained,  
It rode us all the way to New Orleans.  
  
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna,  
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.  
Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine,  
We sang every song that driver knew.  
  
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,  
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.  
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,  
You know feeling good was good enough for me,  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee  
.  
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,  
Hey, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.  
Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we done,  
Hey Bobby baby kept me from the cold world  
.  
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,  
He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it,  
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday  
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine.  
  
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,  
Nothing, that's all that Bobby left me, yeah,  
But feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,  
Hey, feeling good was good enough for me, hmm hmm,  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.  
  
La la la, la la la la, la la la, la la la la  
La la la la la Bobby McGee.

Like a carrot baby!  
Like a carrot darling!  
Like a carrot baby!  
Like a carrot baby!  
Like a carrot dear!  
All right, daddy, take it all!  
  
I'll tell you something, man,  
I never expected that out of Toronto, man.  
You're looking real good, real good  
In fact you're all invited to my house for a drink.  
I live in San Francisco and if you can get there man,  
I'll give you the drink.  
I promise.  
I ain't too hard to find, ha ha ha ha ha  
I'm all over the streets, man.  
Ha Ha. I'm not.  
  
A while back, it was about a year ago,  
I think it was, I had this apartment in San Francisco,  
I lived on the third floor in this little tiny apartment building,  
Had a little two rooms and a dog, right.  
  
I lived on the third floor and I used to walk around town and I had,  
You know, a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple T-shirts  
And I thought I had my shit pretty good together, man.  
  
You know I was out on the streets talking and talking,  
Doing all that shit, and every time I found a nice piece of talent  
He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor,  
There was another chick on the second floor, right.  
  
And I couldn't understand, I couldn't understand,  
I kept thinking, Janis, why are you doing wrong suddenly ?  
Well I so decided to get up one morning, ha ha ha,  
And check out the chick's action, right,  
Figure out what she had going that I didn't have going.  
  
I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.  
And I got up at 9:30 in the morning,  
I hid in the stairwell right next  
To the chick's across from her apartment, right.  
And I watched her and watched to see what she had, man,  
That I didn't have.  
  
And I'll tell you what she had man,  
That chick hit the streets at noon.  
I mean I didn't use to get up till three.  
That chick was already in the street hustling, man.  
So I figured out what you gotta do, man.  
Every time you're looking for a little piece of action  
And you ain't getting none, man,  
You know what you better do, baby,  
You better try harder, man.

I wake up in the morning  
And I look out at the sun  
Then I think I'll get up, go out a while  
And I get out on the run.  
Then I say, "My boy, you got to slow down  
And have yourself some fun."  
So I lay around and I smoke a while  
And I never get nothing done.  
  
I don't care, my needs are few,  
What in the world am I gonna do  
With a million dollars from I don't know who  
When in the world, will I get through  
With living in such great expectations  
With loving, some call it infatuation.  
  
I go outside and I walk a while  
Singing in the street.  
I blow a kiss, I give a smile  
To every one I meet.  
I buy myself a beer or two  
Just to leave my stone behind.  
Sometimes I get so drunk  
I can sing just like a child, yeah.  
Ooh, ooh.  
  
I get drunk and I laugh a lot,  
There's something that I hear.  
My brain gets loose, my soul gets hot,  
The music hits my ears.  
I hear the music...  
Lord, it sounds so sweet!  
  
Music's hot and I don't mind  
If I dance a step or two.  
I do a twitch, unwind my spine  
I set my eyes on you.  
I watch you move, you move so fine,  
So fine I never knew  
Making love while dancing  
Is an easy thing to do.  
  
Yes, it's easy It ain't hard!  
Yes, yes it's easy It ain't hard!  
Oh, oh, it's easy Oh no, no, no!  
Oh, it's easy Come on...

( from the soundtrack of the motion picture 'janis' )  
I ain't got no reason to livin', I can't find no cause to die  
Lord, I ain't got no reason for livin', you give me no cause to die  
Lord, I ain't got no reasons for stay here, give me no cause to try  
I got these blues, I gotta find me that middle road  
Well, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care  
Lord, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care  
Lord, I ain't got no reasons to go on, give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues, I gotta finally know why  
Well, I ain't got no reason for walkin', I guess I'm gonna fall or standstill  
Lord, I ain't got no reason for walkin', guess I'm gonna fall or standstill  
Lord I ain't got no reason for goin', give me no cause to stay here  
I got these blues, lord I gotta finally know why  

Well, once I lived the life of a millionaire, spending my money, no, I didn't
care  
Takin' my friend John out for a mighty good time  
Buyin' high-priced liquor, champagne and wine  
  
Then I began to fall so low, didn't have a friend, nor no place to go  
If I get my hands on a dollar again  
I'm goin' to hold on to it until the eagle grins  
  
Soon as I get back up on my feet again, everybody wants to be my long-lost
friend  
It's might strange, without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when you're down and out  
  
Lord, soon as I get up on my feet again, everybody wants to be my long-lost
friend  
It's mighty strange, without a doubt  
Nobody wants you when you're down and out  
That's what I mean, when you're down and out

(recording of july 28 1966, san francisco)  
(spoken: this is an ol' little richard tune called 'oh my soul')  
  
Oh, my soul!  
Oh, my soul!  
  
Baby baby baby, give me all the love you've got  
Don't you know you've got the best love in the house  
I said love, I said love, oh, my soul!  
  
Baby baby baby love your daddy all night long  
Baby, baby, love you all night long  
Love you, I'm gonna kiss you, oh, my soul!  
  
Now baby baby, well you drive me crazy  
Oh, baby baby, well you drive me crazy  
I said love, I said love, oh, my soul!

Oh, baby, love you, love you all night long  
I said baby, I said baby, oh, my soul!  
  
(spoken: thank you very much)

Yeah!  
  
Oh, sweet Mary, child of confusion, she runs the hills to cry  
Past the willows or an illusion, Lord, tell me the reason why.  
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?  
Breathing in the air Breathe in the air  
Anyone to care.  
Oh!  
  
(Alright, yeah!)  
  
Oh, sweet Mary, in our story, have we nothing left to give ?  
But don't we all know, babe, if we're pressed to, that that's the way we live.  
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?  
Breathing in the air Breathing in the air  
Anyone to care, oh, yeah!  
  
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now,  
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, whoa, yeah!

Honey, I love to go to parties  
And I like to have a good time,  
But if it gets too pale after a while  
Honey and I start looking to find  
One good man.  
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching,  
Oh yes I have!  
One good man,  
Oh ain't much, honey ain't much,  
It's only everything, whoa.  
  
An' I don't want much outta life,  
I never wanted a mansion in the South.  
I just-a want to find someone sincere  
Who'd treat me like he talks,  
One good man.  
Oh honey don't you know that I've been looking.  
Oh, one good man  
Ain't much, honey it ain't much,  
Oh, it's only everything.  
All right.  
  
Some girls they want to collect their men,  
They wear 'em like notches on a gun.  
Oh honey, but I know better than that,  
I know that a woman only needs one.  
One good man, oh,  
Oh baby don't you know I've been looking, hmm.  
One good man,  
It ain't much, no, no honey it ain't much,  
Oh, it's only every little thing,  
Just-a everything, everything  
Ah yeah.

An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?  
Honey, you know I did!  
And each time I tell myself that I, well I've just had enough,  
But I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough.

Deep down in your heart I said you know that it ain't right,  
Never never never never never never hear me when I cry at night.  
Honey, I cry all the time!  
And each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain,  
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.  
  
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it!  
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby.  
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah,

What do you think about your town since you've left and come back ?  
It's fantastic! I was across the river from the club last night, I never had
more fun in my life! except sometimes in california I have more fun.  
Do you plan to come back soon ?  
Oh ? er, er, er, I have no immediate plans, ha ha ha!!  
Did you entertain in high school, at the high school, when you went back at
the high school ?  
Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a
painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.  
What happened ?  
I got liberated! I don't know, I just started to sing and singing makes you
want to come out because painting, I feel, keeps you inside, you know ? and
once you start singing you just sort of wa  
O talk to people more and go out more and, you know, your lifestyle's becomes
more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.  
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?  
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?  
Did they make you different ?  
No.  
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them, or were you ?  
I felt apart from them.  
Did you take a part in football games ?  
I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom, and er ...  
Oh, you were asked, weren't you ?  
No, I wasn't. I don't think, I don't think they wanted to take me. till I'll
be a hundred and sufferin'! it's enough to make you wanna sing the blues!

Afternoon Show 17 06 1967 [Janis 3 cd Box Set]

Got the blues from my baby  
Left me by the san francisco bay.  
This big ocean liner took her so far away.  
Didn't mean to treat her so bad  
She was the best girl I ever have had.  
She said good-bye, and she made me cry  
I'm gonna lay right down and die.  
Well, I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime.  
If she don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind.  
If she ever comes back to stay,  
Well, that'll be another brand new day,  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay.  
Sittin' in my back door  
Wondering which way to go  
That woman I'm so crazy about  
She don't love me no more.  
Lord, I think I'll grab a freight train  
Because I'm feeling blue,  
Ride all the way to the end of the line  
Thinking only about you.  
Well, meanwhile in another city  
Just about to go insane  
Thought I heard my baby  
The way she used called my name.  
If she ever comin' back to stay  
Well, that'll be another brand new day  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay  
(I really mean it!)  
Oh, walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay, whew!!  

And it's hey, hey hey, she was standin' in the kitchen, honey, in her morning
gown  
Lord, she was standin' in the kitchen, babe, in her morning gown  
She was standin' in the kitchen, honey, in her morning gown  
  
But I say hey hey, hey hey, Lord, see see rider, see what you done done  
Lord, now, see see rider, honey, see what you have done  
Well, see see rider, see what you done done  
  
Well hey, hey hey hey, hey hey  
Well, the blues ain't nothin' but a good man feelin' bad  
Lord, the blues ain't nothin' but a good man feelin' bad  
Yeah, the blues ain't nothin' but a good man feelin' bad  
  
Hey hey, hey, hey hey

Lord, well see see rider, see what you have done  
Yeah, see see rider, gonna see what you have done  
I say hey hey, hey hey

Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.  
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.  
Go ahead!  
  
I don't want your golden mansions with a tear in every room,  
All I want's the love you promised, beneath the halo moon.  
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name  
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin' game.  
  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine  
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.  
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,  
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.

I went down to old Joe's bar room  
On the corner by the square.  
Well, the drinks were bein' served as usual,  
And this motley crowd was there.  
  
Well, on my left stood Joe Mckennedy  
And his eyes were bloodshot red.  
When he told me that sad story,  
These were the words he said:  
  
I went down to the St. James infirmary,  
I saw my baby there,  
She was stretched out on a long white table,  
So cold, and fine, and fair.  
Go ahead!  
  
Let her go, let her go, God bless her,  
Wherever she may be,  
She can search this world over  
Never find another man like me.  
  
Yes, sixteen coal black horses  
To pull that rubber tied hack.  
Well, it's seventeen miles to the graveyard  
But my baby's never comin' back.  
  
Well, now you've heard my story,  
Well, have another round of booze  
And if anyone should ever, ever ask you -  
I've got the St. James infirmary blues!

Well, put your arms around me like the circles in the sun  
I want you to love me daddy like my easy rider done.  
If you don't believe that I love you, look what a fool I've been,  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me,  
I'm stealin' back my same old used-to-be.  
Well, I got a little woman, 'bout my height and size,  
Now she's a married woman, sees me once in a while.  
If you don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me,  
I'm stealin' back my same old used-to-be.  
With good whiskey you stay drunk all the time,  
Stay drunk baby 'cause it eases my mind.  
If you don't believe that I love you, look what a fool I've been,  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me  
I'm stealin' right back my same old used-to-be  

He rose from Texas the wrestling scene  
Writing the scriptures of 3: 16,  
Took it upon himself to erase pieces of trash who got in his face,  
I see his shirts wherever I wander,  
I know in my heart that  
They've never laundered and they  
Never need it to be and that kind of attitude appeals to me.  
And Mcmahon can't control him so don't even try,  
You can have him arrested but there goes the ride,  
Can't take away the intensity of his high,  
But you can't lock away the Stone Cold pride.  
Took out poor Vinnie a shot to the sac,  
A picture was taken so he could look back,  
A pain inflicted on a true fiend, molding the king of the true 3: 16,  
He's in top form and his knee is fixed,  
Ready to school that Sean Michaels  
Prick and open up a can of whoop-ass  
How do you like that jackass.  
And Mcmahon can't control him  
So don't even try,  
You can have him arrested but there goes the ride,  
Can't take away the intensity of his high,  
But you can't lock away the Stone Cold pride.

Make it the last time, make it the last time  
Make it the last time, oh darling please.  
But I don't understand why you always pick the time  
When I've just talked to you with your love on my mind.  
To see a distant light, to hear a far-off horn  
To leave me one more time, I can't stand no more  
Say no more, well no more,  
Well no more, darling, please.  
And every time you leave I make the very same vow  
That when you come back I ain't gonna love you no how.  
But when you return you look so fine to me  
I can't stand no more, my darling, it's just got to be  
I said the last time, oh the last time,  
Oh the last time, darling, please.  
Don't you understand me, don't you understand me ?  
Honey, don't you understand my word ?  
Well, you told me that you love me, I believed you, darling,  
But you lied, you know it's true.  
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving  
Then I'll cry.  
Oh darling, oh darling,  
Oh darling, make up your mind  
Oh, I can't stand your loving, honey, it's tearing me apart,  
You done got my soul, but now you're after my heart.  
Well, don't hurt me, darling, now you know how to do it so well  
I just got one consolation, I just wail  
It was the last time  
It was the last time  
It was the last time, darling, please.  
When you told me that you love me I believed you, darling,  
But you lied, you know it's true.  
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving  
Then I'll cry.  
Well no more, well no more,  
Well no more without you, please!  
If you wanna love me, honey, please stay home,  
If you don't wanna love me, baby, please stay gone.  
Don't you understand me, don't you understand me ?  
Don't you understand my words ?  
Say no more, oh no more,  
Well no more, oh, darling, oh!  
You told me that you love me I believed you, darling,  
But you lied, you know it's true.  
Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving  
Then I'll cry, yeah.

My hands are tied behing my back my face is red with hate  
I know I've tried to be the better man but I can't accept this fate  
  
It's seems every time I cross the line and wonder that  
Am supposed to figure which way you want to go  
And I can see that misery is plaguing you  
And I'm supposed to be there when you have no one  
  
Take my hand i'll take from where you stand  
My mind is made up and I can't take the people falling  
Down on me but that's the way it's gotta be  
(our 2 worlds can't coexist)  
I can't promote a lie that I wanna watch you crying

Some say love, it is a river  
That drowns the tender reed  
Some say love, it is a razer  
That leaves your soul to bleed  
  
Some say love, it is a hunger  
An endless, aching need  
I say love, it is a flower  
And you, it's only seed  
  
It's the heart, afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream, afraid of waking  
That never takes the chance  
  
It's the one who won't be taken  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dyin'  
That never learns to live  
  
When the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong  
  
Just remember, in the winter  
Far beneath the bitter snows  
Lies the seed, that with the sun's love  
In the spring, becomes the rose

Never ever, never shone on me, no, no.

Living and loving you.

To love anybody.  
Oh honey, I want to talk about love  
And trying to hold somebody  
The way I love you babe,  
And I've been loving you babe.  
  
In my brain, oh I can see your face again,

People come around and ask me

Next one's a song we do called "women is losers"

One pill makes you larger  
And one pill makes you small  
And the ones that mother gives you  
Don't do anything at all  
Go ask Alice  
When she's ten feet tall  
  
And if you go chasing rabbits  
And you know you're going to fall  
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar  
Has given you the call  
Call Alice  
When she was just small  
  
When men on the chessboard  
Get up and tell you where to go  
And you've just had some kind of mushroom  
And your mind is moving low  
Go ask Alice  
I think she'll know  
  
When logic and proportion  
Have fallen sloppy dead  
And the White Knight is talking backwards  
And the Red Queen's "off with her head!"  
Remember what the dormouse said:  
"Feed your head  
Feed your head  
Feed your head"

Work me Lord, work me Lord.  
Please don't you leave me,

With no one to love  
Though I've looked everywhere  
And I can't find me anybody to love,  
To feel my care.

Kind of person down here, I know better,

The worst you can say all about me  
Is that I'm never satisfied. Whoa.  
  
Whoa, oh, oh, work me Lord, hmm, use me Lord,  
Please, honey, don't you leave me,

Trying to live when you're all alone.  
Everyday I keep pushing,  
Keep trying to move forward  
But something is driving me, oh, back,  
And something's trying to hold on to me,  
To my way of life, why.
