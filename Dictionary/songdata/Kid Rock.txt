[Verse 1]  
They talk about money, talk about jobs  
Talk about religion and playing the odds  
Talk about freedom, talk about faith  
They talking 'bout taking my guns away  
Monkeys in suits writing laws and rules,  
They just bicker and fight  
But I ain't gotta listen to them goddamn fools 'cause I know what's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
Rock on  
  
[Verse 2]  
They talk about the greedy, talk about the poor  
They talking 'bout sending my daughter to war  
Talk about spending, talk about pay,  
They talk about defending the NSA  
Monkeys in suits writing laws and rules,  
There's no end in sight  
But I ain't gotta listen to them goddamn fools 'cause I know what's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
  
[Bridge]  
I might be crazy but I ain't no fool  
I got them red-blooded white boy blues  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't enough whiskey, women and wine  
Ain't enough money, stitches and time  
Moonshine honey, a little white line  
Ain't enough change to change my mind

Cruising through town in my jacked up truck  
Eyes open 'cause I'm scopin for a big butt slut  
One that I can take straight back to my house  
And have suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth  
  
Now get, get with it looked across the street  
Seen a slimmy in a skirt bopping to the beat  
So I capped up my forty threw it under my seat  
Rolled up on the freak and I started to speak  
  
But before I could she go grabbed my dick  
Licked her lips and started talking that porno shit  
She said "look here I know our kid rock"  
Then whispered in my ear "I want to swallow your cock"  
  
Well blow me up then blow me down  
'Cause I think I just found the biggest freak in town  
And now I can't wait to get her back to my house  
Set her on her knees and put my balls in her mouth  
  
[Chorus]  
Balls in your mouth  
Balls in your mouth  
"you want my balls in your mouth?"  
  
Back to my crib with no delay  
Big grin on my grill and not much to say  
Except hey yo bitch how's about  
I drop my drawers and put my ballis in your mouth?  
  
Then it was like straight out of a porn  
She dropped to her knees and started blowing my horn  
And after that without no doubt  
She opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth  
  
Next to cutie started rubbing my back  
She put her finger right between my booty crack  
So I grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut  
"Ain't Nobody sticking nothing in my butt"  
  
Now right then I knew I had a ho and a half  
And all that I could do is sit back and laugh  
Stare at the ceiling thinking about  
This chick I just met's got my balls in her mouth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After I busted my nuts I drover to the cut  
She said "I hope you don't think that I'm a big slut  
And please don't tell anyone what we've been through"  
Next day I told the whole fucking crew  
  
Spread the news through the whole damn town  
And to that chick it must have got back around  
So I told the ho sorry and tried to make amends  
But she tried to fuck me in front of my friends  
  
Running off at the lip talking all that shit  
That I'm a bitch I'm a prick and I got a small dick  
I just waited til she walked away to shout  
"Fuck You Bitch You Had My Balls In Your Mouth!"  
  
[Chorus]

Aww shit!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kid Rock back in this motherfucking house  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
Mothers crying from these shotgun blasts  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
People dying from these shotgun blasts  
  
'Cause I'm rippin', flippin', crippin', like a real one does  
So if your rap's wrapped in jack, sweep it under the rug  
'Cause I'ma go above that, beyond the calls of my fuckin' duty  
'Cause all these corney, phony emcee's now a days don't move me  
So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves  
I got a full time pay, start to dig graves  
Because I'm buryin' emcee's, and sharin' their ladies  
Now you rolled hoes are carrying my babies  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
A broken home always hurts someone  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
I saw kids get shot, don't sell guns  
  
And still I rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does  
Rockin', shockin' on the stage, with a hell a steady buzz  
From a 5th of ol' Jimmy Beam  
We fryin' emcees up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean  
Sausage pattys, and smoking cabbies like it's no thing  
Drinkin' more Colt's then the 45 king  
Swingin' emcees like a cow hands rope  
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, I'm straight slittin' throats  
  
'Cause that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
Every time I get my gamble on  
Yeah that's the way I like to do shit, holmes  
I never stay in one spot, i was born to roam  
Feel like I got bank, but it's not enough friend  
'Cause I want more bank see, than my grandkids could ever spend  
So if ya need some cheap slut, then speak up  
Most hoe's know not to ask for cash, 'cause I'm a cheap fuck  
  
[Chorus]

A bottle of jack's got my manager grinnin'  
Yeah that's me that keeps the turntables spinniN'  
I'm countin cards and I keep on winnin'  
I know God hates me 'cause I'm always sinnin'  
  
You don't know me blow me ho you want to get hot  
You'll get your ass blown out fuckin with the Kid Rock  
Eatin up ya suckers just the same way a beast could  
Tearin through your town like mother fuckin Clint Eastwood  
  
'cause I be fakin the rhymes that keep ya shakin'  
Makin a lotta money but don't let me be mistaken  
I never thought about climbin up the pop chart  
And I don't give a fuck you can't buy my tape in K-Mart  
  
Give me a choice between soundin like an ass wipe  
Or sittin in an alley smokin crack from a glass pipe  
I'd be as skinny as a junkie with the AIDS plague  
But still I'd look better than a puppet tryin to get paid  
  
Now check the rhyme as I climb and I co get rude  
And send ya runnin' playin' pussy like Shaggy and Scoob  
'cause I'm the wrong dude to fuck with my mouth is mental  
And I'm a tear shit up like they did in South Central  
  
Son of a bitch I'm the son of a bitch  
Nobody ever loved you so you're the son of a dick  
I'm a product of a young girl top in her class  
You're a product of a hooker who was sellin that ass  
  
And your styles in the past it's old and dusty  
So from now on I'm callin you M.C. Crusty  
'cause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted  
So now I'm gonna drop ya like a hit of acid  
  
And when I rip ya people they might stare  
'cause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair  
An yo buck won't you please be a friend  
And tell your mom I want to fuck and I'll pick her up at 10

All my life I've been searchin'  
All my life I've been uncertain  
I been abandoned and left alone  
At fifteen I had to leave home  
The black sheep, the bad seed  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think she's a little crazy  
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve  
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me it's all good  
She's happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
Two packs and a pint a day  
To hide the shame  
And wash away the pain  
Aww the pain  
Every road was a dead-end street  
Runnin' from the law  
And runnin' on empty  
You couldn't shake the marks that were left on me  
  
At a roadside bar in Tennessee  
I met an angel to rescue me  
She rescued me  
  
She wore blue jeans and a rosary  
Believed in God and believed in me  
All her friends think she's a little crazy  
She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve  
Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me  
She tells me it's all good  
She's happy with a bad seed  
Happy to be misunderstood  
  
[Repeat]  
Misunderstood  
Misunderstood

See I was born a little pie-eyed motherfucker  
Mama she left me and my papa was a hard trucker  
Out on the highway we loved to roll  
He never made me go to school  
  
I never begged to go  
I was a low class livin' raised out in the sticks  
I was born to be a hick  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin'  
  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin'  
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands  
People always tell me I'm a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
Ohh I was born to be a hick  
  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel hunter  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin  
Kissin' and huggin' on some distant lands  
People always tell me I'm a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
See I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'm a shotgun tokin'  
I'm a John Deere drivin'  
I'm a hick  
Ah har

Fast, on a rough road riding  
High, through the mountains climbing  
Twisting, turning further from my home.  
Young, like a new moon rising  
Fierce, through the rain and lightning  
Wandering out into this great unknown.  
  
And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'  
If I don't survive  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born free  
I was born free  
I was born free  
Born Free  
  
Free, like a river raging  
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.  
Chasing dreams and racing father time.  
Deep like the grandest canyon,  
Wild like an untamed stallion.  
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.  
  
You can knock me down and watch me bleed  
But you can't keep no chains on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down  
Deep into my eyes.  
  
I was born free!  
  
Hey yaya yayaya  
Oh hoo  
  
Calm facing danger  
Lost, like an unknown stranger  
Grateful for my time with no regrets.  
  
Close to my destination  
Tired, frail and aching  
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set  
  
And when its done believe that  
I will yell it from that mountain high  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I will vow to the shining seas  
And celebrate God's Grace on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh oh oh wah hoo

I'm gonna move to Southern California  
Got me a ride and a reason to ignore you  
Got me a radio ain't got no speakers  
Ain't much use so I'm leaving it,  
Leaving it for you  
I'm leaving it for you  
Could be back for you  
  
Gotta find a room and I'm running out of money  
Staying up late but I gotta get up early  
Why did I move to southern california  
Smiles, kisses, blue  
Someone should have warned you  
They should have warned you  
Could be back, I could be back for you  
  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Southern California  
  
Why did I move to Southern California?

Day by day my life gets colder  
My ice grows thin, as I get older  
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised  
I feel so helpless and confused  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle tryin' to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
I can't walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do is care  
  
I pray and pray for life's salvation  
Faith is tried and true in tribulation  
Love is lost and lonely, check the news  
And with these open arms I'll wait for you  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
And yelling on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me  
All you sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me  
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place  
When the worst case scenario is my birth place  
I'm just tryin to keep from fallin' victim to the murder rate  
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents  
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings  
And your future ain't brighter than your present  
Quit stressin'  
  
They're screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
While I'm sittin' in the middle trying to live my life  
  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
Can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world to make things fair  
The least that I can do is care  
  
Yeah I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
I cant walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
Oh is care!

The preacher man say's it's the end of time  
The Mississippi river, she's goin dry  
The interest is up, and the stock market's down  
You only get mugged if you go down town  
  
I live back in the woods you see,  
My woman, my kids, and my dogs, and me  
I got a shoutgun, and a rifle, and a 4 wheel drive  
A Country boy can survive  
  
And a Country boy can survive  
See, I can plow a field all day long  
I can catch catfish, from dusk till dawn  
We make our own whisky, and our own smoke too  
  
Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do, no  
We grow good ole tomatoes, make homemade wine  
A Country boy can survive  
And a Country boy can survive  
  
'Cause you can't starve us out, can't make me run  
Hey there boy, I got a big shotgun  
We say grace, and we say Mam  
If you ain't into that, we don't give a God damn  
  
I had a good friend in N.Y. city  
He never called me Kid Rock, he called me hillbilly  
My grandpa taught me how to live off this land  
His taught him to be a businessman  
  
He used to send me pictures of the broadway night  
I'd send him some of that homemade wine  
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife  
For 43 dollars, my friend lost his life  
  
I want to spit some beachnut in the dudes eyes  
Shoot him with my mother fuckin 45  
A country boy can survive  
'Cause you can't starve us out, can't make us run  
  
Hey there boy, I got a big shotgun  
We say grace, and we say Mam  
If you ain't into that, we don't give a God damn  
Were from North California, and South Alabam  
  
And little towns all around this land  
Well I can skin a buck, and run a trout line  
A Country boy can survive  
Well a Country boy can survive  
  
Survive

(Kid Rock) Everything I do gonna be funny  
  
New Player on the field so yield and get back  
To the wall  
'Cause I'm playin' ya all  
Like a game  
  
K-I-D is the name  
Some complain  
And they got a little fame  
And it's a shame  
  
For what its worth  
I'm down with earth  
Pourin' it on like Ms. Butterworth  
Rich and thick  
  
Kinda quick not slow  
The rhymes I fit into flow  
All in a row, from the intro  
To the end so, ho  
  
Put down the microphone and go  
Step a side as I make room to bloom  
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb  
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose  
  
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice  
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile  
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (Cramp your style...cramp your style)  
  
Get down on your knees and pray when I break you  
Down with a sound  
Comin' down with a pound  
Or a bang  
  
If you can't hang with the slang  
That I exploit  
Comin' straight from Detroit  
Rough without a doubt or a question  
  
Kid Rock here in the flesh  
And addressin' and defining certain issues  
To diss you (he diss me..aheo)  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
  
You can't hide so don't be surprised  
When I dismiss you from your throne  
And send you home  
As a Kid Rock clone  
  
'Cause I can hold my own  
Like ya hold a milkbone  
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit  
So when I hit the skit  
  
That's it  
So don't come in face with the base  
And remember your just an imitation  
Don't get buckwhile  
  
In fact don't smile  
'Cause I'll pull your file  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)  
I'll claim the boundries of my domain  
Detroit...Detroit  
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest  
  
From MoTown...From MoTown  
  
I'm like steel or concrete yo cause I'm the hardest  
Down with a label known to be the largest  
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin to hang  
'Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O  
  
I roll thick  
I roll heavy  
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady  
So get ready to feel the pain  
  
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane  
So listen rappers and get to the program  
Breakin' ya down is the Kid rock slogan  
And any rapper who thinks about dissin'  
  
You know what I'll say?  
I got a great big dick  
So anyone who can't adjust  
Gets rust  
  
And then bites the dust  
Be ready to walk a mile  
'Cause I'll smack that cool-Aid smile  
As I Cramp your style (style...style)  
Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style)

Fuck off  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrreee  
  
I never went to college, I ain't got no skills  
I got hair to my shoulders and a bottle of pills  
I got bills stacked up like a turkey club  
I blew my last dime drinkin at the local pub  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins  
I live, each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I'll pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it therrrreeee  
  
Rock, rock y'all

You come alive y'all  
(Alive y'all)  
Come on  
  
I never felt at home, although I grew up loved  
I got a junkies mind in a ramblin man's blood  
Got a flood full of thoughts that's caught in a dam  
Somedays I'm gone, but that's where I am  
I'm fit to slip another rippin rhyme  
I'm so ahead of the game, I feel left behind  
Another dime to boost, I got boots of lead  
Hope I live to see this virus spread  
  
I am not sunshine  
I am dark and grey  
For this life of sins I live  
Each day I pay  
I am not Jesus  
But I died in vain  
Only to relive each day I pay  
  
Unlike me, you're gonna run away  
Unlike me, you'll see another day  
Run like me, out on the highway  
I will ride so faaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr  
I'll probably never make it there  
  
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

From hard luck tricks  
To trust fund freaks  
Bathroom stalls to penthouse suites  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From the bottom of the barrel  
To the cream of the crop  
  
They've picked me up  
And I've watched 'em drop  
  
I been around  
I been around  
  
I sang 'em all a song or two  
About simple things  
Still I feel I'm bein' used  
Ain't a damn thing changed  
  
I'm an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
The only Cool Hand Luke left in this town  
I get my lovin' on the run  
  
I'm a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
Let me show you right  
I sure don't wanna hurt no one  
  
So, don't tell me you love me  
Don't tell me you love, love me do  
Don't tell me you love me  
'Cause love's one thing that I cannot do  
And it's the only thing that I can't give to you  
  
From Hollywood hoes to backstage jive  
Jacked up trucks and Gulf Stream 5's  
I been around  
I been around  
  
From silly little girls who play them games  
To the rich and famous  
I won't say no names  
I been around  
I been around  
  
You gotta touch the stove to learn they say  
Get burnt and learn that way  
You better keep your feelings at bay  
Or honey you gonna pay  
  
I'm an outlaw  
Bad Leroy Brown  
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town  
I get my lovin' on the run  
  
I'm a low down  
Mister fly by night  
Baby slow down  
I'ma fuck you right  
I sure don't wanna hurt no one  
  
So, don't tell me you love me  
Don't tell me you love, love me do  
Don't tell me you love me  
'Cause love's one thing that I cannot do  
And it's the only thing that I can't give to you  
  
So, don't tell me you love me

Baby when i think about you  
I think about love  
Darlin' don't live without you  
And you love  
  
If i had these golden dreams  
Of my yesterdays  
I would wrap you in heaven  
'Till I'm dying on the way  
  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love to you  
Baby if i think about you  
I think about love  
  
Darlin if i live without you  
I live without love  
  
If i had the sun and the moon  
I would give you both night and day  
Of satisfyin  
  
Feel like makin  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like making love to you  
  
And if i had those golden dreams  
Of my yesterdays  
I would wrap you in heaven  
Till I'm dyin on the way  
  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love to you

Gotta make this money  
Gotta make this money  
This money is me  
This money is everything I do and see  
  
Who are you to judge me  
Just let me be - and let me breathe  
I see this whole world headed for damnation  
And I'm ready to leave  
  
I can't believe this whole world twisted me  
You fuckin' biggets, you fakes, you want to-be's  
I see the future and its lookin' grim  
A lake of fire lookin' like a gonks whip  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a fist of rage (one foot in the grave)  
I'm a fist of rage (far from saved)  
I'm a fist of rage (in a broken state)  
(I'm a razor blade slippin' through a bale of hay)  
I'm a fist of rage! [Repeat: x 4]  
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back  
  
Huh-huh, Slim Jim's  
And the tin men grins  
Fat heads with dreads  
And all the feds growing shark fins  
  
Huh-huh, my girls knocked up  
We're in love but she's young and I think I'm being locked up  
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsu  
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been through  
  
I'm looking for love but it's got too many dam faces  
I can't win even with these four aces  
My place is here with the mix and the tricks and sickos  
I spend g's but only make nickels  
  
My soul tickles  
But this ain't even fun and games  
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain  
My fuse is short and its lit like me I'm short  
  
It's sketchy  
It's getting hard to see  
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath  
These people take and they take  
Until there's nothing left  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ya feeling bold with me  
Your up a creek  
And you don't know it  
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it  
And I know it  
  
'Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it  
Payback on your ass cause I know I owe it  
Now when your goin' down bet I'll be blowing up  
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and know you're fucked  
  
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage  
(Coming - Come and feel me) [Repeat: x 4]  
  
[Chorus]

You know I spent a little time out in Malibu  
I spent quite a bit down in Nashville too  
Cuz I like the beach and loves to honky tonk  
But the place that I call home  
Is where I never have to feel alone  
It's the place where I was raised and I was born  
  
And the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine  
And there's no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
Flyin' high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin' high  
With an ice cold beer  
Got nowhere to go, no place I'd rather be  
Yeah the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
You know I've traveled on yachts thru the south of France  
Think I even got a pair of Versace pants  
But all that makes me feel is like a fool  
Cuz a pontoon boat, and a bottle of Beam  
A couple good friends, and some cut off jeans  
Has made us realize, you can't buy cool  
  
And the grass don't get much greener  
And life can't get no sweeter  
I got a funny cigarette and a two-dollar bottle of wine  
And there's no need for new beginnings  
More money or window trimmings  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high  
  
Flyin' high  
In an old lawn chair  
Flyin' high  
And my family near  
Nowhere to go no place I'd rather be  
Yeah they mock me because I stand out  
But I ain't never had to take a handout  
And if the good Lord's willin', I'm a keep on chillin', refillin' and flyin'
high.

Kid Rock, I'm gonna rock the house biatch  
It goes, 1 for the trebble, and 2 for the bass  
  
And the blue eyed devils gonna rock this place  
'Cause I don't give a damn what ya label me  
I'm still able G, to wreck the whole town  
Got my cards on the table, it's a Royal Flush  
  
In God I trust, and it's a must I bust  
The angel dust and the strick 9  
A big bag of shrooms and the Boones wine  
Never uptight, see I'm that light that shines  
  
Lady's always askin me "what's your sign"  
I'm a Capricorn, not a Taurus  
I'm the oriental lick master from the forest  
I'm the Borris, sorest, looser that you ever saw  
  
But watch out slick, I'm quick on the draw  
And I'll be blastin the fools like this  
Pop, pop, pop, shit!  
Rocks no joke, I go straight for the throat  
  
Chillin it late on my old mans boat  
I hate to grin about the girls I got  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7 yo I got a whole lot  
Stright pimpin, can't stop this  
  
So when I get low on dough, I make my hoe's dance topless  
Watch me rock this, I'm far from spotless  
I'm really kinda dirty, flippin you the birdy  
Rollin on chrom D's  
  
Bumpin them motherfuckin Beasties  
I see these emcee's laugh at Rock  
But I'm nuclear  
Feel the wrath of the after shock  
  
'Cause after Rock, rocks the spot, I leave the whole crowd hot  
On the mic with my nuts in my hand  
With the sluts backstage, hittin nuts on demand  
That could never be a buster, a straight hustler  
  
I got a good bitch, but I still don't trust her  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
  
I'm just another kid tryin to get mine  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme uhh, uhh  
  
I gave an invitation to the president, just for kicks  
It said "your courduly invited to suck my dick"  
I'm a trippin, true as this  
I got mill in the bank, cause I make so much sense  
  
Hell bent, and I'm whisky bound  
Is there anything wacker than the wicked clown (no)  
Some people just don't get it  
They got no talent so they hide behind the gilnick and rcok with it  
  
It's a shame, but who's to blame.  
I got a see note brain, steel veins  
I got love for everyone  
Just don't get dumb, cause if ya get dumb,ya get done  
  
From the jimmy to the beach, to the bum  
From the fist, to the back, to attack with the hand granades  
You can't fade me, I'm down for mine  
And the hate in the world, is the sign of the times  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
  
I'm just another kid tryin to get mine  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme uhh, uhh  
  
Now I'm the highest, flyest emcee in town  
The scratchin, most smackinest emcee around  
Heaven sentin, representin always  
Your on MTV, radio, game all crazed  
  
I blaze smoke screen, 4-5 OG's  
Got the lady's breakin' with this goatee  
24 on a 12 step relapse  
Phil and Bill bozin' at the knee caps  
  
I'll be back if I don't make green  
With the funky rhymes and the no sell out themes  
I have dreams and aspirations  
My graduation, was from pimp of the county to pimp of the nation  
  
Damn nation is shockin' signs  
From the Kid Rock flows, to the free style rhymes

Do what you have to  
I do what I had to  
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue  
And as I rank I want to thank no one  
  
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
You helped me around  
My parents put me down  
I never skipped town  
  
I stood my ground  
We kept showin' up  
Drinkin and throwin' up  
Rap was my life  
  
As I was growin' up  
Actin a fool in school no one topped us  
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious  
Drivin a bronco  
  
Runnin my own show  
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes  
And me and Bo got together  
Made sense  
  
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements  
I scratched records and performed a few tricks  
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit  
Pumpin the new sounds town to town  
  
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown  
Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock  
The Genuine Article  
  
They don't want me  
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
  
F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice  
Its like the roll of the dice  
For a whole new life  
But don't get my song wrong  
  
I enjoy it a lot  
Walkin around like a big shot  
'Cause I'm Kid Rock  
Smooth as an ice cube  
  
Cool as an igloo  
And more complex, than a rubix cube  
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue  
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run  
  
And as I incline through time to get mine  
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line  
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep  
The one who finds is the one who seeks  
  
So I sought and fought  
And a lot I got taught  
And although I left those who stole got caught  
Many shows I rocked  
  
Many suckers I laughed at  
And those who snapped back usually got slapped  
The cat if I was strap  
'Cause I was a son of a gun  
  
Livin' life on the run  
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none  
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson  
Pumpin' the new sounds town to town  
  
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown  
On the upside with nuthin' too high  
The Genuine Article  
  
They don't want me  
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done  
Chuck nice break that beat down  
Uh huh...Uh huh..Uh huh  
KDC...huh  
  
Six Generations of rap and I'm first  
Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed  
I worked and worked and worked and I worked  
When many thought I was just gettin jerked  
  
Used, abused, but I paid my dues  
And now no one out there could fill my shoes  
And my pants and do this dance  
This shit didn't happen by chance  
  
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick  
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip  
And now up and up and up I won't stop  
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock  
  
Yes me the low key MC  
With the ability to rock a party  
Anywhere and make people stare  
I'm lookin while I'm cookin with no care  
  
Pumpin the new sound town to town  
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown  
And still I won't stop growin this flat top  
The Genuine Article  
  
They don't want me  
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

I turn my 15 minutes into 10 long years  
I made a million from drinkin' beers  
I got a jet, just some touch in these frets  
So if my ego gets outta check  
  
I guess I'm guilty  
I said I'm guilty  
  
I might do a little yack, might of rub my trab  
Now and then, get into a scrap  
That's alright, I got lawyers for that  
And then motherfuckers, they even know  
  
That I'm guilty  
I said I'm guilty  
  
I never sweat, really feel regret  
Well cameras roll when you least expect  
Some other times ended up online  
And motherfucker, if that's a crime  
  
I guess I'm guilty  
  
I know agreement, a shit ain't findin'  
You catch me on your charts, still climbin'  
A big, big Nascar reshinin'  
I said I'm goin' platinum, bitch I went diamond  
I've been rhymin' solid check it out  
I've been climbin', flamin' all about  
Where you at, I've been here for years  
Come on, every little body listen  
  
You know I'm guilty  
I'm guilty  
You know I'm guilty  
I'm guilty, guilty

[Kid Rock]  
And if you feel it  
Then let me know it  
Show it, here's your chance  
Don't blow it  
I got game too player  
Now watch me throw it  
I feel we owe it  
To the people on the real side  
To collide styles because it seems  
Real music died  
We got pride in our city, Detroit  
Kid Rock and Bradley baby, mmm,  
Now that's the real joint  
And when it hits it's like a fist  
From Joe Louis  
Try to get higher than us  
You'll just blow through us...  
  
[Robert Bradley]  
I saw lightening  
I heard thunder  
As the river bout to flow  
I saw faces  
So many places  
Wonderin where I got to go  
Feel like I got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
Where I can rest my aching soul  
  
Take me higher  
A little higher  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
Higher  
A little higher  
  
I heard stories  
I got older  
Wonder if I truly believe  
But I'll take what  
You give me brother  
Wonder if I really need  
But I know that  
Come tomorrow  
I'm gonna reach a higher spot  
Smoke and fire  
Take me higher  
Somehow I got to breathe  
  
Take me higher  
A little higher  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
Higher  
A little higher  
Higher  
  
A little higher  
Higher  
Take me up  
  
[Kid Rock]  
And if you feel it in your toes  
And you won't stop  
And if it's deep in your soul  
Then you can't stop  
And if you know what I know  
Then you won't stop  
We're goin way up, way up  
Way up, way up, way up  
  
[Robert Bradley]  
Take me up  
Take me up  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
A little higher  
A little higher  
Higher...

I'm drunk again, excuse the hiccup  
The redneck originator, rollin' in my pick up  
Truck jacked up with the four gold shocks  
And where I come from mud flaps come stock  
  
People Kid Rock it up and down the block  
And the hens all flock to the coup with the cock  
You want to rock with me baby, row it down to the swamp  
Dock your boat, we'll do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it, hi-ho  
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho, haha  
  
I like stuckies, truckers and big mesh hats  
I like large round women in laundromats  
I like to wander jack like a backwards thug  
And watch the moonshine through the bottom of a jug  
  
Hugging and kissing with my vision all blurry  
Sifting through this world of worry  
Hurry up with love, please, God bless  
I don't do drugs anymore or any less  
  
I didn't start this mess on this planet  
Stop looking at me like a bandit  
I've been chilling down at the swamp  
With the folks that want to do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it, hi-ho  
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho  
  
Now people want to know how to do this dance  
Life your legs in the air like you wet your pants  
Plant your hands on the top of your butt  
And stomp around the woods like you're all fucked up  
  
Circle up the trucks, fire up the brush  
Untuck your shirt, we're gonna kick some dust  
Don't two plus two it or three plus three it  
Four by four and to a place that's scenic  
  
Heat it up like some hot ham hocks cooking  
And hop to the spot where the cops ain't looking  
Bring your whole flock, go on down to the swamp  
And we can rock all night doing the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it, hi-ho  
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho

Hey dude, you recordin'  
  
Well fire it up, chop one out, somebody's got to know  
That I'm two days in, I got two days left to go  
'Cause I am Georgia, I am Memphis, Tennessee  
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be  
I am love and I am hate, I'm your late night drunk debate  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
  
Have you ever seen the sun over the rocky mountains shinin'  
Or touched the sands of a southern Florida beach  
Have you seen a grown man cry or a child that's slowly dying  
Have you looked inside to see all that you can see  
  
And I am North and South Dakota, and New York City  
I am everything Hollywood wants to be  
I am love and I am hate, and the critics can all debate  
But they'll never put a finger on me  
No you'll never put your finger on  
  
Ohh, ohh, hey, hey  
Ohh, ohh, yeah, eh, yeah, eh, hey, hey  
  
Have you seen the Northern falls or the midwest seasons changing  
A Montana storm, or warm Kentucky rain  
Have you heard the love that sings over inner city sidewalks  
Have you risen above all that leads to hate  
  
And I am Boston and D.C., and all of Detroit city  
I am everything that Hollywood wants to be  
I am Southern rock n roll, country and hip-hop and soul  
And you'll never put your finger on me  
  
I'm a father and I'm a friend, I'm your brother until the end  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
I am "Only God Knows Why", I'll be a "Cowboy" till I die  
But you'll never put your finger on me  
  
You'll never put your finger on me, you'll never put it on, put it on, on me  
You'll never put, never put it on, put it, put it on, hey, never put it on  
You'll never put, never, never, never, never, never, never  
Put your finger on me

[Chorus]  
I am the Bullgod  
I am free and I feed  
On all that is forsaken  
  
(I'm gonna get you)  
(I see through you)  
(I'm gonna get youuu)  
  
I'm like a train I roll hard lettin' off much steam  
In the cut-off flanel and the dusty jeans, baby  
I never was cool with James Dean, but I be hangin' tough  
With my man Jim Beam  
  
I swing low like a chimp, back in '86  
Then I was seein' a shrink  
But now I'm humble and I can only think  
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp  
  
So ask no questions and I tell no lies  
I got big old pupils and bloodshot eyes  
I'm on the brink, if you know what I mean  
And the twelve step program couldn't keep me clean  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Unh, huh, huh, said I'm trippin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A lot of people poke fun and that's alright  
But when I start pokin' back they get all uptight, uh  
You can't cap with the master son  
So sit your ass down 'fore I blast you one  
  
'Cause I'm so greasy you can call me mud  
And I feel a little hate running through my blood  
I want to flood the world with my twisted thoughts  
You can bid all day, but I can't be bought  
  
Uh, break it up, let's tie one on  
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn  
So I grab my Walkman but before I cut  
I go behind the garage and fire it up  
  
'Cause I'm the Bullgod, you understand?  
The illegitimate son of man  
The T-O-P to the D-O-G, or the P-O-T to the G-O-D  
And I'm trippin'  
  
Huh, huh, said I'm trippin' (Didn't you know?)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Forsaken)  
  
Psh...You ain't nothin'...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
(Come on get 'em up)  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
(Yeah)  
  
I get a feeling of peace  
From a low so high  
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by  
These thoughts I have, I can't mold the sense  
  
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense  
Born and raised in the outer lands  
And at times you could say I'm out of hand  
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run  
  
Every time that paper hits my tongue  
And sometimes it seems so odd  
When my veins are poppin' and I'm on the nod  
I am the Bullgod, you understand?  
And here in my hand is my master plan  
  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you  
I'm gonna get you  
I see through you!

Breaking the silence  
Is the hardest thing in life  
Knowin' that you're wrong  
Feelin' like you can't go on  
I've been a victim  
So many times  
But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong  
  
With the fresh cut mullets  
Back row in sight  
Pass the packed bullet  
I'm gonna rock all night  
  
Up tight right wingers  
Trying to say I'm what  
But I'm a flight bound singer  
Not givin' a fuck  
  
Hard luck of the devil  
With the grace of God  
On a level of Oz  
And it makes you nod  
  
With the body of a sinner  
Mind of a saint  
I'm everything you love  
Everything you hate  
  
Hit a lot of curves  
Hard roads and hills  
Got nerves of steel  
And watched time stand still  
  
It took too long  
But I stood my height  
You can say I'm wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
But you ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
right  
  
You can save the environment  
With all your wit  
But can you save your children  
From a world of bullshit  
You look at me  
With a loss for love  
But if you took me out  
Would your kid still do drugs  
You want to point your finger in the unclear  
You ought a point your finger at the mirror  
  
You want to trip  
Quit 'cause I'm a keep rippin'  
You can bitch but the strippers gonna keep strippin'  
I'm singing songs in the key of life  
You can say I'm wrong  
  
[Chorus]

My ideas like highs  
They come and they go  
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know  
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep  
  
Someone so shallow that's in so deep  
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared  
Completely blinded but things are so clear  
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother  
  
I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father  
Fuckin' A is all I got to say  
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way  
I was born into this world and I don't know why  
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die

[Verse 1]  
Sometimes I've had too much to drink  
Get all stoned and play some Hank  
I guess that's just the way I am  
And I love the man from Galilee  
Because he died for you and me  
I met them both in Dixieland  
  
[Hook]  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
[Verse 2]  
When the water all turned into wine  
I lost my mind for a time  
I felt them both holding my hand  
Looking through these bloodshot eyes  
Praise The Lord I saw the light  
And two sets of footprints in the sand  
  
[Hook]  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right there by my side  
  
I was cashing in, I was casting stones  
I was lost in sin I was on my own  
But now I don't feel alone  
Cuz I've got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam, to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right here by my side  
With Jesus and Bocephus, right here until the day I die  
  
Jesus and Bocephus

Used as a scapegoat and taped to the wall  
Bruised and abused on some foreign soil  
Trained to kill baby, that's what we do  
And programmed to bleed red, white and blue  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, we fight or die  
  
Grab your guns son, said we headed for war  
Like your uncle JT done years before  
No pussy, no dope, this ain't Saigon  
But keep your heads up for roadside bombs  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, we fight or die  
  
Even in darkness, you're my strength, my soul, my will to survive  
But in this fight I stand ready to die  
  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
I'll say a prayer for you to make it through to the other side  
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night  
C'mon and grab your guns, let's ride  
And may your conscience be your guide  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon  
C'mon, yeah  
  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa  
Oh oh oh oh whoa

I got my Cat Scratch Fever eight-track  
My best friend's in a gun rack  
I'm a lowlife  
I owe everybody money  
I think racist jokes are funny  
I'm a lowlife  
I got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth  
I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out  
With your wife  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
  
I got kids I never seen  
And their momma's seventeen  
I'm a lowlife  
I take strippers out to breakfast  
You can add that to my checklist  
I'm a lowlife  
Ahh the landlord called the rent is due  
I spent it all on a Kiss tattoo  
I Rock n Roll all night  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
Livin' the highlife  
  
I'm watchin' porno on the TV  
Wonderin' why she'd ever leave me  
I'm a lowlife  
The object of my affection  
Asked the police for protection  
I'm a lowlife  
The romance is gone, I'm doin' fine  
Me and your mom had a real good time  
Just last night  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
  
I make black music for the white man  
Keep cocaine upon my nightstand  
I'm a lowlife  
Ain't never hung out in the Catskills  
But I've been to jail in Nashville  
I'm a lowlife  
I've got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth  
I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out  
With your wife  
  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
Livin' the highlife

Now I'm sheddin' my skin  
Ya gotta listen to me  
I'll tell ya what I see, never belive what you read  
This shit is spreadin' like a disease  
Never feel withdrawn, time to move on, get your groove on  
Say goodbye, everything must die, solidify  
And fly to a new level  
A place where love is unconditional, physical  
And non-denomanitional  
  
Like a snake, she'd my skin, leave my past where I've been...  
Can you feel what I feel?  
To hold on must be killed, don't cry over what's been spilled  
Yeah, yeah,  
Can you feel what I feel?  
  
See the kid rock pumpin' up a' down your block with no cares  
Long hair, swingin' middle fingers in the air  
People stare and point, I hit the joint and laugh  
Kiss my ass!  
The past is more than 10 years I've grown from a complete unknown  
Into the high zone, million dollar home and a diamond ring  
Never thought I'd a mount to a damn thing  
I'm the man, singin' like curtis may  
Mack on homies like ruby day  
It's been a long time comin', but you know what's happened  
Straight pimpin' and sittin' five times platinum..

Burnin  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no, oh no, here we go now  
Oh no...  
  
Went to New York to cut my first LP  
Ridin down Broadway in a taxi  
Hang a right at 25th  
Just a little too swift, jo'  
  
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on  
Here's 4 bucks you drive like a moron  
Lost in The Apple and I'm all alone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
In the village chillin' with a 40 in a brown bag  
I'm seein' freaks, and also fags  
I see a set of nice legs in my site  
But its a fuckin' transvestite  
  
Walkin' in the daylight  
Now I'm trippin' and I'm like blown  
But I take another sip and say to each his own  
He'de get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Now if your sounds are knockin' to the cool Kid Rockin'  
Has got your girl jockin'  
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap  
'Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm goin back to back  
  
With a track, uh, that's just too clean  
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam  
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur  
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver  
  
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty  
Instead I rock the house in every major city  
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali'  
I get down and I yodel in the valley  
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brookland zones  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home  
  
Ate ave in the 40 deuce, its like a freak show  
A lot of hookers try to pop that week, so  
I walk with a limp when I pimp through  
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illin' with the Beast Crew  
  
It's pickin' up, ill check this fact  
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac  
Conjested, overcrowded, see ya I'm gone  
  
'Cause New Yorks Not My Home

I've been sittin' here trying to find myself  
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself  
Looking for the payback listening for the playback  
They say that every man bleeds just like me  
  
And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line  
I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time  
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain  
I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same  
  
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud  
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a crowd  
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am  
Out stretched hands and one night stands  
  
Still I can't find love and when the walls are tumbling down  
I will always be around  
Yeah...  
  
And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around  
People don't know about the things I say and do  
They don't understand about the shit I've been through  
It's been so long since I've been home  
  
I've been gone, I've been gone way too long  
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss  
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this  
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm  
  
You get what you put in and people get what the deserve  
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine  
I've been given but just ain't gettin' I've been walkin that thin line  
So I think I'll keep a walking with my head held high  
  
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why  
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why  
Only God knows why, why, why, why  
Only God knows why  
  
Take it to the river, hey  
Take it to the river, hey

Smokin any thing that I can fit in a pipe  
Slammin bottles of tussin and going fishing for pike  
Never uptight my high won't permit it  
My problem's life but I don't sweat it, just live it  
  
And I'm not your average rapper  
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper  
So bitch better watch your back  
'cause I push more power than a Marshall stack  
  
Never the wack but oh so pesky  
Some say I can't flow but mother fucker don't test me  
And if you arrest me you dumb cop  
I'll find your daughter and I'll give her this cock  
  
Kid Rock's my mother fuckin name  
Bitch you know me so pass the O.E.  
And don't talk about takin me out  
'cause I got your girl and I'm makin her shout  
  
Just like a piano I'm really grand  
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan  
Some friends call me fly  
But most just call me when they want to get high  
  
It ain't the disco Cisco Kid mother fucker  
It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting  
Dick-swingin' pussy lickin' punk  
little skinny mother fucker and I'm not no hunk  
  
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks  
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk  
Walk with a limp 'cause I pimp like a pro  
And if ya dis me punk I'll fuck your ho  
  
And though you think I'm nothing more than a young punk  
I'm like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk  
I move quick like a cheetah  
And it ain't shit to me to just beat a  
  
M.C. down who looks like a dick  
Jumpin 'round like a homo on a pogo stick  
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk  
And just "Give 'em an example of how a D.J. works"  
  
'cause it's blackjack and I got two aces  
Been many places seen many faces  
And everywhere I go people want to jive  
So I keep my fingers on my .45  
  
So don't cross my dusty path  
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass  
Don't front ho pass the jay  
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J.  
  
To the beat y'all and I won't stop  
And I'ma rock this shit till your eardrums pop  
Everybody's tryin' to get a piece of the pie  
But I don't let bullshit spoil my high

Living my life in a slow hell  
Different girl every night at the hotel  
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days  
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey  
Wish I had a good girl to miss me  
Oh I wonder if I'll ever change my ways  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
I put your picture away  
Sat down and cried today  
I can't look at you  
While I'm lying next to her  
I put your picture away  
Sat down and cried today  
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her  
  
I called you last night in the hotel  
Everyone knows but they won't tell  
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right  
I've been waiting on you for a long time  
Filling up on heartaches and cheap wine  
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
I put your picture away  
I wonder where you've been  
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him  
I put your picture away  
I wonder where you've been  
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him  
  
I saw you yesterday with an old friend  
  
It was the same old same how have you been  
  
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey  
  
You reminded me of brighter days  
  
I hoped you were coming home to stay  
I was headed to church  
  
I was off to drink you away  
  
I thought about you for a long time  
Can't seem to get you off my mind  
I can't understand why we're living life this way  
  
I found your picture today  
I swear I'll change my ways  
I just called to say I want you to come back home  
I found your picture today  
  
I swear I'll change my ways  
I just called to say I want you  
To come back home  
I just called to say I love you  
Come back home

I feel world is cheatin'  
My heart is barely beatin'  
Like alone wolf in the pack  
  
No one to believe in  
Tryin' to fight these demons  
Where I'm going's where I'm at  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
  
I've been a man of reason  
Only to end up even  
I've paid the price of givin' back  
  
Low down and double dealing  
Up on the mountain kneeling  
I fell your love is just a trap  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Siftin' though the devil's pot o' gold  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
  
I feel just like I'm trapped by nighttime  
I sleep with one eye open in the day  
I've walked the wrong way but I've walked a long way  
  
Hey, rebel soul  
  
Touched by the hand of treason  
I'm through with not believin'  
I'm leavin' town my bags are packed  
  
And if you feel the need when  
You finally find your feelings  
You'll know just where to find me at  
  
With high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh, rebel soul

Turn me up in the headphones  
  
Been alotta cheap talk but I rock still  
From the streets of Shanghai back to Knoxville  
Sittin' high on a mountain top holdin' shop spreadin' the good news  
Been alotta false prophets and quick hits  
And a lot of unAmerican bullshit  
But the time has come to settle and the devil's gonna make u choose  
  
And just like a cold wind blowin' can u feel me comin' for u  
Just like a freight train rollin' packed tight full of rhythm and blues  
  
Testify  
It's a Rock revival  
Don't need a suit  
Ya don't need a bible  
Get up and dance  
I'm gonna set you free yeah  
Testify  
It's all sex, drugs, rock n roll  
A soul sensation that you can't control  
And you can see I practice what I preach  
I'm your rock n roll Jesus  
Yes I am  
  
Been alotta bling bling but it ain't real  
And alotta new kings but I won't kneel  
Sittin' high on a mountain top, holdin' shop singin' the raw dog blues  
Like in old Mississippi's dirty cotton fields  
Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels  
It's the same song spinning but the same song's always been true  
  
And I'm gonna take my roll cuz I ain't got nothin' to lose  
And I'm gonna save your soul if it's really what you want me to do  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Get on your knees  
  
I'm your rock n roll Jesus

15 years on this lonely road  
I paid my own way  
I carried my own load  
I never ask too much from no one  
  
I was much too proud  
All I ever wanted  
Was to play my music for a sold out crowd  
Bitches money fame  
  
They say I had it all  
6 foot 1  
I walked around like I was 10 feet tall  
Did you see me shine  
  
Where the hell were you now  
Detroit City back in '99  
Stoned out of my mind  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
  
I had to slow things down  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Life's been good to me so far  
  
Hope it's been kind to you  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
Now I've been rollin' on love and lust  
  
I ride around on this million dollar bus  
But this bus is just a bus man  
I can't sleep at night  
Man I miss my babies  
  
And I'd really like to fuck my wife  
But she ain't here tonight  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
After the lights go down  
  
I live out in the woods now  
It helps me keep my feet on the ground  
Life's been good to me so far  
Hope it's been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
I've seen this train wreck  
Time and time again  
  
I felt It's pain  
I've seen it take my friends  
You've got to stop and take a look man  
Or life will pass you by  
  
Get you a guitar and a good song  
That's all you really need to ride  
On that rock n' roll pain train  
I can't slow it down  
  
The music and the whiskey  
Don't it make you want to get loud  
Life's been good to me so far  
Hope It's been kind to you  
  
Stand strong in the storms of life  
The sun will always shine on you  
The sun will always shine on you

Tears on the pillow  
Is all you leave behind  
And the only thing you know, this time  
Is it's time to let go  
So put the key under the mat  
And don't you look back, just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
Cause trapped in these blues, ain't where you belong  
So baby rock on  
  
Let the songs and the static  
Fight for the dial  
Inside an addict's last passin' mile  
Well I know it ain't easy, but the wheel's in your hand  
And who knows where you'll land, so just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
And may the good Lord God bless you, and help you along  
Now baby rock on  
  
And baby don't stop, just  
  
Rock on, baby rock on  
You ain't got nothing to lose, that ain't already gone  
I know your heart's black and blue, but life don't last long  
So baby rock on  
  
Baby rock on

Basically make her scream  
At the top of her longs

[Verse 1]  
We haven't really talked about it  
All we do is walk around it now  
I hate to say I thought about it  
I wished that we could make this work somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not really complicated  
I can hear it when you sigh  
It comes a time we have to face it  
Maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lately I can feel us drifting  
Even tho the good outweighs the bad  
It feels like our world is shifting  
And yet, you are the best I've ever had  
  
[Chorus]  
I still love to watch you sleeping  
I still see that look in your eyes  
But they're seein' and believin'  
That maybe it's just time to say goodbye  
  
[Bridge]  
Say goodbye to all the times we treasured  
Say goodbye, let the chips fall where they lay  
Say goodbye, to things we cannot measure  
Walk away, say goodbye!  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'll remember you forever  
I'll remember every single year  
Runnin' through the rain and laughin'  
And later in our bed we feel so near  
And I'll know when I am older  
And the clouds fill up the sky  
I may look over my shoulder  
And no-one was too young to say goodbye  
Years from now when I am older  
I may sit and wonder why  
Will I look over my shoulder?  
And know I was too young to say goodbye  
I was just too young to say goodbye  
To say goodbye!

Latley I've been spendin' lots of time with my kid  
Tellin' him stories  
About the things that we did  
When we were a family  
  
Long time ago  
I've answerd his questions  
'Til I'm blue in the face  
Wish all that hurt in him  
  
I could erase  
But I tell him the truth  
Cause he ain't to young to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Single father  
Part time mother  
When I'm not one  
Then I'm the other  
You used to be  
My full time lover  
Now I'm a single father  
And a part time mother  
I spend every minute  
I can with my boy  
There's no doubt about it  
He's my pride and joy  
  
Someday he will grow up  
And I won't have him no more  
Some things I just find  
Too hard to explain  
  
So we go to mcdonalds  
Or I buy him a train  
And we go put it together  
On the living room floor  
  
Such is the life  
Of a single father  
He says daddy explain  
If it's not too much bother  
  
While its just you and me  
Living here in this home  
I don't understand it  
And neither does he  
  
Why there's just two  
When there should be three of us  
Sharing this moment  
Lord I feel so alone  
  
[Chorus]

There's a new day on the horizon  
There's a rising in the air  
Somewhere somebody's tryin' to tell me they care  
So I'm a lift my head to a new day  
Plant my feet on the ground  
Look at life in a new way and what's goin' down  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try and change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And slow my roll  
Mixin' loneliness and whiskey  
Heartache and cocaine  
Livin' life like a gypsy, lost and ashamed  
So I'm a look to the Lord as my witness  
Rest my hat on a shelf  
Trade these boots for forgiveness and find myself  
'Cause today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Try to change my ways forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, 'cause they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And I can't believe sixteen has long since past  
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', and never looking back  
And I won't survive if I live this life this fast, no, no  
And today's the day, I'm gonna take things slow  
Change my ways, forgive and let all that go  
Tell the ones I love, what they need to know  
I'm gonna turn around, settle down  
And slow my roll  
Slow my roll, slow my roll

You've got a body like the devil  
And you smell like sex  
I can tell your trouble, but I'm still obsessed  
Because you know you're so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
Yeah  
Come on  
Yeah  
  
You like the kiss of death  
Like the hand of fame  
I can tell your trouble  
But I still wanna taste  
Because you know your so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
because you know you're so hott!  
I wanna get you alone...so hott  
I wanna get you stoned...so hott  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
  
So hott  
I wanna get you alone  
I wanna...get you stoned  
I don't wanna be your friend  
I wanna fuck you like I'm never gonna see you again  
See you again  
See you again

I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side  
Never drop top forty cause I always rock be -sides  
G-rides with a hundred spokes to match  
We roll two deep...three freaks...four amps in the back  
  
I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang  
Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing  
I want to twang like Hang...rock like roll  
Got soul like Stevie when I'm under the sun and so  
  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
Somebody's gotta feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
I never had a lot of money never made much sense  
Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent  
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed  
He's rockin' dickie's slippin lickin? honey?s steady  
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold  
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go  
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness  
  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
I see these people makin' money and it's funny to me  
Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me  
'Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more  
Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour  
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers  
  
Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror  
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt  
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt  
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my roap  
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because  
  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Some-some-some body's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
(Somebody's gotta feel this)  
Someone's got to feel this  
  
Feel this

Come on, yeah  
I like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will rock  
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd, Run-D.M.C., and that American pimp Kid Rock  
I like Willie, Waylon, George and Merle, and a lot of ZZ Top  
I like country, soul, rock n roll, and I love me some hip hop  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
I got a bougart and west coast chopper, that sure make them bitches stare  
Got a dead flamingo wrapped around this cowboy hat I wear  
I like to cuss, yell, scream, fight and rasie all kinds of hell  
And if you ride to live, like I live to ride, then let me hear that rebel yell  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
  
One time for your mind, yeah  
  
I like my whiskey straight up, daiquiri's make me ill  
And if someone touches my beaver skins I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pick-up truck, I'm a four wheelin' maniac  
And if you want to race then just name the place and I'll show you where it's
at  
  
I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I don't like no new wave techno bands around  
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit  
And this one here, goes out to my man  
  
The legendary David Allen Coe  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey

I think you might like to hear something from us  
Stand up  
Put your hands up  
Come on get up  
  
Kid Rock's in the house yo, Ready to pick up  
The tempo and you know so I will fo somewhat unconventional  
But comprehendible  
I'm the presentable good lookin  
  
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin  
Heatin' the house up just like a hot late  
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate  
You didn't think in a blink I'd stnd here  
  
Now your in fear and stand clear  
You can't come near this hot sylin  
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin  
Aso the perfect lyric announcer  
  
On the set with a cold forty ouncer  
Ready to glide from sid to side  
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
  
N-NNow yes I'm new  
But before I'm threw  
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe  
'Cause I'm solo  
  
A young pro on the go  
Close to an angel  
But I wear no Halo  
I just shake, create, and never act fake  
  
And I learned to dislike and not hate  
Because hatred leads to an uproar  
Violence is on thing I am not here for  
I'm just here flat out  
  
And to blow the roof  
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do  
Pump it up like an air comb presser  
Teach to each like a wise professor  
  
No job I strive to reach high  
Make the girls in the house all sigh  
And I'll glide from side to side  
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
  
Appied, Step in Stride you bet I do  
Get you hig like a bottle of German Brew  
Comin clean  
New on the scene  
  
Makin girls scream  
I you know what I mean  
'Cause they dream ofme to rock the place  
And put a big smile upon their face  
  
Any girl of any race  
But they have to like the bass  
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on te set  
Workin up a sweat  
  
No Jive Kid Rock uprrivd  
And I Step in Stride  
  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied  
'Cause I step in stride  
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

Non-commercial lyrics run like Hershel  
Walkin' fast cause I'm a smooth talker  
Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel  
Just heal  
  
And always look for the seal that's real  
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this  
Kid Rock serious and I mean business  
Ascending up and up I keep boosting  
  
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston  
With a mind of violence, right, I might  
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's  
To release to each and be friends of  
Every single, individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin'  
Come together  
  
Jumbo, yo that's how I'm movin'  
I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'  
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority  
'Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me  
  
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'  
A lotta just came in, sound the same in  
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men  
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan  
  
'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak  
And if you step out of line your up shits creek  
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it  
His style ain't dope, its a throat, and I slit it  
  
I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride  
No half steppin', I always take a full stride  
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made  
I used to come correct in the projects  
  
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement  
House and parties like real estate agent  
So on, so strong, and everyone got along  
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
  
Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears  
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot  
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot  
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war  
  
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out  
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out  
New tax the acts and half the drug industry  
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me  
  
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up  
For one to get over, one must get stuck up  
One will roll up, another will smoke up  
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up  
  
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there  
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air  
'Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin for a hooker  
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her  
  
For a place to hide and when he got his ride  
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died  
Her family cried over this homicide  
And why they pondered, why she wandered  
  
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop  
All to smoke a little cooked up rock  
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along  
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'  
Come together  
  
From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein  
Maybe I'm ahead of my time  
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states  
Surrounded by the Great Lakes  
  
I was once out cold at 15 years old  
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo  
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats  
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks  
  
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes  
But now I realize it wasn't too wise  
So now I teach, I'll reach to each  
And every single individual  
  
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together  
Come... come... come... come together

Hard to remember if anything was real  
Cold like December and I don't like how that feels  
I been livin' a long time  
I been givin' a long time too  
  
And I can't believe I wasted so much time on you  
But time has brought me back around  
Back around to me  
And I feel so free  
Yeah  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Bad like Brutus  
Hit like Joe Louis  
I gots lots of cash  
But I'm not Jewish  
  
I'm not no nudist  
I'm fully clothed  
And I fuck hot pussy until it's cold  
Got rhymes of gold Got a voice of platinum  
  
I'm not Dwayne Wayne  
But that's what's happening  
I'm back in black and if ya have to ask  
You can kiss my Anglo-Saxon ass  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Hot like a toti  
Smooth like Mondovi  
Around the way they call me Bathroom Bobby  
Sugar is my hobby and my greatest joy  
And that's why they call me "cowboy"  
  
No Jive I come alive like Frampton  
I'm bigger than Seinfeld's house in the Hamptons  
Cramp my style, go ahead and give it your best  
But I ain't met a mutha fucka who can do that yet  
  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
Sugar tonight  
  
Hey  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Whoo woo  
Whoo woo  
Now who's gonna give me some sugar tonight  
Whoo woo  
Whoo woo  
  
They call me Shotgun Bobby, rock the young hotties  
Jock the John Gottis, sock the paparazzi  
Real life Fonzie, I roll like Yahtzee  
I like stars and bars but I ain't no Nazi  
So fuck you, fuck u in the nose  
Fuck you and your flows, fuck you and your hoes  
Fuck u and your mother if u can't understand it  
I'm the illest mutha fucker on the God damn planet  
Huh

Bonnie shades  
And a high top fade  
So low you know on the mic with no aid  
You didn't think in a blink no way  
  
That I'd make the grade  
But now you say I use to go to school with him  
I use to go to dot dot bim  
I use to know his older brother  
  
I use to be his eighth grade lover  
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak  
He use to go with me, wrong you were my freak  
I never gave a hoot  
  
If a girl was cute  
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots  
And then they get dissed  
Crossed off my list  
  
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed  
Just like so world the girls will go low  
Just like Jock Custoe  
And blow  
  
Up come my drawers, see ya gotta go  
It's to plain  
Kid Rock's the name  
And I run my game  
  
From Frisco to Maine  
Never fell in love  
'Cause I'm a girl heartbreaker  
But still I built my skills and I'm the  
  
'Cause I'm the  
  
Super Rhyme Maker  
Come on, Yeah

Rhyme Maker  
  
Stop the madness  
You never had this  
Wild style of my b-boy badness  
Runnin' the show  
  
Clockin' the dough  
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not  
I'm Kid Rock  
Flat top and all  
  
Not Michael Jackson spinnin' singing off the wall  
But making everyone how I thump like thunder  
Got over like a mother  
While you went straight under  
  
And now you can't stand  
The way I jam  
Hold the mic in my hand  
And rock the whole land  
  
Man get jealous if you want to  
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do  
'Cause I work to hard to make ends match  
Started from scrath  
  
And to a lot of crap  
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch  
And I'm a bad mother fucker  
Believe that  
  
I'll pop on top more flop no stop  
Makin' every girl in the house want a piece of the rock  
And then I'll bring a new swing  
To make it understand the kid's running things

But go ahead cause my rap's made of brick

The lakes and pines they bleed of beauty and grace  
And the rivers they run wild like an endless race  
The forests soar so high then fall to the sea  
As church bells ring and sing in harmony  
  
I heard them say they're shuttin' Detroit down  
But I won't leave 'cause this is my hometown  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The concrete and steel stand strong against the wind  
With the memories of what was and what has been  
The sounds of sweet soul music and blue-collar blues  
There were seventeen colors for a Chevy all red white and blue  
  
I heard them say that you can't save that town  
But I won't leave, I will stand my ground  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
  
The ice and snow give way to a new spring bloom  
In the wake that hope and faith they will be home soon  
A new day dawns as the good Lord shines from above  
'Cause in the rubble and rust there remains a whole lotta love  
  
And I was here watchin' it all go down  
And I'll still be, when it comes back around  
  
And it's times like these we can't replace  
It's times like these we must embrace  
And even though it's bittersweet and brings us to our knees  
It makes us who we are, in times like these  
It makes us who we are in times like these

People like the way my style is rollin'  
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin'  
I'm not bullshittin'  
Here's how I'm hittin'  
  
Funkin' it up more than George Clinton  
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format  
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that  
I live press the best I won't rest the pest(?)  
  
'Cause I'm blessed and I jus won't settle for less  
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up  
The one with the hair that stands straight up  
People look and stare in shock  
  
Trippin' over a Rock  
Trippin' over a Rock  
  
Chased,and chased and chased but never close to caught  
And the skills I filled were all self taught  
With so many styles on each panfulls(?)  
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels  
  
As the girls admire the way I aspire  
To move piles of dough in my own empire  
Not a liar, I tell no lies  
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes  
  
But don't get me wrong I get wicked  
Shake that ass in my face and ill stick it  
Hit it get wit it  
Knock it out the box  
  
Trippin' over a rock  
Trippin' over a rock  
  
A genuine badman  
Like Yosemite Sam man  
I see-see-see-can rock the land  
And bring a new swing and sensation  
  
To represent the next generation  
So slack up You better back up  
Here comes the score and the weed in a jigsaw  
Fuck with me  
  
With no doubt  
Ill put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out  
Ill go deep in I won't weaken  
Guaranteed to keep the house beepin'  
  
Girls rockin' guys  
Try to to cockblock(?)  
  
Trippin over a rock

Here here we go from Japan to Romeo  
My flow is slow and it's ya know my first time on radio  
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild  
And that all might be true  
  
But it did not happen overnight  
So let me tell my tale to you  
It started out when I was six just tellin' dirty jokes  
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap  
  
Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do  
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth  
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not  
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block  
  
You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin it's tail  
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail  
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak  
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week  
  
So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all  
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standin tall...  
And you don't know me  
It's funny how one kid can cause so much confusion  
  
Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using  
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory  
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story  
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at  
  
Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back  
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style  
They try to diss they shoot they miss  
I walk off with a smile  
  
But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me  
And the booty naked truth is you don't know shit about me  
So when I'm in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me  
So you can see what's really me and find out you don't know me  
  
'cause you don't know me  
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam  
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam  
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty  
  
With every drind 'n every blink you seem to get more pretty  
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do  
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to  
(Ha!)  
  
Next day I awoke I almost choked  
Who's bringin me inside,  
My head was ringin' heard people singin' "here comes the bride"  
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see  
  
The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me  
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony  
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN'  
You don't know me...She didn't know me  
  
Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist  
But they bought my first L.P.  
You know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast  
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie  
  
What's your favorite song off that L.P.  
"Ah, Wax that Booty"  
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny  
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money  
  
But check on back 'cause it's a fact obscenity is no new thing  
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling  
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel  
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real  
  
Even though I don't look the same 'cause I cut off my flat top  
I'll always say just what I feel 'cause that's the real Kid Rock...  
And you don't know me.

Ha  
You took my friends away, Yeah  
You got them livin' for the grave  
Now everything's been fine since you been gone  
But you made my winter's feel so warm  
I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born  
  
Yeah  
See the suckers come down  
It's alright  
Mother Fucker  
Come see  
  
You played my soul for your fucking fool  
Yeah down in the beat  
You took my life and turned it around  
But you made my winter's feel so warm  
I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born  
  
Yeah  
See the suckers come down  
It's alright  
Mother Fucker  
Come see  
  
Yeah  
Your making me feel this way  
I can't live everytime I'm in my grave  
Yeah...Yeah  
You got time burning the place on me, Yeah  
Oh never alone, I've been fine, Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Your makin me feel this way  
Yeah...Yeah  
I guess I'm livin everytime you sit in my grave  
You got the joke to break on me  
So I'm never alone, I've been fine

I'ma pimp  
You can check my stats  
And rollin' a Fleetwood - that's how I mack  
I rock all the tracks  
  
So the world knows  
I love all the girls  
Smack all the hoes  
Show love to those who come real with it  
  
Life's a bitch but I deal with it  
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman  
Could drink about 15 Heinikeins  
I'm not born again  
  
But if I was I'd ask to come back with a little more love  
Well I'm puffin' a Winston  
Drinkin' a four-o  
Kid rock, and I'ma let you know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been sitting here just wasting time  
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind  
  
Its been a couple of months in this smokey room  
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes  
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit  
  
A little bit of love that's all I need  
A little inspiration and a bag of weed  
A seed to plant so my tree can grow  
You know I left my girl cause I need that hooooold up  
  
Wait a minute I'm about to flow  
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't no rough guy  
Ain't no tough guy  
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly  
Born in the game that's all I am  
  
Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam  
Fuck it  
I'm free to do what I please little lady  
I was born at night but not last night baby  
  
I've been around - seen some things  
I slept in dumpsters - got high with kings  
I don't bring much - ain't gotta lot to say  
But I got more time than Morris day  
  
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o  
Kid Rock and I'm a let you know  
  
[Chorus]

Headin' for the south lands  
Lookin' for some fun  
Down below that dixie mason  
I know your the one  
  
My tongue is chasin' my eyes are wide  
I can see paradise  
I been down here once or twice  
But I never seen it look so nice  
  
Ahh yeah  
Ahh yeah yeah  
I like it with the grass cut low  
Big mountain tops valley below  
I love it when you scream out my name  
  
Kid Rock, what you say?  
Kid Rock, what you say?  
Kid Rock, what you say?  
Kid Rock Yeahhhhh  
  
'Cause I'm a bad mama jamma from Detroit city  
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city  
I'm raw and greedy, show me, gimme, I'll nick it  
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it  
  
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie  
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body  
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man  
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
You know I've tried a thousand times and I've tried to explain  
And I've cried a thousand times over things that I can't change  
I've learned a lot you know, I grow each passing day  
And I blame nobody but myself for mistakes that I have made  
  
He's a bad maama jamma from Detroit city  
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city  
I'm raw and greedy, show me gimme, I'll nick it  
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it  
  
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie  
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body  
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man  
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
Lord knows when your not here, I get so damn bored of me  
And I've spent some lonely nights that did not have to be  
And if you could only see, I swear I'd show you true  
And although I carry a load out on the road,  
I want to come back home to you  
  
From Detroit to New Orleans  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
All them late nights, and early mornings  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
  
From Detroit to Carolina  
I love the life but I never sold my soul  
From London town down to China  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road  
Let me show you what I learned out on the road

Oooh..Ooooh  
I tell you it will shake the earth beneath your feet  
The light that shines will redefine your old beliefs  
What you reap is what you sow and so it goes  
Where you plant your needs is where your garden grows  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else, it will make you feel  
  
Each day ain't wine and roses  
I doubt it's meant to be  
Always a cross to bear salvation don't come free  
A heart that beats is a heart that bleeds  
And you know that's true  
So don't deny yourself of something good for you  
Before you do it for yourself, do it for someone else  
That makes it real  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause when you love someone  
It don't matter what you say  
When you love someone  
You will dance the night away  
When you love someone  
There ain't nothing you can't do  
Ain't that right  
Yeah I want to love someone tonight  
  
Will you believe in love or just sit around and judge?  
Can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge?  
'Cause above selfishness there lies a bright blue sky  
And wealth and happiness can be a long and lonesome ride  
Yes it's hard to steer yourself  
Without that someone else to take the wheel  
Take the wheel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you believe in the art of growing old  
Do you believe that rock n roll can save your soul  
Do you believe in everything you do  
'Cause when you do that's when it all comes back to you  
Before you think about yourself  
Think of someone else  
Do it for yourself  
And do it for someone else  
  
When you love someone -

I grew up a herding cattle, I got more rhymes than Harold one in Seattle. You  
Want to battle with the Rock quick front, I'll spit on your ass and tell you  
That you ain't nothin'. Grab your honey and your beer and I'll break south,  
Take all of your money and tell you get the hell out. I'll put your head out  
This is my night how you gonna snap with Rock when I got the mic?  
  
I shot the sheriff and the deputy too, paid off the feds, now it's all ?bout  
My crew, whatcha hoes want to do? One at a time or all at once I'll still roll  
Through your whole crew. Like a southbound trucker, hauls motherfuckers,  
Motherfuckers takes the law,and when you step with your anger, I'm like the  
Robot from Lost In Space: "Danger"  
  
I'll give you a warning but if you don't take it I'll put my arm around your  
Neck like we're cool then I'll break it. It's all real cop a feel here's the  
Deal when I say clap your hands like a seal. Or better yet give respect where  
It's earned, you'll eat me up and I'm like a hot pepper and you might get  
Burned, you took a turn for the worse, walked up in my face, rolled away in a  
Hearse. Now how you gonna front all night?, Kid Rock's in the house that's  
Where I'm at...  
  
Where you at Rock? Where you At? Over here, to the rear with your girl and the

Where you At Rock? Where you At? 1,2 and you don't stop, 3,4 and you don't
quit,  
1,2 and you don't stop  
  
From the depths of hell to God's right hand side I'm what's left of the  
Getting paid self-made pride. I step in stride, I'm raw as cowhide, my first  
LP is still selling that ain't no jive, am I the chosen one? Some people  
Ain't getting where I'm comin' from, or where I'm going to stand back, Kid  
Rock's in the house that's where I'm at?

And I be the long-haired wizard with the lazy-eye, as all the ladies will  
Tell you that I'm crazy fly, I'll step to the mic like a solider bro, I hate  
To sound like a dick but I told you so, ho, old crow and a soul full of  
Desperation, I'm rockin' on the mic with no consideration for your church or  
Your family, [unknown] couldn't stand me, so she banned me. I'm like a dandy-
lion  
  
Jack, you can cut me down and then I'll pop right back, like a tack from the  
Back like a great white, I'm not down with the scappin' but I'm down for the  
Gunfight, behind my back talking shit, but when I front your ass you want to  
Act like a little bitch, keep on and get your ass smacked, Kid Rock's in the  
House that's where I'm at?  
  
Where you At Rock? Where you At? Over here, to the rear with your girl and the  
40s of beer

Over there with the bad attitude 'Cause I just don't care  
  
Where you At Rock? Where you At?

Shit god damn motherfucker I'm back  
My name ain't Jack Tripper, but I'm a day tripper  
So watch me whip another funky rhyme  
Black hoes sayin' that honky's fine  
  
Gettin' mine, just like I'm supposed to  
And if you fuck with the Rock, I'll roast you  
A little toast to the real MC's  
Ain't no love for the wannabe's  
  
So, hey ho don't call me Joe  
'Cause the Joe's I know, can't even flow  
I can battle rap, and all that other crap  
So if ya don't want none, better step to the back

Basement party's in the Clem fool  
Talkin' that trash, I wish you would  
Come step to Rock, it's all good

Kind bud, be the bud's I'm tokin'  
Hittin' you straight with the fresh shit  
Mid western funk, and I'm the best bitch  
  
The K to the I to the chrome D's  
In the Grand Marquees sippin' O-E  
Pimpin' Rock, it's my name, my game  
Servin' you hoe's like it ain't no thang  
  
I'm a kid when I rap, rock when I'm singin'  
I don't care who comes, but what the fuck you bringin'  
Shit, one time, one rhyme  
'Cause I'm, that motherfuckin' ill one, with a steel dick  
  
Hittin' you hoe's with the real shit  
Ya keep on  
Rock the house  
Rock...rock the house  
  
Ya keep on  
Ya keep  
Rock...rock the house  
Rock...rock the house  
  
Ya Keep On  
Rock...rock the house  
Rock...rock the house  
  
Now if you don't know hoe, I'm the man in the dark  
I got more riffs than Stanley Clark  
Or George Duke, shoot, I'm the kid with the funky loot  
So if ya want some, get some  
  
If ya need some, here's some  
If ya don't, just step to the rear son  
'Cause I'm commin with the quickness  
If you dis this bitch, you'll wind up on my hit list  
  
I'll put a bounty on your head  
McCough County bitch, ain't a good place to wind up dead  
'Cause i'm a real relavent, elevent, type menace  
But it ain't Rocky Dennis  
  
Watch me bend this rhyme in half  
I'm like Moses, with the mic is my staff  
Layin' down them 10 commandments  
Thou shall not dis the Rock god dammit  
  
Rock the house  
Rock...rock the house  
Ya keep on  
Ya keep on  
  
Rock the house  
Rock...rock the house  
Ya keep on  
  
Rock...rock the house  
Rock...rock the house
