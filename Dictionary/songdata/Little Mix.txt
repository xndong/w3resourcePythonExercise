Just something about the boy  
  
It's the verse in my head  
The words that make me stutter  
The swag in my step  
The change from gray to color  
A guaranteed bet  
Oh, I found my lucky number  
The feeling that you get  
Can't help but make me wonder  
  
No need to try  
He's just right  
He's got that something  
I can't let nobody tell me no  
No I don't mind  
Takes me high  
I won't stop until the boy is mine  
  
He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool  
Taking me down I can't stop  
He got me up  
I can't come down  
He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice  
There's just something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
There's just something about the boy  
  
It's the first time we met  
The lightening to my thunder  
The green light on red  
The kiss that pulls me under  
It's only for me  
If you're the test I got the answer  
And I'm all that you need  
Now you finally get the chance to  
  
No need to try  
He's just right  
He's got that something  
I can't let nobody tell me no  
No I don't mind  
Takes me high

He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool

He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice

Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
Something about  
Something about the boy  
There's just something about the boy  
  
I know you like to play it slow  
But I'm running out of time  
It's like I lost my self control  
'Cause you are the one  
And you know what you've done  
My poor heart's come undone  
Baby please  
  
He got me good  
I've got it bad  
He got me feeling like a girl gone mad  
Got me running around like I'm a lovefool  
Taking me down I can't stop  
He got me up  
I can't come down  
He got me locked and I don't want out  
I know he's playing my heart and I ain't got no choice

We are, friends for life.  
Hold that, deep inside  
Let this, be a drive  
To survive  
  
And just stand, high and tall  
Make sure you give your all  
And if you ever fall  
Know that I'm right here  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always  
  
I am here, find me, in the sky  
Destine with the moon at night  
Your heartbeat is disguised as my, lullaby  
Be happy, and know that I'm  
Watching you travel far and wide  
Waiting for us to meet again  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always  
  
I am here, If you need me, yeah  
I'm in the wind , look for me friend  
I'm in the stars, when you need me  
The heavens will send a message within  
Straight to your heart, ooh  
  
We'll always be together, don't you worry, don't you worry  
I'll always be by your side, don't you worry  
The circle will never end, just know that we'll meet again  
And we'll always be together, forever, always.  
I am here, I am here, I am here

[Jade:]  
Magic

There's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth  
There's still a little bit of you laced with my doubt  
It's still a little hard to say what's going on  
  
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness  
There's still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed  
You step a little closer each day  
That I can't say what's going on  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
Life taught me to die  
So it's not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball  
  
There's still a little bit of your song in my ear  
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear  
You step a little closer to me  
So close, I can't see what's going on  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
When you know that you just dont know  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to cry  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
And I don't wanna scare him  
  
Its not hard to fall  
And I don't want to lose  
Its not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball.

Hits when I'm asleep right through  
I'm cold when I wake cause I won't feel you  
When I can't breathe I know it's you  
Got a lump in my throat just thinking of you  
  
Makes no difference you've been tried  
(Makes no difference you've been tried)  
Still sick inside, oh oh  
It's meant to be over now  
But I think we're going down (we're going down)  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And I'm still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
Case closed  
  
Behind these walls, so tall  
I don't wanna climb, I'm afraid to fall  
So we both do time and never have closure cause I still wanna hold ya  
  
Makes no difference you've been tried  
(Makes no difference you've been tried)  
Still sick inside, oh oh  
It's meant to be over now  
But I think we're going down (we're going down)  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And I'm still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
  
They can never, never be a  
Never be a  
Never, never be a  
Case closed  
  
They can never, never be a  
Never, be a  
Never, never be a  
Case closed  
  
Got your fingerprints as evidence all on my body  
Put your right hand on the book and you were found guilty  
I can't wait forever but that's how it's gonna be  
For me they'll never be  
  
Case closed  
No matter what the verdict say  
Case closed  
Too many questions in my head  
Case closed  
And I'm still waiting for a while  
Why there can never be  
  
Case closed

Yeah, you're such a gentleman  
You always open doors for me  
But you see us kind of different  
It's like, you always have to be  
The first one to open his mouth  
The last one to throw in the towel  
It's time to show your self-out  
Boy you're trying  
  
Just a little bit too hard  
I thought I told you when we met  
That all I get for who you are  
But I treat you like an argument  
I don't need to speak in my mind  
I'm too grown, I'm taking my time  
I'm sick of hearing you rhyme  
Listen, baby  
  
You don't have to come first  
Second is okay 'cause you ain't never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind  
  
Tell me does this scare you  
That I'm living my dream?  
Now I don't mean to hurt you  
But you make me wanna scream  
You smile while grinding your teeth  
You clap and stomping your feet  
You act about 17  
I'm so tired  
  
You don't have to come first  
Second is okay 'cause you ain't never beated me  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
What are you trying to prove?  
What is it with you?  
Always thinking  
  
I can do it better  
You know I can do it better  
  
Baby, I can't stand  
Always argument  
Why you wanna fight?  
Why you always fight?  
  
You ain't always right  
I can do it better every day and every night  
I can do it better every day and every night  
  
I say it once  
You say it twice  
You know I like a little competition from time to time  
You think I'm wrong when I know I'm right  
You lose this ain't no kind of competition  
I like a man with ambition  
For when you gonna know it's time to let go  
'Cause I think I'm about to lose my mind

Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it?  
Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck?  
No scientist or biology  
It's obvious when he's holding me  
It's only natural that I'm so affected  
  
And my heart won't beat again  
If I can't feel him in my veins  
No need to question, I already know  
  
It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA  
It's in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-b-breath away  
I feel it every day  
And that's what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
It's in his D-D-D-DNA  
  
It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future  
Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah, hey, yeah  
Now I don't have any first degree  
But I know, what he does to me  
No need to work it out, it's so familiar, oh, oh, oh  
  
And my heart won't beat again  
If I can't feel him in my veins  
No need to question, I already know  
  
It's in his DNA D-D-D-DNA  
It's in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-b-breath away  
I feel it every day  
And that's what makes a man  
Not hard to understand  
Perfect in every way  
I see it in his face  
Nothing more to say  
It's in his D-D-D-DNA  
  
It's all about his kiss  
Contaminates my lips  
Our energy connects  
It's simple genetics  
I'm the X to his Y  
It's the color of his eyes  
He can do no wrong  
No, he don't need to try  
Made from the best  
He passes all the tests  
Got my heart beating fast  
It's cardiac arrest  
He's from a different strain  
That science can't explain  
I guess that's how he's made  
In his D-D-D-DNA  
  
It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA  
It's in his DNA  
And he just takes my breath away  
B-b-b-breath away  
I feel it every day  
And that's what makes a man (what makes a man)  
Not hard to understand (to understand)  
Perfect in every way (in every way)  
I see it in his face (in his face)  
Nothing more to say (nothing more to say)  
It's in his D-D-D-DNA

Can't breathe, can't sleep, crazy, what you do to me  
Head is smokin', feeling my heart is open  
So hazy, but it's alright, you take me, to the dark side  
Dangerous, but I'm fearless  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
Feelin' so hot, I'm taking your clothes off  
Glasses steamed up, I'm dreaming that no one can see us  
  
Lying underneath the stars, Jupiter hits on mars  
And it hits me so hard  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
Trippin' on the floor  
Freaky love for sure  
Still I need you more  
You knock me down with those eyes  
And do it every time  
Can't shake you out of my mind  
  
Just a little bit love drunk heading the crowd  
And that will never be a hater that can bring us down  
I've been slurring my words and I don't know what to say  
But it's a feeling that I believe in, never felt this way  
  
And I swear I don't even like anything  
They call me love drunk cuz I'm far from tipsy  
They call me love drunk, what are you doing to me?  
They call me love drunk cuz I'm far from tipsy  
  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
And I just can't shake you outta my head  
Maybe maybe maybe, maybe maybe maybe  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
Ever get the feeling where you're miles away  
Everybodys looking at me walking, stumbling  
Hardly talking, mumbling, going red in the face  
Promise I've been drinkin' only lemonade, it's all I take  
My hearts just on one about someone  
And I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
  
I'm a little bit love drunk  
My eyes are blue but I'm seeing red  
I'm a little bit love drunk

[Verse 1: Jesy]  
You used to tell me that you loved me once  
What happened, what happened?  
Where is all of this coming from?  
What happened, what happened?  
You say I'm crazy and there's nothing wrong  
You're lying and you know I know  
Baby what have we become?  
What happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But it's all we ever do lately  
And you're turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh  
  
[Chorus: Perrie]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
  
[Verse 2: Jade]  
Do you remember when you loved me once?  
What happened, what happened?  
And you'd hold me here just because  
What happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jade]  
We used to never go to bed angry  
But it's all we ever do lately  
And you're turning away like you hate me  
Do you hate me, do you hate me? Oh  
  
[Chorus: Perrie]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
  
[Bridge: Jade]  
Love me baby please cause I could still be the only one you need  
The only one close enough to feel you breathe  
Yeah I could still be that place where you run  
Instead of the one that you're running from, ooh  
  
[Chorus: Leigh-Anne]  
You can take this heart  
Heal it or break it all apart  
No, this isn't fair  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here  
Love me or leave me here

I feel a strange sensation taking over from my head to my toes  
I got the shakes body rippling it's enough to shatter my bones  
  
Is it all a dream? 'Cause I don't wanna stay awake  
But I won't remember a thing  
And now it's running through my veins  
I don't know what's happening, the beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
They're coming for me  
  
Everywhere I look I'm shook I got bloodshot eyes  
I'm like a fugitive tryna climb the walls but my hands are tied  
In just one touch and I'm infected by the sound crawling all over my skin  
And the sky is falling down, I don't know what's happening, beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
They're coming for me  
  
They're coming for me, oh oh  
  
Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close  
Saying my prayers, don't take me back there  
Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close  
Saying my prayers don't take me back,  
Take me back, take me back there  
  
They're coming for me  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
It's like I'm running but I just can't find my way  
(I don't wanna go back)  
And they can't hear my voice no matter how I scream  
They're coming for me

Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Down on your knees  
She made you feel like you're worthless  
You just don't deserve this, no no  
How does it feel?  
To think that you gave all you could  
Wish you did but you would  
  
I'll be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
You're save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Where do you run?  
Who do you turn to, and burn to  
cause you though that she was the one  
She threw it away  
Let's do it nothing with pain  
You won't feel love again  
  
I'll be the ears you talk to  
The doors you walk through  
The arms to hold on to  
You're save with me  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
I'll give you the strength that you need to forget  
I'll be the last thing that you would regret  
Make you believe in love again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Your hearts been stolen  
Eyes weren't open  
Trust is broken  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Make you stronger  
So we'll live longer  
You've lost your faith in love  
But I'll make you believe again  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I'll make you believe  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I'll make you believe again  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
I'll make you believe again

We're lining up in supermarkets for cancer  
Practically begging to die a long, unnatural death.  
Would you like some food with your chemicals?  
It's being processed with a lot of question marks and uncertainty.  
  
Buying organic is becoming a fraud to maximize profits.  
It's the same old shit just with a fancy sticker.  
Corporations set the standards and capitalize.  
They don't need animal testing--we're the guinea pigs.  
They're shoving shit down our throats that dogs won't eat,  
Then feigning shock that disease is on the rise.  
  
The fda should step in, but they're in bed  
With the very corporations they're supposed to regulate.  
Conflict of interest? No.  
They're not interested in us because money is money  
And we're all gonna die anyway.!

(JESY)  
I could have all the money,  
All the fancy treasures in the world  
Twenty-five acres just to hold my diamonds and my pearls  
  
(JADE)  
But all of that's a fantasy  
Nothing like I wanna be  
Baby you and me, that's real, yeah  
Something like a masterpiece  
We'd be up in galleries  
You and I, that's real  
  
(ALL)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
Boys will be boys, I got plenty knocking at my door  
But none of them compare baby you're the one I'm waiting for  
  
(PERRIE)  
'Cause I'm living in a fantasy  
Everytime you're here with me  
Kiss me if it's real  
Baby you and me for keeps  
You bring out the best in me  
Now you know that's real  
  
(ALL)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
No matter what they say, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
No, nothing like ya  
No, nothing like  
No, nothing like ya  
No, nothing like  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
If I had everything it wouldn't mean a thing  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
(PERRIE)  
No matter what they, can't take my love away  
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you!  
  
(ALL)  
Baby even when we're miles apart  
You'll always stay inside my heart  
Let me tell you no one else will do  
'Cause baby nothing feels like you  
  
And when you're gone, we could be miles apart  
I'll feel the way I did from the start  
I told you nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
Baby when everything's said and done  
I hope you know that you're the only one  
I told you nothing feels like, nothing feels like you  
  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like you  
No nothing like

What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
I remember the day when we were out all night  
I wish that I can get the day back and tell you it's alright  
Cause we all do the same thing, we just don't realize  
That we're living on borrowed time  
  
What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
I see the light that I'm chasing  
A memory, but it's fading  
When it's gone I'll be waiting  
Knowing it's too late (knowing it's too late)  
You chose the road that I'm walking  
Now it's your soul that I'm caught in  
And you're not hearing when I'm calling  
Calling your name  
  
One breath, one step, one life, one heart  
Two words, two eyes, new beginning, new start  
Too neat, too narrow, too short, too bright,  
I'm there with you, here by my side  
  
What would you do? What would you say?  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
Nothing here, no one talking, knowing it's too late  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK  
Nothing here, no one talking, nothing's gonna change  
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK  
  
What would you do? (what would you do?)  
What would you say? (what would you say?)  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
What would you do? (what would you do?)  
What would you say? (what would you say?)  
How does it feel? Pretend it's OK  
My eyes deceive me, but it's still the same  
Pretend it's OK  
  
Oh yeah  
What would you do? What would you say?  
Pretending it's OK  
What would you do? What would you say?

When you hold me in the street  
And you kiss me on the dance floor  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't it be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours  
  
We keep behind closed doors  
Every time I see you, I die a little more  
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls  
It'll never be enough  
  
It's obvious you're meant for me  
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly  
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep  
But I'll never show it on my face  
  
But we know this.  
We got a love that is homeless  
  
Why can't you hold me in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours  
  
[Jason Derulo:]  
When you're with him, do you call his name  
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?  
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down  
Or would you play it safe and stay?  
  
Girl, you know this.  
We got a love that is hopeless  
  
Why can't you hold me in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours  
  
And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby  
I don't wanna hide us away  
Tell the world about the love we're making  
I'm living for that day  
Someday  
  
Why can't I hold you in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that we could be like that  
Why can't we be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours  
  
Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't it be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours  
  
Why can't I say that I'm in love?  
I wanna shout it from the rooftop  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that?  
'Cause I'm yours  
  
Why can't we be like that?  
Wish we could be like that

[Verse 1: Jade]  
We keep behind closed doors  
Every time I see you, I die a little more  
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls  
It'll never be enough  
  
[Jesy] As you drive me to my house  
I can't stop these silent tears from rolling down  
You and I both have to hide on the outside  
Where I can't be yours and you can't be mine  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jade]  
But I know this, we got a love that is homeless  
  
[Chorus: Perrie]  
Why can't I hold you in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours  
Why can't I say that I'm in love?  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours  
  
[Verse 2: Jesy]  
It's obvious you're meant for me  
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly  
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep  
But I'll never show it on my face  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]  
But we know this, we got a love that is homeless  
  
[Jade] Why can't you hold me in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours  
[Perrie] Why can't I say that I'm in love?  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours  
  
[Leigh-Anne] I don't wanna live love this way  
I don't wanna hide us away  
I wonder if it ever will change  
I'm living for that day, someday  
  
[Jesy] When you hold me in the street  
And you kiss me on the dance floor  
I wish that we could be like that  
Why can't we we be like that? Cause I'm yours, I'm yours  
  
[Leigh Anne] Why can't you hold me in the street?  
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours  
  
[Perrie] Why can't I say that I'm in love?  
I wanna shout it from the rooftops  
I wish that it could be like that  
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours  
  
[Outro: Jade]  
Why can't we be like that?  
Wish we could be like that

Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
(JESY)  
I feel the rain on my skin  
Wash away all the pain I was in  
I see the sun in the sky  
No longer know how it feels to cry  
  
(JADE)  
And it really doesn't matter, so what, so what?  
That I've been hesitating so long, so long  
Somebody turn up the lights  
'Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
(ALL)  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
Drop me in the ocean, I'll swim  
Throw me in with the lions, I'll roar  
There's a survivor within  
So much stronger than I was before  
  
(PERRIE)  
They never saw me coming, so what, so what?  
'Cause they've been sleeping on me so long, so long  
I gotta leave that behind  
'Cause right now must be my time to shine  
  
(ALL)  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now  
  
Now...  
  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
  
They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't  
But if they could see me now  
They'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing  
And the world will hear me shout  
We say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh  
Might call me crazy but I've been thinking, maybe  
You would change your mind if you could see me now

Let me start it by telling you something  
I think there's one thing you should know  
We ain't playin' no games, this ain't no playground  
It's time to drop your sticks and stones  
  
'Cause I've been chasing dreams since I took my first leap  
And I'm gon' be lil' Bo so contemplate if you're the sheep  
And we gon' make a humble pie so egos cut a slice and take a piece, hey  
  
So, you see, there's no point in underestimating me, to me  
Lock up all your thoughts and throw away the key  
No, I don't want to hear it 'cause you're, no, it doesn't bother me

And I'm gonna let it wash all over me

Run the beat and blow my speakers  
And make me feel like I'm the only girl (yeah)  
The way we move is so in time  
I'm the rare, got the skills to blow my mind  
They don't make 'em like you no more (ye-yeah)  
  
I'm in heaven now, so in love  
Lay your weapons down, and turn it up  
Up, up, up, up (wooh)  
  
And be my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left  
  
Can you save me?  
Can you set me free?  
'Cause I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
'Cause you changed me  
And now I believe  
And I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
Stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control (let me lose control)  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left

I feel so numb  
Staring at the shower wall  
It's begun,  
The feeling that the end has come  
And now the water's cold  
  
I tried to eat today  
But the lump in my throat got in the way  
  
In this time I've lost all sense of pride  
I've called a hundred times  
If I hear your voice I'll be fine  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep  
These four walls and me  
  
I lay in bed  
Can't seem to leave your side  
Your pillow's wet  
From all these tears I've cried  
I won't say goodbye  
  
I tried to smile today  
Then I realized there's no point anyway  
  
In this time I've lost all sense of pride  
I've called a thousand times  
If I hear your voice I'll be fine  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep  
These four walls and me  
  
Oh oh oh  
  
And I, I can't come alive  
I want the room to take me under  
'Cause I can't help but wonder  
What if I had one more night for goodbye?  
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep  
These four walls and me

(JADE)  
Daddy doesn't think  
That you'll be good enough for me  
Mama says be careful  
'Cause he'll break your heart in three  
They don't walk in my shoes,  
They ain't been kissed by you  
  
(LEIGH-ANNE)  
My sister says  
She doesn't like the way you wear your hair  
But I know that she's jealous  
So why would I even care?  
I have to lie about how good you make me feel  
  
(PERRIE)  
So tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
(ALL)  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do  
  
(JESY)  
Talk is cheap and rumours spread  
But they go with the wind  
It's not about she said he said  
'Cause I know where it ends  
I know the real truth  
And the real truth is you  
  
(JADE)  
It's funny 'cause at times  
It feels like us against the world  
They treat you like a criminal  
But I'll still be your girl  
I'd rather die with you  
Walk the line if you asked me to  
  
(PERRIE)  
So tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
(ALL)  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do  
  
(JESY)  
L-L-Like I do, they just don't know you  
  
(ALL)  
You don't know about our love  
You choose what you see  
But if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
They don't know about the times  
When it's just him and me  
'Cause if you felt the way we love  
You'd just let it be  
  
Tell me, tell me you won't break my heart  
You won't tear my world apart  
That you'll be there when I need  
'Cause I wanna tell them  
  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you,  
They just don't know you, they don't know you like I do  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you, they don't know  
They just don't know you like I do

In my memory, all the small things, like daggers in my mind  
In my memory, while my head bleeds, the words I'll never find  
That I always meant to say to you I can't  
  
Cause you turned your face, and now I can't feel you anymore  
Turn your face, so now I can't see you anymore  
Walk away until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face, hmm oh  
  
In my memory, I was hurting, long before we met, oh  
In my memory, there's still burning, fingerprints you left  
And I'll always meant to say to you I can't  
  
So just turn your face, until I can't see you anymore  
Turn your face, until I can't see you anymore  
Walk away until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away and stay  
  
Turn your face  
  
Each time I take you back  
You bring one thousand cracks  
And I accept them, like a fool oh  
  
So now what's your excuse  
What do we have to lose  
Since I'm already losing you  
  
So hard to face, that I can't feel you anymore  
Hard to face, that I can't see you anymore  
So walk away, until you're not standing at my door  
Turn your face, walk away, and stay  
  
Turn your face  
Turn your face, and stay  
Turn your face

Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
My face, my eyes, someone turn me up, I'm speaking my mind  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
Momma, momma, momma made me the way I am  
She told me I should look up on the world with my head held high  
And I, and I, I've been wasting a lot of time looking in mirrors  
And hating on me, but now I like what I see  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on  
The new you on  
  
We are who we are, who we are, pretty's just a petty word  
And I'm gonna shine like a star, cause I'm the only me in this world  
Throw away the books and the magazines, I'm never gonna look like a beauty
queen  
We are who we are, who we are, and I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
I know, I know, I never be perfect  
I know, I know, but I'm gonna work it  
Let go, let go, put your new shoes on

And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me  
And I'm just doing me, just doing me

Mama told me not to waste my life  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And if they give you shhhh  
Then they can walk on by  
  
My feet, feet can't touch the ground  
And I can't hear a sound  
But you just keep on running up your mouth yeah  
  
Walk, walk on over there  
'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh yeah  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
Keep talking, all I know is  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life,  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And they can't detain you  
'Cause wings are made to fly  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly  
  
Huh huh  
I'm firing up on that runway  
I know we're gonna get there someday  
But we don't need no ready steady go, no  
Talk, talk turns into air  
And I'm to fly to care, oh yeah  
  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
Keep talking, all I know is  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life,  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night,  
And they can't detain you  
'Cause wings are made to fly  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly  
  
I don't need no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey  
I don't hear no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
You better keep on walking  
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy  
You better keep on walking  
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy  
  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
They're just like water off my wings  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And they can't detain you  
'Cause wings are made to fly  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly  
  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly

Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star, to follow where you are  
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means  
I'm wishing on the rainbows, that I've seen  
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream  
I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
I'm wishing on all of the things, we've never done  
  
I never thought I'd see, the time where you would be  
So far away from home, so far away from me  
Just think of all the moments, that we spent  
I just can't let you go, for me, you were meant  
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know  
In the game of love you reap what you sow  
  
I feel it's time we should make up, baby  
I feel it's time for us to get back together  
And make the best of things oh baby when we're together  
Whether or never  
  
Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star, wishing on a star  
To follow where you are, a-a-a-are  
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means  
And I wish upon the rainbows that I've seen  
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream  
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
I'm wishing on all the things that we, we never to-o-o-old!  
(Woo! Jls, 1D)  
  
Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star (Oh wishing on a star)  
To follow where you are (Oh anywhere you go)  
I'm wishing on a star (I'm wishing on a star)  
To follow where you are (To where you, where you go)  
I'm wishing on a star.
