Riding a hurricane, tied to a ball and chain  
Too much of a good good thing, it kind of stops you in your tracks  
How did you ever get this far, now honey don't look back  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Heh, inside of you, yeah  
  
Ride on a carpet ride, high on the tears you cried  
One's just too many but a thousands not enough  
And you can't make up your mind playing blind mans bluff  
And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you  
Yeah, inside of you  
  
It ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, I got to have it now ain't it tough  
It ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough  
Oh shit  
  
You know another touch is easy, try and reach the sky  
And though you can't get much more higher than you ever tried  
When you die you're not forsaken  
Best be taking tries of all the things that you're not taking  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it ain't it tough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough  
Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough  
I got to have it  
  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it  
Ain't enough, I really got to have it

I kept the right ones out  
And let the wrong ones in  
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins  
There were times in my life  
When I was goin' insane  
Tryin' to walk through  
The pain  
  
When I lost my grip  
And I hit the floor  
Yeah, I thought I could leave, but couldn't get out the door  
I was so sick and tired  
Of livin' a lie  
I was wishin' that I  
Would die  
  
It's amazing  
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light  
It's amazing  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
It's amazing  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight  
  
That one last shot's permanent vacation  
And how high can you fly with broken wings?  
Life's a journey, not a destination  
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings  
  
You have to learn to crawl  
Before you learn to walk  
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah  
I was out on the street,  
Just a tryin' to survive  
Scratchin' to stay alive  
  
It's amazing  
With the blink of an eye, you finally see the light  
It's amazing  
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright  
Oh, it's amazing  
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight.  
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts  
  
Never said I'll do it, never  
Never gonna go, never  
  
(So, from all of us at Aerosmith, to all of you out there, wherever you are...  
Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel, may be you! Good night!)

I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night  
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you  
I want your love  
Let's break the walls between us  
Don't make it tough  
I'll put away my pride  
Enough's enough  
I've suffered and I've seen the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Bayayby, you're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and make it alright  
  
Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside  
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride  
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar  
Without your love a dog without a bone  
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come and save me tonight  
You're the reason I live  
You're the reason I die  
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry  
Don't need no reason why  
Baby, baby, bayayby  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Yeah, come and make it alright  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and take me alright  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight

Don't wanna close my eyes  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't wanna miss a thing  
Know what I was thinkin'  
(What?)  
I, I really don't think that the animal cracker  
Qualifies as a cracker  
(Why?)  
Well, 'cause it's sweet which is an in suggest cookie  
And when you put a cheese on something  
It's sorta the finer characteristic  
Of what makes a cracker  
Why I thought of that, I just  
(Baby, you have such sweet fill-up talk)  
Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing  
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains  
Now look, as the cheetah approaches  
Watch as he stalks his prey  
Now the gazelle is a little spooked  
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south  
The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question  
North or south way down tune in next week  
(Baby, do you think it's possible)  
That anyone else in this world  
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?  
I hope so  
Otherwise what the hell are we trying to save?  
Don't wanna close my eyes  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Hey  
Give my heart a break  
You say it's you that loves me more  
And then you kick and slam your door.  
Hey  
While you're on your way  
I want to thank you for the ride  
And pull the thorn out of my side  
  
And call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
It's all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes  
Yeah, what's it take to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
  
You crash and burn  
With the pages turned  
In your black book full of names  
And then you throw your frozen heart  
Out in somebody else's flames  
And it's a low down dirty, dirty shame.  
Don't let this love slip through the tracks  
I miss your claw marks on my back  
  
And call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Yeah, it's all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes  
Yeah, what's it take to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
I believe I've always been in love with you  
Though we got caught up in the sway  
Never know in where we left  
Been off the hook and out of hand  
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime  
'Cause I remember, yeah, the very first time  
  
You call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Yeah, it's all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes  
Yeah, what it takes to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye

I had a friend who spoke of fate  
And he knew of another place in space and time  
He told of how me and my lady  
Could look but we would never find  
Said if you please I beg your pardon  
Sometimes the things you see they just ain't so  
Your life can be an avant garden  
Cause love's what makes your garden grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
Sometimes my life ain't what it's seemin'  
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin'  
Could all this just be lucid dreamin'  
But dreams just ain't enough for me  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
We won't be denied  
Here inside our avant garden  
You know it just ain't right  
To deal with other's shite  
No one should ever be so broken hearted  
Don't never be afraid  
Cause when you got it made  
Yeah you don't even have to try  
So I'll be waiting in your garden  
Ffff...watching all your flowers grow  
The sun leads the way  
The moon lights the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
I dream of the day when our world's collide  
You'll know we've arrived  
Here inside our avant garden...yeah yeah  
The sun brings the rain  
The moon needs the sky  
I see you and I  
Lying in my avant garden  
Beware of the lies  
A word to the wise  
There's sweet cherry pies  
And truth inside our avant garden...ooh ah yea  
Do it do it  
Do it do it...  
You can spend your whole lifetime  
Under my skin  
You can be never more mine  
Under my skin

I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
Ridin' into town alone by the light of the moon  
I'm lookin' for old Sukie Jones, she crazy horse saloon  
Barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye  
She turned to give me a wink, that'd make a grown man cry  
  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
  
Come easy, go easy, all right until the rising sun  
I'm calling all the shots tonight, I'm like a loaded gun  
Peelin' off my boots and chaps, I'm saddle sore  
Four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more  
Fools' gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet  
No tongue's drier than mine, I'll come when I get back!  
  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
  
I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol  
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful  
I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle  
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle  
  
Yodalayhe yodalayhe yodayahehoo.  
  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
I'm back in the saddle again  
I'm back!  
  
Ridin' high!  
Ridin' high!  
Ridin' high!

It cannot be seen  
But there's blood on the green  
Only god knows I'm innocent  
Take me, take me home  
A dark seed reigns in me  
Like the storm rules over the sea  
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone  
  
Don't dare me now  
The threatening shadows will pass by  
There're getting closer now  
Open your eyes  
Wake up my dear young friend  
And hate shall fade away  
  
I will not move, yet  
I'll stand still, instead  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
The field's been left in sorrow  
The father and the son  
They're gone  
  
The sun shines bright  
And anger rises  
Lorn and lonely  
Torn apart  
Don't you think  
It's time to stop now  
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss  
  
Let's pray  
That heaven is on our side  
Through violence and horror  
Shall honour arise  
  
So let's pray  
And blessed shall be our leader  
We follow the noble and bright  
  
Don't you hear me crying  
Crying  
Come take me away  
I hallow thy name  
  
There on the battlefield he stands  
Down on the battlefield he's lost  
And on the battlefield it ends  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore  
  
That's what minstrel sing  
Join in the horrible screams  
Take part in murderous deeds  
Renowned be the lion-hearted  
Join in the minstrelsy  
Wailing in endless grief  
It eagerly longs for more  
Broken bodies lay down on the ground  
  
Blood sheds all over the place  
The green will be stained forever  
And hate reigns all over the field  
They keep struggling on in anger  
  
Fiercely intense  
Outrageous, too blind to see  
And in pain they keep on singing  
We claim the land for the highlord  
God bless the land and our highlord  
  
War and anger shall reign  
The clash of iron can be heard  
By blindness you're driven insane  
I'm lost in anguish and grief  
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die  
A shattered body deeply hurt  
And darkness will cover the light  
It's gone forevermore

Uh uh  
I friend of mine was talking  
I was earjacking, eavesdropping  
Down on my knees  
So I could hear what she was saying  
As I got closer to her fire, her desire  
Was to lead me on and on and on  
It was like  
  
Beautiful  
(We are free again, we're out of here)  
Beautiful  
(You need a friend, let's disappear)  
  
Now I get to thinkin' 'bout the high speed dirty deeds  
What I want, what you need  
I think you best believe it  
Got it, want you here,  
But you still gotta know  
We can skin it, we conceal it  
And so baby let's begin it  
Sayin'  
  
Beautiful  
(We are free again, we're out of here)  
Beautiful  
(You need a friend, let's disappear)

When I whip out my big ten inch  
  
Record of a band that plays the blues  
Well a band that plays its blues  
She just love my big ten inch  
Record of her favorite blues  
  
Last night I tried to tease her  
I gave my love a little pinch  
She said now stop that jivin'

Record of a band that plays those blues  
Well a band that plays the blues

Record of a band that plays the blues  
Band that play the blues  
She just love my big ten inch  
Record of her favorite blues

It be night time when shadows fade  
She was dressed like a chamber maid  
All decked out in silk and I took her  
Like a cat takes to milk  
Come here little Queenie or...  
Has the cat got your tongue?  
Can't let nobody see me  
Come on girl while we're still young  
'Cause there's never been no lover's knot  
Can tie you down 'cause you're so hot  
Don't pinch me ass I may be dreamin'  
Hope tonight that I'll be screamin'  
  
Black cherry, black cherry, black cherry  
I like it, I like it, I like it  
  
She looked sheik in a funky way  
Tongue in cheek baby all the way  
Home girls they got pride, she said  
'One time around' I said 'Let's go for a ride'  
Come here little Queenie... Or ah  
Has the cat got your tongue?  
My best shot for a C note baby she said  
That's why this Janie's got a gun  
Because there's nothin' like a good time girl  
To take you twice around the world  
I'm so in lust I think I'm trippin'  
So in love I think I'm slippin'  
  
Down to the river, down to the river of love  
Where the love runs deep it's so sad it's a love you can't keep  
  
Down to the river, down to the river  
Abover 42nd Street it's so sad  
That the bad don't come cheap  
  
Because there's nothing like a good time girl  
To take you twice around the world  
Right to the land of milk and honey  
Leave your troubles, bring your money  
  
Black cherry, black cherry, black cherry  
I like it, I like it, I like it

Pack up your troubles in your old gym bag  
You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin  
I'll take short breaks, love her to the outbreaks  
  
Standing on the seashore, lookin' at the city  
See the street light, dog bite, go lady on the TD8  
The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves  
There's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby  
  
Can't break, cabbage head  
Try and get a salad made  
Hold my pickle, hold the lettuce  
Session waters don't upset us  
  
Kick, stand, face look so evil, like Knieval  
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner  
Like a squawk eight fool in I don't know orogotus  
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello  
  
Facial, connish lie  
Smoke a bowl of feeling fine  
Burn and people, try to let us  
Session waters won't upset us  
  
Hee lee cans (Kick in the pants)  
Water fall (got on a dance)  
Blame it all (Say gotta eve us a trance)  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it  
Ain't gonna do it...

Flatbush boy cruisin' sheepshead bay  
His boardwalk mama just a sniff away  
Underground dmt, ridin' thunder train  
The cone island white fish boy is on the run again  
  
Oh, runnin' with the pack  
Oh, never lookin' back  
Oh, know just where he's been  
That coney island white fish boy's  
Been there and back again  
  
Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen  
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams  
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel  
Streaked with clorox bleach  
Coney gettin' down and dirty  
Snortin' up the beach  
  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Go get 'em coney

Get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down  
Get back in town  
Get back, get down

She'd be screamin' (coney)  
Best believe it (coney)

It's the dawn of the day and I'm crashed and I'm smashed  
As it is I'm feelin' like my chips are cashed  
All of my clothes strewn all over the room  
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got the sunlight blues  
I can't find my shoes  
The only thing on TV  
Is the Good Morning News  
  
The tricks of the night  
Keepin' me in a daze  
Open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades  
Glance in the mirror  
Back into bed  
Forget that it's day, time to party again  
  
[Chorus]  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Bright light fright  
Give me the night  
  
[Repeat Chorus To Fade]

I met a babe in a backseat drive-in  
Back in the saddle she'd sit  
Pulled on the reins just to keep me risin'  
  
She loved to chomp at the bit  
Daddy do it, ooh, just do it  
Daddy do it, please let me see  
Do it, please just do it daddy  
Do it, do it, drivin' me crazy  
  
She always walks with her eyes down on her bootlace  
She lives to give it away  
She don't believe in the right time or the wrong place  
She's always liable to say  
  
(Cheese cake) Looser than her sister  
(Cheese cake) Mmm, her sugar gets me high  
She knows I can't resist her (cheese cake)  
Got my fingers in her pie (cheese cake)  
  
(Cheese cake) Sneakin' out the back door  
(Cheese cake) Rollin' down the lawn  
Everybody's kissed her (cheese cake)  
At the crack of dawn (cheese cake)

You act like a prima donna,  
Playing so hard to get.  
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant,  
Draggin' on a cigarette.  
You keep a wall all around ya.  
I'll get through some day.  
I want your love, baby,  
Push, don't shove  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
You stand like a marble statue,  
Trying to look so hard.  
All decked out in your antique dress,  
While the boys all promenade.  
Even a rock will crumble,  
If you strike it night and day.  
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust.  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm wanna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Yes I do, yes I do.  
  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.  
  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
  
Chip it.  
I'm gonna nip it, all night long.  

Ooh, on the beach at cartegena  
She, salty baby with the name-a  
Oh, chiquita  
Oh, love chiquita  
  
She, takes to walkin' in the sunshine  
She, she'll be lovin' till the moon shine  
Love chiquita  
Oh, love chiquita  
  
She, got the poppy-eyed desire  
Tease, till the boys put out the fire  
Love chiquita  
Oh, love chiquita  
  
Oh no no, now don't you wake me up I'm dreaming  
No no no, if you shake me I'll be screaming  
Love chiquita  
Oh love chiquita

The street is cold, the dawn is grey  
My heart says no but my head says stay  
My work is finished, or so I've been told  
Can't part the three of us, once we got a hold  
  
I forgot the name  
I took a shot on the chin  
I'm rearranging my game  
Tell by the shape I'm in  
  
In line of fire, you know what to say  
They gave us no choices, just one shade of grey  
My legs keep movin', I don't seem to stray  
But I know each step we take, they're one step away  
  
I found the secret, the key to the vault  
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls  
I took the time, to feel for the door  
I found the secret, the key to it all  
  
I got the Nouveauree  
And dragged it home to bed  
I traded you for me  
I took it all and said  
  
I find my own fun,  
Sometimes for free I got to pay it to come lookin' for me  
Walkin' on Gucci,  
Wearin' Yves St. Laurent barely stay on cause I'm so God damn gaunt

Here come ol' flat top  
He come grooving up slowly,  
He got Joo Joo eye-ball,  
He one holy roller,  
He got hair down to his knee.  
Got to be a joker,  
He just do what he please.  
  
He wear no shoeshine,  
He got toe jam football,  
He got monkey finger,  
He shoot Coca-Cola,  
He say I know you, you know me,  
One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
He bag production,  
He got walrus gumboot,  
He got O-no side board,  
He one spinal cracker,  
He got feet down below his knee.  
Hold you in his armchair,  
You can feel his disease.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
He roller coaster,  
He got early warning,  
He got Muddy Water,  
He one Mojo filter,  
He say one and one and one is three.  
Got to be good looking,  
'Cause he so hard to see.  
Come together, right now, over me.  
  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together  
Come together

(Dum, dum..can't find anything  
Better to do...you drive me crazy)  
Sitting on a castle  
On the floor with Esmeralda  
Waiting for the Geezer  
Captain Crunch to come around  
Feeling suicidal 'cause of certain situations  
Hanging from the stairs too long  
I think I'm coming down  
It's time to Crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Doin' tons of colon blow  
Stuffing it in every hole  
Mile high, so am I  
Watching Jimmy kiss the sky  
Salle diner becomes a blur  
With everybody jammin'  
Republicans begin to sin  
The batwings start a slamming  
It's time to crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Crash  
(Yeah, maybe it's a little late but it's time to)  
Crash  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
Captain Billy Beemish  
Put a lamb up on a rack  
Thanks for coming Billy  
And we hope you're comin' back  
The castle will be waiting  
For the next bangers and mash  
Blanche and Marsha Reznick  
Put their marmack with their hash  
It's time to crash  
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind...

Come here, baby  
You know you drive me up the wall  
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull  
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love  
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me  
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways  
You hear me?  
  
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train  
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood  
Girl, you been givin' me that line so many times  
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah  
  
That kinda lovin' turns a man to a slave  
That kinda lovin' sends a man right to his grave  
I go crazy, crazy baby, I go crazy  
You turn it on, then you're gone  
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby  
What can I do, honey? I feel like the color blue  
  
You're packin' up your stuff  
And talkin' like it's tough  
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!  
But, I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that over coat  
And it's all a show, yeah!  
  
That kinda lovin' makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah!  
That kinda lovin', yeah, now I'm never, never, never gonna be the same  
I go crazy, crazy baby, I go crazy

Ow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, now baby, baby, baby, baby

Arriving in boats, black hooded coats  
Tormentors climbed into my room  
I crawled under my bed, covered my head  
But they're flushin' me out with a broom  
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall  
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past  
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind  
But she never got the feelin' to last  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it  
This is the critical mass  
So far so good, I heard the other say  
So good so far, they're takin' me away  
I drink to you, your mind, her ass  
We'll take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it  
This is the critical mass  
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue  
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall  
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done  
But she just ain't listenin' at all  
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart  
I'll practice and phase  
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit  
And I went screaming out down the hall  
Need it  
Need your love  
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door  
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more  
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass  
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it  
We are the critical mass  
Time and space, is takin' me away  
Time erase, don't know the time of day

Now you say you lonely  
You cry the whole night through  
  
Well you can cry me a river,  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you.  
  
You drove me mad and drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said,  
Told me love was true for me and...  
Told me you was...you and...me and...Now you say you loved me  
Well, just to prove ya do  
  
Go on an  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you...

There was a time  
When I was so brokenhearted  
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine  
The tables have turned - yeah  
'Cause me and them ways have parted  
That kinda love was the killin' kind  
All I want is someone I can't resist  
I know - all I - need to know  
By the way I got kissed  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dryin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do down on me  
Now there's not even breathing room  
Between pleasure and pain  
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love  
Must be one and the same  
It's down on me  
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing  
It's been on my mind, girl I gotta say  
We're partners in crime  
You got that certain something  
What you do to me takes my breath away  
Now the word out on the street  
Is the devil's in your kiss  
If our love goes up in flames  
That's a fire I can't resist  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do to me  
'Cause what you got inside  
Ain't where your love should stay  
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love  
'Til you give your heart away  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' just to get you  
Now I'm dyin' just to let you  
Do what you do, what you do down on me  
Baby, baby, baby  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you  
Do what you do down to, down to, down to  
I was cryin' when I met you  
Now I'm tryin' to forget you  
Your love is sweet misery

I love to look into your big brown eyes  
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize  
You say the things nobody dares to say  
And I'm not about to let you fly away  
My lover with no jet lag  
We'll stay up all night in my sleepin' bag  
You got a heart-beatin' rhythm from the subterranean  
I really love you little girl, I don't need to explain  
I love you 'cause your deuces are wild, girl  
Like a double shot of lovin' so fine  
I been lovin' you since you was a child, girl  
'cause you and me is two of a kind  
Like deja vu I feel like I've been here  
Or somewhere else but you've been always near  
It's you that's in my dreams I'm beggin' for  
But I woke up when someone slammed the door  
So hard I fell out of bed  
Screamin' mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread  
And the moral of the story, I can testify  
I get stoned on you girl, that's the best reason why

If you see Kay, you got to revel  
No angel wings more like the devil  
She was so hot, so cool and nasty  
Believe it or not here's what she asked me,  
If you need love with no condition  
Let's Do the Do honey I'm on a mission'  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'  
My soul's been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
If you see Kay, tell her I love her  
She did me in but I'll recover  
She said love was her desire  
All that she touched she set on fire  
She was so diss, I couldn't slay her  
She blew a kiss, I threw the dagger  
  
Ain't no mistakin', my body's shakin'  
My soul's been taken  
By a Devil with a New Disguise  
The girl's so witchin', my backbone's twitchin'  
Cause down in Hell's kitchen  
The Devil's got a New Disguise  
  
She came from the wrong side of town  
Every time she got off she gets knocked back down  
She's Heaven materialized  
She's givin' me Hell but it ain't no surprise  
She's a bit uncivilized

Pulled into town just to check out the sites  
Chantilly Lace was head to toe in these tights  
I smell that Perfume now here she come again  
I can't believe this chick and a check out that grin  
The way that you come yeah the way that you drool  
Don't give me no nevermind I ain't yesterday's fool  
You buzzin' round my hive some and reek of self conceit  
Rubbin up and down my leg like a dog in heat  
  
You're a dime store lover  
A dime store lover  
Just a back page cover  
Yeah a dime store lover....  
  
Now some object when I throw down my cool  
But I'm judge and jury so uh... Objection overuled  
She did her best just to put on the charm  
She said "I dare you", I said "twist my arm"  
Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque  
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck  
I... I... I tipped my hat, she winked her scandle eyes  
And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised  
  
She's a dime store lover  
A dime store lover  
Yea a back seat shover  
Just a dime store lover....  
  
We was rollin round and round and round  
Chantilly took my breath away  
Yeah when push came to shove  
She gave me all the love  
That she was savin' for a rainy day  
We was rollin round and round and round  
Chantilly was my cream brule'

Can't help it yeah I just got to have it  
  
You're a dime store lover  
A dime store lover  
Just a back page cover  
Yeah a dime store lover....

Mmm.....  
I'll tell ya little secret  
Make you wanna jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you want to tell somebody  
But you got to be discreet  
Then you catch your girlfriend  
With her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
Say the times they be a-changing  
Though the blind lead the blind  
And you know your head is empty  
Though there's something on your mind  
Shackin' up with Lucy and when the morning comes  
You're with sally in the ally  
And the junkies and the bums  
You wonder why your girlfriend  
Has her skirt hiked up to here  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
(till I can see the white o'  
Your eyes, baby...just wait till i...  
I'm gonna fuck up, mm hmm, I'm gonna kick ass  
You just wait to see what I've got in store...)  
Roll the dice get lucky  
'Cause they roll ya for a dime  
You got nothing else to lose  
If ya only loose your mind  
When pleasure that is shallow  
Causes trouble to be deep  
You've been dusted with the devil  
While he sweeps you off your feet  
Huh,  
Tell you little secret  
Make you want to jump and shout  
When you talk to me in circles  
Take your foot out of your mouth  
It's hard enough to make it  
When you're livin' on the street  
And you hate to be a wise guy  
When your feet are in concrete  
Sleeping with the dogs  
And you wake up with the fleas  
Honey, don't get mad, get even  
Don't get mad get even  
Don't get mad get even, yeah  
Don't get mad get even  
Uh, uh, uh...

Remember when somebody tried to tell you how to walk  
And now they got the balls to tell us how we should talk  
Oh no, glove love ain't cool, I must agree  
So get outta my face, you ain't got nothin' on me  
  
Some say they do, some say they don't, I take it in stride  
And I can never get enough if I don't got to swallow my pride  
I heard it all before and then she told me, gimme some slack  
Then she smiled at me and gave me the shirt right off her back  
(And that's when I took advantage of the situation)  
  
Don't stop  
Rockin' your socks off  
Don't stop  
Knockin' their blocks off  
Don't stop  
Gettin' your rocks off  
Don't stop  
Takin' a hit, boy  
Don't stop  
Shakin' your fist, boy  
Don't stop  
I ain't got much to lose  
I'm feelin' so confused  
  
There's such a small thin line between pleasure and pain  
And when you say don't, then it's don't stop, I got to complain  
(Yeah) I think I may be gettin' real tired of all the steam  
Because it's hard to get the way you move out of my dreams  
(Got to get it while you can)  
  
Whenever you're in doubt, you got to whip it out  
When you keep hearin' no and your body says yes  
But you can't hear a word that's been said  
But you gotta confess lookin' up her address  
Got you thinkin' with your other head

Every time when I look in the mirror  
All these lines on my face getting clearer  
The past is gone  
It went by, like dusk to dawn  
Isn't that the way  
Everybody's got the dues in life to pay  
  
I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it's everybody's sin  
You got to lose to know how to win  
  
Half my life  
Is books, written pages  
Live and learn from fools and  
From sages  
You know it's true, oh  
All the things come back to you  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  
  
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream until your dreams come true  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream until your dreams come true  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away.

Totally outta control...(control) (control)... she owns me  
I didn't know that she'd know...(she'd know) (she'd know)... she stoned me  
I think I got it bad and I can't let it go  
I thought I knew me much better  
Autumn and cashmere all orange and green  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Creme' de gardenia and black Vaseline  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
It's so not fair...completely inside my head  
Imagine pretending she's the book that I've read  
With a beautiful ending  
It really drives me mad I can't leave her alone  
'Cuz I won't let me forget her  
Rose colored glasses you know what that sez  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Her sweet molass' is all mine pasque frez  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
(Yeeaaahh)...yeah  
Totally out of control she owns me  
Sweet almond eyes just to see and be seen  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
She's tasting like cherries sweet love's grenadine  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous  
A ten with a smile like a young Norma Jean  
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous...gorgeous

Cruised into a bar on the shore  
Her picture graced a grime on his door  
She a long lost love at first sight  
Baby, mabye you're wrong  
But you know it's all right - that's right  
  
Back stage we're having the time  
Of our lives until somebody says  
'forgive me if i seem out of line'  
Then she whipped out a gun  
Tried to blow me away  
  
(chorus)  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
  
So never judge a book by it's cover  
Or who you gonna love by your lover  
Love put me wise to her love in disguise  
She had the body of a venus  
Lord, imagine my surprise  
  
(chorus)  
  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Let me take a peak dear  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Do me, do me, do me all night  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Turn the other cheek dear  
(baby let me follow you down)  
Do me, do me, do me, sue me  
  
What a funky lady  
Oh, she like it, like it, like it, like it  
Oh, he was a lady  
  
(repeat chorus)

Well, well, well, well  
  
You were talking about your woman.  
I wish to god that you could see mine.  
You were talking about your woman.  
I wish to god, man, that you could see mine.  
Every time my little girl start to lovin',  
She bring eyesight to the blind.  
  
Lord, her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way
she walked.  
Her daddy must have been a millionaire, cause I could tell by the way she
walked.  
Every time she start to lovin',  
The deaf and dumb begin to talk.  
Yeah, you know what they say.  
  
I remember one Friday morning,  
We was lying down across your bed.  
Man in the back room was dying, eyes were sad, and I stroked his head and I
said Lordy ain't she pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
And every, every, every time she start to lovin', she bring eyesight to the
blind  
  
What a woman I got here.  
Lean on me baby, lean on me.  
  
Yes, I declare she's pretty, and the whole state knows she's fine.  
Man, I declare she's pretty, lordy, lordy, I declare she's fine.  
  
Every, every, every, every time she starts to lovin', she bring eyesight to
the blind.

Looking through the looking glass  
Looking back at me  
I got X-Ray rear view vision  
But I don't like what I see  
  
Now, I'd should not bitch and moan  
But there's not much I can do  
When you're hangin' by a thread  
And I'm hangin' on to you  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long, way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Now I know you feel compelled  
When you're so down in the dumps  
Every road can take some turns  
And every road has got it's bumps  
  
Now you got to know yourself  
Yeah, you got to play it smart  
'Cause you'll suffer for your sanity  
If you suffer for your art  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Now honey I got this feelin' something's funny  
But I don't know what it is  
My knees are shakin'  
And the ground's about to give  
  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Fall together  
Fall together  
Fall together, right now  
You and me

Theres a candle burning in the world tonight  
For another child who vanished out of sight  
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain  
Theres a million tears that fill a sea of pain  
Sometimes I stare out my window  
My thoughts all drift into space  
Sometimes I wonder if theres a better place  
(Tell me)  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling  
Now the times in frightening  
Cant ignore the facts  
Theres so many people  
Just slippin through the cracks  
So many ashes are scattered  
So many rivers run dry  
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell  
and you dont know why  
(So listen)  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Somewhere out there theres a shining light  
And I got to be with you tonight  
And with all were nowhere  
We still pay the price  
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way  
In downtown paradise  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Theres a candle burning

The day rolls in, the night rolls out  
Desire rules without a doubt  
The heart beats fast, you salivate  
And when you come, it won't be late  
I guess by now, you got the score  
A little taste you want it more  
From San Antone to Marrakesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have flesh  
You got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
From the day that Eve did Adam down to Romeo and Juliet  
Everybody gotta have  
The prince of lust has met his match  
The witch has brewed her baddest batch  
His sword is sharp and hard as stone  
Her cauldron begs for one more bone  
And so my love, this story's told  
From modern times to days of old  
From Boston, Mass to Bangladesh  
Yeah, when the night comes  
Everybody's gotta have  
Flesh - it's got me all soaking wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat, yeah  
From the Mississippi River  
To the highest mountain in Tibet  
Everybody gotta have  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing that's worth the sweat  
Flesh - you got me all soakin' wet  
Flesh - the only thing, the only thing, the only thing  
From a Sufi in a Rickshaw to a bimbo in a pink Corvette  
Everybody gotta have

Looking for a way  
Maybe now, maybe in a day  
Cause nothing gonna change  
If we stay around here  
  
We gotta do what it takes  
Cause it's all in our hands  
We all make mistakes  
But it's never too late to start again  
  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let them pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
If this life, gets any harder now  
Don't ever mind, you got me by your side  
And any time you want  
We can catch a train and find a better place  
Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down  
  
Maybe you and I  
Should pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
And fly away from here  
Anywhere, I don't care  
We'll just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
  
We won't let times pass us by  
We'll just fly  
  
Do you see a bluer sky now  
You could have a better life now  
Open your eyes  
No one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we won't let them  
No way

Yeah  
  
If I could change the world  
Like a fairy tale  
I would drink the love  
From your holy grail  
  
I would start with love  
Tell ol' Beelzebub  
To get outta town  
Cause you just lost your job  
  
How did we get so affected  
Cause I think  
Love is love reflected  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
And if  
There's a spell on you that  
I could take away  
I would do the deed  
Yeah, and by the way  
Here's to Heaven knows  
As the circle goes  
It ain't right  
I'm uptight  
Yeah, get on my toes!  
  
I used to think that every little thing I did was crazy  
But now I think the Karma cops are comin' after you  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
Every time you get yourself caught up  
Inside of someone else's crazy dream  
Own it, yeah, that's a mistake  
Everybody's gotta lot o' nada killing  
Them instead of killing me  
  
Time  
Don't let it slip away  
Raise yo' drinkin' glass  
Here's to yesterday  
In time  
We're all gonna trip away  
Don't piss Heaven off  
We got Hell to pay  
Come full circle  
  
Circle, circle...

No no, no no  
  
Oh, hey good lookin'

You a young spring chicken  
Make your feet start kickin'  
Boot it out, dance without me

She's right peculiar  
She'll try and fool ya  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
She's so appealing  
Right off the ceiling  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
What did I tell ya  
She'll buy and sell ya  
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
She's so affected  
I'm so rejected  
And the girl keeps coming apart  
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down  
Don't let it get me down  
She's just a screamer  
A nightmare dreamer  
Yeah, the girl keeps coming apart  
She's like a call girl  
Loose ends and all girl  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
White lace and leather  
She's so together  
But still the girl keeps coming apart  
I feel sedated  
Boxed up an crated  
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't  
Don't let it get me down  
Don't let it get me down  
"So there she was  
Buns up and kneelin'  
I was a wheelin' and a dealin'  
My ace in the hole so to speak"

When winter hush turns summer pink  
In half the time it takes to blink  
But it all depends on what' choo think  
About the girls of summer  
  
When all you think of all day long  
Is a pretty face inside a song  
With a thought like that you can't go wrong  
About the girls of summer  
  
Oh yeah (Do you know, what everybody's talking about)  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls can't live without it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Over and over again  
  
My favorite thing that drives me wild  
Is when a city girl walks a country mile  
For a boy she loves  
God bless the child inside the girls of summer  
  
Oh yeah (Do you know, what everybody's talking about)  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls can't live without it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Yeah over and over again  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
They get'choo climbin' the walls  
They get'choo caught in their spell  
They get'choo speakin' in tongues  
Could this be Heaven or Hell  
To fall in love twice a day  
Is such a sweet price to pay  
  
S'il - vous - plait  
  
The best things about life are free  
The pussy willow up your tree  
To the one who climbs  
They'll always be the girl yeah  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls no doubt about it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Some girls can't live without it  
Some girls got twenty reasons why  
  
Over and over and over and over and over

Any way you can feel it  
You shouldn't try to conceal it baby  
You got to make up your mind  
Any way I can steal it  
Any way you can deal it to me  
You know the pleasure's all mine  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...  
That's right!  
I wanna say you're a firecracker  
I wanna say you're a switchblade knife  
You make your sex a career  
Comin' down from an all night tripper  
Pull your foot from the ruby slipper  
'Cause you can't get it from here  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...  
Goin' round n' round n' round n' round....  
I got this feeling deep inside my love  
Overwhelming feeling but I know not what  
One thing's for sure I ain't got time for those  
Who can't relate  
You gotta learn to love the midnight madness  
You gotta revel in the good and badness  
If yin n' yang is your thing  
What I gotta do to try and reach ya  
Is it for real or just a double feature  
So let's go throw the I ching  
You gotta love it  
You better own it  
You gotta love it  
And god knows it  
You gutta shu uh shove it  
I'm gonna make things happen  
Goin' round n' round n' round...

[Chorus:]  
Gypsy, gypsy, dancing feet  
Gypsy, gypsy, bittersweet  
Screamer, dreamer, disarray  
Gypsy, gypsy, why don't you fly away?  
  
No good, papa's no good, sister's no good and that's a drag  
Sometimes you feel like your heads on the ceiling  
When you scream your mama rag  
When your daddy come home with an old soup bone  
And take all your money away  
And your mama's in the kitchen on the phone she be bitchin'  
And your girlfriend who called to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
High school lover with ya cops undercover and gettin' high, drank Lebanese  
Hey mama choose that you been through  
And it's right between your knees  
Hair case, shotgun, rock on, chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight...  
Your love child with wild child smile  
And don't care wrong from right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody but nobody baby knockin' my socks off  
Rock, rockin' baby I'll be gettin' my rocks off  
Nobody but nobody shootin' never get a shot off  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Me and my old lady sittin' in the shade  
Talkin' 'bout the money that I ain't made  
Singin' o boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
If I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock that Moses stood  
Singin' O boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
Drank so much hooch  
It my eyes be gettin' blurry  
They say I nailed her to the wall  
A stitch in time don't mean a thing  
No hangman jury could make me crawl  
'Cause I'm a poor boy dontcha  
Line the track a lack a  
  
O boy dontcha line the track  
O boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
O boy dontcha line the track  
  
Whatcha do with a gun that's loaded  
Shot her dead and her heart exploded  
Tell me baby now d-dontcha worry  
Like lyin' to a Hangman Jury  
I swear I didn't know that '45 was loaded  
In fact my memory ain't too clear  
That's not to say she didn't get what she deserved  
Least that's the way it looked from here  
Boy when you line the track a lack a  
  
Hey boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Hey boy dontcha line the track  
Ooh, my love came tumblin' down  
Ooh, love come tumblin' down  
Ooh, Let's get outta here  
  
Love come tumblin'  
And every night she take her things into the city  
And in the morning make me beg  
If I'd taken all her titty gritty  
Smack her right upside the head  
  
Boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
Ooh, my love came tumblin' down  
Ooh, love comes tumblin' down  
Ooh, love comes tumblin' down  
Poor boy sweatin' in the hot summer night  
Hangman waitin' for the early mornin' light singin'  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
  
If I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock that Moses  
Done stood singin'  
  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track  
Oh boy dontcha line the track a lack a  
Oh boy dontcha line the track

I was dancing down the sidewalk  
Just some slam dunk  
That you might jive  
And I wondered then  
About his old girlfriend  
Was she still around - still alive  
  
It's been years  
Since my gears have been turning  
Since I asked her same dice dance  
How the flames of my poor heart been burning  
If it's hate then this must be romance  
  
Head first, baby  
How the good time feelin' lingers  
Oh, you can be alright  
On the wrong side of the street  
I'm so hungry for love  
I've been lickin' off all my fingers  
Oh yeah, you got to learn to  
Take the bitter with the sweet  
  
Yeah, I feel just like getting in trouble  
By the hair on her chinny-chin-chin  
And I love to get down on the stubble  
With my teeth it will taste like your grin  
  
Head first, baby  
How the good time feelin' lingers  
Oh, you can be alright  
On the wrong side of the street  
I'm so hungry for love  
I've been lickin' off all my fingers  
Oh yeah, you got to learn to  
Take the bitter with the sweet  

Met a woman, she had a man  
Couldn't help it, I had a plan  
Right around midnight he was gone  
Saw her red light, she left it on  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh, now she's mine  
If there's a reason for these chains  
It's like we suffer to ease the pain  
Now I got this feelin' inside of me  
My heart's in jail and I can't break free  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
And oh my heart's done time  
And oh now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine  
Now she's mine

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
Where I stop and I turn and go for a ride  
'Til I get to the bottom and I see you again  
  
Do you or don't you want me to love you  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Will you want you want me to make you  
I'm comin' down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter, look out  
  
She's coming down fast  
Yes she is, yes she is

I'm down a one way street  
With a one night stand  
With a one track mind  
Out in no man's land  
The punishment sometimes  
Don't seem to fit the crime  
  
Yeah there's a hole in my soul  
But one thing I've learned  
For every love letter written  
There's another one burned  
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time  
  
Is it over?  
Is it over?  
Cause I'm blowin' out the flame  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl  
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you, girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever  
It's a place where a garden never grows  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
Yeah, I should have known better  
Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm as dry as a seven year drought  
I got dust for tears  
Yeah I'm all tapped out  
Sometimes I feel broken and can't get fixed  
  
I know there's been all kinds of shoes  
Underneath your bed  
Now I sleep with my boots on  
But you're still in my head  
And something tells me this time  
I'm down to my last licks  
  
Cause if it's over  
Then it's over  
And it's driving me insane  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl, yeah, I swear  
I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever

Yeah, I should have known better  
Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Yeah, is it over?  
Yeah, it's over  
And I'm blowing out the flame  
  
Take a walk outside your mind  
Tell me how it feels to be  
The one who turns  
The knife inside of me  
Take a look and you will find  
There's nothing there, girl, yeah, I swear  
I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause  
  
There's a Hole In My Soul  
That's been killing me forever  
It's a place where a garden never grows

Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose  
Yeah, yeah

I could stay awake just to hear you breathing  
Watch you smile while you are sleeping  
While you're far away and dreaming  
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender  
I could stay lost in this moment forever  
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure  
  
Don't want to close my eyes  
I don't want to fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
'Cause even when I dream of you  
The sweetest dream will never do  
I'd still miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
  
Lie close to you feeling your heart beating  
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming  
Wondering if it's me you're seeing  
Then I kiss your eyes  
And thank God we're together  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever  
Forever and ever  
  
Don't want to close my eyes  
I don't want to fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
'Cause even when I dream of you  
The sweetest dream will never do  
I'd still miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
  
I don't want to miss one smile  
I don't want to miss one kiss  
I just want to be with you  
Right here with you, just like this  
I just want to hold you close  
Feel your heart so close to mine  
And just stay here in this moment  
For all the rest of time  
  
Don't want to close my eyes  
I don't want to fall asleep  
'Cause I'd miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
'Cause even when I dream of you  
The sweetest dream will never do  
I'd still miss you baby  
And I don't want to miss a thing  
  
Don't want to close my eyes  
I don't want to fall asleep  
I don't want to miss a thing

Refrain] Oh, I love trash!  
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty  
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty  
Yes, I love trash  
I have here a sneaker that's tattered and worn  
It's all full of holes and the laces are torn  
A gift from my mother the day I was born  
I love it because it's trash  
[Refrain]  
I have here some newspaper thirteen months old  
I've wrapped some fish inside it, it's smelly and cold  
But I wouldn't trade it for a big pot o' gold  
I love it because it's trash  
[Refrain]  
I've a clock that won't work, and an old telephone  
A broken umbrella, a rusty trombone  
And I am delighted to call them my own  
I love them because they're trash  
[Refrain, ending with]... Yes, I love, I love, I love trash

Kickin' down the road  
Feelin' mighty slowed  
With the likes of you  
Gettin' mighty spaced  
Never had a taste  
Of what you're goin' through  
I can't bitch  
Went from rags to riches  
Then to ragtime screamin' the blues  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Try to make a fool out of me  
I want to know why  
Everybody's good intention  
Gotta make a fool  
Gotta make a fool  
Try to make a fool out of me  
Swing low  
Sweet cherry o  
When a strange love showed me the way  
Ya see more  
Can't keep a score  
When the whore's comin' on for the play  
E. Poe  
Eatin' crow  
Wonder if he knowed that the raven was mad  
Time passed  
And words lost the last  
Of the best thing he ever had  
Oh play rough  
Can't get enough  
So they try to make a fool out of me, lordy  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me  
Ain't foolin' me  
Ya ain't ghoulin' me

You telling lies thinking I can't see  
You don't cry 'cause you're laughing at me  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down

Same old thing happens every day  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down

You still moan: "Keep your hands to yourself"  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down on the ground (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down, down, down

What a stormy night, when I met the pony,  
It was so dark, that I could hardly see,  
It smelled so sweet, you know who and Joanie,  
So many butterflies, one could not see...  
We all could feel desire, took off in flight,  
It was hotter than fire, then came the light.  
I smell the heat, the dancing ponies,  
Unwrapped his wings, to dry off Joanie,  
The pony he grew in size, the thunder and rain,  
And finally realized, what was, what it does, and what it come to say.  
Love to kiss the cheek of mother nature, nobody here can deni such things,  
Make the ladies you love come honey, no butterfly should be denied its
wings...  
He was kick ass rocking horse! He was like a hell bent tied to the Gavin pole,  
He was a one time fantasy, I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land,  
Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,  
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!  
We rode the night, and took to wing, it was so all right, it was everything,  
We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,  
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!  
No, no, no, no, took off in flight,  
No, no, no, no, then came the light.  
Flashback, somethings coming over me, no sweat one time fanatsy.  
Bare bones all in the wind it seems, hell, who's the chick,  
That rides into my dreams?  
No Libury,  
No stablize,  
No one try to please,  
Nobody's eyes.  
We'll never see us again, tell me when it passed,  
Let it all begin, but all of that time, somebody shot an arrow...  
Being tempted by the time is never,  
Breaking me cause your cold sometimes...  
Being seduced by your own pleasures,  
Being king on your own time...  
He was a kick ass rocking horse, he was a...  
One horn, unicornucopia,  
Two, two in utopia,  
Three star, verge in to infinity,  
Four, four, ya... yaa hoo...

She said i feel stranded  
And i can't tell anymore  
If i'm coming or i'm going  
It's not how i planned it  
I got a key to the door  
But it just won't open  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
That life happens for a reason  
I don't i don't i don't  
Becuase it never worked before  
But this time  
This time  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better  
  
She said i need you to hold me  
I'm a little far from the shore  
And i'm afraid of sinking  
You're the only one who knows me  
And who doesn't ignore that my soul i weeping  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
Everything must have it's season  
'round and 'round it goes  
Every day's the one before  
But this time  
This time  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better

To all the things i leave behind  
It's really getting old yea  
I think i need a little help this time  
  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better

Just Push play  
Fuckin A  
Just push play  
They're gonna bleep it anyway  
S'il vous plait  
Fuckin' A  
Just push play  
We're comin' at you anyway

Long ago in days untold  
Were ruled by lords of greed  
Maidens fared with gold they dared  
To bare their wombs that bleed  
Kings and queens and guillotines  
Taking lives denied  
Starch and parchment laid the laws  
When bishops took the ride  
Only to deceive  
Oh I know I  
Lived this life afore  
Somehow I know now  
Truths I must be sure  
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'  
Dreams of swords in hand  
Sailing ships, the Viking spits  
The blood of father's land  
Only to deceive  
Living times of knights and mares  
Raising swords for maidens fair  
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride  
Living other centuries  
Deja vu or what you please  
Follows true to all who do or die  
Screams of no reply  
They died  
Screams of no reply  
And died  
Died  
Lordy, Lordy, they died

Finders keepers losers weep  
Down on 42nd street  
Bare-foot-children cryin' my-oh-my  
I watched you on the avenue  
While other men were having you  
I think that you should led your caged bird fly  
  
And kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
  
I've been so lost I must confess  
I've had my share of loneliness  
But yeah it's hard to keep a good man down  
The loves you lost were all in vain  
The past lives on inside your brain  
I don't think you need those memories  
Hangin' 'round, yeah  
Good-bye  
  
Kiss your past good-bye  
You've gotta let if fly  
Kiss your past good-bye, yeah  
And if that bird don't fly away  
There's just one thing I got to say  
It's later than deuce a ticks  
Your broken heart, it needs a fix  
You're feedin' off a high that would not last  
And people they don't seem to care  
And sorry just don't cut it, yeah  
It seems to me you're gettin' nowhere fast  
  
So, kiss, your, past  
Or kiss your ass good-bye  
Kiss your past good-bye  
There's no more tears to cry  
So kiss your past good-bye  
Or kiss your ass good-bye  
Yeah

Take me back to a south Tallahassee  
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy  
Can't stand up on my feet in the city  
Got to get back to the real nitty gritty  
  
Yes sir, no sir  
Don't come close to my  
Home sweet home  
Can't catch no dose  
Of my hot tail poon-tang sweatheart  
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse  
From a J Paul Getty and his ear  
With a face in a beer  
Home sweet home  
  
Get out in the field,  
Put the mule in the stable  
Ma, she's a cookin'  
Put the eats on the table  
Hate's in the city and my love's in the meadow  
Hand's on the plow and my feets in the ghetto  
  
Stand up, sit down  
Don't do nothin'  
Ain't no good when boss man's stuffin'  
Down their throats with paper notes  
As babies cry  
When you're rockin' the street  
Home sweet home  
  
Mamma take me home sweet home  
I was the last child, just a punk in the street.

Legendary child  
I tell ya what I'm talkin' about  
  
Makin' love at seventeen, yeah, we had the luck  
But we traded 'em toys and other joys, and we didn't give a (whoa-oh-oh)  
I took a chance at the high school dance, never knowing wrong from right  
And that same show, forty years ago, being televised tonight  
  
'Cause journey from inside my head to the Taj Mahal  
I went from never-havin'-none to wanna-have-it-all  
I wanna keep that dream alive  
And eat that honey from the hive  
With all the noise and all the glamor  
No surprise you know I am a  
  
Legendary child  
I think that what I'm tryin' to say is  
  
Sticks and stones will break your bones, at least they'll rearrange  
I drop a dime and every time I get myself a nickel's change (whoa-oh-oh)  
They say we don't know jack  
At the plant, we proved 'em wrong  
We traded in our souls at night and sold 'em for a song  
  
And if Satan had a lady friend, her name was Mary Jane  
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane  
And how we got the golden fleece  
From tokin' on that pipe of peace  
Yeah, as far as I can see  
There is a God 'cause I got me a  
  
Legendary child  
Legendary child  
  
(Le-gen-da-ry child) Legendary child  
Legendary child  
  
Legend  
Legendary child  
Legendary

Rock-a-bye baby if you want to dance  
Grab yourself a body and take a chance  
They say one time around is all you get  
But I'm still dancin' so you lost your bet  
I got a hardcore mama with a hot hoochie coo  
Make my wheels start spinnin' like a formula two  
I got one for the money  
Two for the show  
Three for my honey  
And four to let you know that I  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Let the music do the talking  
Cheesecake maybe if I take another bite  
I'm a real fat city I'm an aero delight  
Threw out my pipe and my alcoline  
Got a squeaky clean body and a dirty mind  
I'm a real fine dancer I'll be cutting rug  
Got my brand new baby she's my brand new drug

Johnny come lately on a Saturday night  
Singin' how-de-do  
Backstreet boogie in the house of delight  
Where they steal the show  
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet  
And it's a love affair  
Whole place rockin', people stompin' their feet  
When the gang's all there  
He gets his lovin' every night for free  
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe  
I sing na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Johnny liked to gamble with his lady Louise  
She was a blackjack deuces are wild  
He got to thinkin' 'bout his nose in the breeze  
Johnny looked and he smiled  
He started thinkin' bout the fortune and fame  
And the young girls down at his knees  
He dug the money but forgot all the names  
So he knew just how to appease  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
Lick and a promise  
He gave the ladies a lick and a promise  
Loose change clover in his early early years  
Had his poor mama pacin' the floors  
He grabbed a guitar and a couple of beers  
Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more

Boo yah  
There's a place in the way outta sphere  
Do ya  
Want to burn the midnight oil  
Does it fool ya  
When you think there's no way out of here  
Let it pull ya  
From the outside to within  
  
[Chorus:]  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light makes everything all right  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright  
  
May I  
Introduce you to my point of view  
Me, I  
Want to get under your skin  
I want to thank you  
For the pleasure that I get from you  
I want to drag you  
From the outside to within'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright  
  
[Chorus]

Boys, it looks, are ready to rumble  
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble  
Blades gonna flash when streets gang clash  
In the avenue tonight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
Zip gun Johnny's finger is itchin'  
The lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen  
It's an eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
It's so ruthless when they fight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
When the lightning strikes  
It's dog eat dog when you meet your rival  
And the combat zone it's your means of survival  
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz  
With a broken dagger knife  
When the lightning strikes  
  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
Oh, oh...  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
Lightning and thunder  
When the lightning strikes...

If you think that you're strong  
Wanna fight well come on  
And line up  
When the goin' gets tough  
And your talk ain't enough then come on  
And line up  
We gotta get up, get out before they get us down  
'Cause livin' up against the wall, yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up  
So don't be surprised  
When they pull the wool over your eyes  
Yeah, don't get funked up  
If you got all the stuff  
And you can't get enough  
Then line up  
If you're out on a limb  
And you wanna come in  
Then line up  
Your head's down, sittin' 'round  
Pick yo face up off the ground  
And get yourself together baby  
And learn to stand tough  
Come on an line up  
We better get to it  
Instead of just standin' around  
It's time to get down  
If you're playin' to win  
Then your only way in  
Is line up  
If we all wanna live  
Then we all gotta give  
Line up  
We gotta get up, get out  
Before they get us down  
'Cause livin' up against the wall, yeah  
Has got us locked up  
Come on and line up

If you got all the stuff  
And you can't get enough  
Then line up - line up  
If you think that you're strong  
Wanna fight well come on  
And line up - line up

I was walkin' down the street  
When someone called my name  
She had spiked heels on her feet  
And she was feelin' no pain  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
So I hid behind the newspaper  
Turned to page six  
She was in her birthday suit  
Behind a crucifix  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
She was hangin' big booty  
She was puss n' boots way up to here  
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7  
A 10 every day of the year  
  
Now there must be some mistake  
I'm feelin' so high strung  
She said 'I make love like a snake  
I even got a forked tongue'  
  
At first I thought I was dreamin'  
That I'd wake up and she'd disappear  
But when I opened up my eyes  
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier  
  
You know I never seem to give  
Or ever get enough  
And I just can't seem to live without  
That sweet bodacious stuff  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love

Down to who knows who, just to socialize.  
I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes.  
You got no way to make a man honey,  
You got to understand.  
I'm your man, child. Lord of the thighs.  
  
Well, well, Lordie my God,  
What do we got here?  
She's flashin' 'cross the floor,  
Make it perfectly clear.  
You're the bait, and you're the hook,  
Someone 'bound to take a look.  
I'm your man, child. Lord of the thighs.  
  
You must have come here to find it,  
You've got the look in your eyes.  
Although you really don't mind it  
I am the Lord of your thighs!  
  
You must have come here to find it baby,  
You've got the look in your eyes.  
Although you really don't mind it  
I am the Lord of your thighs!
