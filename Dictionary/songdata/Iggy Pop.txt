You look so good to me  
Here in this old saloon  
Way back in West Berlin  
A bottle of white wine  
  
White wine and you  
A table made of wood  
And how I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
  
You look so good to me  
Standing out in the street  
With your cheap fur on  
Or maybe your plastic raincoat  
  
And your plastic shoes  
They look good too  
Standing in the snow  
You're younger than you look  
  
Fall in love with me  
Fall in love with me  
How I wish you would  
A table made of wood  
  
And a, a bottle of white wine  
And you, and a bottle of white wine and you  
And when you're standing  
In the street and it's cold  
  
And it snows on you  
And you look younger than you really are  
  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me  
I wish you would  
Fall in love with me yeah, yeah  
  
The way your eyes are black  
The way your hair is black  
The way your heart is young  
There's just a few like you  
  
Just the kind I need  
To fall in love with me  
Oh and you look so good  
Oh yes you look so good  
  
A bottle of white wine  
A cigarette and you  
Here in this saloon  
White wine and you  
  
I wish you'd fall in love with me  
I wish you'd fall in love with me  
'Cause there's just a few like you  
So young and real  
  
There's just a few like you  
So young and real  
Fall in love with me [Repeat: x 4]  
I wish you would  
  
You look so good  
Oh when you're young at heart  
There's just a few like you  
You're young at heart  
  
Won't you  
Come to this old saloon  
Come to my waiting arms  
A table made of wood  
  
And I will look at you  
'Cause you're so young and pure  
And you're young at heart  
You're young at heart  
A bottle of white wine  
  
And when you're tumbling down  
You just look better  
When you're tumbling down  
You just look finer

Yeah, I like it  
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!  
  
I'm only five foot one  
I got a pain in my neck  
I'm looking up in the city  
What the hell what the heck  
  
I stare at the concrete  
The girders eye high  
The steel's above me  
There's love in my eyes  
  
And I'm doing the things  
A five foot one man can do  
  
I'm only five foot one  
I got a pain in my heart  
All the night I'm working  
In the amusement park  
  
With a bottle of aspirin  
A sack full of jokes  
I wish I could go home  
With all the big folks  
  
And I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
Anything  
  
I'm only five foot one  
Unless the time has come  
I won't grow anymore  
Anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
'Till I'm losing my head  
I'm checkin' it twice  
I'm gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
  
And I'm doing the things a five foot one man can do  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines [Repeat: x3]  
I wish life could be  
Yeah, I wish life could be  
Oh  
I wish life could be  
  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be Swedish magazines  
I wish life could be  
  
I won't grow anymore [Repeat: x3]  
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
I'm only five foot one [Repeat: x3]  
I'm five foot one

Fast young girl wants to go  
Body 's red mouth is whole  
Got the worst in the world  
But this won 't be hassle-free  
  
Lovers kiss in the heat  
Body crush basement suite  
Mind my eyes behind my hair  
Hide my face and look nowhere  
Change addresses ditch that guy  
Don 't pick up when he calls  
Runaway everyday  
  
Coffee beans and hideaways  
They want these, they want those  
First my nose then my toes  
Presidents and super meaks  
Litey dogs and love boutiques  
  
Afternoons waking up  
Neighborhood slouch and stuff  
Drifters too in a flow  
Nowhere they got to go  
Shave haired girl with a dog  
Dressing cool not too new  
I want to talk I want to know,  
What she feels and what she knows  
  
I m so fucking alone  
I m so fucking alone  
O.k. o.k.this is me  
O.k. o.k.this is me  
  
Evening breeze river east  
Music mix salsa speed  
Metal rap lonely sax  
Open jeep with the speakers back  
Rock n roll band practicin'  
Shaking those walls next to me  
Everybody is in a dream  
Of what they want and who they need  
To feel all right to be alive  
To wipe out words that they despise  
  
From a thunder brain  
That's quick to pain  
And only once to live again  
When that set up gets in the way  
The dreamin brain will make a play  
To wipe it all outta space  
Press record and then erase  
'cause there's something here  
They gotta face  
  
Everyeody in this place  
It's the same for everyone  
They gotta figure out something  
They gotta figure out themselves  
They gotta figure on their own  
They gotta figure out, OK?  
O.k. o.k. o.k. o.k.  
I 'm so fucking alone  
I' m so fucking alone  
Oh no, being alone  
I'm so fucking alone  
O.k. o.k. so this is me  
O.k. o.k. so this is me  
This is me  
O.k.  
I' m not even sure what she wanted  
I 'm not even sure what she wanted

She sat on the pavement  
As I pulled in the drive  
Wearing leopard skin velvet  
And shiny black eyes  
"She looks like a sleeper"  
  
Said my wife at the time  
She had curls like Delilah  
And a smile like the sun  
She held my poor corpse  
Like she'd never be done  
And the caption in my mind said  
"This is the one"  
  
But I'm strong and I'm disciplined  
And I avoided her for years  
'Till one night, as usual  
With my heart full of tears  
A hand touched my back  
  
And she was standing right there  
Then I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury  
Whispering  
Whispering  
  
Now I'll try hard to tell things just like they is  
How my life was a desert before she came in  
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin  
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house  
The way she curled up quietly on the couch  
I can still see her in my mind that way now  
Aah I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
  
Well time went by quickly  
And her confidence grew  
And she wanted this and that  
And she wanted those too  
And she wouldn't shut up  
And one day I just blew up  
Now she's in the hospital  
For the second time  
Maybe she'll die  
Maybe I'll cry  
Therapists would say  
"You're in denial"  
  
But love became inconvenient  
Love became a literal drag  
Very bad for business  
I'd be better off a fag  
She's a model de sport  
That I can't afford  
'Cause I'm a practical American  
From the Middle-West  
And I can piss on a grave  
While welcoming guests  
If cold's what I am  
I'm cold 'till the end  
And I felt the luxury of her  
I felt the luxury of her  
Now I'm gonna continue walking  
In the modern world  
Which justifies every egotistical perversion  
With scientific talk  
And new ways to walk  
  
But I'll remember the religion  
She became to me  
And the other person I could have been  
So for now I'll say so long  
I gotta go do wrong  
I gotta go do wrong  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
I felt the luxury  
Aah, Luxury

(feat. The Stooges)  
  
But I am your crazy driver  
Honey I'm sure to steer you ' round  
I am dying in any story (?)  
I'm only living and (when I) sing this song  
(just the same, baby...)  
  
  
I need somebody, baby  
I need somebody, too  
I need somebody, baby  
just like you  
  
  
But I'm losing a lot of my feelings  
and I'm running out of friends  
you know you lied to me in the beginning  
tried to bring me to the end  
  
  
I need somebody etc.  
  
Well I was trying to leave this signal  
in a fury an (it) is too strong  
Yea I got my reputation  
write me anyway, not too long  
  
I need somebody etc

You are a moron  
I'm glad to be here  
Seeing the sight of you  
Smelling the smell of you  
  
You most deplorable glaring example  
Of a degenerate narcotic influence  
My seething hate is driving me nuts  
What can I do to obliterate you  
  
I snub you  
I really hope you're one of a kind  
You don't care who you brutalize  
You are a bully plain and simple  
  
You are a beast you are a pig  
You've been a pig for long enough now  
I'm making my move  
I'm making an end to you  
  
I snub you  
And when I snub  
I really snub  
I snub you finally, forever  
  
Is she really going out with him?  
Now is the time  
I'm playing my ate  
I'll give you a mouthful you can't swallow  
  
Unquestionably I've been lacking in taste  
You're being cheerful but not for long  
Your Mum and Dad they sure made a mess  
You're going to look like watercress  
  
When I snub you  
He snubs you  
We snub you  
Dogs snub you  
I snub you

I see my future shuffling  
A shaky step at a time  
I got no choice but careful  
Thank God I've done my crime  
The tools I see on TV  
Can't stand it when they fake  
A prick's a prick at any age  
Why give one a break?  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
  
The soul is in the eyeball  
For anyone to see  
I'm better than a Pepsi  
I'm cooler than MTV  
I'm hotter than California  
I'm cheaper than a gram  
I'm deeper thar the shit I'm in  
An' I don't really give a damn  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer now  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
  
Step up it's fight time  
Kick scratch and bite time  
Ain't talking about no more fun  
But that don't bother my bad ass none  
  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live a little bit longer now  
I want to live a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live  
Just a little bit longer  
I want to live live live live live

I'm standin' in a shadow, hating the world  
I keep a wall around me, block out the herd  
It's a nerve-wreck placeto be, it kills real  
Quick  
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick  
But we're gonna live so happily  
In a faraway place, just you and me  
If I don't crap out  
The sun will shine and give us a hug  
The world will sing like a happy bug  
If I don't crap out  
No and I won't crap out  
I won't crap out  
  
I'm glad I am crazy, it keeps me trying  
I despise the trendies, I know  
They're lying  
  
If you want to stir up real mud  
You had better pay with real blood  
But the birds will sing a sweet melody  
In a couple of green indifferent trees  
If I don't crap out  
  
And you're gonna know how fine you are  
Gonna write your name on a violet star  
If I don't crap out  
  
We'll have a window and we'll have a door  
And a reason to be living for  
If I don't crap out  
  
And the material singers will fade into dust  
Like forgotten merchants of disgust  
If I don't crap out  
No I won't crap out  
No I'll never crap out  
Oh I won't crap out  
I won't crap out

I used to lead a quiet life  
In fact it was a bare existence  
I passed out on many floors  
I don't do that any more  
  
Hello my friends  
Is everybody happy?  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
I'm a conservative  
  
I like the small black marks on my hands  
I'm a conservative  
I like the crazy girls that I screw  
Hey I know them all well  
  
And when I run out of bread I laugh  
All the way to the bank  
Sometimes I pause for a drink  
Conservatism ain't no easy job  
  
I smile in the mornings  
I live without a care  
Nothing is denied me  
And nothing ever hurts  
  
I got bored so I'm making my millions  
When you're conservative you get a better break  
You're always on the rigltt side  
When you're conservative  
  
You walk with pride  
Pride is on your side  
Pride pride pride  
Is on our side  
Oh boy  
Pride is on our side  
  
I like my beer  
I like my bread  
I love my girl  
I love my head  
  
I'm in the clear man  
I'm in the dear  
Because I'm a conservative  
I'm a conservative  
I really am  
Ohyeslam  
  
And it would mean so much to me  
If you would only be like me  
Yes it could mean so much to me  
  
Hey look me over  
lend me an ear  
I'm a conservative

I'm bored.  
I'm the chairman of the board.  
I'm a Lincoln monologue, I'm livin' like a God,  
I'm bored.  
  
I bore myself to sleep at night, I bore myself in broad daylight, 'cause I'm
bored.  
Just another slimy bore.  
  
I'm free to bore my well-bought friends,  
And spend my cash until the end,  
'cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
I'm the chairman of the board.  
  
I'm sick.  
I'm sick of all my kicks.  
I'm sick of all the stiffs, I'm sick of all the dips, I'm bored.  
  
I bore myself to sleep at night, I bore myself in broad daylight,  
'cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
Just another dirty bore!  
Alright now, face, come out and bore me!  
  
I am sick!  
I am sick of all my kicks!  
I'm sick of all the stiffs, I'm sick of all the dips, I'm sick!  
I'm sick when I go to sleep at night, I'm still sick in the broad daylight,  
'Cause I'm bored!  
I'm bored!  
I'm the chairman of the board!

A bowling wind is whistling in the night  
My dog is growling in the dark  
Something's pulling me outside  
To ride around in circles  
I know that you have got the time  
Coz anything I want, you do  
You'll take a ride through the strangers  
Who don't understand how to feel  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
  
I'll let some air come in the window  
Kind of wakes me up a little  
I don't turn on the radio  
Coz they play shit, like... You know  
When your hand was down on my dick  
It felt quite amazing  
And now that, that is all over  
All we've got is the silence  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
So come on mandolins, play  
  
When I touched you  
I felt that you still had your baby fat  
And a little taste of baby's breath  
Makes me forget about death  
At your age you're still joking  
It ain't time yet for the choking  
So now we can own the movie and see each other truly  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
In the deathcar, we're alive  
I want to ear some mandolins

Standing on the poop deck of a wreck  
Inferiority complex  
Waiting for the tugboat of respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
Trying to see the good side of a bad life  
Showing real courage with a sad wife  
Your soul is full of holes air could blow through  
People that you meet don't want to know you  
  
People are strange when they don't respect  
Inferiority complex  
People are mean when they get the chance  
Won't anybody have this dance  
People are weird when they don't respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
Are you heel or just a toe?  
It's hard to say cause you feel so low  
  
The man is eying and you like a suspect  
Inferiority complex  
Your every word is something to correct  
Inferiority complex  
  
Everything about you repels sunshine  
Every deep desire leaves you flat lined  
Walking trough the world you leave no traces  
You don't feel a part of any places  
  
People are strange when there's no respect  
Inferiority complex  
People are bad when they get the chance  
Won't anybody have this dance  
People are strange when there's no respect  
Inferiority complex  
  
It's hard to say when you're down so low  
So low  
  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore  
Inferior but not a bore

I used to live in an innocent world  
I had a car and a pretty blond girlfriend  
We was too young to know what we were doing  
And anyway I was just fooling around  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
With a cute little monkey on my back  
And a total disregard for the facts  
I'd run away and never get back  
From my innocent world  
  
There ain't no reason to tell no lie  
When you're young and you've got a lot of pie  
Now I slink around like a killer  
The things they say are just a lot of filler  
In my mind, in my mind  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Running, laughing in the sun  
And always having lots of fun  
Smoking dope and just being young  
In my innocent world  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
With a cute little monkey on my back  
And a total disregard for the facts  
I'd run away and never get back  
From my innocent world  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world [Repeat: x4]

Standing on the borderline  
Between joy and reason  
Tending carefully my fire  
Waiting for my season  
I know who these people are  
I know what they stand for  
Corruption's built into this plan  
Nothing's under the other hand  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the grinning shadows  
  
I have seen the sludgy beach  
And the poisoned river  
I have met the lordly rich  
They're just getting stiffer  
This whole place is like a maze  
Or like some Medusa  
Let me out I can't accept  
A certain read life story  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running where the sorrow bless me  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a moose  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running to keep one chance open  
  
Marks on walls, the common outlet  
Tell the truth and always will  
Marks on wall destroy the thought  
Of perfect sunny civilization  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the grinning shadows  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a bear  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running to keep one chance open  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running cause I don't believe it  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the bare emotion  
Instinct keeps me running  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running  
I'm running, running, running, running

Needed you, you were only using  
Needing you just tore me down  
And here I stand in isolation  
Feeling emptiness and doubt  
Walking down the broken highway  
Sucking sugar plain and sweet  
Did your mother ever tell you  
That the joyful are free  
  
I need some lovin'  
Like an inmate needs a dime  
I need some lovin'  
Like a poet needs a rhyme  
Here I stand in isolation  
My empty hands in isolation  
Walking down the broken highway  
Sucking sugar cause it's my way  
  
Find me one heart to complete with  
Heading for the farthest reaches  
I need some lovin'  
Like a body needs a soul  
I need some lovin'  
Like a fastball needs control  
Here I stand in isolation  
My empty hands in isolation  
Strike up the band  
In this proud land  
  
Got a lot to do  
Got a lot to say  
Got a life to live  
Here I stand-  
In isolation

I found you looking for the rainbow  
You found me waiting for a chance  
Now we got something good together  
A life where we have joined our hands  
And there ain't nobody gonna break that  
Our love  
And there ain't nobody gonna break it  
Our love  
Our love  
  
I didn't have too much to offer  
You didn t have much to expect  
A cold hotel room full of trouble  
Beside a blinking traffic light  
On all night  
And there ain't nobody gonna break this  
It' s our love  
There ain't nobody gonna take it  
Not our love  
Nobody's gonna take this  
It 's our love  
Love  
  
I know the feeling of being outside  
Alone and watching all the fun  
The crowd's together, laughing loudly  
And long  
But that type, they re never really strong  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
An 'there ain't nobody gonna take it  
There ain't nobody who's gonna break it  
It's our love

He's got a great big hit he's in a limousine  
When I see his face somethin' starts to freeze  
He's got money for miles his girl comes out of vogue  
When he acts like an ass he's treated like a rogue  
  
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' it's boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
This isn 't for the first time in my life  
  
She comes from top cheekbones she never worried hard  
You could camp an army on her family's yard  
When I look at blue blood I want to make it mud  
And tear that difference down rock an' roll is how  
  
I feel it comin' it's breakin' my neck  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin' my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin breakin' my neck  
I feel lr comin' jealousy baby  
This isn 't for the first time in my life  
  
I feel it comin' it's flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' boilin my blood  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' flushin' my face  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' breakin' my neck  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
I feel it comin' heatin' my eyes  
I feel it comin' jealousy baby  
Jealousy baby

I woke up in the quiet dark  
Fed the cat and hit the park  
Cutest chicest chocolate queen  
Look and smiled right at me  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
  
She said "hi" without no sound  
Made my head go alright and 'round  
She was dressed to kill the pope  
And what she did she gave me hope  
I smiled back without no sound  
I said "hi" and left the ground  
Keep on believing, keep on believing, keep on believing  
  
Life won't leave me alone  
Trouble won't leave me alone  
Strength don't leave me alone  
Truth don't leave me alone  
  
She looked so bright in pixie hair  
She made me know how much I cared  
Her brown eyes gave me butterflies  
Sure towed my soul up to the sky  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
Keep on believing, keep on believing

You can change situations  
Go ahead and knock 'em down  
  
The world has its problems but I can't see how  
Knockin' 'em down in the city  
I want expression and I get it now  
Knockin' 'em down in the city  
And I don't care what your name is  
I'm only here to knock 'em down  
  
Are you ready  
Are you ready to knock 'em down

Fancy Apple lap top cost 5 grand  
Fresh girl in a T-shirt silll looks best  
Travel to a sunny quiet land  
Layin' on the beach I miss my pests  
Life's turning up the pressure  
  
It's makin' me aggressive  
The music sounds like dead ham  
The dj is a con man  
He's sayin'...  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do  
What can you do?  
  
One day I went out to buy a truck  
I found one that looked so huge and big  
Once I got that sucker on the road  
I was looking down at everything  
And I really liked that  
Everyone obeyed me  
I thought this is power  
Like that religious hour  
When the preacher says...  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do?  
  
Something from you Something from you  
Something from you Something from you  
  
Once the telephone starts ringing I stop thinking  
Sittin' at the TV I'm just blinking  
Go to the compuler and I'm punching  
What's this information that I'm munching  
The leader and the followers  
The rock star and the model  
The general and the perverts  
They're poking me where it hurts (ouch!)  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do?

Oh my my what have we done?  
Guess we had a little too much fun  
But what comes down, goes up again  
  
Don't you worry about me my friend  
I'll boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
I'll boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
The resist only made a mess of you  
You wrecked your car and you cracked your tooth  
Come and sing our sewer song  
Whether we get loud and we get strong  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
Ah, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Ah, boot and rally, boot and rally  
  
Brother my brother, my oldest friend  
Vull yourself back up again  
Don't you be no graveyard man  
Time to finish what you began  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally  
Boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally, boot and rally

Little doll I can't forget  
Smoking on a cigarette  
In my life a real queen  
Prettiest thing I ever seen  
Uh-huh  
You're the one who makes me sing  
Bring happiness and everything  
You're the only real one  
A real way to have some fun  
Uh- huh  
But I don't know you little doll  
I don't know you little doll  
Come on shake  
Come on shake  
Come on shake you little doll  
Shake you little doll  
Come on.... Shake  
Come on shake  
Shake you little doll

You didn't mean to do it  
But you did it again  
The night started out  
Fuckin' around with your friends  
Somebody screamed and thingd went bad  
Now you're standing accused  
And the prosectuor says you should be dead  
  
And they're fryin'up your hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up your hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up your hair  
In that little electric chair  
Fryin' up your hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair [Repeat: x3]  
  
Easy street is nice in a lawless nation  
The police puts some flyers in circulation  
Stuck one in my door with some scary mugshot  
They're looking for some bad boys  
Height, weight, age, race, tatoos too  
  
But they're fryin'up that hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up some hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up some hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up that hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair [Repeat: x3]  
  
The people are quietly lusting for blood  
They wanna live in peace but they don't wanna budge  
From their lazy ways and lazy notions  
If the other half's win  
Let' em eat pigeons  
And live in prison  
  
And they're fryin'up that hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up some hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up that hair  
In that little electric chair  
They'll be fryin'up some hair  
In that little electric chair  
  
Electric chair [Repeat: x4]

(feat. Sum 41)  
  
I'm the kid that no one knows,  
I live a life I never chose,  
But these thoughts in my mind,  
Are my own, my own  
  
I'm face to face with the unknown,  
My scary movie will be shown,  
I've got one evil mind,  
My own, my own  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
So...  
  
I'm a target although smart,  
They got amunition I got heart,  
I'm analyized and tagged,  
Before I start  
  
So tell me who can I respect,  
I feel the leash around my neck,  
As I find out the shame,  
In the game (in the game)  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
  
And I feel like I've crawled outside the box  
And I feel like I'm sleeping when I'm not  
  
[Chorus:]  
We take from one another,  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side,  
But nothing lasts forever,  
When stupid turnes to cleaver,  
Why are you surprised,  
Little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry, I understand  
You little know it all (litle know it all)  
Ten bucks in my hand,  
Little know it all (little know it all)  
Don't cry I understand,  
You'll never know it all

You're not giving an inch  
You're strung like wire  
Your open arms they flinch  
Joan Crawford style  
Treated like a towel  
Inside you howl  
  
On some dark concrete  
Midnight street  
You've built an altar  
That's quite complete  
Your self control  
Is damned amazing  
You're trying hard  
And I want you  
Little miss emperor  
  
You really want to grow  
And you're alert, I know  
But babies mostly drown  
It's a company town  
Cheat gods and joke  
Attack your noble ghost  
  
I saw the best minds  
Of my generation  
Learn how to crawl  
Across our nation  
Conformity falls  
Like one wet blanket  
Look how we live  
And I want you  
Little miss emperor  
Little miss emperor  
Trying to open doors

My mommy told me  
If I were goody  
That she would buy me  
A rubber dolly  
  
I got some energy to burn  
It makes me jumpy and nervous  
But I'm too damn old to join the military service  
Hup two three four  
I got to hit my baby on a Saturday night  
You know the devil made me do it  
I know it wasn't right  
  
Like a loco mosquito  
'Round and 'round and 'round I go  
And when I'm hungry  
Down I go  
  
Please Mr. Custer I don't want to go  
And spend my night in a bar with some stupid dodo  
I'm sick of hanging 'round with old transvestites  
They stare at my rubbers  
It makes me uptight  
  
And here I go  
In love again  
Here I go-oh wo wo  
Like a loco mosquito  
  
I got some energy to burn  
But you always want to tap it  
You're busy sucking on my gas tank  
Before I can tap it  
  
Like a loco mosquito  
'Round and 'round and 'round I go  
And when I'm hungry  
Down I go  
  
Loco Mosquito

Alone with the phone again  
The deepening light seeps in my mind  
I'm desperate to hear a voice  
Can this really be my choice?  
I'm fifty and I'm tricky  
And I'm sick of being alone  
You're twenty-five and pretty  
But you're old enough to know  
That actions form a pattern  
And the heart's the last to know  
And I'm waitin' for another friend  
Callin' long distance again  
  
My mind is an antique room  
There's overstuffed chairs and carpets too  
Where nobody ever comes  
It's a good place to run away from  
And I'm runnin' from a love  
With every step I take  
And if I can fall for you then  
From the last one I am saved  
And it's a cold grey wet December  
Shity shity day  
And I'm waitin' for another friend  
Calling long distance again  
  
You're dark and your French voice is lovely  
And you're bright eyes light the receiver across the miles  
I'm listening close and I'm hoping  
To learn love, but I don't know how  
Calling long distance again  
Calling long distance again  
I'm calling long distance again  
Calling long distance again

Now he was blond and she was dark  
They called him thunder 'cause he had the spark  
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure  
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure  
  
Look away look away  
  
They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots  
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots  
They live the dream and they went non-stop  
They did' ok 'til the band broke up  
  
Look away look away look away look away  
  
Unfortunately the needle broke  
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke  
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone  
She was selling something that I was on  
  
Look away look away  
  
Now thunder and me did not part friends  
What we did once I wouldn't do again  
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon  
'til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon  
  
Look away look away  
  
So a few years later thunder died broke  
Sable had a baby back at her folks  
Me I went straight and serious too  
There wasn't much else that I could do  
  
Look away look away  
  
So now that I'm straight I'm settled too  
I eat and I sleep and I work like you  
I got lots of feelings but I hold them down  
That's a way I cope with this shitty town  
  
Look away look away  
Look away look away

Now look out  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
I went down and baby you can tell  
I took a ride with the pretty music  
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell  
I'll stick it deep inside  
I'll stick it deep inside  
Cause I'm loose  
I feel fine to be dancin', baby  
I feel fine, I'm a shakin' leaf  
I feel fine to be dancin', baby  
Cause it's love, yeah I do believe  
I'll stick it deep inside  
I'll stick it deep inside  
Cause I'm loose  
And I'll stick it deep inside  
And I'll stick it hey  
Well I'm loose, well I'm loose  
Well I'm loose

I got my work  
I got my work  
The profit of doom is walking the beach  
With a psychotic breakdown cardboard sign  
Everything's faked and there's nothing to teach,  
And there's no point in running crying  
  
And I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
Evil  
  
I walk through the filthy sterile wasteland  
When I'm no good they'll dump me on a scrap heap to die  
Giant American tyrannosaur,  
Even the animals are running away.  
  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
L.o.s.t. lost  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
In a garden of evil  
Evil  
  
Evil baby  
I got my work  
Yeah  
I walk through the filthy sterile wasteland  
When I'm no good they'll dump me on a scrap heap to die  
Giant American tyrannosaur,  
Even the animals are running away  
  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost  
I'm l.o.s.t. lost

And now the news  
  
[Chorus:]  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go  
  
The communist world is fallin' apart  
The capitalists are just breakin' hearts  
Money is the reason to be  
It makes me just want to sing Louie Louie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A fine little girl is waitin' for me  
But I'm as bent as Dostoevsky  
I think about the meaning of my life again  
And I have to sing Louie Louie again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's give it to 'em right now  
Oh man, I dunno like, health insurance  
The homeless and world peace and aids and education  
I'm tryin' to do right  
  
But Hey  
Life after Bush and Gorbachev  
The wall is down but something is lost  
Turn on the news it looks like a movie  
It makes me want to sing Louie Louie  
  
Louie Louie  
Oh baby I gotta go, let's go

I don't want to throw away my time  
Playing games I don't respect or like  
I can't give away my sovereignty  
To existence with no song of me  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
I built myself a beautiful brick wall  
Gets a little higher every day  
? ignorance inhabits me  
Cause I've already chased my love away  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
Take that happy banner off the wall  
I don't need to see no smiling face  
All I really want's a cup of tea  
To feel a warmth inside of me  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low

Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine  
He's gonna do another striptease  
Hey man where'd you get  
That lotion? I been hurting  
Since I bought the gimmick  
About something called love  
Yeah something called love  
That's like hypnotizing chickens  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
With my torture film  
Drive a G.T.O.  
Wear a uniform  
All on a government loan  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the  
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains  
With the liquor and drugs  
With the liquor and drugs  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
Got a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
Oh a lust for life  
A lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine

Itching once you buy the gimmick  
About something called love

Yeah a lust for life  
I got a lust for life  
A lust for life  
Lust for life, lust for life

This whole country is scared of failure.  
My head keeps trying to sell me ambition.  
But in my heart, I want self-respect.  
There's a conflict.  
  
Boy, I feel so outgunned today  
But I'll get up and fight back, anyway  
You and I are not huge mainstream stars  
But unlike them, we're really what we are  
  
We got Main Street eyes  
Watchin' as the big boys roll by  
Under rotten television skies  
We got Main Street eyes  
  
I saw a kitten squashed in the street  
I read about a plastic surgeon and his art collection.  
  
We are played for suckers all the time  
Phony rock and roll  
It's a crime  
I don't want to dip myself in trash  
I don't want to give myself for cash  
  
We got Main Street eyes  
Tryin' to do what's decent with our lives  
Under funny television skies  
We got Main Street eyes  
  
Walkin' around sometimes  
I see a tension under the surface  
People are just about ready to explode.  
  
So hold me, and trust me  
I love you, don't worry.  
Keep your Main Street eyes [Repeat: x3]  
Eyes  
Eyes

Before you go  
Do me a favor  
Give me a number  
Of a girl almost like you  
With legs almost like you  
I'm buried deep in mass production  
You're not nothing new  
I like to drive along the freeways  
See the smokestacks belching  
Breasts turn bronw  
So warm and so brown  
  
Though I try to die  
You put me back on the line  
Oh damn it to hell  
Back on the line, hell  
Back on the line  
Again and again  
I'm back on the line  
Again and again  
And I see my face here  
And it's there in the mirror  
And it's up in the air  
And I'm down on the ground  
  
By the way  
I'm going for cigarettes  
And since you've gotta go  
Won't you do me that favor  
Won't you give me that number  
Won't you get me that girl  
Yeah, she's almost like you  
Yes, she's almost like you  
And I'm almost like him  
Yes, I'm almost like him  
Yes, I'm almost like him  
Yeah, I'm almost like him

Her skin is copper and her voice is Spanish red  
Her vibe is golden 'till her anger kills it dead  
She wants the world to see  
A body rich in harmony  
A mouth cruel as death  
  
She rides a fantasy she hasn't tested yet  
She looks in every mirror to check her silhouette  
The turning heads  
The honking horns  
Gave proof to her  
Since she was born  
That love is her game  
  
She loves me, Miss Argentina  
Though she hides behind her smile  
She runs free, Miss Argentina  
Dripping blood  
With lots of style  
  
She loves to stay in bed and watch the movies play  
She wants a husband who will worship and obey  
The moods that she enjoys like children's' games and football toys  
She laughs without shame  
  
She likes the military and the Rolling Stones  
Her little brother has a T-shirt from Ramones  
She's shy and sensitive and doesn't know the tougher games  
But boy can she love  
  
She's easy, Miss Argentina  
A masterpiece without a frame  
She runs free, Miss Argentina  
But Venus is a dangerous game  
  
She saves my spirit with a humanistic light  
She's greedy, lazy and impossible to like  
She dresses sexually  
And she's afraid of many things  
Like being alone  
  
She's back with mother now  
She's over twenty-five  
I tried to keep her, but she buried me alive  
In love and birth and jealousy  
And every emotion totally freed  
Screaming at once  
  
But she loves me, Miss Argentina  
While she hides behind her smile  
She runs free, Miss Argentina  
Dripping blood with lots of style  
She's lovely, Miss Argentina  
A masterpiece without a frame  
She's easy, Miss Argentina  
But Venus is a dangerous game

All across the continents  
Everywhere a soul is sent  
A new mix of the races is taking  
It's what Hitler didn't like  
And it makes a pretty sight  
Just look at what you see on your MTV  
  
Out on the edges they' re mixin' the colors  
Some they don' t like it but me I don' t mind  
In every city they' re mixing the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin', they 're mixin'  
  
On the edges of the line  
There's a different kind of kind  
No one seems to claim for  
The race war games  
'cause you don t have to choose sides  
It just crucifies your mind  
There's a hundred million ways  
To live your life for yourself  
'  
Out on the edges they re mixin' the colors  
Some they don 't like it but me I don' t mind  
In every city they 're mixin' the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
  
I like the kids with the ways of their own  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin' the colors  
  
Now a language that sounds new  
Comes a-driftin' next to you  
And the music that you hear ls changin' too  
'cause they 're mixin' the colors  
Baby the colors

Pop  
  
Five little monsters were riding through space  
Their spaceship broke and they fell into this place  
They gotta get out but they don't know how

But the ones who move in this house are gonna go boony

Who's gonna tell you goodnight?  
Who's gonna put out the light?  
I love you and love is almost crazy  
Slippin' through the so and so's  
Over all the fields we go  
Moonlight lady  
  
Don't wanna tell you so long  
Don't wanna mess up your song  
Feelin' like I do I'm almost crazy  
Choosin' all the red blue jeans  
Watchin' people be so mean  
Moonlight lady  
  
I'm on fire  
And I can hardly breathe  
Time goes by  
And all alone  
My poor heart grieves  
  
I love you just 'cause I do  
I didn't plan it with you  
But now we're here we might as well accept it  
We're together for all time  
Marching through the fields of dimes  
Moonlight lady

I met a little girl  
With a heart of stone  
She said she wanna give me  
An instant bone  
  
I took her for a ride  
In my classic car  
We didn't even stop  
At a whiskey bar  
  
Her titties look hard  
And her booty's got a rise  
Soon my hands will be  
Where I'm putting my eyes  
  
Steady energy and ??? urgency  
We got out of the car  
Now here we are  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
I guess we're living in sin  
  
She's got three kids and a husband at home  
He doesn't have a clue how to make her groan  
I'm waiting in the room gonna do it like hell  
Come on baby, come on baby ring my bell  
  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
I guess we're living in sin  
  
There's gonna be a war  
So we gotta be quick  
The place is full of desperate, horny  
Chicks and dicks  
The ex-president is in number six  
I hard can hardly wait to get my licks  
  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
Baby we're living in sin  
  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
At the motor inn  
Baby we're living in sin  
  
Baby do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna  
I wanna  
Baby are you gonna, are you gonna, are you gonna  
I'm gonna  
Baby do you got it, do you got it, do you got it  
I got it  
Oh, I fucking know you got it, oh, I fucking know you got it  
Girl I know you got it, baby, yeah you got it  
I got it  
Yeah I know you got it, baby yeah you got it  
Well I got a ??? he look so fine  
I got a ??? whose titties are mine  
Great big titties  
Titties  
Big brown titties  
I love those titties, I love those titties  
You love'em  
Tittittitittittititititites...  
At the motor in  
Motor in  
Motor in  
I guess we're living in sin  
  
Let's motor  
All right, let's fucking motor  
You wanna motor  
I take you to the motor in  
Taking me to the fucking motor in  
At the motor in  
At the motor in  
At the motor in  
Motor in  
At the motor in  
Motor in  
Motor in  
Motor in

I saw her in a dream but it wasn't true  
Through the smoke and fire  
Of the exhaust fumes  
She just laughed and loved me 'till I was no use  
And I'll never fall in love again  
She's a motorcycle that I can't ride  
She's a precious jewel that I can't buy  
She's a scene I'm playin' in which I die  
And I'll never fall in love again  
"I never play to win"  
Is what she said  
And poured a little cocaine in my head  
She's a fuckin' Picasso in bed  
And I'll never fall in love again  
  
Now your voice  
So Spanish and clear  
Rings like a church bell in my ear  
But I don't believe in a word I hear  
And I'll never fall in love again  
My mind calls you in the night  
My mind calls you and I want to take flight  
To some other garden of sweet delight  
And I'll never fall in love again

I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back  
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks  
The life on display is trouble for sure  
The drugs that I took have made me impure  
  
The neon forest is lighting up  
The neon forest is lighting up  
My brain  
  
I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting  
My mouth  
A fury in my gut is spinning me round  
And round  
To be a total phony is the winning design  
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine  
  
The neon forest is my home  
And like a cartoon cat I roam  
Where only kids are still alive  
And anyway they're gonna fry  
My brain  
  
You can get a weird prize for being adored  
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore  
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence  
America takes drugs in psychic defense  
You can say what you want but nobody's there  
Have you got any money?  
Are you anybody?

I've never known a girl like you before  
Now just like in a song from days of yore  
Here you come a knockin', knockin' on my door  
And I've never met a girl like you before  
  
You give me just a taste so I want more  
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw  
Cos you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor  
And I've never met a girl like you before  
  
You've made me acknowledge the devil in me  
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically  
Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically  
Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel  
And I've never known a girl like you before  
Never, never, never, never  
Never known a girl like you before  
  
This old town's changed so much  
Don't feel like I belong  
Too many protest singers  
Not enough protest songs  
And now you've come along  
Yes you've come along  
And I've never met a girl like you before...

I'm healthy as a horse  
But everything is spinnin'  
And if I use a gun I'm sure to go to prison  
I'm stubborn as a mule  
And nobody breaks my rules  
But nothin' comes my way.  
  
I've got a hard-ass pair of shoulders  
I've got a love you can't imagine  
Yeah, and what I got I double  
I swear I'm keepin' out of trouble.  
  
I'm lookin' for one new value  
I'm lookin' for one new value  
But nothing comes my way.  
  
We live in the same world  
  
But nothin' comes my way.

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing  
We're what's happening  
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing  
We're an ice machine  
We see people brand new people  
They're something to see  
When we're nightclubbing  
Bright-white clubbing  
Oh isn't it wild?  
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing  
We're walking through town  
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing  
We walk like a ghost  
We learn dances brand new dances  
Like the nuclear bomb  
When we're nightclubbing  
Bright white clubbing  
Oh isn't it wild . . .  

No fun my babe no fun  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun to hang around  
Feeling that same old way  
No fun to hang around  
Freaked out for another day  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun to be around  
Walking by myself  
No fun to be alone  
In love with nobody else  
Well maybe go out maybe stay home  
Maybe call mom on the telephone  
Well come on, well come on,  
Well come on..........

She's not right  
I want somehing I want something tonight  
I want something  
I want something, all right  
But she can't help because she's not righ  
No, no, no, no,  
It's always, it's always this way  
  
I'm not right  
She wants something she wants something tonight  
She wants something  
She wants something, all right  
But I can't help because I'm not right  
No, no, no, no,  
It's always, it's always this way

Lovely games of yesterday  
Have left me with my soul today  
Felicity flies out the door  
When people lose their warmth  
That's a very ordinary bummer  
I'll hold out for summer days  
  
Stand and laugh and run  
In a quiet movie of mine  
I saw a girl with eyes like fire  
I had to look away  
She was swearing like a sailor  
And demanding her own way  
That was when I knew I had to love her  
  
I opened up my sad old eyes  
And let the feelings run  
With a quiet beauty of mine  
Maybe sometimes we do bad things  
And then other times we do good  
And sometimes from something very bad  
Comes something very good  
In a quiet year of mine

Sally goes 'round the roses  
Every night  
Trying to find a warm place  
To spend the night  
She becomes a target  
Soon as she rise  
Somebody wants to cut her  
Down to his size  
  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
The feeling's in my bones  
It won't leave me alone  
  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
  
Jimmy goes round the dumpsters every day  
Trying to find a way to  
Some kind of way  
He knows he's a target  
Everyone is  
Strangle that rock and roll star  
Make him eat jizz  
  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
It's a sad bad feeling  
The feeling's in my bones  
It won't leave me alone  
  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head  
I'm going out, out of my head, I'm going out, outta my head

Penetration  
Penetrate me, penetrate me  
I'm so fine so fine so fine  
I get excited, I get excited  
I'm alone, I'm so fine, pull a line  
  
Every night outta town, every night outta town  
I go now, go now, I pulsate  
I'll be all fine, I'll be all fine, man  
I'll take away, take away, be alright  
  
[gibberish]  
  
Penetration  
Come and take me, come and take me  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
I'll stick it out, babe, I'll stick it out  
I'll be all fine, every time, penetrate  
  
Penetration

Say Ta  
Eisenhower saw the thing  
He said this is sickening  
I swear I saw the very thing  
I saw it in America  
  
Let's play safe  
I never knew how  
How to play safe  
You told me how  
how to play safe  
A thousand times  
  
I don't believe in fairies any more  
  
Today I saw a very very thing  
But that's another song  
You're too simple minded  
Let's play it safe  
  
What do we have in common?  
Play it safe  
What do we have in common?  
Play it safe  
  
I want to be a criminal  
Play it safe

I have a private hell  
Of excellent quality  
I've dwelt there for years  
Playing with my fears  
  
It's tastefull, luxurious,  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell  
  
Anger and greed brew  
And then they stamped  
Till I can transmute  
Them into more loot  
  
It's tasteful, luxurious,  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell

Dance to the beat  
Of the living dead  
Lose sleep baby  
And stay away from bed  
Raw power is sure to come  
A runnin' to you  
If you're alone  
And you got the shakes  
So am I baby  
And I got what it takes  
Raw power will surely come  
Running to you  
Raw power got a healin' hand  
Raw power can destroy a man  
Raw power is more than soul  
It's got a son called rock and roll  
Raw power honey just won't quit  
Raw power I can feel it  
Raw power baby can't be beat  
Poppin' eyes and flashin' feet  
Everybody's always tryin to tell me  
What to do  
Don't you try  
Don 't you try to tell me what to do  
Look in the eye  
Of the savage girl  
Fall deep in love  
In the underworld  
Raw power is sure to come  
Runnin' to you  
If you're alone  
And you got the fear  
So am I baby  
Let's move on out of here  
Raw power is sure to come  
A runnin' to you  
Raw power got a magic touch  
Raw power is much too much  
Happiness is guaranteed  
It was made for you and me  
Raw power honey just won't quit  
Raw power I can feel it  
Raw power honey can't be beat  
Get down and kiss my feet  
Raw power's got no place to go  
Raw power honey it don't want to know  
Raw power is a guaranteed OD  
Raw power is laughin' at you and me  
And this is what I want to know  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
Raw power  
Can you feel it?

I was riding on a concrete slab  
Down a river of a useless land  
It was such a beautiful day  
I heard a witch doctor say  
Ill turn you into a toadstool  
  
I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
A muscle twitch, an auto it swerves  
You want to speak you lose your nerve  
Infinity throws you a curve  
Dumps you in shit you don't deserve  
  
As life roars by you in a blur  
Leaves you murmuring a dirty word  
  
A page out of a comic book  
A chicken hanging on a hook  
A reverie, a babbling brook  
A sermonette, a TV. cook  
  
Shaking my hand at your fake head  
A suicide, a certain look  
  
A microphone, a blues guitar  
Piques a feeling near and far  
Stupidity a mental scar  
Cruel cruelty, oh cruelty  
Harboring no inspiration  
An alcoholic at the bar  
Every insult goes to far  
  
I was pissing on the desert sands,  
When the desert whispered to me,  
It said, isn't this a shame?  
Things will never be the same...  
I've learned this gets me so edgy  
  
Now I'm looking for the joke with a microscope  
  
I was a teenaged dinosaur  
Stoned and obsolete  
I didn't get fucked and I didn't get kissed  
I got so fucking pissed  
  
Using my head for an ashtray  
  
Now I tell you who I am  
I'm a repo man  
And I'm looking for the joke  
Yeah I'm looking for the joke  
I'm looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke  
Looking for the joke with a microscope  
I been looking for the repo repo repo repo man  
Looking for the repo repo repo repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man  
Looking for the repo man...

Born in a corporate dungeon  
Where people are cheated of life  
I knew I could never stay home, No  
  
As you lie in the dark  
With your pink dress on  
You look risky, Lovely, Risky, Lovely  
  
Child of the whispering skies  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
You make me feel, that this heart is real  
When you hold me, love me, hold me, love me  
  
Girl with the scream in her eyes  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
People fall apart all the time  
I've been hit enough to know why  
Climb to this point, move on  
Climb to this point, move on  
Career, career, acquire, acquire  
But what is life without a heart  
There's standing room only  
Somebody better tell the truth  
Proceed at your own risk  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
Why feel so sad  
Let your heart be glad  
Love is risky, lovely, risky, lovely  
  
Child of the whispering skies  
  
Born in a corporate dungeon  
Where people are cheated of life  
I knew I could never stay home  
  
Risky love, Risky love, Risky love, Sweet love  
Risky love, Risky love, Give me love, Sweet love, Risky love, Risky love

pinch history  
feel the pinch blistering  
pinch me in dreams  
cause im still not listening  
x marks the spot  
on your calender days  
a beard half eaten  
smiled  
crawling with legs  
temper tampered temperature  
  
manuscript replica  
  
in infrared is how we saw  
the night that lit up  
scarecrow plots  
the nerve that pinches  
crippled hobbled  
frolicked flat on its own face  
  
jigsaw pattern  
dominoes left a trail  
the whites of their eyes  
polaroids tell the fate  
for our amusement  
we bring stares to the defendants  
mechanical panaceas  
absolved by history  
phonetic paralysis  
inflicted through morality  
the seed that it nurtured  
was a wilted bouquet  
temper tampered temperatures  
  
squirming through cuts  
in a throat

Big dick is a thumbs-up guy  
He shot a missile in the sky  
It functioned just as advertised  
Until the fire made him cry  
Look into it later  
  
When the dust is clearing off the crater  
Run like a villain let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Run like a villain cause you can't adjust  
To a saccharine suburb in the mush  
I've got some loving arms around me  
Darker than the tombs of Egypt,  
Dumber than the crudest fiction,  
Buried in a melting coffin  
Nights like this appeal to me!  
  
Tracy got an afghan, pedigreed,  
Prescription shades and designer jeans  
A sony walkman on her head  
All she wants is to be fed  
Run, run, run, cause you're soft  
Run, run, but don't get lost  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
  
I've got some loving arms around me  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
I've got some loving arms around me  
Trying to steal a moment of pleasantry  
In this zombie birdhouse  
  
Run, run, run run like a villain  
Let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to save your soul  
It can't be done I already know  
So I run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Cause who you are nobody knows  
Who you are nobody knows  
Rings on your fingers  
And bells on your toes

If The savior came again today,  
Would you like him or turn him away,  
Would he have a girlfriend with a thong,  
Or a boy group singing dumb ass songs.  
Would he be a rapper with a gun,  
Or a bugger building steel buns.  
If the savior was crucified to lose  
What's the difference?  
  
Get me outta here [Repeat: x4]  
  
Watch me walk on water  
Watch me walk on water  
Watch me walk on water  
Before they  
Put me in a box  
  
We Should have never  
Gotten another break,  
Praying is an art for it's own sake,  
Would he have a pair of Gucci shoes  
With a pitbull  
  
Get me outta here [Repeat: x4]  
  
Watch me walk on water  
Watch me walk away on water  
Watch me walk on water  
  
Get me outta here [Repeat: x7]  
  
Watch me walk on water  
Watch me walk away on water  
Watch me walk on water

Do you remember when we met  
That's the day I knew you were my pet  
I wanna tell you  
How much I love you  
Come with me  
  
My love To the sea  
The sea of love  
I wanna tell you  
Just how much I love you  
Come with me To the sea Of love  
Do you remember when we met  
  
Oh that's the day I knew you were my pet  
I wanna tell you Oh how much I love you  
Come with me To the sea Of love  
Come with me My love To the sea  
The sea of love  
I wanna tell you Just how much I love you  
I wanna tell you Oh how much I love you

I'm a street walking cheetah  
With a heart full of napalm  
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb  
I am the world's forgotten boy  
The one who searches and destroys  
  
Honey gotta help me please  
Somebody gotta save my soul  
Baby, detonate for me  
  
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology!  
Ain't got time to make no apology  
Soul radiation in the dead of night  
Love in the middle of a fire fight  
  
Honey gotta strike me blind  
Somebody gotta save my soul  
Baby, penetrate my mind  
  
And I'm the world's forgotten boy  
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy  
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy  
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy  
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy  
Forgotten boy said  
Hey forgotten boy

You gave me a present  
The paper was blue and green  
I unwrapped it with pleasure  
These are the best shades I've ever seen  
You can be my girlfriend  
Forever and a day  
I never thought I was worth much  
Or that anyone would treat me this way  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not  
The kind of guy  
Who dresses like a king  
And a really fine pair of shades  
Means everything  
And the light that blinds my eyes  
Shines from you  
It makes me come in the night  
It makes me swim with delight  
I like this pain  
I like this mirror  
I like these shades  
  
I could have had a problem  
I might have never followed through  
The other guys are in trouble  
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you  
These shades say something  
I'll bet they cost a lot  
I hope I don't break 'em  
I hope we don't break up  
  
[Chorus]

Hey little girl  
You're black and blue  
Hey little girl  
You're six foot two  
I know a man who loved too hard  
He lost his mind it wasn't hard  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love  
  
Cute little knees that you got  
Out in the dark parking lot  
Cute little voice whispering  
I know a man lost everything  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
  
This sickness of love  
This sickness is hauntin' me  
Till I cannot see  
This sickness is what I am  
I greet it like a friend  
Amen  
  
Hey little girl  
I'm almost trough  
Hey little girl  
I'm almost you  
Hey little girl  
The river runs  
Hey little girl  
The rising sun  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love  
  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
Over this sickness  
This sickness of love

Calling Sister Midnight  
You've got me reaching for the moon  
Calling Sister Midnight  
You've got me playing the fool  
Calling Sister Midnight  
Calling Sister Midnight  
Can you hear me call  
Can you hear me well  
Can you hear me at all  
Calling Sister Midnight  
I'm an Idiot for you  
Calling Sister Midnight  
I'm a breakage inside  
Calling Sister Midnight  
Calling Sister Midnight  
You know I had a dream last night  
Mother was in my bed  
And I made love to her  
Father he gunned for me  
Hunted me with his six gun  
Calling Sister Midnight  
What can I do about my dreams  
Listen to me Sister Midnight  
You've got me walking in rags  
Calling Sister Midnight  
You put a beggar in my heart  
Hey where are you Sister Midnight  
Can you hear me call  
Can you hear me well  
Can you hear me at all

Sweet 16 in leather boots  
Body and soul,  
I go crazy  
Baby, baby I'm a hungry,  
sweet 16  
  
Funky bar all full of faces  
Pretty faces, beautiful faces  
Body and soul, body and soul I give to you  
I am an easy mark with my broken heart  
Sweet 16  
  
Show you my explosion, sweet 16  
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt, crying inside  
'Cause everybody's so fine  
And they don't need me.  
  
Tell me what can I do, sweet 16  
I give you my body and soul sweet 16  
I must be hungry 'cause I go crazy  
Over your leather boots  
Now baby I know  
  
That's not normal  
But I love you,  
I love you  
I love you, sweet 16  
(Everywhere I go, I love it!)

Sometimes I don't even move a muscle  
Baby while you lie awake all night  
I think I've got 9 lives in these corpuscles  
Girl, you know sometimes I don't think right  
  
I hear voices in the hall  
I wake up and it's nothing at all  
A hungry wolf-an angry child  
Or something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
  
It's not as if we could think that things  
Was one way  
Or they would all just be that way right now  
When I was a kid I thought that some day  
I could tame this lion heart some  
Way, some how  
  
Now I'm hungry for the love  
That doesn't know what it's thinking of  
Searching for the meek and mild  
Like something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
Something wild  
  
There's a hole where the wind blows through  
And some curtains too  
But I can't hide a thing from you-  
You know where I'm comin' from  
Well I tried gettin' there under my own steam  
But my very last chance was shot  
Now you're ridin' me down like a submarine  
I can feel you in my veins, runnin' hot  
I went out and stole a new pair of shoes  
Some pocket money and a place to go  
Now we gotta get up and scream at the  
Top of our lungs like it was gonna die  
If we didn't make it so  
I hear voices in the hall  
I wake up and it's nothing at all  
A hungry wolf-an angry child  
Something wild

You can kick me out of a real good jive  
You can use my friendship like a doorknob  
You can make me super Styrofoam  
You can make me feel all alone  
You can stuff hamburger in my head  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can tempt me with a pretty girl  
You can call on me in fancy fur  
You can say, "Just do it, everyone is"  
You can tell me that it's just showbiz  
You can turn my life from green to red  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can burn my bridges down for laughin', ha ha ha ha  
You can call me a fool for crashin', woh  
You can make me stare down at the floor  
You can make me listen while you snore  
You can do all these things that I have said  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
Let's go!  
  
You can make my position low as a dog  
You can trick me with your social fog  
You can criticize my very bag  
You can call my treasures a heap of slag  
But you might as well eat lunch instead  
Cause I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no  
I ain't gonna be no

Stars in the sky  
I like them better than you  
Stars in the sky  
They tell me what to do  
I don't care about your city  
Or your fat income  
I don't care about your Vanity Fair  
Or your fucking sitcom  
  
Starry night  
Starry night  
That starry night  
  
Makes me feel alright  
I heard a lotta mean talkin'  
I met a lotta tough guys-they all look  
Pretty ugly under the stars  
Go out to the desert  
And just look up  
You can feel yourself  
Under the stars  
All man's buildings  
Will soon be gone  
'Cause something here  
Is absolutely wrong  
  
Starry night  
Starry night  
That starry night  
  
Makes me feel alright  
Like a human being  
Take your building and your income and  
Shove it up your ass  
Take your building and your income and stuff  
It with your cash  
I heard a lotta big talk-met a lotta tough guys  
That shit looks ugly under a starry night  
Which country is the strongest?  
Who plays the best guitar?  
Who fucking cares  
Under the stars

I need a strong girl  
Cause war's where I'm going  
I need a war girl  
Who wants to show 'em  
  
Good people want to be  
Really what they are  
But if you try, you will fry  
Plenty before catching fire  
  
I need a strong girl  
Who works on tension  
I need a gendarme  
Cause I'm after ascension  
  
When the guns raise, hit my back  
On a naked day  
I know I will testify  
No matter what I have to say  
  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Strong girl, she's like a ocean  
  
I need an eagle  
To be my scanner  
Cause a liar  
Can look like a winner  
  
All the animals  
Are running with the pack  
I'm outside, tell you why  
I don't wanna fight 'em back  
  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Yeah  
  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
Strong girl, she's like an ocean  
  
Strong girl, strong girl

I'm sitting in the supermarket  
On the disposable shelf  
I'm kinda like a sandwich  
I kinda need some help  
Most people they pass me up  
Some stop and buy  
But when they take me home  
They never look in my eye  
  
The supermarket shelf is a lie  
I know, we saw  
The guy from the record company  
Makes me wanna die  
  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who don't like that get blood in the eye  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who don't like that get blood,  
Get blood in the eye  
  
I'm proud of the corporate logo  
Written on my box  
It says that I'm ok  
For the company stock  
What I am I do not own  
I don't know who does  
Maybe any, some institution  
With no flesh, flesh or blood  
  
The supermarket shelf is a lie  
I know, we saw  
The guy from the record company  
Makes me wanna die  
  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who don't like that get blood in the eye  
Everybody sells and everybody buys  
People who don't like that get blood,

I've been working a long long time  
Now I'm caught in a wicked bind  
You offered love but I threw that out  
I couldn't hear you I was too busy shouting  
  
Like a laughing hyena run out of breath  
I shot my rocks off 'til there's nothing left  
It's an old old story I suppose  
A heavy price for a heavy pose  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
Somebody should  
I'm pretty good  
  
International garbage man  
I've decided that's what I am  
I need somebody to pull me out  
I'm sinking like trazy in my sauerkraut  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
I've done my best  
Now you do the rest  
  
little boy take out your toys  
Lay them on the table  
Benwa balls and bugs that crawl  
I can't enjoy them without love  
Still I've been known to run around  
  
Take care of me  
But beware of me  
Sometimes I'm a snake  
Just aher the take  
  
Take care of me  
Take care of me  
I've done my best  
Take care of me  
Now you do the rest  
Take care of me  
I'll never forget  
Take care of me

Look what you have done,  
Ruined every single one.  
See what fools they are,  
Jealous of a simple star.  
  
Feel the 4 winds blow,  
Let the sword hang low (baby)  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
To tell the sucking truth,  
Everybody's dreams get used.  
  
Twist me till I drip,  
Liquid of emotions ripped.  
  
Every hungry soul,  
Hides a hungry fool (baby)  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Life's to take,  
Says the talking snake,

Says the talking snake,  
Everybody should be happy  
Should be happy

What must I do to take a holiday  
Show me a bill that they can make me pay  
Tell me a story  
And maybe I'll believe it  
  
Me I'm just a lucky guy  
Young and free  
Too hard to cry

She's good looking and a married girl so  
Tell me a story

Young and hard  
Too tough to cry  
  
Standing in a show

They're shining down on me  
And I like, I like it  
Just like I like I like it  
I'm taking like I find it  
  
What did they do to chill the joy away  
What did they do to say you had to pay  
And pay  
And pay  
Tell me stories  
You know I never can believe them  
Never ever

Well gather round people  
And listen to this  
I am a hermit of burial ridge  
Once I was shaven and worked every day  
But the call of the wild just lured me away  
Singing hi hi ho it's a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
Hi hi ho it's a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
  
There's pals at my table and mud on the floor  
There's bears in the area and wolves at the door  
Their singing a song about cookie McBride  
Who goes out a-trapping and then tails their hide  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to a rain filled grave  
So if you're planning a natural trip  
Don't call up snooping on burial ridge  
The searchers will come and discover your hide  
High, wet and hanging like cookie McBride  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On your way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
Who will remember the money you saved?  
I'm in over your head  
You're in over your head

I never saw you before  
I never sound strained before  
Now I'm at your door  
And I hope you're unusual  
Very unusual  
  
Now I'm at your door  
And when you nicely ask me in  
I'm staring at your shoes  
And I don't wonder why  
I feel like a horse  
We can stray out on the open range  
Missing me every day with its hidden claws  
Spring snow  
  
And when you brush me  
Brush me with your eyes  
I think you've noticed that  
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore  
I never saw you before  
But you're unusual  
And now I'm at your door  
  
I feel safe and warm  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
Like a horse  
Ha ha ha ha  
What's this?

I was gently raised  
Fussed over r in school  
Fed and housed and entertained  
Wanting to be cool  
Summers in the grass  
Winters warm and slow  
Until the one thing on my mind was to just  
Get up and go  
  
We're the undefeated  
We got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
  
There's a real mean world outside  
Where many lives are lost  
But struggle builds character  
And we are growing soft  
I don't want to sit and watch no TV show  
I want to roam and be challenged  
I want to grow and grow  
  
We're the undefeated  
We got what they want  
We're so fucking spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
What have we made?  
A giant jail  
A bunch of walls  
That's all that we've made  
Oh, my  
  
We're the undefeated we got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated we got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
  
We're the undefeated  
Always undefeated  
We're the undefeated  
We're the undefeated,  
Now

Hey little one  
You've got the way  
I ain't doing nothin'  
That's so important  
  
I'd like to know how you deal  
Oh when I worry to darken  
If I can't get in your show  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
While you were mine  
I got so hazy  
While you passed by  
I found my answer  
  
Is this the best thing in life  
The only thing I remember  
If I can't get in your show  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
  
Pure love, sunshine  
Our love is always fine  
We are related, you know  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
We are related, you know  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
The sky is angry  
Over this city  
Birds fly like devils  
Over this city  
  
So many things of no worth  
Are being shoved in my face  
When all the wealth in the world  
May work the faith in one girl  
  
That's why I'm sad to say  
Till there can be no hate, oh  
The only one they come through  
Is absolute  
You

I saw my baby  
She was turning blue  
I knew that soon  
Her young life was through  
And so I got down on my knees  
Down by her bed  
And these are the words  
To her I said  
Everything will be alright tonight  
Everything will be alright tonight  
No one moves  
No one talks  
No one thinks  
No one walks tonight  
Tonight  
Everyone will be alright tonight  
Everyone will be alright tonight  
No one moves  
No one talks  
No one thinks  
No one walks tonight  
Tonight  
I am gonna love you till the end  
I will love you till I reach the end  
I will love you till I die  
I will see you in the sky  
Tonight

Psst, psst, hey girl  
Just come here, come on, come here  
  
I love your hair  
Your pearly smile  
Your icing scan  
Society's vile  
Insect cars  
Horny men from Mars  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
  
You've know the score  
For a while now  
Your dad don't care  
Your mom's aware  
Your hands are new  
I wonder what they'll do  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
  
There's chaos in the old suburbs  
And downtown too they got the blues  
But you'll survive  
With a hard glint in your eyes  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you, tuff baby  
I love you  
I love you, tuff baby [Repeat: x3]

Ugly  
  
Ugly!  
  
See'mon! Yeah! hey! all right  
You got an ugly ass guy,  
He got a problem with his dick.  
You got a song with no soul,  
Fucking don't mean a thing.  
He got an ugly bouzy house,  
He got a girlfriend on T.V,  
That girl's something,  
He can't sing for shit.  
  
And I'm trying to be a person,  
But they all say I'm worthless.  
I'm trying to be a person,  
But they all make me nervous.  
  
This is my description of an ugliness. [Repeat: x4]  
Ugliness  
Ugliness  
Ugliness  
  
You got a dog face chic,  
With basketball tit's.  
Porno sucks,  
That's the truth of it.  
You got a bunch of dumb fat guys,  
In a wrestling uniform,  
Trying to fake they're playing music,  
They ought to be killed.  
And I'm trying to be a person,  
But they all say I'm worthless.  
I'm trying to be a person,  
But they all say I'm worthless.  
  
This is my description of an ugliness. [Repeat: x5]

They got the chics,  
The money cars and all, but they ain't got no motherfuckin' balls.  
They got the chics,  
The money cars and all, but they ain't got no motherfuckin' balls.  
They got a fungus on their dick,  
They got bald heads and tupees,  
They're in total control,  
Total fucking control,  
They're even parked in my space.  
You got a song with no soul,  
No truth no love.  
  
Because the music sucks,  
That's why little kids blow up.  
Everybody needs a gun,  
To express feelings,  
That should be expressed by a real musician  
And I'm trying to be a person,  
But they all say I'm worthless.

I'm a Very Important Person  
I park in the V.I.P  
And when I go to the bathroom,  
I go in the V.I.P toilet  
And when I wanna change a light bulb,  
I don't do it myself  
I have a technician  
Cause I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
I'm a V.I.P  
Now, as I began to become a V.I.P,  
I forgot what I've become a V.I.P for  
I began to grow accustomed to people saying  
"Right this way sir, drinks are on the house"  
Flight attendants on airplanes saying  
  
"Please, really, I don't wanna bother you sir, but it's such a pleasure to
have you on board.  
May I have your autograph for my daughter?"  
"Yeah baby right after I go to the toilet  
I I'll give you a couple of 'em  
Cause I'm a V.I.P!"  
  
Now,one thing about V.I.P is,is they never seem to be alone  
Oh no !  
The "true" V.I.P must travel with an entourage !  
People who say "Right on boss"  
Cause it's a V.I.P!  
Right on boss  
I'm a V.I.P!  
As I began to realize that I had gained V.I.P status,  
Worries began to creep in  
What if one day,I woke up,and I was no longer a V.I.P?  
No more good tables at the restaurants,  
No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets,  
No more top notch booty  
No more entourage to say "Right boss"  
I began to have nightmares  
And in my nightmares, I was just a fucking nobody.  
Laying at the beach, imagining myself being a VIP!  
Just like I was before,  
Hearing the applause in my head  
Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender  
  
V.I.P  
V.I.P  
  
Of course, when one becomes a V.I.P,  
One meets other V.I.Ps  
At social occasions,  
And one inevitably thinks,  
"thick! How shallow and crass these people are!  
They're not down to earth and real like me,  
Oh no! I'm a very special V.I.P"  
  
Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood,  
Is the "V.I.P reflection effect", during which anyone associated with the
V.I.P,  
Becomes a sort of V.I.P in their own right! Such as "son OF the V.I.P",  
"Guitar player FOR the V.I.P",  
"Girlfriend WITH the V.I.P",  
"Accountants of the V.I.P"  
The maid, the dog, the music publisher, huh!  
All enjoy a sort of 'reflected glory', as in  
  
"Hi this is Nastea  
I work for Iggy  
And I'd like 6 tables tonight in the V.I.P section  
And he needs passes for everyone  
And free drinks of course  
In the V.I.P area"  
Right on boss  
Cause I'm a V.I.P.  
It's also true that when one is a V.I.P, everybody's happy to see you, all the
time!  
And there's an implicit rule that a V.I.P must never, never  
Be on a barn.  
Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day  
And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood.  
They will "thck!tchk!tchk ! mur mur mur mur mur!",  
And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention:  
A "difficult" V.I.P.  
Psychologists tell us that a sense of self-esteem  
Is so necessary in today's world.  
As a V.I.P, I can guarantee you, you'll never be alone.  
You'll never be alone.  
Cause you're a V.I.P!

Watching the news  
The plot you already know  
Don't have anything  
They don't belong to anywhere  
Imagining things to be perfectly white  
Who are these people?  
They don't belong  
Where's the u.s. navy?  
  
I like the action  
Money money  
Food here  
Woman woman  
Fight here  
Approval approval  
Frown frown  
Approval  
My daughter's not some damn hamburger chainsaw  
In a parking lot  
She trips  
Quick quick  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
She carries that television on her back  
As I watch the news  
That's the russians  
Carry the television  
Money money  
Carry the television  
Food here  
Fuck here  
Fuck here  
Fight here  
Get out  
Approval  
You don't count

So good crying  
I want to be on  
The news  
  
I want to be known  
I want to be known  
I want to be on  
I want to be known  
Come on everybody knows that everybody's watching the news  
  
Watching? watching?  
It's something about crime, crime, crime  
I like to watch  
But I like to  
What do you want?  
What do you want?  
What do you want?  
Legs rush, legs rush, legs rush, legs  
Scary, scary, damn scary  
Come all ye faithful ye joyful triumphant

One night out in l.a.  
I met a Mexicana  
With a butchy girlfriend  
Who I thought was a man  
They took me to the alley  
To have a little chat  
People lined the corner  
Doin' this and that  
In wild America  
  
Now I 'm in a black car  
With my Mexicana  
She's got methedrine but  
I want marijuana  
I don 't want to drive home  
Not in my condition  
So I ask my friend Matt  
To handle the ignition  
In wild America  
Exterminate the brutes  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Well I mean I like it here...do you have anything you' d like to say to
America?  
I'd just like to say at this point that I' m 24 hour, 7 day a week, 365 day a
year American)  
  
I was glad that Debbie  
Had a sense of humor  
This time of the morning  
I tend to get gloomy  
She laughed and said "iggy,  
You have got a biggy!"  
I had no reply  
So I just closed my eyes  
In wild America  
Exterminate the brutes  
They're goin' wild  
Goin' wild  
They' re goin' wild  
They' re goin' wild baby  
They got all kinds of fuckin' stuff  
They got everything you could imagine  
They' re so god dammed spoiled  
They' re poisoned inside  
They Judge a man by what he's got  
And they wanta have more and more  
More power, more freedom  
Taller kids, longer lives  
Everything, bigger houses, slaves, whoa
