(Lainie Marsh)  
I hear the clock a tickin'  
See the sweat upon my brow  
I know my destination  
Nothing's gonna stop me now  
I'm running on desire  
Baby I've got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
There's a junkyard dog a barkin'  
In the valley down below  
He's wanting me to stop and  
Gather up a heavy load  
Ain't gonna heed his call  
Ain't givin' him the time of day  
You mangy mutt once and for all  
I said I threw that stuff away  
I won't have a bit of trouble  
Heading down the straight and true  
I'll fly solo on the double  
Into the yonder blue  
I might need some intervention  
Out upon the icy turn  
In a foggy situation  
Squealin' on a hairpin curve  
I'm running on desire  
Baby I've got nerves of steel  
Coming down to the wire  
Lord above me guide the wheel  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Keep me in your prayers tonight  
I'll be weary upon that road  
I know the finish line's in sight  
But I still have a ways to go  
Got a ways to go, got a ways to go  

(Bruce Springsteen)  
  
Tonight my bag is packed  
Tommorrow I'll walk these tracks  
That will lead me across the border  
Tommorrow my love and I  
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies  
Somewhere across the border  
  
We'll leave behind my dear  
The pain and sadness we found here  
And we'll drink from the Brazos muddy waters  
Where the sky grows gray and wide  
We'll meet on the other side  
There across the border  
  
For me you'll build a house  
High up on a grassy hill  
Somewhere across the border  
Where pain and memory  
Pain and memory have been stilled  
There across the border  
  
And sweet blossoms fill the air  
Pastures of gold and green  
Roll down into cool clear waters  
And in your arms 'neath the open skies  
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes  
There across the border  
  
Tonight we'll sing the songs  
I'll dream of you my Corazon  
And tommorrow my heart will be strong  
And may the saints blessing and grace  
Carry me safely into your arms  
There across the border  
  
For what are we  
Without hope in our hearts  
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters  
And eat the fruit from the vine  
I know love and fortune will be mine  
Somewhere across the border

Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming saying something about a
queen  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming and the archer split the
tree  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze  
Look at mother nature on the run in the twentieth century  
Look at mother nature on the run in the twentieth century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement with a full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for a replacement when the sun burst through the skies  
There was a band playing in my head and I felt like I could cry  
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie  
[ piano ]  
Well I dreamed a saw the silver spaceships flying in the yellow have of the
sun  
The were children crying and colors flying all around the chosen ones  
All in a dream all in a dream the loading had begun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home

Castles tall  
Houses small  
Left alone  
All fall down  
  
Dreams so clear  
Disappear  
Without a sound  
All fall down  
  
Lovers meet  
Lovers quarrel  
Lonely boy  
Lonely girl  
  
I lost him  
And I have found  
Dreams like walls  
All fall down  
  
All fall down  
All fall down  
She don't want me to call her  
And she's told me not to bother comin' round  
All fall down  
All fall down  
When you take a love for granted like I did  
You're bound too see it all fall down  
  
Castles tall  
Houses small  
Left alone  
All fall down  
  
Dreams so clear  
Disappear  
Without a sound  
All fall down

Oh my mama told me  
'Cause she say she learned the hard way  
Say she wanna spare the children  
She say don't give or sell your soul away  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple  
Don't you eat of the bitter fruit  
Hunger only for a taste of justice  
Hunger only for a world of truth  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
I was a pretty young girl once  
I had dreams, I had high hopes  
I married a man he stole my heart away  
He gave his love but what a high price I paid  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
Why was I such a young fool  
Thought I'd make history  
Making babies was the best I could do  
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever  
Found out the hard way one can't possess another  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
I thought, thought that I could find a way  
To beat the system  
To make a deal and have no debts to pay  
I'd take it all, take it all I'd run away  
Me for myself first class and first rate  
But all that you have is your soul  
  
Here I am waiting for a better day  
A second chance  
A little luck to come my way  
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again  
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Oh my mama told me  
'Cause she said she learned the hard way  
She said she want to spare the children  
She said it don't give to sell your soul away  
All that you have is your soul  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have is your soul

(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
A million miles our vagabond heels  
Clocked up beneath the clouds  
They're counting down to show time  
When we do it for real with the crowds  
Air miles are owing  
But they don't come for free  
And they don't give you any for pain  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
The rimshots come down like cannon fire  
And thunder off the wall  
There's a man in every corner  
And each one is giving his all  
  
This is my fife  
This is my drum  
So you never will hear me complain  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning  
  
Well if you're inclined  
To go up on the wall  
It can only be fast and high  
And those who don't like the danger  
Soon find something different to try  
When there's only a ringin' in your ears  
And an echo down memory lane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
  
The show's packing up  
I sit and watch the convoy  
Leaving town  
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,  
For riding around and around  
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death  
You showed me one time on the plane  
  
But if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
A million miles of vagabond sky  
Clocked up above the clouds  
I'm still your man for the roaming  
For as long as there's roamin' allowed  
  
There'll be a rider  
And there'll be a wall  
As long as the dreamer remains  
  
And if it's all for nothing  
All the roadrunning's  
Been in vain  
  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning  
All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning

My baby never was the cheatin' kind  
But it wasn't 'cause the ladies didn't try  
Now everywhere we go  
They're walkin' 'round him slow  
Givin' him a flutter and a sigh  
Now I got him past that redhead in atlanta  
Lord I walked all over that black-eyed cajun queen  
But outside of amarillo, he found his thrill, I'll tell you  
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine  
  
Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for  
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more  
You done played a trick on me  
Hooked him in the first degree  
While he put another quarter  
Push dolly and then porter  
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine  
  
If we only hadn't stopped in there for coffee  
If someone hadn't played the window up above  
He'd still be mine today  
But he heard those fiddles play  
One look and then I knew this must be love  
Oh that pinball machine was in the corner  
Well he saw the lights and he had to hear 'em ring  
And he never was the same after he won his first free game  
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine  
  
Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for  
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more  
You done played a trick on me  
Hooked him in the first degree  
While he put another quarter  
Push dolly and then porter  
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine  
  
Oh amarillo what'd you want my baby for  
Oh amarillo now he won't come home no more  
You done played a trick on me  
Hooked him in the first degree  
While he put another quarter  
Push dolly and then porter  
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

My latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run  
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph has begun  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  

(Rodney Crowell)  
This morning is Monday where are you now  
Teasin' my memory teaching me how to lay low  
When I don't want to  
Well love is elusive this I know now  
It's making me crazy leaving me out  
In the open when I don't want to  
The moments of pleasures Never do last  
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past  
Long gone and in a hurry  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
The second street beggars alone in their life  
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night  
Like I am They're just like I am  
Baby, I can't go through this again  
I don't need to go down more then I've already been  
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town  
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now  
Just like a wild fire You're running all over town  
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by now  

(Rodney Crowell)  
  
In this modern world we're livin'  
The rules ain't like they've ever been  
Speakin' of spreading it thin  
That's what you do, flashing your soul  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act with feelings  
Baby, better start turnin' em down  
  
Now it's a brave new wave we're roarin' in  
Hanging out, out on the rock 'n roll fringe  
Speaking of running around  
All over town, lettin' it show  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act in public  
Baby, don't better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down  
  
Sure is clear ain't nothin' easy any more  
Sure gets cloudy when I look in all directions  
Sure is rainin' like this feeling in my heart  
Sure is crazy how you're acting  
  
In this latest craze or current trend  
Burnin' money every way that you can  
Speakin' of goin' for broke  
That's how it is and lettin' it slow  
That ain't no way to treat your lover  
Ain't no way to act with strangers  
Baby, you'd better start turnin' em down, start to turnin' down  
  
Baby, better start turnin'  
Baby, better start turnin' 'em down  
Baby, better start turnin'

I see a bad moon rising  
I see trouble on the way  
I see earthquakes and lighting  
I see bad times today  
  
Now don't go 'round tonight  
For it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a blowing  
I know the end is comin' soon  
I fear the river's overflowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
I hope you have got your things together  
Hope you are quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye

Her mama picked him up in south Minnesota  
He promised her the world but they never got that far  
For he was last seen in that '59 DeSota  
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota  
She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation  
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart  
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation  
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations  
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes  
With bugs on her headlights  
And runs in her hose  
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelt's nose  
Adios, South Dakota, adios Sally Rose  
They've got a national monument carved out of stone  
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed  
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose  
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose  
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour  
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor  
And turnin' the dial she was pulled by the power  
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting tower

(Leonard Cohen)  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away  
She'll walk 'til she finds him her darlin' her stray  
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash  
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss  
  
And there's nothin' to follow nowhere to go  
He's gone like the summer gone like the snow  
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song  
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong  
  
Did she dream was it he who went galloping past  
And bent down the fern broke open the grass  
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe  
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth  
  
And although he goes grazin' a minute away  
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day  
And she's blind to his presence except to compare  
Her injury here with his punishment there  
  
Then at home on a branch on a highest tree  
A songbird sings out so suddenly  
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride  
On a willow tree by the riverside  
  
Ah the world is sweet and world is wide  
He's there where the light and the darkness divide  
And the steam's comin' off him he's huge and he's shy  
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky  
  
And he comes to her hand but he's not really tame  
He longs to be lost she longs for the same  
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge thru the first open pass  
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass  
  
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau  
Where there's nothing above and nothing below  
It's time for their burden the whip and the spur  
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her  
  
So she binds herself to her galloping steed  
And he binds himself to the woman in need  
And there is no space just left and right  
And there is no time but there is day and night  
  
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low  
Whither thou goest I will go  
And they turn as one and they head for the plain  
No need for the whip or no need for the rein  
  
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight  
Who snaps it asunder the very next night  
Some say it's him some say it's her  
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair  
  
So my darlin' my darlin' just let him go by  
That old silhouette on the great western sky  
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along  
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl

I meant to ask you how to fix that car  
I always meant to ask you about the war  
And what you saw across a bridge too far  
Did it leave a scar  
  
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel  
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal  
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels  
How did it feel  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end  
  
I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost  
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed  
There was still that line that you would never cross  
At any cost  
  
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed  
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve  
And if you ever really were deceived  
By the likes of me  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end  
  
Gone now is the day and gone the sun  
There is peace tonight all over Arlington  
But the songs of my life will still be sung  
By the light of the moon you hung  
  
I meant to ask you how to plow that field  
I meant to bring you water from the well  
And be the one beside you when you fell  
Could you tell  
  
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly  
To dust be returning from dust we begin  
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy  
Above and below me world without end

Was in the merry month of May  
When all gay flowers were a bloomin',  
Sweet William on his death-bed lay  
For the love of Barbara Allen.  
  
He sent his servant to the town  
To the place where she was dwelling  
Said, "You must come to my master's house,  
If your name be Barbara Allen."  
  
So slowly, slowly she gets up,  
And to his bedside going  
She drew the curtains to one side  
And says, "Young man, you're dying."  
  
"I know, I'm sick and very low,  
And sorrow dwells within me  
No better, no better I never will be.  
Til I have Barbara Allen."  
  
"Don't you remember last Saturday night  
When I was at the tavern,  
You gave your drinks to the ladies there  
But you slighted Barbara Allen?"  
  
He reached up his pale white hands  
Intending for to touch her  
She turned away from his bedside  
And says, "Young man I won't have you."  
  
He turned his cheek into the wall  
And bursted out a crying  
"What I do to thee I do to all  
And I do to Barbara Allen."  
  
She had not walked and reached the town  
She heard the death bells ringing  
And as they rolled they seemed to say,  
"Hard-hearted Barbara Allen."  
  
"Oh Mother, oh mother go make my bed  
Make it both long and narrow  
Sweet William died for me today  
I'll die for him tomorrow."  
Sweet William was buried in the old church yard  
  
And Barbara there anigh him,  
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose,  
And out of hers, a briar.  
They grew and grew to the old churchyard,  
  
Where they couldn't grow no higher,  
And there they tied in a true love's knot.  
The rose wrapped around the briar.

They say there's wreckage washing up all along the coast  
No one seems know too much, or got hit the most  
Nothing has been spoken, there's not alot to see  
But something has been broken, that's how feels to me  
  
We had a harmony, I never meant to small boats  
Lying out in the water, like a slick of oil  
Tide is running out to sea, under a darkening sky  
The night is falling down on me, and I'm a thinking that I should head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb  
  
Little wild kitten out hunting, see what he can get  
You're in a big city, that won't stop growing yet  
The sun is goin' down smokin', a flaming testiment  
Something has been broken, and it feels permenant.  
  
The little seabird flying, he knows were he wants to go  
Quess I ought to pack my stuff, and do the thing I know  
Turn around and head on back, along the old sea walls  
I felt somthing give and crack, and now I'm sorry that's all head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb

I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time  
But that was before I met you  
I never saw one that I wanted for mine  
But that was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you  
  
Well, I wanted to ramble and always be free  
But that was before I met you  
I said that no woman could ever hold me  
But that was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you  
  
They tell me I must reap just what I have sown  
But darlin', I hope that's not true  
'Coz once I made plans about livin' alone  
That was before I met you  
  
I thought I was swingin' the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
And I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you

(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
My mamma and my daddy  
Told me that love is a two-way street  
But lately baby, you've been finding  
New ways of dragging yout feet  
So come on, make your best shot  
You don't have to take the blame  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
There's lonely people everywhere  
From Abilene to Arkansas  
The way they run for cover  
You'd think love was against the law  
Well i don't need a pistol , baby  
You won't have to rob a train  
You can be my belle star  
And i can be your Jesse James  
  
I know you've done some hard time  
Baby, and you've got your doubts  
When you feel surrounded  
And it's looking there's no way out  
I'll come riding to rescue  
All you gotta do is call my name  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
It don't take a genius, baby  
There aint no big mystery  
You can't play it safe  
And still go down in history  
So saddle up the horses  
'Cos we're headed for the hall of fame  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James

Beneath still waters  
There's a strong undertow  
The surface won't tell you  
What the deep water knows  
  
Darling, I'm saying  
I know something's wrong  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Even a fool could see  
That you'll soon be leaving me  
But each and every heart  
Must take its turn at misery  
  
And this time it's me  
And I'll cry alone  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Even a fool could see  
That you'll soon be leaving me  
But each and every heart  
Must take its turn at misery  
  
And this time it's me  
And I'll cry alone  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone  
Beneath still waters  
Your love is gone

Room 16, the palms motel  
Now I can rest behind that door  
My life with you's become a living hell  
Don't want to live like that no more  
And whatever it will take  
I will do to make this final break  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
So I'll unpack my bag  
And kick off these old shoes  
This room is a good as anyplace I've ever been  
For lookin' at the truth  
Now it's all so clear to me  
What a blind man could plainly see  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life  
  
Oh, god, here comes the tears  
I'm gonna stay right here  
I'll cry. I've cried before  
But I won't go back no more  
  
Looks like a change in the weather  
I can hear it start to rain  
I hope it's not too long this time  
Before the sun comes out again  
But if it rains forever  
I will still be better off  
  
Yeah, better off without you  
Better off without you  
Better off without you in my life

(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
I didn't ask for much  
As maybe I ought've  
But I'm staying in touch  
With the one I love  
And I can see in the dials  
And in these headlights beams  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you  
  
These are the big playloads  
Hammer down on the floor  
These are the restless roads  
Every one a war  
But in the flashing lines  
I see a love supreme  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you  
  
They promised me some good home time  
And some layover pay  
The agent he's a friend of mine  
Says it's due my way  
I'd drive a thousand miles  
Haul a trailer of tears  
Just to see you smile  
And as the dawn appears  
At the edge of the night  
There's still a light that gleams  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you

Away beyond the blue  
Away beyond the blue  
One star belongs to you  
One star belongs to you  
  
And every breath I take  
And every breath I take  
I'm closer to that place  
I'm closer to that place  
  
Yeah baby, I'm gonna meet you there  
On the outskirts of the sky  
Yeah baby, I'm gonna meet you there  
And we will fly  
  
Away beyond the blue  
Away beyond the blue  
One star belongs to you  
  
This life is but a dream  
This life is but a dream  
Go gently down the stream  
Go gently down the stream

I don't want to hear a love song  
I got on this airplane just to fly  
And i know there's life below  
But all that it can show me  
Is the prairie and the sky  
  
And i don't want to hear a sad story  
Full of heartbreak and desire  
The last time i felt like this  
It was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire  
And i stood on the mountain in the night and i watched it burn  
I watched it burn, i watched it burn.  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham  
I would hold my life in his saving grace.  
I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham  
If i thought i could see, i could see your face.  
  
Well you really got me this time  
And the hardest part is knowing i'll survive.  
I have come to listen for the sound  
Of the trucks as they move down  
Out on ninety five  
And pretend that it's the ocean  
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean  
Baby do you know what i mean  
  
I would rock my soul in the bosom of abraham  
I would hold my life in his saving grace.  
I would walk all the way from boulder to birmingham  
If i thought i could see, i could see your face.

You don't love me this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
I hung around a little too long  
I was good but now I'm gone  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
Any way the wind can blow  
That's where I'm gonna go  
I'll be gone like a five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
The shoulder I've been leanin' on  
Is the coldest place I've ever known  
There's nothin' left for me round here  
Looks like it's time to disappear  
  
Like the buffalo  
That boy from Tupelo  
The old wall down in Jericho  
Maybelle on the radio  
I'll be gone like the five and dime  
It'll be the perfect crime  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know  
  
You don't love me, this I know  
Don't need a bible to tell me so  
It's a shame and it's a sin  
Everything I coulda been to you  
  
Your last chance Texaco  
Your sweetheart of the rodeo  
A Juliet to your romeo  
The border you cross into Mexico  
I'll never understand why or how  
Oh but baby its too late now  
Just ask the boy from Tupelo  
He's the king and he oughta know

I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho' I'm not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
I could tend and make any diesel sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
Well I met my wife to be  
Through my mother's best friend's son  
She had been a bar room singer  
She was as good as anyone  
But I ask her to stop singing  
And the girl she did not flinch  
Next day she went and bought that man  
A brand new crescent wrench, ohh  
A brand new crescent wrench  
  
We had three fine children  
As eight years went on by  
And earned a silver visor  
The knuckles stayed bone dry  
But after supper I kept hearin' her  
By the kitchen radio  
Singing sweet but desperate harmony  
A little bit to low, ohhh  
A little bit to low  
  
She left three months later  
I'd just come home for lunch  
Note said "easy come, hard go"  
I still love you so much  
She said I don't know if I'll be there  
Or if you'll want me when I come  
But if and when that Abbott steer  
You better  
Let my sweet dream run, ohhh  
Let my sweet dream run  
  
Ohhhh...ohhh...ohhh...ohhh  
  
I was good shad tree mechanic  
So I send myself to school  
They smoothed off my rough edges  
In my hands they put new tools  
The instructor once he told me  
I could work on any line  
But now the diesels aren't the only thing that sing  
Just like Patsy Cline  
Just like Patsy Cline  
  
I was once a broken man  
I was once a broken fool  
Lost my wife and children  
To one basic broken rule  
Now I live my life in silence  
Tho' I'm not quite in a shell  
Drink and listen to that song  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale  
A whiter shade of pale

Keep that candle burnin' bright, mama  
I'll be kind of late tonight, mama  
There's a yellow moon above me, mama  
Shinin' on the one I love, mama  
  
[Chorus:]  
Burn that candle, night and day  
Burn that candle, honey light our way  
Keep that doorway open wide  
Until we come slowly strollin' side by side  
  
While that candle's shinin' high, mama  
I'll be with my sugar pie, mama  
We'll be comin' home you know and mama  
Lookin' for that candle glowin', mama  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After we have had the wedding, mama  
To that candle we'll be headin', mama  
So before we're winin' and dinin', mama  
Keep that candle light a-shinin', mama  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Those lives were mine to love and cherish  
To guard and guide along life's way  
Oh God forbid that one should perish  
That one alas should go astray  
Back in the years with all together  
Around the place we'd romp and play  
So lonely now I oft' times wonder  
Oh will they come back home some day  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day  
  
I gave my all for my dear children  
Their problems still with love I share,  
I'd brave life's storm, defy the tempest  
To bring them home from anywhere  
I lived my life my love I gave them,  
to guide them through this world of strife,  
I hope and pray we'll live together  
In that great glad here after life  
  
I'm lonesome for my precious children  
They live so far away  
Oh may they hear my calling, calling  
and come back home some day

O the walls are closin' in I can feel it in my bones  
Like water risin' up to my chin  
Another long night to be alone  
I could go out on the town  
Talk too much and laugh too loud  
If I'm already on my way down  
I might as well just work the crowd  
  
Can you hear me now  
O the stories I could tell  
Sometimes I really hit my stride  
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell  
Tryin' to get across to the other side  
But everyday ends up the same  
One step up, two steps back  
Like some old silent movie frame  
Zoom in close, then fade to black  
  
Can you hear me now  
How did the load get to be  
so heavy I used to wear my trouble like a crown  
A bad flood's poundin' on the levee  
And I'm gonna need some help  
To hold my ground  
  
But I'm sinkin' like a stone  
To where in solitude this life I'll spend  
In the coldest place I've ever known  
I'm here just waitin' until the end I send up my S.O.S.  
A message in a bottle set out to sea It just reads

The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the dogies bawl  
Where spurs are a-jinglin', a cowboy is singin'  
This lonesome cattle call.  
  
He rides in the sun 'til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
Singin' his cattle call.  
  
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide  
When the night winds blow up a squall  
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call.  
  
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie  
And he sings with an ol' western drawl  
Singin' his cattle call.

(chuck berry)  
  
It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished them well  
You could see that Pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle  
And now the young monsieur and madam  
Have rung the chapel bell  
"C'est la vie", say the old folks  
It goes to slow you never can tell  
They furnished off an apartment  
With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was crammed  
With T. V. dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work  
The little money comin' worked out well  
"c'est la vie", say the old folks  
It goes to show you never can tell  
  
They had a hi-fi phono  
Boy did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rockin' rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell  
"c'est la vie", say the old folks  
It goes to show you never can tell  
  
They bought a souped-up jitney  
'Twas a cherry-red '53  
They drove it down to New Orleans  
To celebrate their anniversary  
It was there that Pierre  
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle  
"C'est la vie", say the old folks  
It goes to show you never can tell

Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring  
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss  
She blames him and he blames her  
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is  
And all of the time in the back of their minds  
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been  
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring  
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again  
Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts  
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for  
A stranger here, a stranger there  
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more  
And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight  
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn  
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring  
Two unhappy people to the point of no return  
And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids  
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy they choose  
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins  
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

Although you see the world  
Different than me  
Sometimes I can touch upon  
The wonders that you see  
And all of new colors  
In pictures you've designed  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
  
You don't need direction  
You know which way to go  
And I don't want to hold you back  
I just want to watch you grow  
And you're the one who taught me  
You don't have to look behind  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
  
Nobody's gonna to kill your dreams  
Or tell you how to live your life  
There'll always be people  
To make it hard for awhile  
But you'll turn their heads  
When they see you smile  
  
The times you were born  
May not have been the best  
You can make the times to come  
Better than the rest  
I know you will be honest  
If you can't always be kind  
  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine  
Child of mine, child of mine  
Oh yes, sweet darling  
So glad you are a child of mine

Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
Snowflakes a fallin'  
My old home's a callin'  
Tall pines a hummin'  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
Holly's in the window  
Home's where the wind blows  
Can't walk for runnin'  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home  
White candles burnin'  
My old heart's a-yearnin'  
For the folks at home when  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Can't you hear them bells ringin'  
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'  
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'  
Back to my country home  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
Christmas time's a-coming  
And I know I'm goin' home

Old brown clock ticking on my shelf  
Take my mind to someplace else  
Little gold clock ticking by my bed  
Funny little people dancing 'round my head  
  
Morning brings me things to do  
Morning brings me thoughts of you  
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace  
Some of which shining on your sweet face  
  
Counting hours making days  
Watching time throwing love away  
Nothing golden never stays  
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...  
  
Time is always taking me  
Places I don't want to be  
But when the morning rise the moon  
I know a bird day's coming soon  
  
Counting hours making days  
Watching time throwing love away  
Nothing golden never stays  
That's what I heard the poets say Mmm ...  
  
Morning brings me things to do  
Morning brings me thoughts of you  
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace  
Some of which shining on your sweet face

(Dolly Parton)  
  
Back through the years I go wondering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours, Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
  
Oh, I couldn't understand it, for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be  
Now I know we have no money, but I'm as rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me  
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me

Colors of your heart  
Like the colors on a pinwheel  
Spinning around, turning away  
Colors of your eyes  
Tell me you're changing  
Tell me your leaving  
And that it's too late to try  
Colors of your heart  
Like the places you're going  
There's no way of knowing  
What did I do so wrong  
Diamonds and sand  
Slide through your hands  
Like you've done through mine  
Did I look away  
Or did I never say  
How I needed you  
Colors of your eyes  
Like the blues in a bottle  
Taking you down  
Let them wash you away  

You feel the thirst  
But none can make you drink  
The answer's waiting for you here but  
It's not what you think  
It won't steal your soul or leave you blind  
It was just a cup of kindness all the time  
  
And when Mother Mary finally comes to cal  
She could pass right through your heart  
And leave no trace at all  
While you were reaching for  
The sacred and divine  
She was standing right beside you  
All the time  
  
And the emptiness  
You can't seem to fill  
Beauty fades and pleasures cannot  
Take away the chili  
And the glamor lures you down into a lie  
O but the cup of kindness  
Never will run dry  
  
You hear the vandals  
Howlin' down your walls  
And arm yourself against the ones  
Who want to see you fall  
Till some Holy Grail reveals  
The grand design  
Well it was in a cup of kindness  
All the time

I live on a big blue ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
But even the day that I do  
I jump off and smile back at you  
I don't even know where we are  
  
But they tell us we're circling a star  
Well I'll take their word I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so maybe that's so  
  
I'm riding a big blue ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
But even the high may lay row  
So when I do fall I'll be glad to go

As each long day rolls by and falls behind me  
In the lonely night there's a peacefulness I've found  
Tho' I'm weary even then  
When I rise to start again  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
I have wasted all that life has laid before me  
I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown  
But I shall not disavow  
All these ties that bind me now  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
Shinning down some day I know  
Brighter than all their streets of gold  
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down  
And the sorrows I have known  
I'll see them all be overthrown  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
Through the passing of the years I will grow stronger  
Just as sure as this old world keeps spinning 'round  
Then the closer I will be  
To my sweetest victory  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

Oh sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked  
Long ago in the sweet used to be  
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet  
As they did when you picked them for me  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that or do I ever cross your mind  
[ fiddle - mandolin ]  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night  
Cause you miss me do you darling  
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place in time  
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared  
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind  
[ guitar ]  
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long
ago  
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and
close  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all or do I ever cross your mind  
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mind

She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi  
Alone in the pale moonlight  
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler  
Said that he'd return tonight  
  
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi  
Lovin' the whole night through  
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'  
And bring it on back to you  
  
Evangeline, Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away  
  
Bayou Sam from south Louisiana'  
Had gamblin' in his veins  
Evangeline from the maritime  
Was slowly goin' insane  
  
High on the top of a hickory hill  
She stands in the lightning and thunder  
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'  
She watched that queen go under  
  
Evangeline Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away  
  
Evangeline Evangeline  
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen  
That pulled her man away

In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed  
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand  

(Patty Griffin)  
  
I'm falling down  
I need to sleep  
Come a long long way  
No time for weepin  
No time for weepin  
Quiet now I'm falling down  
I'm falling down  
I have heard  
A million tales  
I have told  
A million more  
Some of them  
Must have been true  
But I don't know anymore  
I'm falling down  
  
Do your dance on my head  
Heavy steps of the dead  
Everything the snow surrounds  
Falling, falling, falling, falling  
Falling, falling down  
I'm falling down

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day
long  
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong  
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and
drear  
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year  
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by  
[ piano ]  
Faithful till death said our loving Master a few more days to labor and wait  
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful
gates  
Farther along we'll know all about it...  
Yes we'll understand it all by and by

(Wayne Kemp)  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
When I came home from work this morning  
My baby was feelin' low  
And he told me what was on his mind  
Then he told me where I could go  
Well I didn't go where he told me to  
Cause the water was cold in the lake  
Now there's something fishy 'bout this whole deal  
I don't see where I made my mistake  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
When I woke up this morning  
Like me, the sun was high  
Well I started walking the long way home  
Just to think of an alibi  
Well I couldn't think of a darn gawn thing  
That hadn't already been said  
So I guess I better just play it by ear  
Cause I'm already dead  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
Yes today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  

Keep the fire burning in your eyes  
Pay attention to the open sky  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
I don't remember losing track of you  
You're always dancing in and out of view  
I must have thought you would always be around  
Always keeping things real by playing the clown  
Now you're nowhere to be found  
I don't know what happens when people die  
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try  
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear  
But I can't sing, I can't help listening  
I can't help feeling stupid standing around  
Crying is the easier down  
'Cause I know that you would rather we'd be dancing  
Dancing our sorrow away  
No matter what fate throws in your way  
Just do the steps that you've been shown  
By everyone you've ever known  
Until the dance becomes your very own  
No matter how close to yours  
Another's steps have grown  
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone  
Keep a fire for the human race  
Let your prayers go drifting into space  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
Perhaps a better world is drawing near  
Just as easy it could all disappear  
Along with whatever meaning you might have found  
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around  
Go on and make a joyful sound  
Into a dancer you have grown  
From a seed somebody else has thrown  
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own  
And somewhere between the time you arrive  
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive  
But you'll never know  

The day breaks your mind aches  
You find that all her words of kindness linger on  
She no longer needs you  
She wakes up she makes up  
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry  
She no longer needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
  
A love that should have lasted years  
You want her you need her  
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead  
You think she needs you  
She goes out you stay home  
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone  
She doesn't need him  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
  
A love that should have lasted years  
Your day breaks your mind aches  
There will be time when all the things she said  
Will fill your head  
You won't forget her

I never thought I'd need you  
But now I find I'm wrong  
Come on back, sweet mama  
Back where you belong  
I've rambled over town  
To find that I can't win  
Come on back and pick me up again  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time  
Of all the other gals I've known  
There's none to take your place  
'Cause when I get into a jam  
They just ain't in the race  
So, now that you're back here  
Let's take another round  
With you here by my side  
Babe, the deal just can't go down  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time  
Now, if I lose  
(If I lose)  
Let me lose  
(Let me lose)  
I don't care  
(I don't care)  
How much I lose  
If I lose a hundred dollars  
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?  
My baby, she's got money all the time  

Oh, the night is growing colder,  
And the stars have lost their shine  
And I have been forsaken,  
By everything I thought was mine  
For in the darkest hour,  
When the final story's told  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter how bright I glittered, baby,  
I could never be gold.  
  
You gave up your finest treasure,  
For the one you saw in me  
But how could I know the measure,  
Of all you needed me to be  
Though I came with sweet intentions,  
More my pockets could not hold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I finally gave up counting,  
The ways you said I let you down  
When I fell into that river of no return,  
And you watched me drown  
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond,  
Have silver line my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You looked so high and low for heaven,  
I tried so hard to show the way  
But though I flew on wings of angels,  
My feet were always made of clay  
I could come trailing clouds of glory,  
But you saw nothing to behold  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(Shirley Eikhard)  
Darkness falls and you withdraw  
Your humour disappears  
It's been this way for years  
It's nothing new  
Come around and don't look down  
You'll never see the sun  
You'll never see the one  
Who's loving you  
You've got to hold your head up, darling  
Never let them see  
When you're sad, you look a lot like me  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
Now I don't care for sad affairs,  
The outcome's up to you  
If tears are overdue, then let them fall...  
Come around and don't look down  
You'll never see the sun  
You'll never see the one  
Who's loving you  
You've got to hold your head up, darling  
Never let them see  
When you're sad, you look a lot like me  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
You've got to want to win my darling  
Or you're bound to lose  
I wish for once that I could bring you good news, good news  
Good news  

I remember holdin' on to you,  
All them long and lonely nights I put you through.  
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry,  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico  
One place I may never go in my life again.  
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
I only miss you every now and then,  
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean.  
Most Novembers I break down and cry,  
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico,  
One place I will never go in my life again.  
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
No I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
Goodbye.  
Goodbye.

Troubles and trials  
Often betray us  
Tempting the wearing  
Body to stray  
But we shall all meet  
'Side the still waters  
With the Good Shepherd  
Leading the way  
  
Those who have strayed were  
Sought by the Master  
He who once gave His  
Life for the sheep  
Out on the mountain  
Now He is searching  
Bringing them in  
Forever to keep  
  
Going up home to  
Live in green pastures  
Where we shall live and  
Die nevermore  
Even the Lord will  
Be in that number  
When we shall reach that  
Heavenly Shore  
  
We will not heed the  
Voice of the stranger  
For he would lead us  
On to despair  
Following on with  
Jesus our Savior  
We shall all reach that  
Country so fair  
  
Going up home to  
Live in green pastures  
Where we shall live and  
Die nevermore  
Even the Lord will  
Be in that number  
When we shall reach that  
Heavenly Shore

The green rolling hills of West Virginia  
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know  
Though the times are sad and drear  
And I cannot linger here  
They'll keep me and never let me go  
  
My daddy said, don't ever be a miner  
For a miner's grave is all you'll ever own  
'Cause the hard times are everywhere  
I can't find a dime to spare  
These are the worst times I've ever known  
  
So I'll move away into some crowded city  
In some northern factory town you'll find me there  
Though I'll leave the past behind  
I'll never change my mind  
These troubled times are more than I could bear  
  
But someday I'll go back to West Virginia  
To the green rolling hills I love so well  
Yes, someday I'll go home  
And I know I'll right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more  
  
Yes, someday I'll go home  
And I know I'll right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more

Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails  
He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells  
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico  
The only thing we've owned is this old house here by the road  
  
And when he dies he says he'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
She walked through springtime when I was home  
The days were sweet, our nights were warm  
The seasons changed, the jobs would come  
The flowers fade, and this old house felt so alone  
When the work took me away  
  
And when she dies she says she'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And she will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
Highway 90, the jobs are gone  
We kept our garden, we set the sun  
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow  
And once a year they come and go  
At this old house here by the road  
  
And when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away to heaven  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring  
  
Yes when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing  
And we will fly away together  
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring

If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never feel so blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do  
You're nice to me when there's no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never feel so blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you

(Paul Kennerley)  
  
You asked me if I've met your baby  
I have to say it's been some time now  
But it seems like yesterday  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
You say he means the world to you  
Yes I can tell  
You'll make each other happy I wish you well  
He was mine for awhile  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when he was mine  
  
He was mine  
He was mine

Heart to heart we'll hold together  
Hand in hand we'll find a way  
Oh, the storms of life may blind us  
But with the loving vows that bind us  
  
Heart to heart hand in hand we'll stay  
Side by side forever and always  
Day by day till our lives are done  
This sweet love is ours to treasure  
Far beyond all time and measure  
Side by side day by day as one  
The years connot take what's between you and me  
We'll stand her together for the whole world to see  
  
Heart to heart there'll be no other  
Hand in hand for our love is true  
Oh, the words that we have spoken  
Will be a promise never broken  
Heart to heart hand in hand with you

Long long time ago when we were young  
You swore to me I would be the one  
I would be the one you loved  
But we had to part  
You asked me to wait for you  
To keep you in my heart  
To keep you in my heart  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
  
Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long  
Have you found another love  
Am I still the one  
Am I still the one for you  
But you're far away  
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday  
Back to me someday  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
  
On heartbreak hill alone at night  
I think of how you held me tight  
And wonder if I ever will see you again  
On heartbreak hill  
  
Oh lord if I only could go back in time enough  
I'd hold you in my arms again  
Never let you go  
Never let you go my love  
And leave me far behind  
High upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine  
You swore to be mine  
  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
Night after lonely night I'm waiting for you still  
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill  
Here on heartbreak hill  
Here on heartbreak hill

When they carried you into the parlor  
Your wounds were the worst I'd seen  
Cold as snow as your body trembled  
Cradled in the arms of morphine  
All the kinfolk cried out loud  
"Good Shepherd save this man"  
But you whispered with icy breath  
"It is not in His hands," and you said  
"Heaven ain't ready for me yet," and you looked at me  
"Give me your heart and take a bet," and you held my hand  
"Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
"I shall not slip away"  
Mama said to me, "daughter  
"You must nurse your cousin well"  
So I cared for you through days and nights  
But your fever I did not quell  
For weeks I watched you suffer pain  
That no laudanum could ease  
All I had left to do is pray  
"Lord have mercy on him please," and you said  
"Heaven ain't ready for me yet," and you looked at me  
"Give me your heart and take a bet," and you held my hand  
"Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
"I shall not slip away"  
Now winter's lights has cooled the air  
At last your strength's returned  
You talk to me of the life you spent  
And of the life you've earned  
You'll waste no time on vengeance  
You've no wish to fight again  
"To find peace," you say, "In God we trust  
"But little faith in Man"  
Heaven ain't' ready for you yet, Jesse  
I'll give you my heart, I'll take a bet, Jesse  
Now I've seen your face, now that we've met  
I shall not slip away

Every night it's the same  
I feel your heart turn cold as rain  
And know that you'll be gone again  
I hear the front door close  
You say you got to go downtown  
I guess there's someone else you've found  
So why you're still coming round  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I've heard it said that talk is cheap  
But still your words they cut so deep  
Lay me crying in my sleep  
And the pain just grows  
I don't know who's right or wrong  
But all we had is dead and gone  
So why you keep me hanging on  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows  
  
I'm going to turn and walk away  
There's nothing left for me to say  
It wouldn't change things anyway  
Though, I suppose  
The love I gave was always true  
Well, I don't know what else to do  
And how I'll ever get over you  
Heaven only knows  
  
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry  
Make me feel like I could die  
That's the way it goes  
Heaven only ever sees  
How love's made a fool of me  
I guess that's how it's meant to be but  
Heaven only knows

Hello stranger  
Put your loving hand in mine  
You are a stranger  
And you're a friend of mine  
Get up, rounder  
Let a working girl lay down  
You are a rounder  
And you're all out and down  
  
Every time  
I ride the four and six street cars  
I can see my baby  
Peeping through the bars  
  
He bowed his head  
And he waved both hands at me  
He's prison bound  
And longing to be free  
  
I'll see you  
When your troubles are like mine  
Yes I'll see you  
When you haven't got a dime

I am searching through the canyon  
It is your name that I am calling  
Tho you're so far away  
I know you hear my plea  
Why won't you answer me  
Here I am  
  
I am in the blood of your heart  
The breath of your lung  
Why do you run for cover  
You are from the dirt of the earth  
And the kiss of my mouth  
I have always been your lover  
Here I am  
  
I am the promise never broken  
And my arms are ever open  
In this harbor calm and still  
I will wait until  
Until you come to me  
Here I am

Here making each day of the year  
Changing my life with one wave of his hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
  
There running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking  
But he doesn't know she's there  
  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere

In South Carolina  
There are many tall pines  
I remember the oak tree  
That we used to climb  
  
But it makes me feel better  
Each time it begins  
Callin' me home  
Hickory Wind  
  
I started out younger  
At most everything  
All the riches and pleasures  
What else could life bring  
  
But now when I'm lonesome  
I always pretend  
That I'm gettin' the feel of  
Hickory Wind  
  
It's a hard way to find out  
That trouble is real  
In a far away city  
With a far away feel  
  
But it makes me feel better  
Each time it begins  
Callin' me home  
Hickory Wind  
  
Keeps callin' me home  
Hickory Wind

I've been running low on inspiration  
Tired of that physical intrigue  
There's nothing left to imagination  
Living in a world that treats love so carelessly  
  
Don't want no smooth talkin' lover  
I can't play the role  
It just leaves me cold  
  
I need a high powered love  
I wanna feel that lightning streak  
High powered love  
Got to be down in the heart with me  
  
Sometimes it's hard to keep believing  
Too many pretty faces all skin deep  
Is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven  
And won't spend more time with a mirror than me  
  
If you're just looking for a good time  
A notch on your gun  
I ain't the one  
  
I want a high powered love  
Got to have intensity  
High powered love  
Don't start the fire if you can't take the heat  
  
I can't turn back I'm on a mission  
I know there's someone out there for me  
  
I need a high powered love  
One that'll defy gravity  
High powered love  
Got to be strong and keep on lifting me  
  
Higher, higher, higher  
Higher, higher, higher  
High powered love  
High powered love  
  
Higher, higher, higher  

[Chorus]  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than death valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
The way I feel, can't explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been cussed and I've been praised  
And I've been nothing these days  
But I'll come back, time will see  
If I'm wrong about you, right about me  
  
[Chorus]

Go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby  
Do not think about tomorrow  
Let tomorrow come and go  
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Safe from all the wind and snow  
I know the police cause you trouble  
They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You won't find no policemen there  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble  
You'll find happiness some day  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Don't you feel the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby  

Tonight as I lay on a boxcar just waiting for a train to pass by  
What will become of the hobo whenever his time comes to die  
Has the Master up yonder in heaven got a place that we might call our home  
Will we have to work for a livin' or can we continue to roam  
Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide  
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen will they tell us that we cannot ride  
Will the hobo chum with the rich man will we always have money to spare  
Will they have respect for a hobo in that land that lies hidden up there  
[ bnanjo - dobro ]  
Will there be any freight trains...

What happened to your mother's love  
What happened to your daddy's pride  
Although you always said enough  
Though they were right by your side  
What happened to that ball of fire  
It got out on that empty road  
  
Nothing but our own desires  
Lighten up this heavy load  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
I know you didn't plan for this  
But that's the way it always starts  
He's looking for a little kiss  
Instead you bought a broken heart  
Now you had to build a bridge  
Only you can walk across  
Wear the tooth until it fits  
Pay the price and bear the loss  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
Once you were a little kid  
Working on a great big plan  
They threw away the simple joys  
And now you have to take a stand  
  
Battles rage in your head  
You wish you didn't have to fight  
Just hold on to my hand instead  
Another day goes by tonight  
  
What happened to your mother's love  
What happened to your daddy's pride  
Way down deep in your inside your blood  
Help you through this lonely ride  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on

I have seen your soul turn black  
And then retreat  
To that dark place where no one else may follow  
I waited here for your returning  
To roll your cigarette  
And wash your bloodied feet  
  
You have heard the silent running  
Of my dreams  
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever  
With the sound of your voice speaking my name  
And a kiss  
That I will feel forever  
  
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead  
WG did forge our wedding bed  
On a hard and holy road  
We lay down our head  
In tha hour of gold, the hour oi lead  
  
I have watched you riding on  
The wall of death  
And when il finally breaks you and you fall  
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me  
To bind the fatal wound  
And catch your last sweet breath  
  
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead  
We did forge our wedding bed  
On a hard and holy road  
We lay down our head  
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead  
  
But the world will be my witness when  
They excavate my heart  
And find the image of your face  
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin  
That neither time Nor tundra could erase  
  
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead  
We did forge our wedding bed  
On a hard and holy road  
We lay down our head  
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead

Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon  
There is no moon above and love is far away too  
Till it comes true  
That you love me and I love you  
  
Somewhere there's music, how near how far  
Somewhere there's heaven, that's where you are  
  
[Chorus]  
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon  
Until you will, I'll still my heart, how high the moon  
  
Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon  
  
[Chorus: x2]

God knows how I love you  
Like a user needs a drug  
And I'll never be free of ya  
You are poison in my blood  
I tried to swim that river  
And get to higher ground  
I been three times under  
The next one'll see me drown  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
God knows why you don't want me  
No one would do the things I do  
But to my grave it's gonna haunt me  
How I got down on my knees for you  
You are my obsession  
And the reason that I live  
You alreday got my soul  
There's nothin left to give  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down  
  
The devil is deep water baby  
And I'm in way over my head  
But I'd be drawn and quartered  
If I could keep you in my bed  
I can't break this spell  
I know the trouble that I'm in  
But If I got out of the mouth of hell  
I'd walk right back again  
  
But I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I don't want to talk about it now  
I want to go down

I dug up a diamond  
Rare and fine  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
If only I could cling to  
My beautiful find  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
  
My gem is special  
Beyond all worth  
As strong as any metal  
Or stone in the earth  
Sharp as any razor  
Or blade you can buy  
Bright as any laser  
Or any star in the sky  
  
Maybe once in a lifetime  
You'll hold one in your hand  
Once in a lifetime  
In this land  
Where the journey ends  
In a worthless claim  
Time and again  
In the mining game  
  
I dug up a diamond  
Rare and fine  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine  
Down in the darkness  
In the dirt and the grime  
I dug up a diamond  
In a deep dark mine

(Dell McCoury)  
Though the miles are between us  
I thought our love would strengthen  
As it has so many times before  
But something has happened  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can feel my world is crumblin'  
And the blues are at my door  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in  
The beginning of the end is near  
I feel your love has faded into darkness  
It seems I have no friend  
I feel the blues movin' in  
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad  
And broken-hearted  
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in  
Between the lines are mixed emotions  
And there's teardrops on the paper  
You said that's all I'll write today  
I'll cose for now old friend  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in  
My state of mind is desperate  
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in  
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out  
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'  
Tell me you still love me  
That would turn my world about  
The last letter that you wrote was  
On a blue piece of paper  
That old feelin's back  
The clouds are movin' in  

Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby  
I guess I will some day  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll get along  
I guess I will some way  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own  
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses  
I guess I will every day  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way  
  
You ask me if I'll find another  
I don't know, I can't say  
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin  
I wouldn't let my dear savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered a long,  
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.  
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I was a fool to wander and stray,  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more in darkness no more in night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

In my imagination  
You are my dear companion  
And I'm the one you cling to  
And your voice still calls my name  
Before your heart began to wander  
And mine was torn asunder  
Before the fairer and the younger  
Before the cryin' game  
All those girls with their long dark tresses  
Waltzing out in their Sunday dresses  
All their sweet soft warm caresses  
Cannot hold you like l do  
And though you say you do notlove me  
And your dreams are never of me  
I will dream my dream of you  
In my dreams you are the swallow  
Coming back to Capistrano  
And I'm the sound of the bells you follow  
But in this world dreams don't come true  
Still when you're lost out in the desert  
When your fire's a dying ember  
The last light you remember  
Will be the light l shed for you  
Mine is no ordinary star love  
I see exactly where you are love  
And no one else could shine that far love  
To bring you safely through  
And though you say you do not want me  
And made no promises to haunt me  
I will dream my dream of you  
The sorrows flow down like a fountain  
Over the miles beyond our countin'  
More than the flowers of the mountain  
Or the raindrops in the sea  
But if Heaven's just a dreaming  
Surely my love will be redeeming  
And you will dream your dream of me

If I needed you  
Would you come to me,  
Would you come to me,  
And ease my pain?  
If you needed me  
I would come to you  
I'd swim the seas  
For to ease your pain  
  
In the night forlorn  
The morning's born  
And the morning shines  
With the lights of love  
You will miss sunrise  
If you close your eyes  
That would break  
My heart in two  
  
The lady's with me now  
Since I showed her how  
To lay her lily  
Hand in mine  
Loop and Lil agree  
She's a sight to see  
And a treasure for  
The poor to find  
  
If I needed you  
Would you come to me,  
Would you come to me,  
And ease my pain?  
If you needed me  
I would come to you  
I'd swim the seas  
For to ease your pain

If you were a bluebird you'd be a sad one  
I'd give you a true word  
But you've already had one  
If you were a bluebird,  
  
You'd be crying  
You'd be flying home  
If you were a raindrop,  
You'd shine like a rainbow  
  
And if you were a train stop,  
The conductor would sing low  
If you were a raindrop,  
You'd be falling  
You'd be calling home  
  
If you were a hotel  
Honey, you'd be a grand one  
But, if you hit a slow spell,  
Do you think you could stand one  
  
If you were a hotel,  
Well I'd lean on your doorbell  
I'd call you my home  
If I was a highway,  
  
I'd stretch alongside you  
I'd help you pass by ways  
That had dissatisfied you  
If I was a highway,  
  
Well I'd be stretchin'  
I'd be fetchin' you home

(Bob Dylan)  
  
Close your eyes, close the door,  
You don't have to worry any more.  
I'll be your baby tonight.  
  
Shut the light, shut the shade,  
You don't have to be afraid.  
I'll be your baby tonight.  
  
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,  
We're gonna forget it.  
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,  
But we're gonna let it,  
You won't regret it.  
  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear,  
Bring that bottle over here.  
I'll be your baby tonight.

(Susanna Clark)  
  
If they'll play another love song  
And if that Miller Highlife light stays dim  
And if you'll keep my glass full of whiskey  
I'll whisper words I wish I'd said to him  
  
Just ask me to dance all the slow ones  
Hold me close and take me 'cross the floor  
I'll gently lay my head on your shoulder  
And pretend this never happened before  
  
I don't want to hear a sad story  
We both already know how it goes  
So if you'll be my tall dark stranger  
I'll be your San Antone Rose  
  
I wish I could tell you I love you  
I wish that he weren't always on my mind  
I wishes were fast trains to Texas  
I'd ride and I'd ride, how I'd ride

Don't think that I'll be hangin' 'round while you're havin' fun  
I won't sit there cryin' over you  
Well from now on when you step out I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Now every time you come in late and we begin to fight  
You tell me there are more fish in the sea  
But the bait ain't what it used to be and I got news for you  
Now after this when you go out well I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
From now on when you come in and won't tell where you been  
With your hair messed up and your clothes don't fit you right  
Well I don't care if I find perfume on you too  
Well you will know that I have been steppin' just like you  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  

When the sun goes down on the other side of town tonight  
And the world is asleep dreamin' in the deep moonlight  
I'll slip away in the shadows out of your life  
You don't want' me anymore so I'll close the door when I leave  
My bags are packed and I'll give you back your keys  
You keep your ring and I'll keep your memory  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
Well, it's hard to take when love breaks down and dies  
But it's better to quit than to sit each night and cry  
I'd rather know the truth than to live through a life of lies  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
Maybe it's for the best to give this love of ours a rest  
But I'll come runnin' back if you want me  
Well, bye bye baby it seems that we're all through  
You sure know how make this little girl blue  
When you say you don't want the things I can do for you  
  
But in my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams  
  
In my dreams at night... oh...oh  
Everything will work out right  
'Cause I'll still hold you tight... in my dreams

In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Once I knew a young man  
Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word  
With just his high-beam lights  
  
Who'd have ever thought  
They'd build such a deadly Denver bend  
To be so strong, to take so long  
As it would till the end  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Another young man safely strummed  
His silver string guitar  
And he played to people everywhere  
Some say he was a star  
  
But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
  
Then there was an old man  
Kind and wise with age  
And he read me just like a book  
And he never missed a page  
  
And I loved him like my father  
And I loved him like my friend  
And I knew his time would shortly come  
But I did not know just when  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed  
Oh Lord, grant me vision  
Oh Lord, grant me speed

He was always there each time I needed you,  
Holding on to me like I held on to you  
We still don't have what you and I once had  
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad.  
  
No, It's Not Love, not like our love It's Not Love,  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I don't have to wonder who he's had  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad  
  
I turn to him when you leave me alone,  
Sometimes even when you're here you're still gone.  
He'e slowly changing what you leave so sad  
No, It's Not Love, But it's not bad  
  
No, It's Not Love, not like our love It's Not Love,  
But it keeps love from driving me mad  
And I don't have to wonder who he's had  
  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad  
No, It's Not Love But it's not bad

Well, it's only rock and roll keep you running from yourself  
When the only way to slow down is to fall  
And it's only rock and roll that caused you to leave home  
When the only way to get back is to crawl  
  
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill  
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you son it's only rock and roll  
  
Yes and it's only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time  
When you really ought to sit this one out  
And it's only rock and roll keep on messin' with your mind when  
You don't know what they're talkin' about  
  
All around the world everywhere you go  
People got to have it 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
Well it's only rock and roll when your money's in the mail  
And your love's on the back of the bus  
And it's only rock and roll when your records start to sell  
And you don't know why they're making such a fuss  
  
Telephone receiver ringin' off the wall  
Can I get witness each and every call  
Second that emotion chased into your soul  
Don't worry lest you linger, son it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll yes it's only rock and roll  
People all around you everywhere you go  
Don't worry if they love you, 'cause it's only rock and roll  
  
It's only rock and roll. yeah it's only rock and roll  
All around the world everywhere you go  
People got to have it son it's only rock and roll

J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout  
Ce que j'ai pu  
J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout  
Ce que j'ai pu  
I have seen some trouble  
Been around the say  
Rode the streetcar of desire and I paid  
And if you want a witness  
I will testify  
To what I saw through a wandering eye  
'Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
I heard all about it  
You don't need an alibi  
There was no medicine I did not try  
You lost your Mona Lisa  
Got burned by Jezebel  
You can always draw water from my well  
'Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout  
I will give everything I am to you  
J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout  
You know it's true  
J'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout, j'ai fait tout  
You can go and leave me  
But you'll come back for more  
I know where all your old secrets are stored  
My history is written  
My heart is still pure  
You crave redemption and I got the cure  
'Cause nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do  
Nobody loves you like I do

Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh  
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou  
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou

Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

(David Olney)  
  
Man you should have seen me way back then  
I could tell a tale, I could make a spin  
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night  
Not only that I could tell you why  
Back then I could really tel a lie  
  
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame  
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again  
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick  
I was takin' everything they had to give  
It wasn't all that bad a way to live  
  
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell  
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell  
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk  
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day  
But everyone just turns and walks away  
  
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time  
So I head across the road to drink some wine  
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street  
You're pretty good if I do say myself  
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else  
  
Instead of callin' out for fire from above  
He just gets real quiet and talks about love  
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money  
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means  
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen  
  
Well since that time every town is the same  
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came  
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him  
He has everyone convinced that he's for real  
Well I figure we can work us out a deal  
  
So he offers me a job and I say fine  
He says I'll get paid off on down the line  
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong  
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow  
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow

Come in as you tread life's journey  
Take Jesus as your daily guide  
Though you may feel pure and safely  
Without Him walking by your side  
But when you come to make the crossing  
At the ending of your pilgrim's way  
If you ever will meet our Savior  
You'll surely meet Him on that day  
  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at these deep waters  
Look at that wide river  
Oh hear the mighty billows roar  
You'd better take Jesus with you  
He's a true companion  
For I'm sure without Him  
That you never will make it o'er  
  
That awful Day of Judgment  
Is coming in the by and by  
We'll see our Lord descending  
In Glory from on high  
So let us keep in touch with Jesus  
And in his grace the Love of God  
That we may be ever called ready  
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide  
  
Now look at that cold Jordan  
Look at these deep waters  
Look at that wide river  
Oh hear the mighty billows roar  
You'd better take Jesus with you  
He's a true companion  
For I'm sure without Him  
That you never will make it o'er  
  
Oh what, what you gonna do  
Oh what, what you gonna do  
Oh how, how you gonna feel  
When you come to the end of the Way

Why don't you call me?  
Do you think I won't answer?  
Jupiter's risin'  
And the moon is in cancer  
You been down in the hunger, baby  
I been around there, too  
Tonight, you could be in the arms of  
The arms of a woman who loves you  
  
You got your questions  
Baby, I got an answer  
Or just the hands of a healer  
And the feet of a dancer  
Yeah, it's all in the wrists now, baby  
And when the aim is true  
There'll be no blink of the eyes, baby  
The eyes of this woman who loves you  
(The eyes of this woman who loves you)  
(The eyes of this woman who loves you)  
  
Heaven's gettin' nearer  
Transmission gettin' clearer  
Now my love  
Stars are fallin' over the ocean  
Come on and show a little emotion now  
My love  
  
Why don't you call me?  
You know I'm gonna answer  
Temperature's risin'  
And the moon is in cancer  
There's a road you can ride now, baby  
Out to that wild and blue  
It runs right through the heart of  
The heart of this woman who loves you  
Yeah, right through the heart of  
The heart of this woman who loves you  
  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah  
Jupiter risin', ah, ah, ah, ah

There's a picture that I carry  
One we made sometime ago  
When they ask who's in the picture with me  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to spend some time with  
Just a flame that lost its glow  
And I don't tell them how lost I am without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to run around with  
Just a friend from long ago  
I don't tell them all the nights I cry without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
I say just someone I use to know  

[Chorus]  
I'll never swim Kern River again,  
It was there that I met him,  
There that I lost my best friend.  
Now I live in the mountains  
I drifted up here with the wind.  
And I may drown in still water,  
But I'll never swim Kern River again.  
  
He grew up in an oil town  
But that gusher never came in.  
And the river was a boundary  
Where my darling and I used to swim.  
One night in the moonlight,  
The swiftness swept his life away.  
Now I live on Lake Shasta,  
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay.  
  
There's the South San Joaquin  
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found.  
And theres a place called Mt. Whitney  
From where the mighty Kern River comes down.  
Now it's not deep nor wide,  
But it's a mean piece of water my friend.  
And I may cross on the highway,  
But I'll never swim Kern River again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
No, I'll never swim Kern River again.

Like Strangers, that's what we are  
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far  
Like Strangers, how can it be  
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly  
  
I love you, truly I do  
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too  
Let's forget that we've been angry  
Let's be lovers like before  
And swear not to be like strangers anymore  
  
Like Strangers, that's what we are  
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far  
Like Strangers, how can it be  
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly  
  
I love you, truly I do  
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too  
Let's forget that we've been angry  
Let's be lovers like before  
And swear not to be like strangers anymore  
  
Let's forget that we've been angry  
Let's be lovers like before  
And swear not to be like strangers anymore

If I had a bird, a little bird  
I would teach that bird to sing your name  
Prettiest song that you have ever heard  
And your indifferent heart I will claim  
  
So be off, my little bird  
Fly away, fly away  
And when my love you see  
Only then, my little bird  
Cry away, cry away, and bring that heart to me  
  
If I had a moon in the sky  
I would light the world and pull the tide  
And when the moon is full like my heart  
It will surely pull you to my side  
But in the darkest night I pine away  
Pine away until your face I see  
So throw your light, my lovely moon  
Shine away, shine away, and pull his heart to me  
  
If I had a wagon made of gold  
Pretty painted horses numbered four  
With a silver harness I would hitch them up  
And drive that wagon to your door  
And if my hand you choose to hold  
Ride away, ride away with the pretty horses four  
But, darlin', if you heart's still cold  
Hide away, hide away till trouble you no more  
Trouble you no more

Just about a year ago  
I set out on the road  
seekin' my fame and fortune  
lookin' for a pot of gold  
Things got bad and things got worse  
I guess you know the tune  
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
I came in on a Greyhound  
I'll be walkin' out if I go  
I was just passin' through  
Must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money  
It looks like they took my friends  
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
Well The man from the magazine  
He said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connection and  
Ran out of songs to play  
I came into town on a one-night stand  
Looks like my plans fell through  
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar  
For every song I've sung  
And every time I've had to play  
While people sat there drunk  
You know I'd catch the next train  
Back to where I live  
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
Oh, Lord, Stuck in Lodi again  
Oh lord stuck in Lodi again

I'm looking for that Lonely Street  
I've got a sad sad tale to tell  
I need a place to go and weep  
Where's this place called Lonely Street  
  
A place where there's just loneliness  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and memories meet  
Where's this place called Lonely Street  
  
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street  
There's someone such as I  
Who came to bury broken dreams  
And watch an old love die  
  
A place where there's just loneliness  
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness  
Where broken dreams and memories meet  
Where's this place called Lonely Street

We've been through some things together  
With trunks of memories still to come  
We found things to do in stormy weather  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run  
Well it was back in Blind River in 1962  
When I last saw you alive  
Rollin' down that empty ocean road  
Gettin' to the surf on time  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run  

Well tonight I'm gonna wear my dancin' shoes  
'Cause I heard the word and I heard the news  
There's a gal in town she's packin' 'em in  
If you've seen her once, you'll see her again  
  
She's got a red hot dynamite band  
They're burnin' down another one-night stand  
Headlinin' double shows  
Everybody go see Sally Rose  
  
She sure knows how to rock the crowd  
Rocks 'em slow rocks 'em loud  
So you better move fast 'cause tickets are tight  
If you want to see Sally Rose pick it tonight

Lost On The River, Dark Is The Night  
Just Like The Blind, Praying For Site  
Drifting Alone, Heart Filled With Fright  
I'm lost On The River The River Of Life  
Once Dear I Thought I Knew The Way  
That Was Before Old Sad Yesterday  
Words That You Said Cut Like A Knife  
I'm Lost On The River The River Of Life  
Out On This River Where Sorrow's Free  
Thinking Of You How My Heart Pleads  
Tomorrow You'll Be Another Man's Wife  
I'm Lost On The River The River Of Life  

I was once some mother's darlin'  
Some daddy's little girl  
More precious than the ruby  
More cherished than the pearl  
My heart was full of mercy  
And my forehead full of curl  
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world  
I am lost unto this world...  
  
They herded me like cattle  
Cut me down like corn  
Took me from my babies  
Before they could be born  
You can blame it on the famine  
You can blame it on the war  
You can blame it on the devil  
It don't matter anymore  
I am lost unto this world...  
  
I was tortured in the desert  
I was raped out on the piain  
I was murdered by the high way  
And my cries went up in vain  
My blood is on the mountain  
My blood is on the sand  
My blood runs in the river  
That now washes through their hands  
I am lost unto this world...  
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil  
Was God the only one there watching  
And weeping as l feil  
O you among the living  
Will you remember me at all  
Will you write my name out  
With a single finger scrawl  
Across a broken window  
In some long forgotten wall  
That goes stretching out forever  
Where the tears of heaven fall  
I am lost unto this world...

Love is a shiny car  
Love is a steel guitar  
Love is a battle scar  
Love is a morning song  
Love is a twelve-bar blues  
Love is your blue suede shoes  
Love is a heart abused  
Love is a mind confused  
  
And love is the pleasures I'm told  
And for some love is still a band of gold  
My love has no reason, has no rhyme  
My love cross the double line  
Love is a mine of gold  
Love is a man to hold  
Love is a drowning soul  
Love is it's own reward  
  
And love is the pleasures I'm told  
And for some love is still a band of gold  
My love has no reason, has no rhyme  
My love cross the double line  
And love is the pleasures I'm told  
And for some love is still a band of gold  
My love has no reason, has no rhyme  
My love cross the double line  
Oh, my love cross the double line  
Oh, my love cross the double line

And so you have come back to me  
And say the old love's growin' yet  
You've tried through all these weary years  
You've tried to vainly to forget  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin' heart you slighted then  
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth  
Come close and let me see your face  
Your raven hair is tinged with snow  
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face  
I loved so many years ago  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin' heart you slighted then  
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth  
Farewell, I think I love you yet  
As friend to friend, God bless you dear  
And guide you through these weary years  
To where the skies are always clears  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin' heart you slighted then  
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth  
Oh no, I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin' heart you slighted then  
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth  

(Buck Owens)  
  
Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more  
Love's gonna live here again  
Thing's are gonna be the way they were before  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
Love's gonna live here  
Love's gonna live here  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
No more loneliness  
Only happiness  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
I hear bells a ringing  
I hear birds a singing  
Love's gonna live here again  
  
I hear bees a humming  
And I know the days a coming  
Love's gonna live here again

You call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice  
Tell me you've been out all night runnin' with the boys  
You say you're cold and tired and lonely  
And you got no place to go  
There wasn't any phonebook  
Mine's the only number that you know  
  
Well call yourself a taxi and I'll pay 'I'm at the door  
If you don't mind sleepin' on the sofa or on the floor  
And I spend an hour hatin' you  
'Til the cab pulls in  
My heart has found another way  
To be loving you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no wore  
  
Then I hear the footsteps the driver's at the door  
He says I look familiar has he made this run before  
And I tell him I don't think so  
What's it matter anyway  
Just tell me what the meter reads  
And I'll go and get your pay  
  
Well now it's down to you and me though it don't seem right  
We both know where we'll be and what we'll do tonight  
And after an hour or two  
When the night comes to an end  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no worse  
  
I know that there should be more to say I'll just reed your mind  
Let's save what's left unsaid for another time  
'Cause I know there'll be another time  
So until then  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
Oh, my heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again

Luxury liner, forty tons of steel  
If I don't find my baby now  
I guess I never will  
I've been a long lost soul  
For a long, long time  
I've been around  
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I  
  
Well, I'm the kind of girl  
Who likes to make a livin' runnin 'round  
And I don't need a stranger  
To let me know my baby's let me down  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I  
  
Luxury liner, forty tons of steel  
No one in this whole wide world  
Can change the way I feel  
I've been a long lost soul  
For a long long time  
I've been around  
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind  
You think I'm lonesome, so do I  
So do I

Making believe that you still love me  
It's leaving me alone and so blue  
Still I'll always dream, but I'll never own you  
Making believe, its all I can do  
  
Can't hold you close when you're not whit me  
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine  
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime  
Loving you and making believe  
  
Making believe I never lost you  
But my happy hours are so few  
My plans for the future will never come true  
Making believe what else can I do

(Jimi Hendrix)  
Waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall  
When I go  
When I go down deep  
I want you here with me  
My sweet waterfall  
I can see  
A rainbow calling me  
Through your mystery  
My sweet waterfall  
Waterfall  
For a million day  
Fall with me for a million days  
My sweet waterfall  
Waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall  

Maybe tonight I'll get lucky  
I've been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Maybe this time I'll be saying  
The words that I wanted to say  
Maybe this time I'll be staying  
For more than just a day  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Maybe tonight I'll get lucky  
I've been lonely too long  
Maybe tonight some dark stranger  
Will hear me singing this song  
I've been down, I've played around  
I don't like it that way  
Love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Well, I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight?  
Well, I'm so tired of being free  
Of living just for me  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight  
Oh love, won't you treat me right  
Maybe tonight, maybe tonight?  

I'm growing tired on the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary, far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Days are dark and dreary  
Everywhere I go  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under Heaven's door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
I'm growing tired on the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary, far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Days are dark and dreary  
Everywhere I go  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Mississippi and you  

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen  
Give him two lips like roses and clover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Sandman, I'm so alone  
Don't have nobody to call my own  
Please turn on your magic beam  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen  
Give him the word that I'm not a rover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream  
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam  
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci  
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace  
  
Mister Sandman, someone to hold  
Would be so peachy before we're too old  
So please turn on your magic beam  
  
Mister Sandman, bring us  
Please, please, please  
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream
