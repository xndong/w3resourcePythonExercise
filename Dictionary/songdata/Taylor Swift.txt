[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall  
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall  
No matter what you say I still can't believe  
That you would walk away  
It don't make sense to me but  
  
[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
It's not unbroken anymore  
How do I get it back the way it was before  
  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a  
  
[Chorus]  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me  
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out  
Don't know what's down this road  
I'm just walking  
Trying to see through the rain coming down  
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels  
The way I do  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm alone, on my own  
And that's all I know,  
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong  
Oh, but life goes on  
Oh, I'm just a girl  
Trying to find a place in this world  
  
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans  
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve  
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine  
Could you tell me what more do I need?  
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah  
But that's okay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission  
But I'm ready to fly  
  
I'm alone, on my own  
And that's all I know  
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong  
Oh, but life goes on  
Oh, I'm alone, on my own  
And that's all I know  
Oh, I'm just a girl  
Trying to find a place in this world  
  
Oh, I'm just a girl  
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh  
Oh, I'm just a girl

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold  
But something about it felt like home somehow  
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house  
And you still got it in your drawer, even now  
  
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze  
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place  
And I can picture it after all these days  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And that magic's not here no more  
And I might be okay  
But I'm not fine at all  
  
'Cause there we are again, on that little town street  
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me  
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red  
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed  
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team  
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me  
  
And I know it's long gone  
And there's nothing else I could do  
And I forget about you long enough  
To forget why I needed to  
  
'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night  
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much  
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up  
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
So casually cruel in the name of being honest  
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well  
  
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it  
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it  
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone  
  
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah  
  
'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so  
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well  
  
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all  
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all  
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all to well

I'm so glad you made time to see me.  
How's life, tell me how's your family?  
I haven't seen them in a while.  
You've been good, busier then ever.  
We small talk, work and the weather  
Your guard is up and I know why.  
  
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind.  
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.  
I go back to December all the time.  
  
These days I haven't been sleeping  
Staying up playing back myself leaving,  
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.  
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side  
And realized I'd loved you in the fall.  
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.  
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.  
And I go back to December all the time.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.  
I go back to December all the time  
  
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,  
And how you held me in your arms that September night,  
The first time you ever saw me cry.  
Maybe this is wishful thinking,  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.  
  
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't  
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.  
  
But this is me swallowing my pride,  
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,  
And I go back to December.  
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,  
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.  
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.  
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.  
I go back to December all the time all the time

Your beautiful eyes  
Stare right into my eyes  
And sometimes I think of you late at night  
I don't know why  
I want to be somewhere where you are  
I wanna be where  
  
[Chorus]  
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine  
So baby, make me fly  
My heart has never felt this way before  
I'm looking through your  
I'm looking through your eyes  
  
I wake up, I'm alive  
In only a little while, I cry  
'Cause you're my lullaby  
So baby hold me tight cause I-I  
I want to be everything you need  
I want to be where,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as long as you're mine  
I'll be you're everything tonight  
Let me love you, kiss you  
Oh baby let me miss you  
Let me see your  
Dream about  
Dream about  
Dream about your eyes  
Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes

Her hair is Harlowe gold  
Her lips sweet surprise  
Her hands are never cold  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
She'll turn her music on you  
You won't have to think twice  
She's pure as New York snow  
She got Bette Davis eyes  
  
And she'll tease you  
She'll unease you  
All the better just to please you  
She's precocious and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
  
She'll let you take her home  
It whets her appetite  
She'll lay you on her throne  
She got Bette Davis eyes  
She'll take a tumble on you  
Roll you like you were dice  
Until you come out blue  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
  
She'll expose you, when she snows you  
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you  
She's ferocious and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
All the boys think she's a spy  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
  
And she'll tease you  
She'll unease you  
All the better just to please ya  
She's precocious, and she knows just  
What it takes to make a pro blush  
All the boys think she's a spy  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
  
She'll tease you  
She'll unease you  
Just to please ya  
She's got Bette Davis eyes  
She'll expose you, when she snows you  
She knows ya  
She's got Bette Davis eyes

I see your face in my mind as I drive away,  
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way  
People are people,  
And sometimes we change our minds  
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time  
  
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,  
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see  
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,  
Now I don't know what to be without you around  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,  
  
[Chorus]  
And I can't,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt  
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve  
People are people,  
And sometimes it doesn't work out,  
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's two am  
Feelin' like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know it's not easy,  
Easy for me  
  
It's two am  
Feelin' like I just lost a friend  
Hope you know this ain't easy,  
Easy for me  
  
And we know it's never simple,  
Never easy  
Never a clean break, no one here to save me  
  
I can't,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to,  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Breathe,  
Without you,  
But I have to  
  
Sorry (oh) sorry  
Sorry sorry  
Sorry sorry

Here you are now  
Fresh from your war  
Back from the edge of time  
And all that you were  
Stripped to the bone  
I thought you' d want to know  
  
That when you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless  
  
Lay down your guns  
Too weak to run  
Nothing can harm you here  
Your precious heart  
Broken and scarred  
Somehow you made it through  
I only ask that you won't go again  
  
When you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless  
  
I'm so glad to see you smiling  
So good to hear your laugh  
I think that you've found you even  
Missed yourself  
I'm only asking this because I think that  
Truth be told  
Oh, you'll never go again  
Again  
  
When you feel the world is crashing  
All around your feet  
Come running headlong into my arms  
Breathless  
I'll never judge you  
I can only love you  
Come now running headlong  
Into my arms  
Breathless  
Breathless  
So when you feel the world is crashing down  
I want you come run into my arms

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you  
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and  
You know it's all the same, another time and place  
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it  
But I believe in whatever you do  
And I'll do anything to see it through  
  
[Chorus]  
Because these things will change  
Can you feel it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down  
It's a revolution, the time will come  
For us to finally win  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah  
  
So we've been outnumbered  
Raided and now cornered  
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair  
We're getting stronger now  
Find things they never found  
They might be stronger  
But we're faster and never scared  
You can walk away, say we don't need this  
But there's something in your eyes  
Says we can beat this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees  
Fight for what we've worked for all these years  
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives  
But we'll stand up champions tonight  
  
It was the night things changed  
Can you see it now?  
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down  
It's a revolution, throw your hands up  
'Cause we never gave in  
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah  
Hallelujah

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing  
Would the song still survive without five golden rings  
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe  
What would happen if God never let it snow  
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie  
Tell me what would you find  
  
You'd see that today holds something special  
Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So here's something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
What if angels did not pay attention to  
All the things that we wished they would always do  
What if happiness came in a cardboard box  
Then I think there is something we all forgot  
What would happen if presents all went away  
Tell me what would you find  
  
You'd see that today holds something special  
Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So here's something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
We get so caught up in all of it  
Business and relationships  
Hundred mile an hour lives  
And it's this time of year  
And everybody's here  
It seems the last thing on your mind  
  
Is that the day holds something special  
Something holy, not superficial  
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives  
It's something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
But here's something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something  
Christmas must be something  
Christmas must be something more  
  
There's gotta be more  
There's gotta be more

Please take down the mistletoe  
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now  
Cause everything I want is miles away  
In a snow covered little town  
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me  
Season's greetings, hope you're well  
Well I'm doing alright  
If you were wondering  
Lately I can never tell  
  
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
I've been doing fine without you, really  
Up until the nights got cold  
And everybody's here, except you, baby  
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold  
  
But for me it's just a lonely time  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
Merry Christmas everybody  
That'll have to be something I just say this year  
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater  
And were your cousins late again  
When you were putting up the lights this year  
Did you notice one less pair of hands  
  
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
You were mine

You said it in a simple way,  
4 AM, the second day,  
How strange that I don't know you at all.  
Stumbled through the long goodbye,  
One last kiss, then catch your flight,  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself don't get attached,  
But in my mind I play it back,  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
The delicate beginning rush,  
The feeling you can know so much,  
Without knowing anything at all.  
And now that I can put this down,  
If I had known what I know now,  
I never would have played so nonchalant.  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets,  
That never bring you back to me,  
I can't help but wish you took me with you,  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in London today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,  
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.  
  
New York, be here.  
But you're in London and I break down,  
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.  
  
This is when the feeling sinks in,  
I don't wanna miss you like this,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
I guess you're in New York today,  
And I don't wanna need you this way,  
Come back, be here, come back, be here.  
  
I don't wanna miss you like this.  
Come back, be here.  
Come back, be here.

I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't wanna go there anymore  
And I know all the steps up to your door  
But I don't wanna go there anymore  
  
Talk to the wind  
Talk to the sky  
Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up and sing you a song  
But I don't wanna have to go that far  
And I, I've got you down  
I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start  
  
Talk to yourself  
Talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
And don't wait for the sky to clear  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I've watched you so long  
Screamed your name  
I don't know what else I can say  
  
But I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
For all these games  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
That you'll come in with the rain  
  
I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you  
Counting my footsteps,  
Praying the floor won't fall through, again  
My mother accused me of losing my mind,  
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky  
And go back and turn it to rain  
And I lived in your chess game,  
But you changed the rules every day  
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone  
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known  
  
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame  
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away  
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand  
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you
can"  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home  
  
Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong  
Don't you think nineteen is too young  
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?  
I should've known  
  
You are an expert at sorry,  
And keeping the lines blurry  
Never impressed by me acing your tests  
All the girls that you've run dry  
Have tired, lifeless eyes  
'Cause you burned them out  
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,  
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town  
  
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.  
  
I see it all now that you're gone  
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?  
The girl in the dress wrote you a song  
You should've known, you should've known  
Don't you think I was too young? You should've known

Verse:  
When I saw you today my hearts beats fast and I can't explain anything about
it doing something to see you day by day. Everything changes when I come in
your places.  
  
Chorus:  
Cause it down to the mountain and I can see you there hoping for sweet smile
and don't know what to do. I can't tell you about it because you have love
someone that you love more than me. But, someday you will love me.  
  
Bridge:  
It's going dark and I can't go home because when I see you, you make fall me
fall in live with you.  
  
Chorus:  
Cause it down to the mountain you make me smile I go and find another like you
cause down to the mountain you make me fall for you everyday.  
Cause down to the mountain you make me smile.....

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles  
Same old tired, lonely place  
Walls of insincerity  
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face  
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you  
  
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"  
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me  
The playful conversation starts  
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy  
And it was enchanting to meet you  
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
The lingering question kept me up  
Two a.m., who do you love?  
I wonder till I'm wide awake  
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door  
I'd open up and you would say, hey  
It was enchanting to meet you  
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
This night is flawless, don't you let it go  
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
This is me praying that this was the very first page  
Not where the story line ends  
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again  
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon  
I was enchanted to meet you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you  
  
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go  
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
This night is flawless, don't you let it go  
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone  
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew  
I was enchanted to meet you  
  
Please don't be in love with someone else  
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

Everybody's waiting,  
Everybody's watching,  
Even when you're sleeping,  
Keep your ah-eyes open.  
  
The tricky thing,  
Is yesterday we were just children,  
Playing soldiers just pretending,  
Dreaming dreams with happy endings,  
In backyards,  
Winning battles with the  
Wooden swords,  
But now we've stepped into a  
Cruel world,  
Where everybody stands and  
Keeps score,  
Keep your eyes open.

fallout,  
Even when your sleeping, sleeping, keep your ah-eyes open.

Keep your ah-eyes open.  
  
So here you are,  
Two steps ahead and stating  
On guard,  
Every lesson forms a new scar,  
They never thought you'd make it this far,  
But turn around,  
Now they've surrounded you,  
It's a showdown,  
Nobody comes to save you now,  
But you've got something they don't, yeah you've got something they don't, you
just gotta  
Keep your eyes open.  
  
Everybody's waiting, to see the breakdown, everybody's watching, to see the
fallout, even when your sleeping, sleeping, keep your ah-eyes open.

The night grows dark,  
Keep your eyes open.

Keep your ah-eyes open.  
Keep your ah-eyes open.

There's somethin' bout the way  
The street looks when it's just rained  
There's a glow off the pavement  
Walk me to the car  
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there  
In the middle of the parking lot  
Yeah  
  
We're drivin' down the road  
I wonder if you know  
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now  
But you're just so cool  
Run your hands through your hair  
Absent mindedly makin' me want you  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't know how it gets better than this  
You take my hand and drag me head first  
Fearless  
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance  
In a storm in my best dress  
Fearless  
  
So baby drive slow  
Til we run out of road in this one horse town  
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat  
You put your eyes on me  
In this moment now capture it remember it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well you stood there with me in the doorway  
my hands shake  
I'm not usually this way but  
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave  
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.  
  
[Chorus]

Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye  
And we caught onto something  
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me  
  
Were you just kidding?  
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down  
We almost never speak  
I don't feel welcome anymore  
Baby what happened? Please tell me  
  
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door  
  
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said forever and always  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Was I out of line?  
Did I say something way to honest, made you run and hide  
Like a scared little boy  
I looked into your eyes  
Though I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure  
  
So here's to everything coming down to nothing  
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core  
Where is this going? Though I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore  
  
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so  
  
Oh back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything?  
Back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything?  
  
'Cause it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when your gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all  
And the flashback to when you said forever and always  
  
And it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
You didn't mean it baby,  
You said forever and always, Yeah

Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye  
And we caught onto something  
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me  
  
Were you just kidding?  
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down  
We almost never speak  
I don't feel welcome anymore  
Baby what happened? Please tell me  
  
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when he said forever and always  
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Was I out of line?  
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide  
Like a scared little boy  
I looked into your eyes  
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure  
  
So here's to everything coming down to nothing  
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core  
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so  
  
Oh back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything?  
Back up, baby, back up  
Did you forget everything?  
  
'Cause it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
  
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called  
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all  
And you flashback to when we said forever and always  
  
And it rains in your bedroom  
Everything is wrong  
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone  
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always  
You didn't mean it baby,  
You said forever and always, yeah.

Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that.  
  
I don't even know her,  
But I feel a responsibility,  
To do what's upstanding and right,  
It's kinda like a code, yeah,  
And you've been getting closer and closer,  
And crossing so many lines.  
  
And it would be a fine proposition,  
If I was a stupid girl,  
But honey I am no-one's exception,  
This I have previously learned.  
  
So don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Ah ah, don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
I see you turn off your phone,  
And now you got me alone,  
And I say, don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that.  
  
I just wanna make sure,  
You understand perfectly,  
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,  
While she waits up,  
You chase down the newest thing,  
And take for granted what you have.  
  
And it would be a fine proposition,  
If I was a stupid girl,  
And yeah I might go with it,  
If I hadn't once been just like her.  
  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Ah ah, don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
I see you turn off your phone,  
And now you've got me alone,  
And I say, don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that.  
  
Call a cab,  
Lose my number,  
You're about to lose your girl,  
Call a cab,  
Lose my number,  
Let's consider this lesson learned.  
  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Ah ah, don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Wanna see you pick up your phone,  
And tell her you're coming home,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that,  
Don't look at me,  
You've got a girl at home,  
And everybody knows that,  
Everybody knows that.  
  
It would be a fine proposition,  
If I hadn't once been just like her.

You and I walk a fragile line  
I have known it all this time  
But I never thought I'd live to see it break  
It's getting dark and its all too quiet  
And I can't trust anything now  
And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake  
  
Holding my breath, won't lose you again  
Something's made your eyes go cold  
  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you're gone  
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted  
  
Stood there and watched you walk away  
From everything we had  
But I still mean every word I said to you  
He will try to take away my pain  
And he just might make me smile  
But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead  
Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again  
Something keeps me holding on to nothing  
  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you're gone  
Can't turn back, now I'm haunted  
  
I know, I know, I just know  
You're not gone, you can't be gone  
No  
  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started  
Come on, come on don't leave me like this  
I thought I had you figured out  
Can't breathe whenever you're gone  
Can't go back, I'm haunted  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
You and I walk a fragile line  
I have known it all this time  
Never ever thought I'd see it break  
Never thought I'd see it

Wish I had concentrated,  
They said love was complicated,  
But it's something I just fell into.  
And it was overrated,  
But just look what I created,  
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.  
Before you ask me if I'm alright,  
Think about what I,  
Had to do, yeah  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,  
Another mess I didn't plan.  
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,  
Wish you could only see,  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,  
But you had to talk about why  
You were wrong and I was right.  
But I can't believe you made me,  
Sit at home and cry like a baby,  
Wait right by the phone every night.  
And now you ask about you and I,  
There's no you and I,  
Remember what you put me through,  
I had to  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Fix my heart, put on my make-up,  
Another mess I didn't plan.  
And I'll bet you thought you beat me,  
Wish you could only see  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
And when you're home all alone at night,  
You'll still wonder why  
You took everything I had, oh baby.  
I haven't thought about you and I,  
There's no you and I, and I know  
Someday you will  
  
Wake up and smell the break up,  
Realize that we won't make up,  
It didn't go the way you planned.  
And you'll know you didn't beat me  
When you look down and see  
I got an "I Heart ?"  
Written on the back of my hand!  
  
Written on the back of my hand!  
An "I Heart ?", yeah.  
Written on the back of my hand!

Last night I heard my own heart beating  
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs  
Six months gone and I'm still reaching  
Even though I know you're not there  
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby  
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through  
Maybe I've been going back too much lately  
When time stood still and I had you  
  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would, you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
I know people change and these things happen  
But I remember how it was back then  
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing  
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,  
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street  
Flashback to a night when you said to me,  
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you  
Not before I knew how much I had to lose"  
  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would, you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
If you're out there  
If you're somewhere  
If you're moving on  
I'll be waiting for you  
Wary, since you've been gone  
I just want it back the way it was before  
And I just want to see you back at my front door  
And I say  
  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would before you say it's not that easy  
Before the fight, before I locked you out  
But I take it all back now  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You would, you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out  
Come back, come back, come back to me like  
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now  
  
You'd be here by now  
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now  
Baby, I don't like the ending  
Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa  
Thought you'd be here by now

Friday night beneath the stars  
In a field behind your yard  
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky  
And sometimes we don't say a thing  
Just listen to the crickets sing  
Everything I need is right here by my side  
And I know everything about you  
I don't wanna live without you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only up when you're not down  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  
It's like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half I'm only trying to  
Let you know that what I feel is true  
And I'm only me when I'm with you  
  
Just a small town boy and girl  
Livin' in a crazy world  
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true  
And I don't try to hide my tears  
The secrets are my deepest fears  
Through it all nobody gets me like you do  
And you know everything about me  
You say that you can't live without me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself  
Only you can tell  
  
That I'm only up when you're not down  
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground  
It's like no matter what I do  
Well you drive me crazy half the time  
The other half I'm only trying  
To let you know that what I feel is true  
  
And I'm only me  
When I wanna be  
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you  
With you  
Uh huh, yeah

I guess you really did it this time  
Left yourself in your warpath  
Lost your balance on a tightrope  
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back  
  
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?  
Always a bigger bed to crawl into  
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?  
And everybody believed in you?  
  
It's alright, just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
You're still an innocent  
  
Did some things you can't speak of  
But at night you'll live it all again  
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now  
If only you had seen what you know now then  
  
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?  
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you  
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?  
Before the monsters caught up to you?  
  
It's alright, just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
  
It's okay, life is a tough crowd  
Thirty two is still growin' up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
You're still an innocent  
  
Time turns flames to embers  
You'll have new Septembers  
Every one of us has messed up too  
  
Lives change like the weather  
I hope you remember  
Today is never too late to  
Be brand new  
  
It's all right, just wait and see  
Your string of lights are still bright to me  
Oh, who you are is not where you've been  
You're still an innocent  
  
It's okay, life is a tough crowd  
Thirty two, is still growin' up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
You're still an innocent  
You're still an innocent  
  
Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh  
It's never too late to get it back

She can't see the way your eyes  
Light up when you smile  
She'll never notice how you stop and stare  
Whenever she walks by  
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her  
But you are everything to me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just wanna show you  
She don't even know you  
She's never gonna love you like I want to  
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me  
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable  
Instead of just invisible  
  
There's a fire inside of you  
That can't help but shine through  
She's never gonna see the light  
No matter what you do  
And all I think about is how to make you think of me  
And everything that we could be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like shadows in a faded light  
Oh we're invisible  
I just wanna open your eyes  
And make you realize  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to show you, she don't even know you,  
Baby let me love you, let me want you".  
  
She can't see the way your eyes  
Light up when you smile

Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby  
Do you recognize me  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes  
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart  
Maybe this year  
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special  
  
'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
And last Christmas  
And this year  
It won't be anything like, anything like  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables  
Left a small town, never looked back  
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'  
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts  
  
I say, "can you believe it?"  
As we're lyin' on the couch  
The moment, I can see it  
Yes, yes, I can see it now  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?  
You put your arm around me for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together  
And there's a drawer of my things at your place  
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded  
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes  
  
And we got bills to pay  
We got nothin' figured out  
When it was hard to take  
Yes, yes  
This is what I thought about  
  
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?  
You put your arm around me, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  
You saw me start to believe, for the first time  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.  
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands  
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street  
  
Braced myself for the goodbye,  
'Cause that's all I've ever known  
Then, you took me by surprise  
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"  
  
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.  
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.  
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.  
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."  
  
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine  
  
Do you believe it?  
We're gonna make it now  
And I can see it  
  
(I can see it now)

Your little hands wrapped around my finger  
And it's so quiet in the world tonight  
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming  
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight  
  
To you, everything's funny  
You got nothing to regret  
I'd give all I have honey  
If you could stay like that  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
No one will desert you  
Just try to never grow up  
Never grow up  
  
You're in the car on the way to the movies  
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off  
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do  
And you can't wait to move out  
Someday and call your own shots  
  
But don't make her drop you off around the block  
Remember that she's getting older too  
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for
school  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
And no one's ever burned you  
Nothing's ever left you scarred  
And even though you want to  
Just try to never grow up  
  
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room  
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home  
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said  
And all your little brother's favorite songs  
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone  
  
So here I am in my new apartment  
In a big city, they just dropped me off  
It's so much colder than I thought it would be  
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on  
  
Wish I'd never grown up  
I wish I'd never grown up  
Oh I don't wanna grow up  
Wish I'd never grown up  
Could still be little  
Oh I don't wanna grow up  
Wish I'd never grown up  
It could still be simple  
  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
Just stay this little  
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up  
It could stay this simple  
I won't let nobody hurt you  
Won't let no one break your heart  
And even though you want to  
Please try to never grow up  
Don't you ever grow up  
Just never grow up

(Spoken):  
My name's Taylor Swift  
This is a cover song I'm gonna sing for you  
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra  
And its the song called Our Last Night  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.  
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar  
I hope the world never tore that out of you  
Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played, and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
And wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?  
Oh oh yeah  
And stars collide and the air's alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night?  
On our last night  
Oh oh oh oh oh  

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car  
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel  
The other on my heart  
I look around, turn the radio down  
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"  
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"  
And he said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day  
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on  
And lost and thrown away  
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed  
I almost didn't notice all the roses  
And the note that said,  
  
Our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window  
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow  
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know  
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
  
I've heard every album, listened to the radio  
Waited for something to come along  
That was as good as our song  
  
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door  
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window  
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow  
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know  
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date  
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have  
And when I got home, before I said amen  
Asking God if he could play it again  
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah  
  
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone  
In the front seat of his car  
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin  
And I wrote down our song

State the obvious,  
I didn't get my perfect fantasy  
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me  
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy  
That's fine!  
I'll tell mine  
You're gay  
By the way  
  
I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
There's no time for tears,  
I'm just sitting here  
Planning my revenge  
There's nothing stopping me  
From going out with all of your best friends  
And if you come around saying sorry to me  
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
If you're missing me,  
You'd better keep it to yourself  
'Cause coming back around here  
Would be bad for your health  
  
'Cause I hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
In case you haven't heard  
  
I really really hate that  
Stupid old pickup truck  
You never let me drive  
You're a redneck heartbreak  
Who's really bad at lying  
So watch me strike a match  
On all my wasted time  
As far as I'm concerned you're  
Just another picture to burn  
  
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn  
Just another picture to burn  
Baby, burn

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street  
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly  
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying
through the free fall  
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark grey all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Loving him was red  
  
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front
of you  
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song  
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's
no right answer  
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that
strong  
  
Losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
But loving him was red  
Oh red  
Burning red  
  
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes  
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go  
But moving on from him is impossible  
When I still see it all in my head  
Burning red  
Burning it was red  
  
Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known  
Missing him was dark gray all alone  
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met  
'Cause loving him was red  
Yeah, yeah red  
We're burning red  
  
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head  
Comes back to me, burning red  
Yeah, yeah  
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I remember your little laugh  
Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back  
  
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  
I can still feel you hold my hand  
Little man, from even that moment I knew  
You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember the drive home when the blind hope  
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And it's about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital  
We'll just disappear  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?  
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you  
  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
Come on baby with me  
We're gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I love you to the moon and back

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm and all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from Heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ our Savior is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God  
Love's pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at thy birth  
Jesus Lord at thy birth  
  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born

(Verse)  
I'm falling down low,  
No hand that I can hold,  
I'm left behind,  
They don't see the tears I cry.  
  
I cuddle up,  
Writing a song,  
About how I feel,  
They say that's crazy.  
  
(Hook)  
They don't understand my life,  
And the ways that I cry,  
Mmm-mmm  
Things are getting really hard,  
Can't search on google for my love  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
(Verse 2)  
They treat like me like I'm,  
A mental patient,  
Wish somebody,  
Could be in sync with me.  
  
(Hook)  
They don't understand my life,  
And the ways that I cry,  
Mmm-mmm  
Things are getting really hard,  
Can't search on google for my love  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
(Slow part)  
I hug the air,  
When reality hits me  
And no one's there.  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I hug the air  
When reality hits me  
I wish some one was there  
  
(Chorus)  
These nights are sleepless,  
These nights are cold,  
Wish I could have somebody  
Somebody to hold  
  
Don't care if it's for one night,  
I'll make do,  
I just want somebody  
Somebody to hold

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm  
And I'm a house of cards  
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running  
But I kinda know that I won't get far  
  
And you stood there in front of me just  
Close enough to touch  
Close enough to hope you couldn't see  
What I was thinking of  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around  
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile  
  
My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea  
You touch me once and it's really something  
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be  
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world  
But with you I know its no good  
And I could wait patiently  
But I really wish you would  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile  
  
I run my fingers through your hair  
And watch the lights go wild  
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me  
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right  
And lead me up the staircase  
Won't you whisper soft and slow  
And I'm captivated by you baby  
Like a fireworks show  
  
Drop everything now  
Meet me in the pouring rain  
Kiss me on the sidewalk  
Take away the pain  
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile  
  
Get me with those green eyes, baby  
As the lights go down  
Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around  
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile  
  
When sparks fly oh baby smile  
When sparks fly

I am not the kind of girl,  
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,  
But you are not the kind of boy,  
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl  
  
I sneak in and see your friends,  
And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,  
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,  
Somewhere back inside a room,  
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,  
This is surely not what you thought it would be,  
I lose myself in a daydream,  
Where I stand and say  
  
"Don't say yes, run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out,  
Of the church at the back door,  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,"  
And they said, "Speak now"  
  
Fond gestures are exchanged,  
And the organ starts to play  
A song that sounds like a death march,  
And I am hiding in the curtains,  
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,  
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,  
But I know you wish it was me,  
You wish it was me, don't you?  
  
Don't say yes, run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out,  
Of the church at the back door,  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,  
And they said, "Speak now"  
  
Don't say yes, run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out,  
Of the church at the back door,  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
Your time is running out,  
And they said, "Speak now"  
  
I hear the preacher say,  
"Speak now or forever hold your peace,"  
There's a silence, there's my last chance,  
I stand up with shaking hands,  
All eyes on me,  
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,  
But I'm only lookin' at you  
  
I am not the kind of girl,  
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,  
But you are not the kind of boy,  
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl  
  
Don't say yes, run away now,  
I'll meet you when you're out,  
Of the church at the back door,  
Don't wait or say a single vow,  
You need to hear me out,  
And they said, "Speak now"  
  
And you say, "Let's run away now,  
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door,  
Oh baby, I didn't say my vow,  
So glad you were around when they said, "Speak now"

I said oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight  
Like we're made of starlight  
  
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45  
Picks me up play one night out the window we were 17 and crazy  
Running wild, wild  
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in  
The night we snuck into a yacht club party  
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince  
  
And I said oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
  
He said look at you,  
Worrying so much about things you can't change  
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues  
If you keep thinking that way  
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me  
Don't you see the starlight, starlight  
Don't you dream impossible things  
  
Like, oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
  
Ooh, ooh he's talking crazy  
Ooh, ooh dancing with me  
Ooh, ooh we could get married  
Have 10 kids and teach them how to dream  
  
Oh my  
What a marvelous tune  
It was the best night  
Never would forget how we moved  
The whole place  
Was dressed to the nines  
And we were dancing, dancing  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we're made of starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Like starlight, starlight  
Like we dream impossible dreams  
Don't you see the starlight, starlight  
Don't you dream impossible things

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us  
How we met and the sparks flew instantly  
People would say, "they're the lucky ones"  
  
I used to know my place was a spot next to you  
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat  
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on  
  
Oh, a simple complication  
Miscommunications lead to fall out  
So many things that I wish you knew  
So many walls up I can't break through  
  
Now I'm standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say  
Since a twist of fate  
When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
Next chapter  
  
How'd we end up this way?  
See me nervously pulling at my clothes  
And trying to look busy  
And you're doing your best to avoid me  
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us  
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here  
But you held your pride like you should have held me  
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending  
Why are we pretending this is nothing?  
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how  
I've never heard silence quite this loud  
  
Now I'm standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say  
Since the twist of fate  
When it all broke down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now  
  
This is looking like a contest  
Of who can act like they care less  
But I liked it better when you were on my side  
The battle's in your hands now  
But I would lay my armor down  
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight  
So many things that you wish I knew  
But the story of us might be ending soon  
  
Now I'm standing alone  
In a crowded room  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know

Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now  
  
And we're not speaking  
And I'm dying to know  
Is it killing you  
Like it's killing me yeah  
I don't know what to say  
Since the twist of fate  
'Cause we're going down  
And the story of us  
Looks a lot like a tragedy now

Hey you! Just think while you're in a row of a sudden urge the best of all

to do it all day today I have a lot more to come back and the jokes on me I
have no idea what I was in a row of my favorite thing about being able a new
song on my old phone call to get my money where we can be used for the next
two weeks before finally getting.  
  
[Bridge]  
The jokes are you a lot of the year before I go to bed  
The jokes on the phone and the otherwise it would be  
The jokes about a month or more to do that in my inbox and a few tears  
Why are we doing this to be the jokes  
  
[Chorus]  
The jokes about you all of them  
The jokes about it is not the same  
The jokes about they're all that matters  
I put a smile on historical  
The jokes about you all of them  
The jokes about it is not the same  
The jokes about they're all that matters  
I put a smile on historical  
  
[Refrain x4]  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes  
The jokes, the jokes, the jokes, the jokes

New to town with a made up name in the angel city, chasing fortune and fame  
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream  
You had it figured out since you were in school  
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool  
So over night, you look like a sixties queen  
Another name goes up in lights  
Like diamonds in the sky  
  
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Now it's big black cars and Riviera views  
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you  
And your secrets end up, splashed on the news front page  
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused  
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used  
And all the young things line up to take your place  
Another name goes up in lights  
You wonder if you'll make it out alive  
  
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
It was a few years later, I showed up here  
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared  
They took the money and your dignity and got the hell out  
  
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere  
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square  
And it took some time but I understand it now  
'Cause now my name is up in lights  
But I think you got it right  
  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one  
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh

You should've been there,  
Should've burst through the door,  
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,  
And it would've felt like,  
A million little shining stars had just aligned,  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
Christmas lights glisten,  
I've got my eye on the door,  
Just waiting for you to walk in,  
But the time is ticking,  
People ask me how I've been  
As I comb back through my memory,  
How you said you'd be here,  
You said you'd be here.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
As I'm looking around the room,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
And the hours pass by,  
Now I just wanna be alone,  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When there's something really wrong,  
So they follow me down the hall,  
And there in the bathroom,  
I try not to fall apart,  
And the sinking feeling starts,  
As I say hopelessly,  
"He said he'd be here."  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all laughing,  
And asking me about you,  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know?  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didn't show?  
  
You should've been here.  
And I would've been so happy.  
  
And it was like slow motion,  
Standing there in my party dress,  
In red lipstick,  
With no one to impress,  
And they're all standing around me singing  
"Happy birthday to you",  
But there was one thing missing,  
And that was the moment I knew.  
  
Ooh, I knew.  
Ooh,  
  
You called me later,  
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"  
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"  
And that was the moment I knew.

In the heat of the fight I walked away  
Ignoring words that you were saying  
Trying to make me stay  
I said, 'This time I've had enough'  
And you've called a hundred times  
But I'm not picking up  
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over  
But if you look a little closer  
  
I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone  
Going through the photographs  
Staring at the phone  
I keep going back over, things we both said  
And I remember the slamming door  
And all the things that I misread  
So babe if you know everything  
Tell me why you couldn't see  
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me  
  
Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
And I'll scream out the window  
I can't even look at you  
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do  
I say, 'there's nothing you can say  
To make this right again'  
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I  
  
I said leave but baby all I want is you  
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles  
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'  
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more  
And don't you leave cause I know  
All I need is on the other side of the door  
  
With your face and the beautiful eyes  
And the conversation with the little white lies  
And the faded picture of a beautiful night  
You carried me from your car up the stairs  
And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess  
After everything and that little black dress  
After everything I must confess, I need you

He is sensible and so incredible  
And all my single friends are jealous  
He says everything I need to hear and it's like  
I couldn't ask for anything better  
He opens up my door and I get into his car  
And he says you look beautiful tonight  
And I feel perfectly fine  
  
[Chorus]  
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name  
You're so in love that you act insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breakin' down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you  
  
He respects my space  
And never makes me wait  
And he calls exactly when he says he will  
He's close to my mother  
Talks business with my father  
He's charming and endearing  
And I'm comfortable  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He can't see the smile I'm faking  
And my heart's not breaking  
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all  
And you were wild and crazy  
Just so frustrating intoxicating  
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now  
  
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name  
I'm so in love that I acted insane  
And that's the way I loved you  
Breakin' down and coming undone  
It's a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you  
  
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh  
Never knew I could feel that much  
And that's the way I loved you

He said the way my blue eyes shined  
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said: "That's a lie."  
Just a boy in a Chevy truck  
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck  
On back roads at night  
And I was right there beside him all summer long  
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone  
  
But when you think "Tim McGraw"  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think "that little black dress"  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
September saw a month of tears  
And thankin' God that you weren't here  
To see me like that  
But in a box beneath my bed  
Is a letter that you never read  
From three summers back  
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet  
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe  
  
But when you think "Tim McGraw"  
I hope you think my favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
The moon like a spotlight on the lake  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think "that little black dress"  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
And I'm back for the first time since then  
I'm standin' on your street  
And there's a letter left on your doorstep  
And the first thing that you'll read  
  
Is when you think "Tim McGraw"  
I hope you think my favorite song  
Someday you'll turn your radio on  
I hope it takes you back to that place  
When you think happiness  
I hope you think "that little black dress"  
Think of my head on your chest  
And my old faded blue jeans  
When you think Tim McGraw  
I hope you think of me  
  
Oh, think of me  
Mmm  
  
You said the way my blue eyes shined  
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night  
I said, "That's a lie."

Today was a fairytale  
You were the prince  
I used to be a damsel in distress  
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
I wore a dress  
You wore a dark gray t-shirt  
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess  
Today was a fairytale  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Today was a fairytale  
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet  
Every move you make everything you say is right  
Today was a fairytale  
Today was a fairytale  
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer  
Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
Yeah yeah  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Time slows down whenever you're around  
I can feel my heart  
It's beating in my chest  
Did you feel it?  
I can't put this down  
  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
But can you feel this magic in the air?  
It must have been the way you kissed me  
Fell in love when I saw you standing there  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
It must have been the way  
Today was a fairytale  
  
Oh oh yeah yeah oh  
Today was a fairytale

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
So may your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

Say you're sorry  
That face of an angel  
Comes out just when you need it to  
As I paced back and forth all this time  
'Cause I honestly believed in you  
Holding on  
The days drag on  
Stupid girl,  
I should have known, I should have known  
  
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale  
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,  
Lead her up the stairwell  
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you  
And your white horse, to come around  
  
Baby I was naive,  
Got lost in your eyes  
And never really had a chance  
My mistake I didn't know to be in love  
You had to fight to have the upper hand  
I had so many dreams  
About you and me  
Happy endings  
Now I know  
  
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale  
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,  
Lead her up the stairwell  
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,  
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down  
Now it's too late for you  
And your white horse, to come around  
  
And there you are on your knees,  
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me  
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry  
  
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale  
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well  
This is a big world, that was a small town  
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now  
And its too late for you and your white horse  
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now  
  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Try and catch me now  
Oh, it's too late  
To catch me now

He said, "Let's get out of this town,  
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds  
I thought heaven can't help me now."  
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down  
  
He's so tall and handsome as hell  
He's so bad but he does it so well  
I can see the end as it begins  
My one condition is  
  
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,  
Staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh, ah.  
  
I said, "No one has to know what we do,"  
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room  
And his voice is a familiar sound,  
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now  
  
He's so tall and handsome as hell  
He's so bad but he does it so well  
And when we've had our very last kiss  
My last request is  
  
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,  
Staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh, ah.  
  
You see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
You'll see me in hindsight  
Tangled up with you all night  
Burning it down  
Someday when you leave me  
I bet these memories  
Follow you around  
  
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,  
Staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just pretend  
  
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,  
Staring at the sunset, babe  
Red lips and rosy cheeks  
Say you'll see me again  
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend) wildest dreams, oh, ah,
in your wildest dreams, oh, ah  
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, ah, in your wildest dreams, ah,
ah.
