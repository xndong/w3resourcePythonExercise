In a dream of a desolate land  
Finding my feet on the wide white sand alone now  
Shot down in apathy during the war  
Never been north of the wise old Thames before  
  
Muslims and Christians, lions and tigers,  
Bombers and fighters  
Harder than they've seen before  
  
Any god that we've needed in time  
Stormed out the door and he slammed it shut behind  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die I'll die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
I'll know I've found myself back home  
  
My Legionnaire of today took all the food and he ran away just laughing  
'It's never too late', he said  
Out of his head as he walked towards the sun  
  
Round him........... ?  
Slumped into the ground, a cross upon his back  
Then we decided, heaven's a stranger away in a manger  
Never too big for the sack?  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die I'll die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
I'll know I've found myself back home  
  
Cultured by con men  
Fathered by fools  
Commerce is good business these days  
Compulsory waste in our schools  
  
He died to convince us all  
Nothing could make us fall but that's not true  
So I know myself, I know myself  
It's now or never  
  
When I leave is not important  
And when I die I'll die alone  
And when I see my camel crossing  
I'll know I've found myself back home

He blew into town like a paper sack  
In a stolen car with a shotgun in the back he said  
She can't run now, she can't hide  
I'm gonna get her back for her lies lies lies  
  
He taught her how to pout  
And he taught her how to tease  
And he taught her how to beg  
When she fell down to her knees he said  
Your face is different  
But you're really all the same  
I have to teach you a lesson again and again  
  
See I feel no pleasure  
And I feel no pain  
So what else can I do?  
I can't stop killing you  
  
When you're out there in the dark  
I'll come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
I'll be coursing through your veins  
When you're swimming in the water  
I'm the hand that drags you under  
I'm the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I can't stop killing you  
  
Well she woke up in the bathroom  
With her face upon the floor  
She said I don't know what I'm doing here  
But I've been here before  
And the fixit man had fixed her  
'Cause he's such a little hitler  
And he loves the feel of power  
That she gives him through her terror  
I can't stop killing you  
  
Well she looked into the mirror  
And she smoked her cigarette  
And she wondered where she'd go now  
To find a place she could forget  
All the things he said he'd do  
I can't stop killing you  
  
When you're out there in the dark  
I'll come rushing through your brain  
When you wake up in the morning  
I'll be coursing through your veins  
When you're swimming in the water  
I'm the hand that drags you under  
I'm the lightning that strikes you  
Just before you hear the thunder  
I can't stop killing you

(kirsty maccoll)  
She called me up the other day  
And left a message on my machine  
She called to say you broke her heart  
And she'd wondered if I'd seen you  
I didn't know what to do, I never called her back  
Oh how can I break the news like that  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine  
Can't look in her eyes and tell her love is blind  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
How can I want you so bad  
She has to lose again  
How could you walk out on her  
And turn to her best friend  
It was wrong from the start  
I wish I'd turned you away  
And my head said go, but my heart, my heart said stay  
And now I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her cry when she knows you're mine  
Can't look in those eyes and tell her she'll be fine  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I'm so ashamed of myself that I still want you  
What a terrible thing for a friend to do  
I think I've gone too far this time  
I leapt across that thin blue line  
God help this selfish heart of mine  
Now I don't want to see caroline  
I can never face caroline  
Now I lie here with you, can't get her out my head  
Do you think she knows that you share my bed  
Well I don't want to see caroline  
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine  
How could a friend be so unkind  
Well I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  
I don't want to see caroline  

Children of the revolution coming out to play  
Bombers ripped the night apart and blew the school away  
Some live on the south side and they overlook the water  
Some live on the north side and they're looking at the border  
And those children of the revolution see the soldiers come  
Smiling at the widows as they take away the sons  
Children of the revolution shot down with a brand new gun  
They're dropping down like flies and in their eyes  
The images of war are in their eyes  
They've seen it all before and know your lies  
Won't keep their bellies full  
In love and war there are no rules  
Children of the revolution getting off the boat  
To face the ignorance and prejudice that keep this land afloat  
Children of the revolution make a brand new start  
Running through the rubble of a thousand broken hearts and in their eyes  
All promises are broken in their eyes  
The words that can't be spoken and your lies  
Don't keep their bellies full  
In love and war there are no rules  
But in their eyes  
Murder comes by sea and from the skies  
It's shiny and it's quick to take their lives  
And if it's cruel, in love and war there are no rules  
Children of the revolution coming out to play  
Someone sells a gun and someone blows them all away  
Children of the revolution sold out by the banks  
Who swap the green upon the dollars for the green upon the tanks  
Children of the revolution shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun  
Shot down by a brand new gun  

When you do know what you don't know  
When you can't tell what you do know  
And it gets so very hard to see  
  
And if you weren't expecting trouble  
And I burst your little bubble  
Well I'm sorry babe, but you can count on me  
  
I know I get a little crazy sometimes  
I know you think I'm driving you out of my mind  
I know you love me and I don't make it easy but you can count on me  
  
You can count on me  
To do the wrong thing at the right time  
Say the right thing at the wrong time  
I have a hard time with my synchronicity  
  
And I know I should remember  
Never never lose my temper  
But you know it isn't easy being me  
  
I'm always early or too late  
I know I often make you wait  
I don't mean to get you in a state  
No you can count on me, darling  
You can count on me  
  
And if I seem to see the hours go so quick like summer flowers  
I have a problem with the bright side  
You can see  
So if I seem a little stateless sometimes  
Rest assured that I'm just unsure of just where I should be  
And don't mistake me for faithless no, no  
I promise you now you can count on, you can count on me  
  
And so I get a little crazy sometimes  
But there's so much of this world that I want to see  
And if you want to come with me now  
I won't let you down  
No, you can count on me

Darling, let's have another baby  
Let's make one soon on our second honeymoon  
Darling, I need you to be near me  
To kiss and to touch, I love you very much  
Darling, if you ever leave me  
I'll cry a million tears  
I'll go to the nearest boozer  
And drink ten pints of beer  
  
Darling, let's have another baby  
Let's make one soon on our second honeymoon  
Darling, I need you to be near me  
To kiss and to touch, I love you very much  
Darling, if you ever leave me  
I'll cry a million tears  
I'll go to the nearest boozer  
And drink ten pints of beer  
  
Darling, let's have another baby  
Let's make one soon on our second honeymoon  
Darling, when we have our baby  
I'll be quite happy to wash and change its nappy  
Darling, oh  
Darling, oh  
Darling, oh  
Darling, oh

Oh dear john  
I hate to be the one to break the news  
But it's concerning me and you  
This is the letter no-one ever wants to write  
You may not believe me but it's the hardest thing I've ever done  
My eyes see other glories  
Other dreams and other stories  
And I want to live before I die  
Dear john  
  
Ten years on  
I still dream and we still hesitate  
The passion's all but gone  
Oh dear john  
Seems we have a bad day every day  
I want to sleep my life away  
This is the letter no-one ever wants to read  
And though it hurts like hell  
It may be what you need to tell you  
I never wanted to be cruel  
But I'm so tired of being the strong one  
And I don't always havet he energy  
And you always leave it up to me  
Dear john  
  
My eyes have seen the glory  
There's more to life than my life story  
And I'll probably never find him  
But I have to keep on looking  
And I'm very very sorry dear john

There's a brand new car in your driveway  
And a blonde new girl in your bed  
You've everything you ever wished for  
Happy little bubblehead  
And you can't fill it up with promises  
You can't fill it up with lies  
And you can't fill it up with business lunches  
Oh but you can try  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl that you despise  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
There's a big house high on a hilltop  
And another house in spain  
Mummy's little soldier's riding on the gravy train  
And my you're looking lovely  
May you stay forever young  
May you never get a conscience  
About the things that you have done  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl to twist the knife  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
Who am I to criticise you?  
Just a girl that you despise  
Welcome to designer living  
This is your designer life  
This is your designer life  
You and your designer life  

Don't go near the water  
Don't you think it's sad  
What's happened to the water  
Our water's going bad  
Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams  
Have all been touched by man  
Poison flowing out to sea  
Now threatens life on land  
  
Don't go near the water  
Ain't it sad  
What's happened to the water  
It's going bad  
  
Don't go near the water  
Don't go near the water  
  
Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath  
So that's a modern ecological aftermath  
Beginning with me  
Beginning with you  
  
Don't go near the water  
To do it any wrong  
To be cool with the water  
Is the message of this song  
Let's all help the water  
Right away  
Do what we can and ought to  
Let's start today

Out in the West Texas town of El Paso  
I fell in love with a Mexican girl  
Night-time would find me in Rosa's Cantina  
Music would play and Felina would whirl  
  
One night a wild young cowboy came in  
Wild as the West Texas wind  
Dancing and daring, a drink he was sharing  
With wicked Falina, the girl that I loved  
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden  
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore  
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat  
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  
  
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran  
Out where the horses were tied  
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run  
Up on its back and away I did ride  
Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso  
Out to the badlands of New Mexico  
I saddled up and away I did go  
Riding alone in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me  
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  
  
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso  
I can see Rosa's Cantina below  
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys  
Off to my left ride a dozen or more  
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me  
I have to make it to Rosa's back door  
Something is dreadfully wrong for I fear  
A deep burning pain in my side  
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle  
I'm getting weary, unable to ride  
But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen  
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest  
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle  
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest  
  
From out of nowhere Felina has found me  
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side  
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for  
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

Oh you shouldn't have kissed me and got me so excited  
And when you asked me out I really was delighted  
So we went to a pub in belsize park  
And we cheered on england as the sky grew dark  
Oh you shouldn't have kissed me cause you started a fire  
But then I found out that you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You never mentioned your three children  
And the fact you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
If you hadn't passed out while I was talking to your friend  
It could have really ended badly cause you very nearly had me  
If he hadn't taken pity on my heart full of desire  
I might never have found out you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
You forgot you have three children  
You forgot you have a wife  
Now it's england 2 colombia 0  
And I know just how those colombians feel  
  
It is not in my nature to ever pick the winning team  
Sometimes I think I'm happy then I remember it's a dream  
Now it isn't in my nature to ever pick a winner  
I always pick a bastard who would have me for his dinner  
  
I can never possess the object of my desire  
Cause he's bound to turn out to be a serial liar  
Ok I didn't mention my kids, I thought I'd wait a bit  
But I am free and single and he's a lying git  
  
Cause he lied about his status  
He lied about his life  
He forgot he had three children  
He forgot he had a wife  
And it's england 2 colombia 0  
I know just how those colombians feel  
  
So I got into a taxi and sobbed all the way home  
Called my friend up in sao paulo and cried down the phone  
I played some tragic music and I lay down to die  
But later I woke and I hadn't stopped crying  
  
You should never have kissed me, you tasted of deceit  
Your perfume was adultery but I'm not a piece of meat  
So I'll be the one that you couldn't acquire  
I found out in time you're a serial liar  
  
You lied about your status  
You lied about your life  
And I pity your three children  
And I pity your poor wife  
Now you can go to hell  
I'm going to brazil  
Still it's england 2 colombia 0

It was Christmas eve babe  
In the drunk tank  
An old man said to me, won't see another one  
And then he sang a song  
The rare old mountain dew  
I turned my face away  
And dreamed about you  
  
Got on a lucky one  
Came in eighteen to one  
I've got a feeling  
This year's for me and you  
So happy Christmas  
I love you baby  
I can see a better time  
When all our dreams come true  
  
They've got cars big as bars  
They've got rivers of gold  
But the wind goes right through you  
It's no place for the old  
When you first took my hand  
On a cold Christmas eve  
You promised me  
Broadway was waiting for me  
  
You were handsome  
You were pretty  
Queen of new york city  
When the band finished playing  
They howled out for more  
Sinatra was swinging,  
All the drunks they were singing  
We kissed on a corner  
Then danced through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
The boys of the nypd choir  
Were singing "galway bay"  
And the bells were ringing out  
For Christmas day  
  
You're a bum  
You're a punk  
You're an old slut on junk  
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed  
You scumbag, you maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy christmas your arse  
I pray god it's our last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I could have been someone  
Well so could anyone  
You took my dreams from me  
When i first found you  
I kept them with me babe  
I put them with my own  
Can't make it all alone  
I've built my dreams around you  
  
[Chorus]

He had the kind of face she'd seen on the tv  
He drove her home one night and made her happy  
He used to phone her after work at the weekend  
And took her out when he had some money to spend  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
  
After a while she used to see him every day  
And pretty soon when they had run out of things to say  
Ideas came to her she tried to ignore  
Got what she wanted but now she wasn't so sure  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
The light of the screen grew too bright in her dreams  
She was searching for something she'd lost in her teens  
  
Misunderstandings caused by lack of honesty  
They got him worried, got her feeling guilty  
Felt so sincere but she was easily impressed  
And every time she had the chance she got undressed  
  
Falling for faces, changing places  
Just like the hard cases out on the... [?]  
Falling for faces  
Falling for faces

Where can I find the words to describe  
The way that I feel with you by my side?  
Everyone can see that you are good for me  
I always dreamed some day I'd find you  
Now I can put my arms around you  
And everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes, I think I do deserve you  
Yes, I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too  
I'll tell you a story of love lost and found  
There's no-one else for me now you are around  
And everyone can see that you are good for me  
Cut me adrift in the bluest of skies  
I'm so close to heaven, it was such a surprise  
Now everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes, I think I do deserve you  
Yes, I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too  

Happy to see you again  
I'm happy 'cos you're a girl's best friend  
I love it when you get real close  
But I don't smile so no-one knows  
That I'm happy just to be next to you  
And I love the way you do the things you do  
And it doesn't have to be so hard  
To get happy when love's in charge  
And I'm happy, I'm feeling really free  
And I'm not satisfied with misery  
I said I'm h a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
Did I ever tell you just how much I love you?  
I may have forgotten sometimes  
With the boats and the stars and the wine in the glass  
And the touch of your body on mine  
You make me h a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)  
H a p p p p y (happy)

Sometimes you look so sad that I could cry  
And sometimes when you get mad I want to say goodbye  
But I know in my heart I could never be the one to leave  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
I try to understand all the things that you do  
But sometimes I wonder why I chose a man like you  
'cause you hurt me without even trying so many times  
I can't help but find love so hard to believe sometimes  
Sometimes I see your eyes on another girl  
Then you say you love me more than the whole wide world  
So I've learned to close my eyes to it and not read between the lines  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
Yes I've learned to close my eyes to it  
I've reconciled my mind to it  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
I said that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  

All babies together, everyone one a seed  
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need  
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world? A nation planted so concerned
with gain  
As the seasons come and go greater grows the pain  
Far too many feeling the strain  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world?  
  
Gather every man  
Gather every woman  
Celebrate your lives  
Give thanks for your children  
Gather everyone  
Gather all together  
Overlooking none  
Hoping life gets better for the world  
When will there be a harvest for the world?  
  
Dress me up for battle when all I want is peace  
Those of us who pay the price come home with the least  
Nation after nation turning into beasts  
Oh when will there be a harvest for the world?

You go to my head till I'm losing my mind  
Your beautiful words stretch me out on a blanket of sky  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
You go to my head, I dream I am loved  
You're flowing through me like a river of poetry  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
So keep feeding the fire, I can't get any higher  
Till the night burns with the fire of a thousand stars  
You go to my head and I know I'm alive  
You could waken the dead with your beautiful mind  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
I don't want to come down, no, I don't want to come down  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  
Just want to stay lost in your eyes  

Here comes that man again  
It's always round midnight  
That Amsterdam creeps into my PC  
After a long hard day selling pornography  
  
He likes to come home and talk to me  
He's got his mind on the job but  
His technological props  
Oops, another file on the email  
  
And though I'm scared to click open  
I just can't help having a look  
Oh, here comes that man again  
A car crash in my psyche  
  
My curiosity's driving me  
Yes here he comes again  
Who'd have thought I'd have as much fun  
With an anonymous Dutchman?  
  
I never knew I had it in me  
He says the camera is on and  
Can I see him yet?  
I say "Babe you look like a ghost  
  
And sound like a Dalek to me"  
So let's go back to the written word  
Even though we both know it's absurd  
Here comes that man again  
  
Here comes that man again  
Here comes that man again  
Here comes that man again  
He knows that I'm online  
  
"Knock knock, who's there?"  
It's just a matter of time  
Here comes millennium man  
Rum and coke in one hand  
  
And in the other...  
Is that a mouse a see?  
Although when I tell him he's corny  
It seems to make him quite horny  
  
And through the cyberspace  
I watch the rapture on his face  
Yes while his girlfriend is sleeping  
His sexuality's peeking  
  
Here comes that man again  
After a long hard day  
He likes to come home and talk to me  
He says it's something he needs  
  
He can't stop spilling the seeds  
God bless European unity  
And all those who never sleep  
  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off  
  
Another stain on another blue dress  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off baby  
Sha la la la la, get your rocks off  
Yes, yes

He was just a friend of mine  
I'd run in to from time to time  
And long before he moved away  
We used to share a taste for wine  
Still I never knew that he was sad back then  
He said, the time had come, for him, to take a holiday  
And he says it's brilliant there  
There's something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
He's on the beach  
I know he's changed somehow, he sends us postcards now  
I'm not sure where he is, but he is out of reach  
When he called me up one day  
And said that he was going away  
I thought he meant a week in France  
And not 12,000 miles to Sydney Bay  
Still he had to take his chances  
He said, the time had come for him to make a move away  
And he says it's brilliant there  
There's something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
He's on the beach  
I know he's changed somehow, he writes us postcards now  
He's on his own again and he is out of reach  
(I bet he gets it on the beach)  
And I don't blame him  
Leaving was the best thing he could do  
He longed for changes  
I just hope he's happy when he does the things he thinks he has to do  
And he tries, and he tries, yes he tries  
But he's a little bit hard on himself  
So now he's trying to be someone else  
And he says, he says, he says it's brilliant there  
There's something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
He's on the beach  
I know he's changed somehow, it's in his postcards now  
He's on his own again, so far out of reach  
And he says it's brilliant there  
There's something in the air  
And sunshine everywhere  
He's on the beach  
I know he's changed somehow, it's in his postcards now  
He's in Australia, so far out of reach  
And he says it's brilliant there  

I am afraid of the dark  
I am afraid of the day  
I am afraid to walk outside  
And of what people say  
  
I am afraid to drink too much  
Because of what I might do  
I am afraid to speak my mind  
And of being with you  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to be unloved  
I am afraid to be forsaken  
I am afraid of doing wrong  
And to never be forgiven  
  
I am afraid that you will find  
I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not afraid to be alone  
And of the unknown  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for you  
  
I am afraid to laugh out loud  
Or to stand out of the crowd  
I am scared of loving you  
I am scared to lose you  
  
I am afraid to lose control  
I am afraid of growing old  
I am afraid to die  
But it's something I must do  
  
It's not that I'm not strong  
It's just that I'm not strong enough for you  
It's not that I'm not brave  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave,  
It's just that I'm not brave enough for two

I hear a lot of talk about the things you say are good for me to do  
I've tried cooperation but I don't get nothing coming back from you  
  
So don't you like my face?  
No you look just fine  
Don't I know my place?  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you  
  
What am I gonna do, you drive me crazy when you say those things you say  
Every time I see you you have to fight the urge to walk the other way  
  
Don't you like my face?  
No you look just fine  
Don't I know my place?  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you  
  
I don't need you to tell me what to wear  
You can say that I don't care, it's true  
I don't need you to tell me how to speak  
I won't become some kind of geek like you  
  
Just to hear you talk you'd think the world revolves 'round what you've got to
say  
Now you can give me trouble but I'm going to give it back to you some day  
  
You don't like my face  
No you look just fine  
I don't know my place  
No you're out of line  
Should I shave off my hair?  
Yeah, and I'll shave mine  
I don't like the things you try to make me do  
And I don't need you  
I don't need you

I'd like to say that you gave me the best days of your life  
So have one on me  
I've been away but I think of you much more these days  
Thanks for the memories  
Here comes the moon again  
It makes me think of when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
He looked so happy then  
I can't believe that he's gone at all  
My irish cousin  
  
He said "surprise!"  
And I could not believe my eyes  
When I saw love  
Yes I saw love  
  
Hey, it's good to hear your voice  
Even if I'm number 32 in your little black book of things to do  
Hey, would you like to go out today  
Maybe see a show  
I don't know about you  
So little time, so many things to do  
I used to have these conversations all of the time  
With my irish cousin  
  
Well, here comes the moon again  
I can't believe that's when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
We had a row in every bar in dublin  
But we loved it 'cause we were equal  
Two very lonely people  
Oh, is it too late to tell him that I miss him?  
I can't remember kissing him goodbye  
My irish cousin  
  
I let him down so many times but he never kicked me out  
He let me cry, he'd let me shout  
He said "that's what it's all about"  
Here comes the moon again  
It makes me think of when I last saw  
My irish cousin  
  
He made me laugh beyond the call of duty and I loved him  
I'm so glad I told him  
But maybe that's what did him in  
I wouldn't put it past him  
My irish cousin  
  
He said "surprise!"  
And I could not believe my eyes  
When I saw love  
Yes I saw love  
In my irish cousin

Behind a burning bush he's waiting  
Like a sleepless night  
So silent and so strong  
I know that I must push push push  
Until the morning light  
Don't make me wait too long  
  
Till I open my eyes  
Open the door  
Take a walk outside  
And feel the sun  
Fall on my skin  
It's time to get up  
But not time to give in  
I just woke up  
  
With eyes as cold as ice cream  
Floating in a frozen lake  
I have to set the spark  
And stroke the fire within him  
Oh I have to see him smile  
To have a happy heart  
  
I opened my eyes  
Walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes  
When I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
One day I just woke up  
I opened my eyes  
Opened the door took a walk outside  
And what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes when I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
Oh let me open my eyes  
Open the door and look up to the skies  
And leave the shore  
And let my hand trail in the cool water  
Float downstream, say goodbye to  
That dream--I just woke up  
  
I opened my eyes  
I walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my mind when I  
Opened the door--I just woke up

We've been friends for oh so long  
I let you share what's mine  
But when it comes to the boy I love  
It's time to draw the line  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
I don't mind lending you my clothes  
My jewelry and such  
But honey let's get something straight  
There's one thing you don't touch  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
That boy is mine

King Kong, you gotta come home  
You've a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Are you receiving OK?  
  
King Kong you done what you shouldn't a did  
You got a woman back home and a couple of kids  
And they get so tired of waiting  
  
And if we lived in another world  
I'd be a boy and you'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ...  
  
I will repair all the pavements you've cracked if you come back and say you'll
be mine  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
King Kong, you gotta come home  
You've a wife and family all alone in the jungle  
Do you remember OK?  
  
King Kong, hanging out in LA  
It's a change from New York  
Won't you have a nice day  
You may even get a movie come your way  
  
And if we lived in another world  
You'd be a boy and I'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ... who knows ...  
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If you're gentle and you will be kind  
You stomping off to the US of A wasn't quite what I had in my mind  
  
And if we lived in another world  
I'd be a boy and you'd be a girl  
If we lived in another world  
Who knows ... who knows ...  
  
I will repair all the pavements you've cracked if you come back and say you'll
be mine  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine  
  
I will give back all the love you can give  
If you're gentle and you will be kind  
Yes, I will fix all the mortars and bricks  
But a tree house will do us just fine

I think I just recalled a time  
It was not the moon and not the wine  
And though you said you were a friend of mine  
I never felt that way inclined  
Oh the days were hot and the nights were long  
I must have sung a million songs  
But all the words just came out wrong  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line  
Hoped everything would turn out fine  
But I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day  
And then the rain came down and  
Sparkled the signs of the underground  
And the darkness fell all over town  
On the last day  
  
I think I dropped my guard that time  
I was flesh and blood and grit and slime  
And I think I may have lost my mind  
On the last day of summer  
I think I fell in love back there  
It was tooth and nail it was bones and hair  
And you'll never never know how much I cared  
On the last day of summer  
  
And though I think I fell that time  
It was not the only fault of mine  
But all I wanted was a sign  
On the last day  
I think you broke my heart that day  
And nothing I could do or say  
Could make the coldness go away  
On the last day  
  
The winter changes everything  
And the raindrops freeze  
On the signs of the underground  
I wonder will you think of me  
When you look up and see  
There's a full moon over London Town  
  
I think I was away the day  
When you said you were too smart to play  
And you'd only beat me anyway  
It's funny how I would have stayed  
And you said you were a friend of mine  
But that's not what I had in mind  
I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line -  
Hoped everything would turn out fine

Days of old when knights were bold, Britain ruled supreme  
Songs were sung and tales were told, life was like a dream  
Top men like the great King Arthur never came here ever after  
Ever since those gallant heroes gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Noted for diplomacy, once the mighty fall  
Touching pmp of pageantry, history books all show  
Husky dogs and great explorers  
Mighty kings and sage warriors  
Trouble take me since they're dead and gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Early evening entertainment  
People sleeping on the pavement  
In the eyes of god we must be wrong  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Time was when a British Empire was in full control  
France and Spain were just the same if the truth be known  
Now the walls are down in Europe  
Forming laws with certain Arabs?  
Better get your petrol while you can  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
Like the grip of an old King Kong  
From South Africa to Hong Kong  
Now the times are moving on and  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
In the days gone by we'd pay for the things we'd got  
Now we pay to advertise while we sell the lot  
All the companies we started sold out on the open market  
Where are jobs now that they're gone?  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
If we're sure we want to stay  
On this, our base for the us of A  
Then it's time that we should say that  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said, falling down  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
London Bridge is falling down

The rain attacks my bedroom window  
The thunder roars above  
Tonight's the night, well should have been  
A night spent with my love  
  
But the rain still pours above my head  
And fills me with despair  
What am I doing waiting for him?  
The man with no name doesn't care  
  
When the time comes, who will reveal  
The love I once had, and the way I now feel?  
For the man with no name, I did love so well  
So when the time comes, whom shall I tell?  
  
I walk through this old lonely house  
The tears fill up my eyes  
How could I have fallen for his old tricks?  
His cheating ways and lies  
  
I know I should have read the signs  
But he lured me to his lair  
What am I doing waiting for him?  
The man with no name doesn't care  
  
So when the time comes, who will reveal  
The love I once had, and the way I now feel?  
For the man with no name, I did love so well  
So when the time comes, whom shall I tell?  
  
He said that he would treat me right  
He said he loved me so  
But here I am waiting for him  
But the man with no name doesn't care  
  
No, the man with no name doesn't care

The ship was heaving with a mass of humankind  
My heart was grieving for the the land that lay behind  
The cruel ocean echoed all those sad goodbyes  
That at my leaving almost made me change my mind  
The night was darker than my scared and lonely eyes  
  
And then that old Manhattan moon began to rise  
And there stood Liberty in silhouetted skies  
And from that moment on I knew that I'd embrace  
Each opportunity to be a part of this place  
Five points and then Hell's Kitchen  
All stops in between  
Somewhere to find an itchin' for this keen Colleen  
Didn't stop me yearning now and then for my old world  
Dreamed I might return just once again to that old world  
But in my heart a piano roll played ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love that old Manhattan moon  
  
I swore allegiance at each rising of the moon  
And learned by heart each swinging Yankee Doodle tune  
And from the moment it first caught me in its beam  
I knew that moon would guide my old American dream  
Five points to Fifth Avenue Central  
All stops in between  
No time to get too sentimental for any shade of green  
That don't stop me yearning now and then for that funny old world  
Could be I'll return just once again to that funny old world  
But in my heart a piano roll plays ragtime like it stirred my soul  
The moment that it greeted me and skilfully entreated me  
To make my new home beneath that old Manhattan moon  
I love my old Manhattan moon

(kirsty maccoll)  
Maybe it's imaginary, I'd like to know  
What's the world coming to and where will it go?  
The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in  
It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin  
And I don't know why, who will reveal?  
Maybe it's imaginary, maybe it's real  
We wash all the food and we peel off the skin  
But what is the point if it's poisoned within?  
Now I don't know why we say ok  
Maybe it's imaginary, hope it's not too late  
And when in the summer we go to the sea  
The things floating by aren't what we want to see  
And I'd change it all if I had one wish  
I'd never go swimming with those nuclear fish  
Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry  
But if it's true then I'd like to know why  
I don't know much but I'd like to know why

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down on lover's lane she strayed  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone  
Madam  
She ran to the man who had lead her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail  
Madam  
They strung her upon the old willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried  
Madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

'Mother's ruin', she said to herself  
"I'm just screwing my own mental health"  
But Fridays and Saturdays  
She walks down those alleyways  
A latter day lady of the lamp  
How you doing? You ain't from round here  
Won't you come in? I'm really not scared  
'Cause Fridays and Saturdays  
I still do it anyways  
And anything is better than out there  
Now don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
So I won't cry myself dry anymore  
Mother's ruin, their own little girls  
Keep them dreaming, there's more to this world  
But turn her the other way  
And every day is 'Father's Day'  
He stays until there's nothing left to say  
But don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
'Cause I can't take it 'round here anymore  
Now don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
So you won't make my heart ache anymore  
Leave the light on and don't shut the door  

It's no use knocking on my door  
I won't be answering any more  
So don't come round here like you did before  
I'm moving out, no doubt about it  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on, let's go  
  
Take the bicycle that's in the hall  
Take the pictures and the ducks off the wall  
This is it, don't let the teardrops fall  
I'm moving out today  
  
Take the video  
Take the stereo  
Take the dog and the cat and the Bonio  
Take the TV and the rug and the radio  
I packed my bags  
Come on, let's go

When I was just a child  
My folks would drive me wild  
They'd spy upon my every move  
Until it drove me to despair  
They told me what to wear  
They told me not to cut my hair  
But that's all over now  
I had to tell them anyhow  
  
It's my affair  
Where I go and what I do  
It's my affair oh yeah  
It's my affair  
It's up to me and not to you  
It's my affair  
  
That's the way I want to keep it  
I kissed the boy in secret  
Thrilled me to the very core  
I couldn't stop I wanted more and  
I didn't hear the door and  
They caught me on the floor  
With my affair  
  
And when we first got wed  
We used to stay in bed  
All day and night all night and day  
We bedded half our lives away  
But that's all over now  
We move in higher circles  
Chomping through the upper crust  
I couldn't see you for the dust  
And then you met that girl  
Who left you with your money spent  
And now it's no concern of yours  
If I sleep with the President  
  
It's my affair  
And if I don't come home tonight  
It's my affair alright  
It's my affair  
Who I see is up to me  
It's my affair  
  
That's how I want to keep it  
I kiss the boys in secret  
Hiding in the parking lot  
Is just as far as I have got but  
If the phone should ring and  
There's no one there  
Then it's my affair  
  
Eso es asunto de ella  
Donde va why lo que hare  
  
Well it's all over now  
You've seen the last of me  
And I don't have to put up with you  
Giving me the third degree  
So you go on your way  
And don't come sneaking round the back door  
Trying to get yourself

(kirsty maccoll)  
I must have been driving all day  
But I'm getting no further away  
All these towns look the same  
And the rain is falling in my eyes  
Take me away  
See all my friends for a day  
It's strange but it's true  
I'm no longer hurting without you  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
And you're not someone I'd lay down and die for  
I was seeing the world through your eyes  
There was not much left not to despise  
It's a shame but it's true  
I started to feel things like you do  
But I'm not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up I won't even be here  
Sod all your funny little ways  
They don't make me laugh these days any more  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
Or some sad lonely encounter the night before  
I'm no victim to pity and cry for  
From some sad desperate collision the night before  
No I'm not tearing my heart out for you dear  
And when you wake up I'll be miles away from here  
Baby, I know  

I'm staying home this evening  
And playing my guitar  
And all the time I'm strumming  
I'm wondering where you are  
Oh yes I know it's over  
I know I shouldn't care  
But I can't get away from you  
It seems you're always there  
How come I don't see you anymore?  
How come we lost the magic touch?  
Why can't I pick up the telephone  
When I want to call you so much?  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't still breaking mine  
The winter's drawing in again  
Another year has passed  
Now I think of things I meant to say  
But the time went by so fast  
I hear you're living in new york these days  
And you don't come here any more  
I keep asking myself so many questions  
But lately I wonder what I'm wondering for  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't still breaking mine  
I let you pass me by  
I never tried too hard  
Though you'll never see me cry  
You really made your mark  
How come I don't see you anymore?  
How come we lost the magic touch?  
And why can't I pick up the telephone  
When I want to hear your voice so much?  
Who's going to make me forget you  
And get you off my mind?  
I could be out breaking other people's hearts  
If you weren't  
If you weren't still breaking mine  

He was a stranger in london at night  
And he felt alone so he followed a light  
Into a bar where the music was loud  
He ordered a pint and got lost in the crowd  
He asked a girl if she wanted to dance  
She turned up her nose and she told him "no chance!"  
He felt rejected and stood by the wall  
And wondered why he'd ever bothered at all  
He missed his family and wished he was home  
With all of those strangers he felt so alone  
Patrick don't be afraid  
You'll live to laugh another day  
Patrick don't be afraid  
The cavalry is on the way  
He stood in silence, looked round for a while  
Then he saw a girl and she looked back and smiled  
Then he went over and started to talk  
She looked a bit like his sister in cork  
He bought her a drink with his last two quid  
When he said "come back for a coffee" she did  
Patrick you've got it made  
You're halfway there, you're on your way  
Patrick she's not afraid  
And now I bet you're glad you stayed  
Looking so lovely and perfectly groomed  
She showed in the centre of patrick's room  
She was lit up from the inside and out  
Oh he was enchanted as she moved about  
She touched him like sunlight on cold mountain stone  
And he grew afraid lest she leave him alone  
Patrick don't be afraid  
You've won the girl and saved the day  
Patrick you've got it made  
The girl's not going to run away  
Patrick don't be afraid  
The cavalry is on the way  
Patrick you've got it made  
Just look outside it's a lovely day  

(lou reed)  
  
Just a perfect day  
Drink sangria in the park  
Then later when it gets dark  
We go home  
  
Just a perfect day  
Feed animals in the zoo  
Then later a movie too  
And then home  
  
Oh it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
Just a perfect day  
Problems all left alone  
Weekenders on our own  
It's such fun  
  
Just a perfect day  
You made me forget myself  
I thought I was someone else  
Someone good  
  
Oh it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow  
You're gonna reap just what you sow

There's an old ... coming on my new tv  
So I go out for a quiet drink  
But it costs a packet and it's such a racket  
That I can't hear myself think  
There's a microchip one armed bandit with a screw loose  
A stripper in the corner with a face like thunder  
A terrible band playing "johnny be goode"  
So I'd rather go home and stay quietly alone  
I get up in the morning with the radio on  
I do my makeup and I go to look for work  
Somebody tells me that the job's just gone  
And I've been replaced by some computer jerk  
I would talk to my boyfriend but I never can  
'cause a space invader stole my man  
There's a dreadful playing "johnny be goode"  
So I'd rather go home and stay quietly alone  
Trying to keep my sanity is hard to do  
Living like a hermit all alone  
Find an occupation that won't deafen me  
My sense of reality's gone  
My temperature is getting higher and higher  
And I'm shaking in my jeans  
'cause I get so angry when I'm shut in  
With one of those machines  
I would talk to my boyfriend but I never can  
'cause a space invader stole my man  
And the synthesizer's playing "johnny be goode"  
Then I'd rather go home and stay quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone  
Quietly alone  

It was sublime, it was thunder,  
As my life got torn asunder  
I felt the rhythm of the real thing.  
  
Falling down is nothing new  
We all fall down now, even you  
I felt the rhythm of the real thing.  
  
Delicate and nearly new  
Cherish it and love it too  
Oh, the rhythm of the real thing.  
  
All fall down or fall in love  
Put it up to high above  
You need the rhythm of the real thing  
  
Colours fly and dull some men  
Exit those who might resent  
The rhythm of the real thing.  
  
There's blood on your shirt  
Is that what you said?  
Exit laughing  
Wake up dead  
  
We're alone now, been before  
Who can that be at my door  
Is it the rhythm of the real thing?  
  
(spoken)  
  
Don't cry, go get him.  
You're mine, don't let it.  
It's time, your credit

Oh I am just a vagabond  
A drifter on the run  
And elequant profanity  
It rolls right off my tongue  
  
And I have dined in palaces  
Drunk wine with kings and queens  
But darling, oh darling  
You're the best thing I've ever seen  
  
Won't you roll um easy  
So slow and easy  
Take my independence  
With no apprehension or tension  
You walking talking paradise  
Sweet paradise  
  
Well I've been across this country  
From Denver to the ocean  
And I never met girls that could sing so sweet  
Like the angels who live in Houston  
Singing "Roll me easy"  
So slow and easy  
Play the concertina  
I'll be your temptress  
And baby I'm defenceless  
Singing harmony in unison  
Sweet harmony  
Gotta hoist your flag and then beat your drum

In America you'll get food to eat  
Won't have to run through the jungle  
And scuff up your feet  
You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day  
It's great to be an American  
Ain't no lions or tigers-ain't no mamba snake  
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake  
Everybody is as happy as a man can be  
  
Climb aboard, little wog-sail away with me  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
  
In America every man is free  
To take care of his home and his family  
You'll be (as) happy as a monkey in a monkey tree  
You're gonna be an American  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay  
Sail away, sail away  
We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay

If you don't open your eyes then you're gonna get hurt  
'cause she keeps telling you lies, she's just a full time flirt  
Now I know I don't count no more  
But you're the one I still care for  
And you won't see me no more if you see that girl  
Now you may think she's fine when she's out with you  
But she only comes around when she's got nothing to do  
I don't want to interfere  
But that girl seems so insincere  
And I won't hang around here if you see that girl  
Do you believe the things that she said to you tonight  
Why can't you see the way she treats you isn't right?  
Now I won't tell you again, it's up to you  
But you'd better make up your mind what you're gonna do  
Don't you know I want you still  
I'm so afraid I always will  
And I'll be loving you till you see that girl  
I'll keep on loving you till you see that girl  
I'll still be loving you till you see that girl  
See that girl  
See that girl  

Your name froze on the winter air  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
Forgotten now I turn away  
Just save me for a rainy day  
But don't be sorry  
I don't want to hear it baby  
  
My feet froze in the winter chill  
I knew I'd probably get ill  
But I was praying we could fill  
An empty bench and still  
You're so sorry  
But I don't want your pity baby  
  
It's all yours now please don't tease  
The pigeons shiver in the naked trees  
And I'll do anything but  
Please don't hurt me  
Just kiss me quick  
'Cause it's my birthday  
And I feel so small  
I don't know why  
But no I'm not too old to cry  
  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
If you'd have come you'd have found me there  
But you never did 'cause you don't care  
And I'm so sorry baby  
I don't mind loneliness too much  
But when I met you I was touched  
And that was good enough for me  
But do we always have to be sorry  
Why can't we just be happy baby?  
  
One day you'll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
And we'll dance around like we don't care  
And I'll be much too old to cry  
And you'll kiss me quick in case I die  
Before my birthday  
  
One day you'll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
No I don't know the reason why  
I'll love you till the day I die  
But one day you'll be waiting there  
Come summertime in Soho Square  
And I'll be painting stars up in the sky  
Before I get too old to cry  
Before my birthday  
I hope I see those pigeons fly  
Before my birthday  
In Soho Square on my birthday

I know I stand in line until you think you have the time  
To spend an evening with me  
And if we go someplace place to dance I know that there's a chance  
You won't be leaving with me  
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place  
And have a drink or two  
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like "I love you"  
  
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies  
You heard the night before  
And though it's just a line to you, to me it's true  
It never seemed so right before  
  
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say  
To make the meaning come through  
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late  
And I'm alone with you  
  
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red  
And oh the night's so blue  
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid  
Like: "I love you"  
"I love you"  
"I love you"  
  
I've booked a small table down the road ...  
I wonder if we could maybe go there and have something to eat?  
  
No

Why'd you never listen to me?  
I could be invisible to you  
Anyway it doesn't matter now  
'cause I have met somebody new  
Sorry if your heart is broken  
Why's your mouth just hanging open?  
Don't look so surprised  
I found another guy  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
Now he's waiting for me  
I just had to break the news to you  
You'd better hide your face a while  
If he gets mad there's no telling what he'll do  
You can see the door is open  
So if you don't want your nose broken  
You had better go away  
'cause terry's coming round today  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
(terry said he'll never let me go)  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
He's been making eyes at me  
It started long ago  
So when he said he loved me  
I just had to say "I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know"  
You thought you were such a smartie  
But terry knows about karate  
There's other things he's good at too  
Terry's not a bit like you  
And terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
(terry said he'll never let me go)  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  

Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Albert Mooney says he loves her,  
All the boys are fighting for her,  
Knock on the door and they ring the bell  
Oh my true love, are you well?  
Here she comes, as white as snow,  
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,  
Old Jenny Murray she says she'll die  
If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye.  
  
Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high  
And the snow come tumbling from the sky  
She's as nice as apple pie  
She'll get her own lad by and by  
When she gets a lad of her own,  
She won't tell her ma 'till she comes home,  
Let the boys stay as they will,  
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.  
  
Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she

In more street where I did dwell  
A butcher boy I loved right well  
He courted me my life away  
And now with me he will not stay  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain  
I wish I was a maid again  
But a maid again I'll never be  
Till cherries grow on an apple tree  
I wish my baby it was born  
And smiling on it's daddy's knee  
And me poor girl to be dead and gone  
With the long green grass growing over me  
He went upstairs and the door he broke  
He found her hanging from a rope  
He took his knife and he cut her down  
And in her pocket these words he found  
"oh make my grave large, wide and deep  
Put a marble stone at my head and feet  
And in the middle a turtle dove  
So the world may know I died of love"  

I want to tell you something  
It's not a secret or anything  
You're not alone in being alone  
At the end of a perfect day  
  
And if you leave all your dependents  
Then they will gain their independence  
Don't make a martyr of yourself  
It's just the end of a perfect day  
  
And it's never how it seems  
The rain may fall on the best laid schemes  
But in a written testimonial I'd say  
I never really knew you anyway  
  
I want to tell you something  
Now don't go crazy or anything  
Just want to tell you that it's over  
It's the end of a perfect day  
  
Do you want sign language?  
Don't want a knuckle sandwich!  
Now you can love or you can hate it's just  
The end of a perfect day  
  
You can't get inside someone  
So don't ask me if we're close  
I really couldn't tell you  
But I know you wouldn't really listen anyway  
  
It's a pain you have to bear  
And it's always going to be there  
But if you disappeared tomorrow  
Then the world would carry on without you anyway  
  
Mind over matter it seems  
Can stop you falling apart at the seams  
It's a matter of honour with me  
I could write out a hundred times  
  
Put my hand on my heart and say  
That I don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
Don't want to lie  
About the way it is  
  
I want to tell you something  
Don't act surprised now or anything  
Now you can revel in yourself 'cause  
It's just the end of a perfect day  
  
No it's not a pretty world out there  
With people dying of their own despair  
But in a written testimonial you'd say  
You never really knew them anyway

Sometimes it feels like you will never win  
Just when you're ready to pack it all in  
You tear it down and start over again  
But I'm not down for the first time  
Maybe I'll always be the one and only girl for me  
  
I never minded the rain on my face  
I knew the sun lived in some other place  
I had to go I just needed the space  
But I'm not down for the first time  
Maybe I'll always be the one and only girl for me  
  
Sometimes your life isn't going too well  
Sometimes it reads like a postcard from hell  
I've made my mistakes I suppose you can tell  
Some lives read like a postcard  
And some lives read like a book  
I'll be happy if mine  
Doesn't read like a joke from an old Christmas cracker

When you're out there lying in the sun  
He's the one who keeps his clothing on  
You'd never know him on a train or a bus  
'cos he looks just like the rest of us  
In the middle of the night it's a different story  
Don't let him catch you all alone  
  
The real ripper  
... ... your pay packet (? )  
The real ripper  
Wearing a dinner jacket  
Ask anyone you meet and they'll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
Keep your hand on your heart but he's gonna get you  
He's gonna make you toe the line  
  
He's the ... laden master of disguise  
And he invented high rise  
On the council they're respectable and ... (? )  
A bounce around the clock and turn away (? )  
Ask anyone you meet and they'll say the same  
Noone is quite sure of his name  
  
The real ripper  
He went to school today  
The real ripper  
Took all the books away  
Keep your hand on your heart but he's gonna get you  
He's gonna make you toe the line

Oh darling why d'you talk so fast  
Another evening just flew past tonight  
And now the daybreak's coming in  
And I can't win and it ain't right  
You tell me all you've done and seen  
And all the places you have been without me  
Well I don't really want to know  
But i'll stay quiet and then i'll go  
And you won't have no cause to think about me  
  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
Just like you swore to me that you'd be true  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you  
  
Oh darling you're so popular  
You were the best thing new in hicksville  
With your mohair suits and foreign shoes  
Lou says you changed your pickup for a seville  
And now I'm lying here alone  
'cause you're out there on the phone to some star in new york  
I can hear you laughing now  
And I can't help feeling that somehow  
You don't mean anything you say at all  
  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
Just like you swore to me that you'd be true  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you  
  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
Just like you swore to me that you'd be true  
There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's elvis  
But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you  
I said he's a liar and I'm not sure about you  
I said he's a liar and I'm not sure about you  
I said he's a liar and I'm not sure about you

(kirsty maccoll)  
You've been around for such a long time now  
Or maybe I could leave you but I don't know how  
And why should I be lonely every night  
When I can be with you, oh yes you make it right  
  
And I don't listen to the guys who say  
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away  
Cause they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
I get a feeling when I look at you  
Wherever you go now I want to be there too  
They say we're crazy but I just don't care  
And if they keep on talkin' still they get nowhere  
  
So I don't mind if they don't understand  
When I look at you and you hold my hand  
Cause they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve  
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose  
  
Baby  
There's no need for living in the past  
Now I found good loving gonna make it last  
I tell the others don't bother me  
Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see  
  
No I don't listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
No I don't listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love

Every Friday night she rides the whole way over town  
Just to see some stupid boy who never turns around  
He never sees the girl whose dreams have told her he's the one  
Still she gets excited whenever Friday comes  
There is no reason in love's sweet plan  
It's deeper than the sea  
Things happen, we fall in love  
It just comes naturally  
Anyone who saw her in the street would never know  
The passion of the feeling she never puts on show  
We can not choose the ones with whom we think that we belong  
Just when you're not looking someone comes along  
There is no reason in love's sweet plan  
It's deeper than the sea  
Things happen, we fall in love  
It just comes naturally  
There she stands, clothes around her feet  
Choosing what to wear so she can just stand in his street  
"please, oh please, this time I'll make him mine"  
She begs of her reflection in her dressing table shrine  
Oh, there is no reason in love's sweet plan  
It's deeper than the sea  
Things happen, we fall in love  
It just comes naturally  

I just know  
Though I can't see  
But I can feel his hands all over me  
His hot breath on me  
I can't resist  
His rope, my wrists  
I never knew there might be days like this  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Will I be saved  
From these Titanic days  
  
A violent frenzy  
In a none too cheap hotel  
He says it's hazy  
But I remember it so well  
His arms, his face  
The way my words got twisted out of place  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he always says  
It's sink or swim  
In these Titanic days  
  
So hot so hungry  
So faretheewell goodbye  
I got so angry  
Now I sit here and sigh  
My love, always  
We should rejoice in these Titanic days  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Will I be saved  
Will I be saved  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Do you ever get that sinking feeling?

I watch you lie asleep  
Watch you breathing  
And as you fall and rise  
Like the tears in my eyes  
I know you'll be leaving  
  
I've earned all the pain  
I suppose it was worth it  
I'd do it again but I just couldn't face it  
And if I see you again  
You won't be the person I knew  
I look to the future and see  
A thousand setting suns  
But tomorrow never comes  
  
I still watch from my window  
To see if you're coming  
But I know in my heart  
There's really no chance  
You'll never stop running  
It's like waiting for Xmas again  
It's all lost in the blink of an eye  
  
And about all the pain  
Well you know it was worth it  
You could do it again but I just don't deserve it  
Let us part in the rain so the clouds hide  
The despair and the sorrow I feel on the inside  
And let my tears dry  
In the light of a setting sun  
And tomorrow never comes

You say you stand by your man  
Tell me something I don't understand  
You said you loved me and that's a fact  
But then you left me, said you felt trapped  
Well some things you can't explain away  
But the heartache's in me till this day  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
All the times when we were close  
I remember these things the most  
I see all my dreams come tumbling down  
I can't be happy without you around  
So alone I keep the wolves at bay  
And there's only one thing I can say  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me?  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
  
Now I got a job and it don't pay  
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay  
But without all of these things I can do  
But without your love I won't make it through  
But you don't understand my point of view  
I suppose there's nothing I can do  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me?  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
  
You didn't stand by me  
No not at all  
You didn't stand by me  
No way

Trains and boats and planes are passing by  
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome  
For someone else but not for me  
The trains and the boats and planes took you away  
Away from mewe were so in love and high above  
We had a star to wish upon  
Wish and dreams come true but not for me  
The trains and the boats and planes took you away  
Away from me  
  
You are in another part of the world  
You had to go  
You said you'd try to return again  
I'm waiting here like I promised you  
I'm waiting here but where are you?  
  
Trains and boats and planes took you away  
But every time I see them I pray  
And if my prayer can cross the sea  
The trains and the boats and planes will bring you home  
Back home to me

I'm stalking a fan  
He lives in a high rise block  
And here I am  
He shouldn't have turned my rock  
He's brushing his teeth  
He doesn't look bad from this far  
I'm hailing a cab  
And I'm gonna follow his car  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
I'm stalking a fan  
He used to write all the time  
How lovely I am  
He really made me feel fine  
But how they forget  
He needed a wake-up call  
And he will regret  
Having been so shallow  
He made me believe  
That I was some kind of myth  
So here I am  
How could he treat me like this?  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Wherever he goes  
I won't be too far behind  
Just hanging around  
Driving him out of his mind  
I'm stalking a fan  
He's gone to the record store  
To buy a cd  
By some other girl not me  
He's taking her home  
Getting her out of her box  
And putting her on  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Treachery made a monster out of me  
Getting her out of her box  
Treachery  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery  
Treachery  
And dancing around in his socks  
Treachery  
Driving him out of his mind  

Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Who's afraid of his nature, afraid of his joy  
I punched him out and brought him to this hut  
But I know he'll thank me when he wakes up  
We got trees, we got snakes, we got acres of sky  
His life in the city was making him cry  
  
Come on, come on darling, be brave for a while  
You don't look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
I'll be good, I'll be strong  
I'll be just what you needed all along  
  
Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Who's afraid of his nature, afraid of his joy  
  
Us Amazonians know where we stand  
We got kids, we got jobs, why do we need a man?  
Us Amazonians make out alright  
But we want something to hold in the forest at night  
  
Come on, come on darling, be brave for a while  
You don't look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
Breathe in deep, stick with me  
You'll still be free as you let yourself be  
  
If you're certain, if you're true  
I'll be the only country girl for you  
I'll be good, I'll be strong  
I'll be just what you needed all along  
  
Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Gotta teach him about nature, and teach him about joy  
  
Us Amazonians know where we stand  
We got kids, we got jobs, why do we need a man?  
Us Amazonians make out alright  
But we want something to hold in the forest at night  
  
Here's my boyfriend, he's small, he is blue  
He is cold, he is rough, he's appalling thatc

I want you to tell me why you walked out on me  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I want you to know that since you walked out on me  
Nothing seems to be the same old way  
  
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you  
The good times we had before you went away, oh please  
Walk right back to me this minute  
Bring your love to me, don't send it  
I'm so lonesome every day  
  
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me

The good times we had before you went away from me  
Walk right back to me this minute  
Bring your love to me, don't send it  
I'm so lonesome every day  
  
Walk right back to me this minute  
The Nicky Campbell show's on, innit?  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I'm so lonesome every day  
I'm so lonesome every day

Darling  
While the firelight is low  
I'm disappearing  
Like the last day of the snow  
And really, it's better this way  
We both know it's over  
And we'll never pass this way again  
Sunshine and the desert call to me  
And you know moonshine  
Makes you blind so you can't see at all  
But whatever you feel  
It may not be real  
And baby we'll never pass this way again  
I'm not the only love you'll ever know  
Look to your stars above and wish it so  
Let me go  
Darling  
If I stay too long you'll tire of me  
'cause darling, that's the way we are designed to be  
So, hard as it is to say  
We had the night and we had our day  
We'll never pass this way again
