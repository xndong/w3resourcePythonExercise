There's a beautiful home, far over the sea  
There are mansions of bliss, for you and for me  
Oh, that beautiful home, so wonderf'ly fair  
That the savior for me, has gone to prepare.  
  
Chorus: (echo first part of each line, part with " marks)  
"There's a beautiful home", far over the sea  
"There's a beautifu home", for you and for me  
"And it's glittering pow'r", the sun outshines  
"And that beautiful home", someday shall be mine.  
  
In that beautiful home, a crown I shall wear  
When the glorified throne, that glory to share  
But the joys of that home, can never be known  
'Till the savior we see, upon his white throne.

A brighter dawn is breaking  
And earth with praise is waking  
For thou, O King most highest  
The power of death defiest.  
  
And thou hast come victorious  
With risen Body glorious  
Who now for ever livest  
And life abundant givest.  
  
O free the world from blindness  
And fill the world with kindness  
Give sinners resurrection  
Bring striving to perfection.  
  
In sickness give us healing  
In doubt thy clear revealing  
That praise to thee be give  
In earth as in thy heaven...

Softly the evening vespers  
Hallow the closing day  
Sweetly the Savior whispers  
"Come to the throne and pray."  
  
Refrain:  
Softly I hear Him calling  
Calling at close of day  
Sweetly His tones are falling  
"Come to the throne and pray."  
  
Come, ere the shadows lengthen  
Bring Him thy burdened heart  
Come where His grace may strengthen  
Come from thy cares apart.  
  
Smiles of His love await thee  
Lighting His lovely face  
Just to behold His beauty  
Dwell in the secret place.  
  
Boldly we may approach Him  
Mercy and grace to own  
Tempted like us, He bid us  
Come to the Father's throne...

A charge to keep I have,  
God to glorify.  
A never dying soul to save,  
And fit it for the sky.  
  
To serve to present age,  
My calling to fulfill.  
O may it all my powers engage  
To do my Master's will!  
  
Arm me with jealous care,  
As in Thy sight to live,  
And O, Thy servant, Lord, prepare,  
A strict account to give.  
  
Help me to watch and pray,  
And on Thyself rely.  
Assured, if I my trust betray,  
I shall forever die...

A Child is born in Bethlehem  
In Bethlehem  
And gladness fills Jerusalem  
Allelujah, allelujah.  
  
A lowly manger shelters Him  
This Holy Boy  
God's angels sing above with joy  
Allelujah, allelujah!  
  
We now give thanks eternally  
Eternaly  
To God, the Holy Trinity  
Allelujah, allelujah!  
  
The work which His goodness began  
The arm of His strength will complete  
His promise is Yea and Amen  
And never was forfeited yet.  
  
Things future, nor things that are now  
Not all things below or above  
Can make Him His purpose forego  
Or sever my soul from His love.  
  
My name from the palms of His hands  
Eternity will not erase  
Imprest on His heart, it remains  
In marks of indelible grace.  
  
Yes! I to the end shall endure  
As sure as the earnest is giv'n  
More happy, but not more secure  
When all earthly ties have been riv'n...

Praise the Lord! My heart with His love is beaming  
I am a child of God  
Heaven's golden light over me is streaming  
I am a child of God.  
  
Refrain:  
I am a child of God  
I am a child of God  
I have washed my robes in the cleansing fountain  
I am a child of God.  
  
Let the saints rejoice with my raptured spirit  
I am a child of God  
I will testify that the world may hear it  
I am a child of God.  
  
Let a holy life tell the gospel story  
I am a child of God  
How He fills the soul with His grace and glory  
I am a child of God.  
  
Saved from sin today, every band is riven  
I am a child of God  
Through the tests of life I have peace from heaven  
I am a child of God...

A mighty fortress is our God,  
A bulwark never failing.  
Our helper He amid the flood  
Of mortal ills prevailing.  
For still our ancient foe  
Doth seek to work us woe.  
His craft and power are great,  
And, armed with cruel hate,  
On earth is not his equal.  
  
Did we in our own strength confide,  
Our striving would be losing,  
Were not the right man on our side,  
The man of God's own choosing.  
Dost ask who that may be?  
Christ Jesus, it is He.  
Lord Sabaoth, his name,  
From age to age the same,  
And He must win the battle.  
  
And though this world, with devils filled,  
Should threaten to undo us,  
We will not fear, for God hath willed  
His truth to triumph through us.  
The Prince of Darkness grim,  
We tremble not for him.  
His rage we can endure,  
For lo, his doom is sure.  
One little word shall fell him.  
  
That word above all earthly powers  
Not thanks to them, abideth.  
The Spirit and the gifts are ours  
Through him who with us sideth.  
Let goods and kindred go,  
This mortal life also.  
The body they may kill,  
God's truth abideth still.  
His kingdom is forever...

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide  
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide  
When other helpers fail and comfort flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.  
  
Swift to it's close ebbs out life's little day  
Earth's joys grow dim, it's glories pass away  
Change and decay in all around I see  
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.  
  
I need Thy prescence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power  
Who like Thy Self my guide and stay can be  
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where grave, Thy victory  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.  
  
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes  
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies  
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee  
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

All hail King Jesus

Alleluia, alleluia, hearts to heaven and voices raise  
Sing to God a hymn of gladness, sing to God a hymn of praise  
He, who on the cross a victim for the world's salvation bled  
Jesus Christ, the King of glory now is risen from the dead.  
  
Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born  
Glorious life and life immortal on this holy Easter morn  
Christ has triumphed and we conquer by his mighty enterprise  
We with him to life eternal by his resurrection rise.  
  
Christ is risen, Christ, the first fruits of the holy harvest field  
Which will in all it's full abundance at his second coming yield  
Then the golden ears of harvest will their heads before him wave  
Ripened by his glorious sunshine from the furrows of the grave.  
  
Christ is risen, we are risen, she'd upon us heavenly grace  
Rain and dew and gleams of glory from the brightness of thy face  
That we with our hearts in heaven here on earth may fruitful be  
And by angel hands be gathered and be ever, Lord, with thee.  
  
Alleluia, alleluia, glory be to God on high  
Alleluia! to the Savior who has gained the victory  
Alleluia! to the Spirit, fount of love and sanctity  
Alleluia, alleluia, to the Triune Majesty...

Alleluia! Sing to Jesus, His the scepter, his the throne  
Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone  
Hark! The songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood  
Jesus out of every nation hath redeemed us by his blood.  
  
Alleluia! Not as orphans are we left in sorrow now  
Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes nor questions how  
Though the cloud from sight received him when the forty days were o'er  
Shall our hearts forget his promise, I am with you evermore?  
  
Alleluia! Bread of heaven, here on earth our food and stay  
Alleluia! Here the sinful flee to thee from day to day  
Intercessor, Friend of sinners, earth's Redeemer, plead for me  
Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.  
  
Alleluia! King eternal, thee the Lord of Lords we own  
Alleluia! Born of Mary, earth thy footstool, heaven thy throne  
Thou within the veil hast entered, robed in flesh, our great High Priest  
Thou on earth both Priest and Victim in the Eucharistic Feast...

We meet, and the angels sing  
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard  
You speak, and the angels sing  
Or am I breathing music into ev'ry word?  
  
Suddenly, the setting is strange  
I can see water and moonlight beaming  
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore  
Then suddenly, I see it all change  
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming  
Through it all your face that I adore.  
  
You smile, and the angels sing  
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start  
We kiss, and the angels sing  
And leave their music ringing in my heart...

Angel voices, ever singing, round Thy throne of light  
Angel harps, forever ringing, rest not day or night  
Thousands only live to bless Thee, and confess Thee Lord of might.  
  
Thou Who art beyond the farthest mortal eye can scan  
Can it be that Thou regardest songs of sinful man  
Can we feel that Thou art near us and wilt hear us? Yea, we can.  
  
Lord, we know Thy love rejoices o'er each work of Thine  
Thou didst ears and hands and voices for Thy praise combine  
Craftsman's art and music's measure for Thy pleasure didst design.  
  
Here, great God, today we offer of Thine own to Thee  
And for Thine acceptance proffer, all unworthily  
Hearts and minds, and hands and voices, in our choicest melody.  
  
Honor, glory, might and merit, Thine shall ever be  
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, blessed Trinity  
Of the best that Thou hast given Earth and heaven render Thee...

I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way  
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home.  
  
Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.

Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
Shepherds, why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heavenly song?  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
Christ whose birth the angels sing  
Come, adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
  
See Him in a manger laid  
Whom the choirs of angels praise  
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid  
While our hearts in love we raise.  
  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!...

As the deer panteth for the water  
So my soul longs after You  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You.  
  
You alone are my strength, my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You.  
  
I want you more than gold or silver  
Only You can satisfy  
You alone are the real joy giver  
And the apple of my eye.  
  
You alone are my strength, my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You.  
  
You're my friend and You're my brother  
Even though you are a King  
I love You more than any other  
So much more than anything.  
  
You alone are my strength, my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You.

You shall cross the barren desert  
But you shall not die of thirst  
You shall wander far in safety  
Though you do not know the way.  
  
You shall speak your words in foreign lands  
And all will understand  
You shall see the face of God and live.  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest.  
  
If you pass through raging waters  
In the sea, you shall not drown  
If you walk amidst the burning flames  
You shall not be harmed.  
  
If you stand before the pow'are of hell  
And death is at your side  
Know that I am with you, through it all.  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest.  
  
Blessed are your poor  
For the Kingdom shall be theirs  
Blest are you that weep and mourn  
For one day you shall laugh.  
  
And if wicked men insult and hate you  
All because of Me  
Blessed, blessed are you!  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest...

Beyond the sunset, O blissful morning  
When with our Saviour heaven's begun  
Earth's toiling ended, O glorious dawning  
Beyond the sunset when day is done.  
  
Beyond the sunset, no clouds will gather  
No storms will threaten, no fears annoy  
O day of gladness, O day unending  
Beyond the sunset eternal joy.  
  
Beyond the sunset, a hand will guide me  
To God the Father whom I adore  
His glorious presence, His words of welcome  
Will be my portion on that fair shore.  
  
Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion  
With our dear loved ones who've gone before  
In that fair homeland we'll know no parting  
Beyond the sunset forever more...

How blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true.  
  
Those who live in Your law  
Whose hearts seek after Thee  
How free their lives of sin  
How blessed their purity!  
  
O, how blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true.  
  
Oh, that I had more strength  
In obeying Your decrees  
But I am trying, Lord  
O God, do not forsake me!  
  
But bless me, Lord  
Bless me as my heart seeks You  
And bless me, Lord  
As I turn my life to You.  
  
Turn to You...

Bright was the guiding star that led  
With mild, benignant ray  
The Gentiles to the lowly she'd  
Where the Redeemer lay.  
  
But lo! a brighter, clearer, light  
Now points to His abode  
It shines, through sin and sorrow's night  
To guide us to our God.  
  
Oh! haste to follow where it leads  
The gracious call obey  
Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads  
The Christian's destined way.  
  
Oh! gladly tread the narrow path  
While light and grace are given  
Who meekly follow Christ on earth  
Shall reign with Him in Heaven...

Child in the manger, Infant of Mary  
Outcast and Stranger, Lord of all  
Child Who inherits all our transgressions  
All our demerits on Him fall.  
  
Once the most holy Child of salvation  
Gently and lowly lived below  
Now as our glorious mighty Redeemer  
See Him victorious o'er each foe.  
  
Prophets foretold Him, Infant of wonder  
Angels behold Him on His throne  
Worthy our Savior of all our praises  
Happy forever are His own...

Hear what glorious song of angels  
Is now ringing through the air  
Never valley, never mountain  
Heard an anthem half so fair.  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man.  
  
Messengers of God's free mercy  
Are now seen by human eye  
Shepherds hear the wondrous message  
"Glory be to God on high."  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man.  
  
Let us also sing the praises  
Of our God so full of love  
Who on Christmas sent a Savior  
Sent a Savior from above.  
  
Refrain:  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth, good will to man...

Christmas day joyous, feast of all peoples  
Heaven and earth resound with glad praise  
Angels descending sing forth His glory  
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days  
Bringing us faith, hope, love, all our days.  
  
Bethlehem's star with radiance beaming  
Fills human hearts with heavenly mirth  
God's loving message brings new assurance  
So let the world proclaim Jesus' birth  
So let the world proclaim Jesus' birth.  
  
In adoration widows and orphans  
Whose hearts are burdened, turn unto Heav'n  
In faith and hope and love they can pray now  
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv'n  
Since Jesus Savior is to them giv'n.  
  
Joy we behold on earth and in Heaven  
Wonderful Yuletide, blessings from Him  
Joy everlasting gladden all hearts now  
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men.  
  
Bring to the world peace, goodwill to men...

Come hither, ye faithful  
Triumphantly sing  
Come, see in the manger  
The angels' dread King!  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
True Son of the Father  
He comes from the skies  
To be born of a virgin  
He doth not despise.  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
Hark! hark! to the angels  
All singing in Heav'n  
"To God in the highest  
All glory be given!"  
  
Refrain:  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye, come hither, O come ye, come hither  
O come ye, come hither to worship the Lord.  
  
To Thee, then, O Jesu, this day of Thy birth  
Be glory and honor through heaven and earth  
True Godhead incarnate! Omnipotent Word  
O come let us hasten, O come let us hasten  
O come let us hasten, to worship the Lord!...

Come, thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy, never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me some melodious sonnet  
Sung by flaming tongues above  
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it  
Mount of Thy redeeming love.  
  
Here I raise mine Ebenezer  
Hither by Thy help I'm come  
And I hope by Thy good pleasure  
Safely to arrive at home  
Jesus sought me when a stranger  
Wandering from the fold of God  
He, to rescue me from danger  
Interposed His precious blood.  
  
O to grace how great a debtor  
Daily I'm constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it  
Prone to leave the God I love  
Here's my heart, O take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above...

Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder  
Why it should be thus all the day long  
While there are others living about us  
Never molested, though in the wrong.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Faithful to death is our loving saviour  
A few more days labour and wait  
Toils of the road will then be as nothing  
As we walk through that beautiful gate.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
When we see Jesus coming in glory  
When He comes from His home in the sky  
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Often I wonder why I must journey  
Over a road so rugged and steep  
While there are others living in comfort  
While with the lost I labour and weep.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by...

I need Thee every hour,  
Most gracious Lord.  
No tender voice like thine,  
Can peace afford.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
Stay thou nearby.  
Temptations lose their pow'are  
When thou are nigh.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
In joy or pain.  
Come quickly and abide,  
Or life is vain.  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
Most holy One.  
Oh, make me thine indeed,  
Thou blessed Son!  
  
I need Thee, oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee!  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee!

I walked today where Jesus walked,  
In days of long ago.  
I wandered down each path He knew,  
With reverent step and slow.  
  
Those little lanes, they have not changed,  
A sweet peace fills the air.  
I walked today where Jesus walked,  
And felt His presence there.  
  
My pathway led through Bethlehem,  
Ah memorys ever sweet.  
The little hills of Galilee,  
That knew His childish feet.  
  
The Mount of Olives, hallowed scenes,  
That Jesus knew before  
I saw the mighty Jordan roll,  
As in the days of yore.  
  
I knelt today where Jesus knelt,  
Where all alone he prayed.  
The Garden of Gethsemane,  
My heart felt unafraid.  
  
I picked my heavy burden up,  
And with Him at my side,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
Where on the Cross He died!  
  
I walked today where Jesus walked,  
And felt Him close to me.

Some glad morning when this life is o'er,  
I'll fly away.  
To a home on God's celestial shore,  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory,  
I'll fly away.  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,  
I'll fly away.  
  
When the shadows of this life have gone,  
I'll fly away.  
Like a bird from prison bars has flown,  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory,  
I'll fly away.  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,  
I'll fly away.  
  
Just a few more weary days and then,  
I'll fly away.  
To a land where joy shall never end,  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory,  
I'll fly away.  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,  
I'll fly away.

I'll Walk with God from this day on.  
His helping hand I'll lean upon.  
This is my prayer, my humble plea,  
May the Lord be ever with me.  
  
There is no death, tho' eyes grow dim.  
There is no fear when I'm near to Him.  
I'll lean on Him forever  
And He'll forsake me never.  
  
He will not fail me  
As long as my faith is strong,  
Whatever road I may walk along.  
  
I'll Walk with God, I'll take His hand.  
I'll talk with God, He'll understand.  
I'll pray to Him, each day to Him  
And He'll hear the words that I say.  
  
His hand will guide my throne and rod  
And I'll never walk alone  
While I walk with God.

[Verse 1:]  
I come to the garden alone,  
While the dew is still on the roses,  
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,  
The Son of God discloses.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He speaks, and the sound of His voice,  
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,  
And the melody that He gave to me,  
Within my heart is ringing.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I'd stay in the garden with Him,  
Tho' the night around me be falling,  
But He bids me go, thro' the voice of woe,  
His voice to me is calling.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.

As clear as wine, the wind is flying  
Among the dreamy pines  
As evening light is slowly dying  
And a lonely bell still chimes.  
  
So many songs, so many stories  
The stony hills recall...  
Around her heart my city carries  
A lonely ancient wall.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
Alas, the dry wells and fountains,  
Forgotten market-day  
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain  
No longer calls to pray.  
  
The rocky caves at night are haunted  
By sounds of long ago  
When we were going to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
But when I come to count your praises  
And sing Hallel to you  
With pretty rhymes I dare not crown you  
As other poets do.  
  
Upon my lips is always burning  
Your name, so dear, so old:  
If I forget Yerushalaim  
Of bronze and light and gold...  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.  
  
Back to the wells and to the fountains  
Within the ancient walls  
The sound of horn from Temple's mountain  
Again so loudly calls,  
  
From rocky caves, this very morning  
A thousand suns will glow  
And we shall go down to the Jordan  
By way of Jericho.  
  
Yerushalaim all of gold  
Yerushalaim, bronze and light  
Within my heart I shall treasure  
Your song and sight.

Mama, take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore.  
It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.  
  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Mama, put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore.  
That long black cloud is comin' down  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.  
  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right it front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
For though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Yeah, there will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the night is cloudy  
There is still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow  
Let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be...

Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
Led on their way  
By this triumphant sign,  
The hosts of God  
In conquering ranks combine.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
Each newborn servant  
Of the Crucified  
Bears on the brow  
The seal of Him who died.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
O Lord, once lifted  
On the glorious tree,  
As Thou hast promised  
Draw the world to Thee.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name.  
  
So shall our song  
Of triumph ever be:  
Praise to the Crucified  
For victory.  
  
Refrain:  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim,  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name...

Lord, I lift my cares to Thee  
Weary is my soul  
Lord, my strength, my comfort be  
In my time of sorrow.  
  
Keep me from errant ways, O Lord  
Guide me with Thy decrees  
Let grace and life be my reward  
For living faithfully.  
  
Lord, I lift my life to Thee  
Help me to be true  
Teach me, Lord, that I might be  
Justified through You.  
  
My heart is set upon Your Law  
It is the light I see  
I run with joy in Your commands  
For You have set me free!  
  
Set me free!...

Lord, in Your love  
You've given life to me  
Lord, in Your love  
Lord, for Your love  
I give my life to You  
Lord, for Your love.  
  
As You she'd Your blood  
May I she'd my blood for You  
In Your Truth revealed  
May my life be ever true.  
  
Through Your grace, my Lord  
Is my life redeemed from sin  
In Your death, my Lord  
Did my life begin again!  
  
I was empty, Lord  
Till Your presence filled my soul  
Without purpose, Lord  
Till Your purpose made me whole.  
  
How can I repay  
All the good You've done for me  
How can I express  
All the love I have for Thee?...

Before Lord God made the sea and the land,  
He held all the stars in the palm of His hand,  
And they ran through His fingers like grains of sand,  
And one little star fell alone.  
  
Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air,  
For the little dark star on the wind down there,  
And He stated and promised He'd take special care  
So it wouldn't get lost again.  
  
Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim,  
And the clouds blow over and darken him,  
So long as the Lord God's watching over them,  
Keeping track how it all goes on.  
  
But I've been walking through the night and the day,  
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray,  
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away,  
Forgetting the promise that we heard Him say.  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars,  
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night,  
And we're lost out here in the stars,  
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night.  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars.

The Maker of the sun and moon  
The Maker of our earth  
Lo! late in time, a fairer boon  
Himself is brought to birth!  
  
How blest was all creation then  
When God so gave increase  
And Christ, to heal the hearts of men  
Brought righteousness and peace!  
  
No star in all the heights of heaven  
But burned to see Him go  
Yet unto earth alone was given  
His human form to know.  
  
His human form, by man denied  
Took death for human sin  
His endless love, through faith descried  
Still lives the world to win.  
  
O perfect love, outpassing sight  
O light beyond our ken  
Come down through all the world tonight  
And heal the hearts of men!

Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would one day walk on water?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would save our sons and daughters?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you.  
  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has walked where angels trod?  
And when you've kissed your little baby  
Then you've kissed the face of God.  
Oh Mary, did you know?  
  
Mary, did you know?  
The blind will see, the deaf will hear  
The dead will live again  
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb.  
  
Oh Mary, did you know that your baby boy  
Is Lord of all creation?  
Mary, did you know that your baby boy  
Will one day rule the nations?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
And the sleeping child you're holding  
Is the great I am.  
Oh Mary

O Lord, You are my God  
I will exalt Thee  
I will praise Thy Name  
O Lord, You are my God  
I will exalt Thee  
I will praise Thy Name.  
  
In perfect faithfulness is Thy plan  
Revealed in wonders unto man  
All will honor  
All revere Thy holy Name!  
  
You are a refuge for the poor  
You are the shelter in the storm  
In your shadow  
Is the song of evil stilled.  
  
And on Thy mountain shall we dine  
The finest food, Lord, the finest wine  
Such a banquet  
You have offered unto us!  
  
And on Thy mountain is the shroud  
Dispelled by You, Lord, as a cloud  
Death is conquered  
We are saved from our disgrace!  
  
And at the end time, Judgment Day  
All true believers, they will say  
We have trusted  
Our salvation is through God!
