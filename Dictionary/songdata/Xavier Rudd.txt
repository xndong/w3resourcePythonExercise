The places that we live and the living that we did  
The places we were put and the things we were given  
He sings what they talk  
But they took away are pride but they didn't take our lives  
They took away the things that made us feel alive  
Said, "Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?"  
Said, "Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become? How did this become?"  
In old woman we flex from the East to the West  
She thinks of her grandmother and her grandfather  
And strings that they had  
Now she looks to the arm, saw them sniffing on their drugs  
The drink in there has stolen so many souls  
And flooded her sacred blood  
She says, "Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become?"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, where are we gonna run?  
What have we become?"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, what have we become?  
What have we become?"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, how did this become?  
How did this become?"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, see the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son"  
She says, "Ooh ooh, where are we gonna run?  
What have we become?"  

People saving whales  
And giving your thanks to our seas  
My respect to the ones in the forest  
Standing up for our old trees  
Them giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby, giving care for free  
'Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
'Cause you care for me  
And we all have opinions, some of them get through  
But there's better people with more good to do, good to do  
What I have could be a message  
Or just some words from my heart  
My respect to the ones making changes  
For all the lives they'll give their all  
Like giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby, giving care for free  
'Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
'Cause you cared for me  
And we all have opinions, some of them get through  
But there's better people with more good to do, good to do  
When our world keeps spinning round and round it goes  
Mother Nature keeps spreading its disease  
And our children keep growing up with  
What they know through what we teach and what they see  
And so only a question of the time we have  
And the lives that our children need  
As they can only keep growing up with  
What they know through what we teach and what they see  
Like giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby, giving care for free  
'Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
'Cause you care for me  
We all have opinions, some of them get through  
But there's better people with more good to do, good to do  
Oh good to do  

At times in life  
You'll connect with some  
And some will have to move on  
At times you'll feel  
The need to fly  
And fly though you may hurt someone  
  
You were there  
Your chances were clear  
Choices were made in spite  
Of times that were spent  
Feelings were mixed  
Amongst your support base  
A heart was lost  
But a heart found its place  
  
This is a recipe of life  
Made up of fragments of peoples  
Peace and peoples vibes  
Well its each now to their own  
Well your heart will know

And my answers, often left to feelin'  
Like you're hangin' out to dry  
And my reasons have left you wondering why  
Life has this question looming over me  
Since the day you took fly  
And if you come back there will be good times  
I see your face when I'm staring out the window  
Beaming down in the moonlight  
Winter is colder, life sought you by my side  
All I have is this photo whom you're  
Smiling to remind me of my words  
In my rights if you come back there would be good times  
And my answers, often left to feelin'  
Like you're hangin' out to dry  
And my reasons have left you wondering why  
Life had this question looming over me  
Since the day we took fly  
And if you come back there would be good times  
And I see your face when I'm staring out the window  
Beaming down in the moonlight  
Winter is colder, I sought you by my side  
Now all I've is this photo whom you're  
Smiling to remind me of my words  
In my rights if you come back there would be good times

Hey Now  
I'm speaking once again  
Oh yeah  
My name is in your head  
So strange  
These people that you have  
That's right my friend  
It's all just where you're at  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
Take me  
Conceal me where you like  
You will see it open  
From within I will rise  
Like seasons  
Your flavour will die  
On and on these people  
They'll listen every time  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
This is how I like to play  
This is how I feel these days  
  

So go but be kind  
You have luck on your side  
Born into a family with food in their bellies  
And a car for them to drive  
  
People sleeping on the concrete  
Still smile behind their signs  
So go now be happy and be free  
You have so much time  
  
If you go chances are you'll come again  
If you come chances are you'll go  
So be mellow let it flow let it bend  
I'll see you somewhere at the end  
  
So go but be kind...

Respect her, she's the one  
Our seasons change with each sign  
Truth lies in her bones  
Our choices now, it faked everyone  
I, I, I, I  
Like a river cuts through the mountains  
To the sun  
The truth cannot be changed  
It has come  
There are leaders who lead  
But our leaders prefer to deceive  
As our oceans they rise, they rise  
Still now they choose to deny  
I, I, I, I  
Like a river cuts through the mountains  
To the sun  
The truth cannot be changed  
It has come, yeah  
So respect her, she's the one

To know you  
And sooth your pain with high  
And not even try  
Through feelings and senses  
We stand as one  
And we don't even try  
Stand up push them  
Stand up feel me  
Don't stand alone  
For your time here now  
Is the time you wanted when  
Things seemed so wrong  
So won't you stand up  
And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
Allow the clouds to shift  
And your heart to blossom  
Every things gonna be just fine  
Won't you stand up  
And let your standard feelings  
Dissolve away with time  
For your time hear now  
Is the time you wanted  
Let the good things dance inside  
Your head  
To want it and need it  
When taken by  
Complete surprise  
  
  

I know, I see, I feel and yes I fear it everyday  
These ego's there minds and games  
With all their power could end our days  
Still the sun it shinesand the moon it sinks with grace  
It's such a shame that all this shit exists  
Here on this earth, this magical place  
I'm doing fine  
Yes you have the funds and size and power to make some change  
What you have will break their smiles  
So many people so many ways  
Each Child who walks their line  
Should be free to run their race  
It's such a shame that all this shit exists here on this earth, this magical
place  
I'm doing fine  
  
  

I guess this is the rushed goodbye  
That I thought would never come  
The woman who lit the light  
For a family in the dark  
Starring at the mirror  
I see your smile through my own  
Your spark embedded deep inside  
Will give me strength  
Will give us hope  
  
And I'll never lose your touch  
No I'll never lose touch  
  
This will take me a while  
Because I miss your smile  
I guess I new your time would come  
But for now I miss your smile  
It's gonna take me a while  
  
Thank you for your loyal stance  
Green spandex and crazy style  
Thank you for the happiness  
That you gave to our lives  
Although now our hearts are cracked  
And our tears are slow to dry  
We must count ourselves  
The lucky ones  
For we were with you in your prime  
  
And I'll never lose your touch  
No I'll never lose touch  
  
Please stay in touch  
Because I need you in my heart  
Please stay in touch  
I need your touch

The stone it sinks  
The day is near  
And I watch your feet I feel your breathe  
I'm in your dreams  
Seems such a long long time But I will return  
You are the only spark I use  
In these things I do  
This is the thing I do  
All these people  
And all these times  
And all this road I see for real  
In four twenty time  
There will be fourteen days  
When sadness climbs  
And there will be times when I feel chilled  
With you on my mind  
This is the thing I do  
You miss me now  
Well I miss you too  
You see well chances are given  
Only once  
Now there's clouds in my heart  
Clouds in my mind  
You see well chances are given  
Only once  
Not for free  
  
  

'Cause it was signal, 'cause it was found  
'Cause these were feelings from so long ago  
Listen to the spirits, came up strong  
All put together with same layer song  
This is how they did it, spears by their side  
Stood on the mountain for their land rights  
All the people noticed, movement took fly  
They said  
This is our home, just honor our lives  
Ooh, this is our home, just honor our lives  
Country it was speaking, land of God  
Families were broken, spirits were crushed  
The language that was silenced, set free to be passed  
The cup that was empty, slowly filled up  
So we can prove together, show our children it is time  
You see this is our home, just honor our lives  
Ooh, this is our home, just honor our lives  
Ooh, this is our home, just honor our lives

So come sit down  
Will you talk with me now?  
Let me see through your eyes  
Where there is so much life  
  
We are biding our time  
For these myths to unwind  
These changes we will confront  
  
So please beware  
With every place that you had  
Look to your soul  
For these things that you know  
  
For the trees that we see  
Cannot forever breathe  
With the changes they will confront  
  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
  
This sacred land it has  
Seen many hands, it has  
Wealth and gold yet it is  
Fragile and old and all the  
  
Greedy souls just don't care to know  
Of the changes it will confront  
  
So speak out loud of the  
Things you are proud  
And if you love this coast  
Keep it clean as it evolves  
  
'Cause the way that it shines  
May just dwindle with time  
With the changes it will confront  
  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
You know some people  
They just wont understand  
  
They just wont understand these things  
Thank you for your message  
But I don't understand  
No, I just wont understand these things  
  
So hold nice and close  
The ones that get to your soul  
So that when it is cold  
You wont feel so alone  
  
'Cause the roads that you take  
May just crack and break  
With the changes you will confront  
  
With each gift that you share  
You may heal and repair  
With each choice that you make  
You may help someone's day  
  
Well I know you are strong  
May your journey be long  
Now I wish you the best of luck  
Well I know you are strong  
  
May your journey be long  
And now I wish you the best of luck

I See you sleeping only in my mind  
I have been away alone this season  
I waste so much time  
Thinking of when I would hold you gently  
And I'd look into your eyes  
And I would be the one to calm your shaking  
When you would cry  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
So miss you in my life  
You hide your answers within every smile  
Time and time again I'd lose my chances  
To reconcile  
Even if I had my time over  
It would take a while  
To reveal all my best intentions  
That I let slip by  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
So miss you in my life  
  

No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
And I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
Oba, oba-serving the hypocrites  
As we would mingle with the good people we meet  
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost along the way  
In this bright future we can't forget our past  
So dry your tears I say  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in Trenchtown  
And Georgie would make fire light  
Log wood burnin' through the night  
And we would cook corn meal porridge of  
Which I'll share with you, mmm you and you  
My feet is my only carriage now  
So I've got to push on through  
But while I'm gone  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright well  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright well  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
Ev'rything's gonna be alright  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
No woman, no cry  
  

He was a boy  
Who felt like a man  
She was a girl  
From a far away land  
Far more beautiful  
Than the picture in his hand  
She had eyes  
That would draw him in  
They took a plane ride  
Together they would find  
Her long lost smile  
They went home again  
Back to her friends  
Back to repair her heart  
He loved this girl  
With all of his heart  
He wanted her mind  
Her secrets and her trust  
She would never do him any harm  
He'd give her the world  
If it sat in his palm  
One rainy day  
It was dark in the sky  
She turned and she said to him  
With grey in her eyes  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
His heart turned to liquid  
And it trickled from his eyes  
All he could do now  
At this point in his life  
Was to go home again  
Back to his friends  
Back to repair his heart  
Go home again  
Go back to your friends  
Go back and repair your heart  
  
  

You had so many opportunities  
So much time, so much space, so much room to breathe  
And you  
  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
You see your fortune lie you can decide to wake it  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
  
And she will come and take your hand  
She will help you understand  
She will help you understand  
And she will lead you to your peace  
In times when you feel weak  
In times when you are weak  
And when your space it feels deranged  
She will hold the key to change  
She will offer the key to change  
So be sure when she whispers in your ear  
That she will chase away those fears  
Then she will chase away those fears  
  
On your journey be proud of what you seek  
And your love for he or she  
For they will help you feel complete

Here and now our choices here are growing thin,  
As children grow they grow with what they see  
In these times where paranioa closes in  
Power and hate a rampaging disease  
In our minds we build the blocks to what we need  
In our minds we are reaching out for peace  
In our hearts we know of such the hills to climb  
In our hearts a sesne of mass defeat  
shame sahme these games that they play with you and me  
Shame for these games that they play our children will keep  
these are our times this problem much to big to hold  
For you and I far too high to reach  
We can begin by holding close the things we know  
And valuing our pockets of peace  
These are the earth the sun the moon the sea the sky  
These are the gifts to which we all agree  
Through these things and those we love we can unite  
And sink into our pockets of peace  
  

Well, here I am this is my shelter  
Here I'm at one with these trees  
And all these birds sing to my rhythms  
And these waves they comfort me  
  
Do what you will while you're able  
Find what it is that you seek  
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean  
I will fly so high above the see  
  
If it's shelter you're searching for  
One that I cannot provide  
Well, I wish you well on your journey  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
I hope your dreams back down and they, they thrive  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
  
Well, I filled my cup with the answers  
And I filled my cup with your lies  
You topped it up with your mysterys  
And all those secrets I denied  
  
Do what you will while you're able  
Find what it is that you seek  
Only I'll fly, fly, fly above the ocean  
I will fly so high above the see  
  
If it's shelter you're searching for  
One that I cannot provide  
Well, I wish you well on your journey  
I hope your dreams they come alive  
I hope your dreams back down and they, they thrive  
  
I Hope Your Dreams They Come Alive  
I Hope Your Dreams Back Down And Thrive  
  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do  
Do, Do, Do

Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
Well I'm peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they won't see me sad  
And if I'm happy they won't share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time for the spirit  
It's time unsaid  
This peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time alone  
  
Silence beating down  
Silence all around  
And I'm peaceful  
At least for now  
Silence beating down  
  
Here other people they won't see me sad  
And if I'm happy they won't share my happiness  
For this is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time for my spirit and me to spend  
This is peacefulness that won't be shared  
For it's time alone

Stargaze, I feel it with everything you do  
And I like this and I do this all along  
This connection founded from day one  
Obviously peaceful staring to the stars  
She came my way yeah, when everything was tangled now

See the sun is shining, ah you've every reason now

And I caught you and I did this and I know why  
As she came my way yeah, when everything was tangled now  
And I'm seeing clearer with every move, yeah  
See the sun is shining, ah you've every reason now  
And I got something now, hey I got you, you, you, you, you, yeah  
Surprise  
Surprise  
I said  

I sit at my window  
With everything I've done  
Doors that I've opened  
The webs that I've spun  
And the candle beside me  
It burns to the left  
And the rain on the clay  
Sends the lizard to it's nest  
will there be a time  
When I'll hold you again  
With my arms spread out  
My chest you'll rest  
And I'll write you a letter  
With everything I know  
'bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go  
So live up my friend  
Step back again  
For somethings will be given  
For some you'll have to bend  
You' ll have to bend my friend  
To hold on to this  
For somethings will come easy  
And some will be a test  
(You'll have to bend)  
Now the ocean connects me  
To everything I know  
I'm mellowing my mind  
So my heart, it can call  
With these trees as my witness  
I'll slice up some fruit  
And each to their peacefull  
Good intentions and truth  
There will be a time  
When I'll hold you again  
With my arms spread out  
I will dive right in  
So now here is your letter  
With everything I know  
'Bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go  
So live up my friend  
Step back again  
For somethings will be given  
For some you'll have to bend  
You'll have to bend my friend  
To hold on to this  
For somethings will come easy  
And some will be a test  
You'll have to bend  
Now the ocean connects me  
To everything I know  
I'm mellowing my mind  
So my heart, it can call  
With these trees as my witness  
I'll slice up some fruit  
And each to their peacefull  
Good intentions and truth  
There will be a time

With my arms spread out  
I will dive right in  
So now here is your letter  
With everything I know  
'bout the weight of the world  
And the way things could go  

I've seen you somewhere before your eyes  
Your eyes draw me back to the songs, it's been many moons  
My mind is too young and I can't place it  
The spirit within me breathes now  
These old people sit here with me  
My feet turned up, inside I receive it  
And I feel it in every breath in it  
It circles inside my head and I  
I fear it with each new day  
And every way these whispers reach  
These whispers reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
These are friends of country and time  
And this knowledge so long denied  
But I thank you, oh oh and I thank you  
The day will be recognized  
But our children still we deny  
This is school culture simply too young to feel it  
As I feeling with every breath in it  
It circles inside my head and I  
I fear with each new day  
And every way these whispers reach  
These whispers reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
Now these whispers they reach  
Now whispers they reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
They're whispers they reach  
The whispers they reach  
Now they're secrets before  
These whispers they reach  
Whispers  
Whispers  
Whispers
