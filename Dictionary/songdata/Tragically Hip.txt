In the ulcerating silence, perspective comes  
The way it always does, for it's ransom  
So randomly, somebody calls  
The phone rings and it brings Niagara Falls  
At 3 o'clock in the morning  
You'd better be dyin', you were  
So we talked about time and where it went  
Unremarkable events and how  
One day took two days and they got spent  
How you'd continue  
Carefully in degrees  
Trying to do one true beautiful thing  
And your beautiful thing  
It'd be a beautiful thing  
To see that beautiful thing continuing  
I don't live there, I just commute  
Secretly cradling a joint, I might puke  
Fumble with the keys, under duress  
The point is, this is, practice duress  
3 o'clock in the morning  
You'd better be dying' and you were  
So we talked about things and where they went  
Big remarkable events and how  
Each day's a new day and they get spent  
How you'd continue, artfully, like the breeze  
Trying to do one true beautiful thing  
Your beautiful thing  
It'd be a beautiful thing to see  
That beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing will be  
A beautiful thing to me  
A beautiful thing continuing  
Your beautiful thing continuing  

About this map, here we are, here  
See, this is us, the exit is here, and  
We've come too far, to just feel like this, yeah  
We've come too far, to be feeling like this  
  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
  
About this map, it's a bit out of date, yeah  
Territories shifted, and things get renamed  
There's coups, revolutions, and boundaries blur  
Volcanoes and earthquakes turn words into birds  
  
It's certain, certain  
You want to, want to  
Certain, certain  
You want to, want to, want to  
  
But, oh, about this map  
It goes beyond, beyond  
And, oh about this map  
About this map  
  
About this map, here we are, here  
See, this is me, and there you are, there, and  
There's got to be more than just to despair  
There's got to be more than just to despair  
  
I'm certain, certain  
I want to, want to  
You're certain, certain  
You want to, want to, want to  
  
And, oh, about this map  
It goes beyond, beyond  
Forget about this map  
About this map  
  
And, oh, about this map  
We don't live in our heads  
Forget about this map  
About this map  
About this map  
About this map  
About this map

Well, there's a rockin' little spot  
Next to the Regent Theater  
And if you wanna make the scene  
You'll make it sooner or later  
You're really hanging with the crowd  
You know the ins and the outs here  
All Canadian Surf Club  
Denim jackets and long hair  
Well, we're rocking to the beach  
Watch the waves as they roll there  
I meant I really dig you, baby  
Make me wild with your blonde hair  
Yeah, when you're dancin' next to me  
I want to roll and die there  
I'll be designing my buggy  
While I'm thinking about next year  
Walk across the sand  
With another friend  
My love depends  
When summer ends  
You really abuse and use the beach  
There's lot of things that you need there  
I got my guitar, Cadillac  
Some chick and twenty-four cold beers  
Yeah, when you're dancin' next to me  
I want to roll and die there  
All Canadian Surf Club  
Denim jackets and long hair  
Walk across the sand  
With another friend  
My heart depends  
When summer ends  
Denim jackets and long hair  
I want to roll and die there  
Make me wild with your blonde hair  
Yeah  

We were a blown out of wicked proportions  
An accidental company  
If we said, we're gonna go out and get all tore up tonight  
Then we did, we got a little happenin'  
Player tonight's the night's right  
And don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
With Dottie, the bluegrass singer  
Baring her local breast  
Singing, "You want an open concept  
I'll give you open concepts"  
You player 'Fuck-up nows' right  
And don't clear the place  
Wreak some havoc on the way out  
You might make it  
?Drink up folks it's getting on time to close?  
They said,"We don't even like you", "I'm with you", I said  
Perhaps you think the road is a means to an end  
Where it's a living in the end  
The living end, the living image of the end  
Player tonight's the night's right  
Don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
If your tonight's the night's right  
You don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
Tonight's the night  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  

I want a book that'll make me drunk  
Full of freaks and disenfranchised punks  
No amount of hate, no load of junk  
No bag or words, no costume trunk  
Could make me feel the same way  
An inch an hour, two feet a day  
To move through night  
In this most fashionable way  
There's this fuckin' band you gotta see  
They used to scare the living shit outta me  
No frothing dog, no cool insanity  
No rock 'n roll, no Christianity  
Makes me feel the same way  
An inch an hour, two feet a day  
To move through night with very little else to say  
But I'm helpless less with the people than the space  
No struggle town, no bemused Trudeau  
No solitary walks through vacant lots in moon glow  
Tonight the winter may have missed its mark  
You can see your breath in Springside Park  
Coffee-colored ice and peeling birch bark  
The sound of rushing water in the dark  
Makes me feel the same way  
An inch an hour, two feet a day  
To move through life with very little else to say  
But I'm helpless more with the people than the space  
I mean I'm helpless less with the people than the space  
You see, I don't know Neil, I don't know Neil  

Illuminate the obvious  
It's standing right here in  
Front of us  
What our apartment does  
When we're not around  
Does not concern us  
  
Simulate the obvious  
And it's standing, standing  
Right here in front of us  
Just what our apartment does  
When we're not around  
Does not concern us  
  
She's the horrible esthete  
And she hates her ugly feet  
At a place where her friends  
All meet  
She takes her shoes off and  
Invites everyone to see  
  
Eliminate the obvious  
And it's right here, right here  
In front of us  
Just what our apartment does  
When we're not around  
Does not concern us  
  
She's the horrible esthete  
At the place where her friends all meet  
While her clock reinforces its conceit  
And her mirror checks out  
Other things  
The walls stand a little more  
At ease  
And her books they chat so  
Expertly  
And her cups and saucers get  
Some sleep  
And things get all together neat  
And at the clicking of the key  
Returns the horrible esthete

It's only human to want  
To inhabit every feeling you've got  
And more often than not  
Let's take it to the nth degree  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where he goes  
The puzzle's pullin' apart  
  
And here's the scene  
You're yellin' calmly out the street  
Are we family or what?  
  
From happy-go-lucky  
To surly-go-crazy the lot  
And more often than not  
Admission to the battles is free  
  
Here he goes  
Gimmie ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where he goes  
Pullin' the puzzle apart  
  
And here's the scene  
Where you whisper down the crookedest street  
Are we family or what?  
  
Are we family when it's only if not when  
Sisters and brothers, wolf, wolf lover  
And the boy who stamped too many ants?  
Are we family?  
  
It's only human to want  
To inherit every feeling you've got  
And like it or not  
Let's take it to the nth degree  
  
Here we go  
Give us ten bucks and a head start  
Here's where we go  
The puzzle's pullin' apart  
  
And here's the scene  
Your horse is going the wrong way up the street  
Are we family or what?  
  
Are we family, when its not if but when  
Taking care of each other, one bullet to another  
When it's all if a song can't save us then nothing can?  
Are we family or what?  
(Are we family ?)  
  
Are we family or what?  
(To one another, the lost to the recovered?  
[Incomprehensible])  
Are we family or what?  
(The tribal jury to the Pakistani teen?)  
  
Are we family or what?  
(Ill-starred evenings to champion mystique)  
Are we family or what?  
(Sick as a writer writing to be lighter than the uncanny, are we family?)  
When the invasion of Antarctica's complete are we family?

As I wind down the pines  
It's the lines on your face  
Playing on your face  
  
Without thinking so much  
As abandoning thought  
I went through open country  
Over water meadows streams  
  
Lakes and wires and roosts in reeds  
To a nest in the hole of  
This dead  
Tree.  
  
To play without stopping or pause  
Not for silence not for applause  
Not without thinking  
And thinking's abandoning thought  
  
As I wind down the pines  
It's the lines on your face  
Playing on your face

You do the combat math, I'm the war artist  
You can't take your shots back, I have to watch them miss  
The basketball rim shook like a tambourine  
Not an unlikely event in a game that means nothing  
In a game that means nothing  
  
Makeshift we are, lead never leaves your system no matter who you are  
Makeshift we are, as makeshift as we are  
  
You're a complex dune, I'm a cloud of octopus ink  
You're an elusive tune, I'm more ice sculpture than I think  
You're the neutral tribe and I got the wrong openness  
Here's where I slowly close my eyes and say, "I'm too drunk for this"  
Yeah, I'm too drunk for this  
  
Makeshift we are, 'Weaklings Make Trouble' you played on your guitar  
Makeshift we are, as makeshift as we are, we are, we are, we are  
  
The loneliest boys on dolphin property  
You're as quiet as a fish, I only sing for the whole sea  
From memory metal tension springs, we were gunsmoke and the truth  
Let's shake some snow off of his shoulders  
Let's shake some snow off of the roof, let's shake some snow off of the roof  
  
Makeshift we are, occurring to each other under the setups of the stars  
Makeshift we are, we imagine us here and here we are  
Makeshift we are, through half-squinted eyes becoming a mirage  
Makeshift we are, we are, we are

Me debunk an American myth?  
And take my life in my hands?  
Where the great plains begin,  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian,  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Driving down a corduroy road,  
Weeds standing shoulder high  
Ferris wheel is rusting off in the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Left alone to get gigantic  
Hard, huge and haunted  
A generation so much dumber than it's parents came  
Crashing through the window  
A raven strains along the line of the road,  
Carrying a muddy, old skull  
The wires whistle their approval,  
Off down the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
(At the hundredth meridian) At the hundredth meridian  
(At the hundredth meridian) At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
I remember, I remember Buffalo  
And I remember Angelo  
It would seem to me I remember every  
Single fucking thing I know  
  
If I die of vanity, promise me, promise me,  
They bury me some place I don't want to be,  
You'll dig me up and transport me, unceremoniously,  
Away from the swollen city-breeze, garbage bag trees,  
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity  
And lower me slowly, sadly and properly  
Get Ry Cooder to sing my eulogy,  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin

Gently breathing, lit by the morning sun  
Through the night, it'd been raining venom  
I want to be kind, not a bullet in the right place  
Or just of two minds, more important than importance  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch, a sting, I don't feel a thing  
As the earth revolved around the sun  
  
All those shadows, waiting round the last lights  
To the dream of being, here comes the night  
All of the tiptoeing, past all our most-feared buildings  
I only say this now because, I didn't when it was happening  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch, a sting, I don't feel a thing  
But as the earth revolves around the sun  
  
I can see it all at once  
And, oh, what a glittering chance  
In my head the game goes quiet  
And I can see it all at once  
Them yelling, "Yer not the goods!  
A kid before the rapids!"  
But in my head the game is quiet  
And, oh, what a glittering chance  
Oh, what a glittering chance  
Oh, what a glittering chance  
  
At transformation  
At transformation  
  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being

They shot a movie once, in my hometown  
Everybody was in it, from miles around  
Out at the speedway, some kind of Elvis thing  
Well I ain't no movie star  
But I can get behind anything  
Yeah I can get behind anything  
  
Get it out, get it all out  
Yeah stretch that thing  
Make it last, make it last  
At least until the supper bell rings  
Well the taxi driver likes his rhythm  
Never likes the stops  
Throes of passion, throes of passion  
When something just threw him off  
  
Sometimes the faster it gets  
The less you need to know  
But you gotta remember  
The smarter it gets  
The further its gonna go  
When you blow at high dough  
When you blow at high dough  
  
Baby I feel fine  
I'm pretty sure it's genuine  
It makes no sense, no it makes no sense  
But I'll take it free anytime  
Whoever fits her usually gets her  
It was the strangest thing how she moved so fast, moved so fast  
Into that wedding ring  
  
Out at the speedway, same Elvis thing  
Well I can't catch her, but I can get behind anything  
Yea I can get behind anything  
Well I can get behind anything

Well I think that there's a problem here  
Her voice just don't sound right  
Left a message on the answering machine  
Said, "I'm back in town tonight"  
I feel I've stepped out of the wilderness  
All squint-eyed and confused  
But even babies raised by wolves  
They know exactly when they've been used  
  
See when it starts to fall apart  
It really falls apart  
Like boots or hearts, oh when they start  
They really fall apart  
  
Fingers and toes, fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Forty-one if you include  
The fact that we don't care  
Now you've blocked off most of main street  
For your faith parade  
Everyone in town now, they probably all agree  
I'm lying in the bed I made  
  
Now you won't even let me talk to you  
We got some air to clear  
We'd probably only agree on one thing anyway  
That's what the hell is happening here?  
Finger and toes, fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Forty-one if you include  
The fact that we don't care

Rolling hill all covered in suede  
I'm heat-nervous and out of road  
Downtown there's a parade  
But I don't think I wanna go  
Smart as trees in Sault Ste Marie  
I can speak my mother tongue  
Passing laws just because  
And singing songs of the English unsung  
  
How could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky?  
  
Front seats stamped by the window  
No erasees in this game  
Arbitrary as the wind blows  
It's another way to lay claim  
Ain't no cause for bloodthirst  
In a little town so dry  
Where the angels dance on a pinhead  
Just to make room for you and I  
How could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky  
  
Thoroughbreds with their great big heads  
Think a mile might be too far  
Highway horses laugh, but of course  
When they don't know where the hell they are  
Smart as trees an Sault Ste Marie  
Victorious mother tongue  
Passing laws just because  
Singing songs of the English unsung  
  
Well how could you do it?  
How could you even try?  
When you were born in the water  
And you were raised up in the sky?

The sweet sound of patent approval comin' down in a not quite fog  
The sweet sound of patent approval comin' down in  
Powdery sparks the sweet sound of patent approval  
Comin' down with holiday concern the sweet sound of patent approval  
Comin' down in a world of hurt  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready  
  
The warm hand of abject approval comin' down with its' ropey veins  
The warm hand of abject approval comin' down to the  
Fingerbowl  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready  
  
The cold eye of constant approval comin' down to freeze the blood  
The cold eye of constant approval comin' down to look real  
Close  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready

I had heart, but I used to be older  
I'm not like I used to be had you,  
But I guess it's all over you talk,  
But you're not like me  
  
You talk and you talk like some weird saint  
What do you think that we could taint?  
When you're nothing I am and I'm something you ain't  
  
Hold me, until the night makes colder  
Tell me, how life's made you bad kick  
When I choke and I smolder  
When I'm not what you had  
  
I'm looking for a cemetery side road  
I'm screaming like a lighthouse lamp  
I'm chasing after what I think that I'm owed  
Like a french foreign legion tramp  
  
You swim in an ocean that's storming  
You eat when the wolves all do  
You ache like a mother in mourning  
When you're left along with you

By design, by neglect for a fact or just for effect  
When they met where they connect at the confluence of travel and sex  
More a trip than a quest plunged into the deeply freckled breast  
Where to now? If I had to guess, I am afraid to say, Antarctica's next  
Or Chagrin Falls, Ohio, where the unknown won't even go  
To Chagrin Falls, Ohio, where the unknown won't even go  
Home's solitude with options artificial chaos isn't one of 'em  
Return there crestfallen Chagrin fell out of her apron  
No profound sound no special effects  
The continent tipped and she just quietly left  
Chagrin Falls on our heads not in a gush but in maddening droplets  
Chagrin Falls, Chagrin Falls, Chagrin Falls, so falls Chagrin Falls  
So falls Chagrin Falls, so falls Chagrin Falls  

There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream  
There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons at a steady stream  
  
It's wing music to a happy cat  
He likes his butterflies  
Slow and fat  
And wing music to a happy cat  
He likes his butterflies  
Slow and fat  
  
Us little Christians in a circle  
Jerk  
Til our daddy gets home from  
Work  
All us good Christians in a circle  
Jerk  
Til our daddy gets home from  
Work  
  
There's a cannon shooting  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream  
There's a cannon that shoots  
Coconut cream  
40 gallons in a steady stream

It's hard to leave your bed  
The cool and hard summer sheets  
Hangover hanging on by the fangs  
Walk to work on wild feet  
Get to the back door  
Look around then turn the key  
Turn all the lights on  
Take down the chairs and make things neat  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
  
Your favorite mixed tape  
You popped it into the deck  
Don't care if it's out of date  
Ol' cat power and classic Beck  
Beware purveyors of cool  
With their compacts of one  
Talking cannons to fool  
When all you need's a BB gun  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
  
One night he'll make you choose  
I'm sorry but he will  
The hardscape or your shoes  
When the moon's behind the hill  
  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Beautiful and disaffected  
It was all perfect till  
He came along and wrecked it  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Hey Coffee Girl  
Hey there Coffee Girl  
Hey there Coffee Girl

Angst on the planks, spittin from a bridge  
Just to see how far down it really is  
Robbing a bank, jumping on a train  
Old antiques a man alone can entertain  
  
It takes all of your power  
To prove that you don't care  
I'm not Cordelia. I will not be there.  
  
Tin can man, dragging from a car  
Just to see how alive you really are  
Marrying words, falling in your wake  
Just to tell what you can't eliminate  
  
Treading the boards, screaming out Macbeth  
Just to see how much bad luck you really get  
Jump in the ring with your hidden cape  
The bull can't decide what it is that he really hates  
  
Angst on the planks, spittin from a bridge  
Just to see how far down it really is  
Robbing a bank, jumping on a train  
Old antiques a man alone can entertain  
  
Thief lingers on, on his hands and knees  
Must be one more thing her I really need  
Die in your dreams, falling on your knife  
A Thief blinded on the job has to steal for life

Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blown  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it in my bones  
Country day  
  
Where mister misses smoke  
And things are finally clicking  
Still having trouble with the things that are meaningful  
But yeah, really clicking  
  
Our dreams are where we're at  
Where we can see and touch  
With work we understand  
But we don't want for much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blown  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it in my bones  
Country day  
  
You infiltrate my life  
You resonate with meaning  
I wrote "I Love You" on a rock one night  
Threw it, never dreaming  
  
Now our dreams are where we're at  
What we can feel and touch  
It's work we understand  
[ The Tragically Hip Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]  
But we don't want for much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
A gentle breeze gently blows  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
I can feel it deep in my bones  
Country day  
  
And that rock it missed your head  
Though it didn't miss by much  
I remember what you said  
No I mean it, I am touched  
And somehow, it is enough  
  
So God keep our land  
Cause we certainly can't  
Until the darkness ends  
Until the sun dries again  
  
Our dreams are where we're at  
What we can smell and touch  
Work we understand  
We don't want too much  
  
Country day  
A day in the unknown  
Where they'd been, where we're going  
Country day  
  
Country day  
Another day in the unknown  
Gently drawn to a close  
Country day

Watch the band through a bunch of dancers  
Quickly, follow the unknown with something more familiar.  
Quickly something familiar  
Courage, my word it didn't come it doesn't matter  
  
Sleepwalk, so fast asleep in a motel  
That has the lay of home and piss on all of your  
Background and piss on all your surroundings  
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter  
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time  
  
So there's no simple explanation  
For anything important any of us do  
And yeah the human tragedy  
Consists in the necessity  
Of living with the consequences  
Under pressure, under pressure.  
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter,  
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time.

I can't imagine how you feel and this is how you feel  
You say your name like you're no longer convinced  
But now they're strapping you in and closing the lid  
And they're dropping you in what's done you did  
The bell is picking up speed there's water leaking in  
That ol' equilibrium just starts to spin and spin  
Do you like to be judged or liked  
Do you like it inside a barrel  
Plunging over the falls  
Curious and grim we wrestle at the rim  
We wonder all about him and the point of it all  
  
I'll be short and brief  
And to the point  
The fighting has resumed  
In that tone of voice  
The plague is exhumed  
He said "what I'm going through  
Is essentially all true  
Made no less amazing  
By the fact that it's see-through"  
You like to be judged or liked  
And you like it inside a barrel  
Plunging over the falls  
Strong and green and dim it wrestled him like nothin'  
Out out out  
And into the thrill of em all  
  
And the real wonder of the world is that we don't jump too

Done and done  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
  
Done and done  
Talk about me  
I'll listen for hours  
'Cause I don't know how it ends  
  
We're through, through  
Through and through  
Yeah, through, through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
  
Done and done  
Days accomplished  
If I had a wish  
It'd be for more of this  
  
This through, through  
Through and through  
Yeah, through, through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
Night accomplished  
If I had a wish  
I'd wish for more of this  
  
This through, through  
This through and through  
We're through, through  
Yeah, through and through

Sled dogs after dinner  
Close their eyes on  
The howlin' wastes  
Kurt Cobain, reincarnated,  
Sighs and licks his face  
Then they drift past strips  
Of Serengeti and the gates  
Of Sleepy Hollow too  
You can pause in wonder,  
They paused in wonder and  
Yea, I paused in wonder too  
Just don't wake daddy  
  
They can lay their heads  
On their futon-beds,  
So many miles from home  
You can teach your children  
Some fashion sense and they  
Fashion some of their own  
For when the policy-weary  
Commune on the untamed land  
Through white sheers  
Whispers in their ears,  
You're damned  
And don't wake daddy  
  
You can stuff yer void  
With the asteroid  
That's hurtlin' toward the earth  
You can drop the bomb  
That restores some calm  
Then promises rebirth  
Just don't wake daddy  
  
It's the perfect time now  
For an eclectic choice  
They're all asleep but us now  
It's time to hear your voice  
  
Sing to end all songs  
To end all songs

Like anyone I knew a Dave  
Drove a Plymouth shallow grave  
Said, "my girl don't just walk, she unfurls"  
With motorcycle language  
He stumbled through his slang pledge  
Then he dragged the mud for wedding pearls  
  
He closed both his eyes and sort of gave her a kiss  
Said "don't worry baby about what you're gonna miss  
There will always be a much much more than this  
Every time you go, you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
  
Pulled down his birthday suitcase  
Brown with dust from no place  
Said, "I think its time we made a start"  
They danced the waltz of charity  
No car garage, two kids for free  
They were pissing bliss and playing parts  
  
She closed both her eyes, sorta gave him a kiss...  
Said "don't worry baby about what you're gonna miss  
There will always be a much much more than this  
Every time you go, you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
  
And the big snake pit  
And we dance to the edge of it  
And we laugh and we laugh  
Cause we ain't seen the edge of it  
  
Every time you go, you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
Every time you go, you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
Every time you go, you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
You and me you and me you and me

September seventeen  
For a girl I know it's Mother's Day  
Here son has gone alee  
And that's where he will stay  
Wind on the weathervane  
Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean  
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain  
For a boy in Fiddler's Green  
  
His tiny knotted heart  
Well, I guess it never worked too good  
The timber tore apart  
And the water gorged the wood  
You can hear her whispered prayer  
For men at masts that always lean  
The same wind that moves her hair  
Moves a boy through Fiddler's Green  
  
Nothing's changed anyway  
Nothing's changed anyway  
Any time today  
  
He doesn't know a soul  
There's nowhere that he's really been  
But he won't travel long alone  
No, not in Fiddler's Green  
Balloons all filled with rain  
As children's eyes turn sleepy-mean  
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain  
For a boy in Fiddler's Green

Bill Barilko disappeared that summer,  
He was on a fishing trip.  
The last goal he ever scored  
Won the Leafs the cup  
They didn't win another until 1962,  
The year he was discovered.  
I stole this from a hockey card,  
I keep tucked up under  
My fifty mission cap, I worked it in  
To look like that  
  
Bill Barilko disappeared that summer, (in 1950)  
He was on a fishing trip.(in a plane)  
The last goal he ever scored (in overtime)  
Won the Leafs the cup  
They didn't win another until 1962,  
The year he was discovered.  
I stole this from a hockey card,  
I keep tucked up under  
My fifty mission cap, I worked it in  
To look like that

We wake up different, rifle through our dreams another placid day, ripples at
the seams  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight?  
So tangle-minded then so becalmed it's all so Subway-grim and then it's gone  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight? we get so weary,  
Taking fish off hooks it's not as effortless as it may look  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight?  
We lay down seething, smell our pillows burn and drift off to the place where
you'd think we'd learn  
  
Do you think I bow out cause I think you're right?  
Or cause I don't want to fight? I said, "I give"

You triumphed over will  
You had immunity to kill  
You had your dreams fulfilled  
And I love you still  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Ah the nights are getting cold  
All your secrets will be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
  
As long as you can dig up proof  
As cold as water through the roof  
Brutal as depicted truth  
That kid's a fuckin goof  
Turn your lanterns low  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Yeah the nights are getting cold  
All his secrets will be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
Alright  
  
I'd like to stand up soon and show  
I'd like to let some people know  
I'd turn my bucket over  
I'd turn my lantern low  
But there's a power beyond control  
There's a fire in the hole  
Yeah the nights are getting cold  
All my secrets would be told  
Turn your lanterns low  
Alright  
Alright

Tragically Hip Fireworks lyrics  
If there's a goal that everyone remembers,  
It was back in ol' 72  
We all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger  
And all I remember was sitting beside you  
You said you didn't give a fuck about hockey  
And I never saw someone say that before  
You held my hand and we walked home the long way  
You were loosening my grip on Bobby Orr  
  
Isn't it amazing anything's accomplished  
When the little sensation gets in your way  
Not one ambition whisperin' over your shoulder  
Isn't it amazing you can do anything  
  
We hung out together every single moment  
Cause that's what we though married people do  
Complete with the grip of artificial chaos  
And believing in the country of me and you  
Crisis of faith and crisis in the Kremlin  
And yea we'd heard all of that before  
It's wintertime, the house is solitude with options  
And loosening the grip on a fake cold war  
  
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish  
When you don't let the nation get in your way  
No ambition whisperin' over your shoulder  
Isn't it amazing you can do anything  
  
Next to your comrades in the national fitness program  
Caught in some eternal flexed-arm hang  
Droppin' to the mat in a fit of laughter  
Showed no patience, tolerance or restraint  
  
Fireworks exploding in the distance  
Temporary towers soar  
Fireworks emulating heaven  
Til there are no stars anymore  
Fireworks aiming straight at heaven  
Temporary towers soar  
Til there are no stars shining up in heaven  
Til there are no stars anymore  
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish  
When the little sensation gets in your way  
No ambition whisperin' over your shoulder  
Isn't it amazing what you can accomplish, eh  
This one thing probably never goes away  
I think this one thing is always supposed to stay  
This one thing doesn't have to go away

Does it diminish your  
Super-capacity to love  
  
Walk like a matador,  
Don't be chicken-shit  
And turn breezes into rivulets  
  
Flamenco-sweep the air  
And weave the sun  
And stamp your feet for everyone  
  
Does it exhibit your  
Natural tendency to hate  
  
Maybe a prostitute  
Could teach you  
How to take a compliment  
  
Maybe I'll go to New York,  
I'll drag you there  
You said, "no one drags me  
Anywhere"  
  
Does it diminish your  
Super-capacity to love

Sometimes when I'm walking  
I dream I'm being taken for granted  
It's then that I clearly imagine  
The Day That You Take Me For Granted  
  
You said, one day you're gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
And with no way to take it back  
You'll get frozen in your tracks  
Frozen in your tracks  
  
Sometimes when we're talking  
I feel like you're not even listening  
It's then that I clearly remember  
Rarely ever seeing you listening  
  
You said, when you gonna realize  
You really have no sense of yourself  
There's no way to take it back  
You've been frozen in your tracks  
  
Simpler than the rest, you don't do stupid games  
You're not more complex, you don't lay 'violent blame'  
  
Tonight I was walking (tonight I was walking)  
Feeling alone on this planet (feeling alone on this planet)  
When all at once something stopped me (when all at once something stopped me)  
(I realized I'd taken you for granted) I realized I'd taken you for granted  
  
And tonight I realized  
I really have no sense of myself  
No way to take it back  
I am frozen in my tracks  
I'm frozen in my tracks  
Frozen in my tracks

The beautiful lull,  
The dangerous tug  
We get to feel small  
From high up above  
And after a glimpse  
Over the top  
The rest of the world  
Becomes a gift shop  
  
The pendulum swings  
For the horse like a man  
Out over the rim  
Is ice cream to him  
The beautiful lull,  
The dangerous tug  
We get to feel small  
But not out of place at all  
  
We're forced to bed  
But we're free to dream  
All us human extras,  
All us herded beings  
And after a glimpse  
Over the top  
The rest of the world  
Becomes a gift shop  
  
I don't know what to believe,  
Sometimes I even forget  
And if it's a lie,  
Terrorists made me say it  
The beautiful lull,  
The dangerous tug  
We get to feel small  
From high up above  
  
From high up above

Hello! Good evening, folks  
We are the Silver Poets  
Here in our thousand mile suits  
We're here to get paid  
We know nobody ever who got laid  
Telling people what to do  
We've come too far to feel like that  
You've come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay!  
There's no denying that  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
You're on your way  
  
And though there's no sign  
Of a songbird up here yet  
No one to take advantage of  
We know that life is short  
Nobody can afford it  
To sing a song that they don't love  
I've come too far to feel like this  
You've come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay!  
A diamond dazzling  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
You're on your way  
  
You're on your way  
You're on your way  
You're on the way  
  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
Oh, goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Thank you! Goodnight!  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Oh, goodnight Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat

I remember a girl on her cellphone  
Surrounded by her friends  
Eyes flickering, she's trying  
To smother a smile in her hands  
Is it someone for us  
Someone more worry-free  
Someone who can say'  
"Leave the worrying about him to me Josephine?"  
I remember you there in the last rays  
Of light at diplomacy's end  
Eyes flickering you're crying  
But, isn't this when the crimes begin?  
When the people you want to don't  
The people who do you  
Don't believe you Josephine?  
I remember you there at the table  
Surrounded by all the days plans  
Eyes flickering you're trying  
To let a coffee cup warm your hands  
Maybe we're born lost  
Born to persevere  
Honey I'd walk into your painting  
Until I'd reappeared  
A speck of comet-tail dust  
A blue-green northern light  
Flickering just in your eyes' deepest ravines  
Goodnight goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight Josephine  
Goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight  
Josephine, Josephine, Josephine, Josephine  

He said I'm fabulously rich  
C'mon just let's go  
She kinda bit her lip  
Geez, I don't know  
But I can guarantee  
There'll be no knock on the door  
I'm total pro that's what I'm here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with will and determination  
And grace, too  
  
The secret rules of engagement  
Are hard to endorse  
When the appearance of conflict  
Meets the appearance of force  
But I can guarantee  
There'll be no knock on the door  
I'm total pro  
That's what I'm here for  
I come from downtown  
Born ready for you  
Armed with skill and it's frustration  
And grace, too

Greasy jungle metropolis noir easy tangles the easiest so far ah  
I drove down your road to hazeldean where I tasted your funeral  
Home's sandwiches and coffee I saw your hands melt into one another  
I saw you grieve and grow care a lot about one another  
  
I stood at your sink and I felt your warm water I washed your dishes and  
I looked out your kitchen window where I saw a  
Soulful gymnast melt in the air and shudder just above the snow  
Making moves that just weren't there ah velvet callow with wet  
  
Hands I turned out the lights and breathing shallow hesitated then went
upstairs  
Where I picked up your housecoat dried my  
Hands and touched your hair and just then you awoke you could never really
barely care  
Ah greasy jungle metropolis noir

What's troubling Gus? You sound demented  
Is it because someone talked and she told me?  
He no longer thinks anything that moves  
And everything he sees is something to kill and eat  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
The whip-poor-will at dusk  
what's troubling Gus? Overhearing conversations  
But it?s because you're too either them or me  
Well, it?s either them or it?s us anything that moves  
And everything you see is something to kill and eat  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? No one is afraid enough  
what's troubling Gus? Is it nothing goes quiet?  
Is that what's troubling ya Gus? The mere mention of the name  
Used to be enough to make every bird stop singing  
The whip-poor-will at dusk, tells you no one is afraid  
No one is afraid enough  
Is it afraid? Or is it afraid enough?  
Troubling Gus  

Here's a glue guy, performance god  
A makeshift shrine, a newly lain sod  
Hardly even tryin', gives the nod  
I sure hope I'm not the type to dwell  
Hope I'm a fast healer, fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
If and when you get into the end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't blame, don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
A toonie to the busker and a husky 'keep it comin'' under my breath  
But then said, ?Though, if you wouldn't mind  
Less cryin' and more tryin', more tryin' and less cryin'?  
I'm not the type to dwell  
I'm a fast healer, fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
Oh, if and, if and when you get into the end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't blame, don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
Don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
If and when you get into that end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't change but don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
Ooh, it's just not the same because of this  
Ooh, it's not the same  

I'm going down to see my highway girl she just back from around the world  
I'm gonna get me a gun, I'm gonna stand on guard  
In a little white booth in her front yard  
  
Throwing rocks at her window what could she do if I throw enough rocks  
One might break through well she looked out her  
Window when the police came to see a big tin man dancing in the rain  
  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl  
  
She said, don't you think babe you push a bit too fast I said,  
Slowing down don't make it last and a memory's never gonna set  
You free go out and see that world and bring it home to me  
  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl  
Oh my little highway girl oh my little highway girl

Your smile is fading a bit, so I ration it  
Don't think about it  
Here where the Mississippi quits  
Where it's still got a bit of Minnesota in it  
No one will give you a thing these days  
They'd rather kill it or throw it away  
Don't 'do' dark American streets so  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, where does that leave you and me?  
The river takes, takes, takes and takes  
It doesn't change and only changes  
See it there in a picture with me  
There's a caption beneath, 'New Orleans is beat'  
And if New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
If New Orleans is beat, if New Orleans is beat  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Where does that leave you and me?  
Your smile is fading a bit so I ration it  
Don't think about it  

The moon goes up, I start to sweat call the doctor, call the vet my brain goes
numb, my blood gets hot all I need is what you got  
  
I'm a werewolf, baby, and here I come I'm a werewolf, baby, and here I come  
  
I lose control, I just can't stop you look so good like a big pork chop ripped
my pants, ripped my shirt I'm gonna eat your  
Mother for dessert  
  
I can smell your blood, I can hear you breathe I'm gonna eat your heart, right
off your sleeve eat you cooked, eat you raw I'm  
Gonna rip you up like a big chain saw

I love you even when I don't even know I'm doing it  
And dismiss it out of hand cause I don't even know I'm doing it but your  
Finger starts to wiggle and landscapes emerge  
Can you spare some change dear, we've only got three hundred feet to go  
  
Roses are worth more dried than alive such a thing to say  
O how I adore you when you reinvent a rose cliche can you spare  
Some change dear we've only got three hundred feet to go  
And with impossibilium for a payload we lift the rocket out of the  
Pocket nothing can stop it  
  
Roses are difficult everywhere you must promise me you'll stay  
These long stems are freakish if anything but we can cut 'em  
Down for the vase can you spare some change dear  
We've only got three hundred feet to go and with impossibilium for a Payload  
We lift the rocket out of the pocket nothing can stop it we can only watch it

Puffy lips glistening skin and everything comes rushing in we don't go to hell
memories of us do  
  
I get a sense of connectedness exclusive tight but nothing dangerous we don't
go to hell memories of us do and if you go to hell  
I'll still remember you  
  
But I thought you beat the death of inevitability to death just a little bit I
though you beat the inevitability of death to death just a  
Little bit  
  
Terry's gift is forever green it got me up and back on the scene we don't got
hell just our memories do  
  
Fantastic gap commom space open concept in your smiling face we don't go to
hell memories of us do  
  
And if you go to hell I'll still remember you

He said, 'Fuck this' and 'Fuck that'  
And this guy's the diplomat  
Stares into the blur of the tuner lights  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
He said, 'We are what we lack'  
And this guy's the autodidact  
Stares into the glare of the TV lights  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs,  
Whoa-ohs and  
Yeahs  
  
He sang, 'I'll die before I quit'  
And this guy's the limit  
Stares into the queer of the firefight  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs,  
Whoa-ohs and yeahs  
La las  
Whoa-ohs and  
Yeahs

When the colour of the night  
And all the smoke for one life  
Gives way to shaky movements,  
Improvisational skills,  
A forest of whispering speakers  
Let's swear that we will  
Get with the times,  
In a current health to stay  
Let's get friendship right  
Get life day-to-day  
In the forget-yer-skates dream  
Full of countervailing woes  
In diverse-as-ever scenes  
Proceeding on a need-to-know  
In a face so full of meaning  
As to almost make it glow  
  
O' for a good life, we just might have to weaken  
  
And find somewhere to go  
Go somewhere we're needed  
Find somewhere to grow  
Grow somewhere were needed.

I need your confidence need to know you're mine  
When it gets right down to the killing time  
I know your heart is bad but it's all  
I've ever had we can live our lives on this righteous crime  
  
I got kicked when I was down  
And a sailor took my girl to town  
Then she licked my wounds with the sea dog's salt I drank a  
Half a bottle of jack swore I'd never take you back by the bottle's  
End I was on that phone  
  
What you call compromise I don't understand what you call compromise I don't
understand  
  
How do you walk away? how do you walk away?  
How do you walk away from a woman that gone and done you wrong?

We can take a bit of a breather.  
We can skip to the practical part.  
We can skip to the Time of Neither,  
When we're together and even  
When we're apart.  
I'll tell you a story about the Lake Fever or  
We can skip to the coital fury.  
You didn't say yes or no, neither.  
You whispered, hurry.  
  
We can take it a little bit further.  
We can stick to the after-effects part.  
'Not trying to make you a believer,  
Don't want to a lil' piece of your heart.  
Just telling you a story about the Lake fever  
Or we can skip to a neutral fury.  
You didn't say yes or no neither.  
You whispered, hurry.  
Want to be a nobody without peer.  
Want to be a thought that's never done  
Want to shake your faith in human nature  
Want to break the hearts of everyone.  
Want to be your wheezing screen door.  
Want to be your stars of Algonquin.  
Want to be your roaring floorboard.  
Want to break the hearts of everyone.  
And cause discontent until They,  
Ceasing their investigation,  
Bring back the days events,  
Good citizens and time well spent,  
Til we're talking in whispers again.  
Until we're talking in whispers again

You know the reasons I can't conceal you kow I'm leaving you  
Obviously you know how I feel you know I'm tired of crawling  
'hind my name among the crowd  
  
It's not a matter for wrong or right  
It ain't much better than drinking  
And looking to fight it's not as easy as calling out your  
Name when ism down  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on the last american exit to the north land  
I'm on the last american exit to my homeland  
I'm on the last american exit to my  
Last chance the keep calling out my name, I shout it down  
  
You've made them wonder and know for sure  
You've made them hunger at night and then run for the door you know you'll  
Probably cry like Caesar's son when you're found  
  
It's not your face it's another town let's face it baby  
I'm up and then baby I'm down you'll watch the border offer you fame and  
Watch you drown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Know your neighbors and know they'll take us  
Know my city it's just like theirs are hope I make it I know I'm gonna make it  
Somehow know my savior he knows you shakers  
Know my pity I'll see you later I'd like to stay but I know it doesn't matter  
Somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They keep callin' out my name they keep callin' out my name  
They keep callin' out my name I shout it down

You kissed my fingers and made me love you  
Last night when we went to hell  
When the blood-starred curtain fell  
Men were turning on their machines, making everything mean  
Fires burned, cold values clashed  
Good and evil were all dry grass  
No child-ghost, no singing bird, no last laugh, no last word  
  
Oh, last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them were quite as frightening  
Oh, Canada emptied, there was me featureless and freezing  
Last night I dreamed you didn't love me  
  
You kissed my fingers and made me love you  
  
Last night you left me derelict  
And disappeared for ages  
You said 'honey save those tears of yours for the show  
Oh, last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them were half as frightening  
Oh, Canada emptied, there was me, beside you  
Featureless and freezing  
Last night I dreamed you didn't love me  
You didn't love me  
  
What's happening to you?  
Why don't you love me like you used to?  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you  
  
Last night I dreamed  
Last night I dreamed darkly nurtured dreams  
None of them, none as frightening  
Oh, awake empty and out of sleep  
You were beside me gently breathing  
Last night I dreamed you didn't love me  
  
You didn't love me  
You didn't love me  
Why don't you love me like you used to?  
When you kissed my fingers and you made me love you

Do you mean the attack is routine?  
A bird asked of a bird  
In this context, a concave nest  
How do we learn to hurt?  
Do you mean there's no variation?  
Watching a dog charge a flock  
Of birds exploding in congregation  
Why plan, when when we stop?  
I don't know but why suppose  
'Cause it's not the way it should be?  
When you can fly above the great waiting list  
As the crow implies, we won't be missed  
We can leave, we can leave, we can leave, you leave  
It's a routine flight for this bird tonight  
There's more worms than earth in the after life  
Where the blind feed the blind, whispering things like  
"On the money" and "Bullseye"  
She picks up the little leaves  
Where human wrecks are left to seed  
Left to repaint their deities  
And plaster away at their villainies  
Where there's love and there's hope  
And do you hope those earthbound poets  
Could learn to sing as good as us?  
So we can sit back and enjoy our illusions and our quietus?  
Well I don't know but why suppose  
It's not the way it should be  
When you can squawk and wait for a word from above  
And change yourself into something you love when you leave?  
You leave, you leave  

It might be late  
But it won't be early  
You got me to the gate  
With time for a coffee  
It's getting late  
Sounds like a departure  
It's getting close  
Sounds to me like a departure  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
Lies over time  
Float to the surface  
Lies over time  
They equal surface  
Lies over time  
Though the reasons desert us  
Lies over time  
With no apparent purpose  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged  
  
See the dead art  
And you see your reflection  
Fear no art  
And you fear no reflection  
But don't look at me  
I'm not the artist in question  
Sounds good to me  
But I'm not the artist in question  
Until we meet again  
Lets stay engaged  
Until then  
Lets stay engaged

Cold wind blowing over your private parts I know a lack you've got and it
makes a strong case for art billboard breasts, they  
Don't have a face, I know that fact you've got, no girl could ever trace
lionized, smoking just a little too violently I know that  
Fact I've got and I know it single-mindedly stupid, stoned cause and effect I
know a lack you've got and you don't even lack it  
Yet lionized, lionize  
  
I can't draw, but I can trace I know a lack I've got, an abundance of extra
space cold wind blowing over your private parts I  
Know a lack you've got is to make a strong case for art lionized, lionize

It gets so sticky down here  
Better butter your cue-finger up  
It's the start of another new year  
Better call the newspaper up 2.50  
For a hi-ball and a buck and a half  
For a beer happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
The long days of Shockley are gone  
So is football Kennedy style  
Famous last words taken all wrong  
Wind up on the very same pile  
2.50 for a decade  
And a buck and half for a year happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
I can cry, beg and whine  
T'every rebel I find  
Just to give me a line I could use to describe  
  
They'd say, "baby, eat this chicken slow  
It's full of all them little bones"  
  
So regal and decadent here  
Coffin-cheaters dance on their graves music,  
All it's delicate fear  
Is the only thing that don't change  
2.50 for an eyeball  
And a buck and a half for an ear happy hour,  
Happy hour happy hour is here  
  
Nothing's dead down here,  
Just a little tired they'd say,  
"Baby, eat this chicken slow  
It's full of all them little bones"

They don't know how old I am,  
They found armor in my belly  
From the sixteenth century  
Conquistador, I think  
They don't know how old I am,  
They found armor in my belly  
Passion out of machine revving tension  
Lashing out at machine revving tension  
Rushing by the machine revving tension  
  
Morning broke out the backside of a truck-stop  
The end of a line a real, rainbow-likening, luck stop  
Where you could say I became chronologically fucked up  
Put ten bucks in just to get the tank topped up  
  
Then I found a place it's dark and it's rotted  
It's a cool, sweet kinda place  
Where the coppers won't spot it  
And I destroyed the map, I even thought I forgot it,  
However, everyday I'm dumping the body  
  
It'd be better for us if you don't understand  
It'd be better for me if you don't understand  
  
Then I found a place it's dark and it's rotted  
It's a cool, sweet kinda place  
Where the coppers won't spot it  
And I destroyed the map that I'd carefully dotted,  
However, everyday I'm dumping the body  
  
It'd be better for us if you don't understand  
It'd be better for us if you don't understand  
It'd be better for me if you don't understand  
  
Let me out  
Let me out  
  
Let me out  
Let me out  
  
Let me out

Does your mother tell you things?  
Long, long when I'm gone?  
Who you talking to?  
Is she telling you I'm the one?  
It's a grave mistake and I'm wide awake.  
  
Drive-In's rained out  
Weatherman wet-fingers the sky  
He pokes it out, he pulls it in  
He don't know why  
It's the same mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time running  
It's well worth the wait  
  
We don't go anywhere  
Just on trips  
We haven't seen a thing  
We still don't know where it is  
It's a safe mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time running  
  
Well, well it's all the same mistake  
Dead to rights and wide awake  
I'll drop a caribou, I'll tell on you  
I'll tell on you, I'll tell on you  
  
You've got a boat-load of nerve  
But I would say you've been told  
You work me against my friends  
And you'll get left out in the cold  
It's the same mistake  
  
It's been a long time running  
It's been a long time coming  
It's been a long, long, long time running  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait  
It's well worth the wait

I've got a job, I explore, I follow every little whiff  
And I want my life to smell like this  
To find a place, an ancient race  
The kind you'd like to gamble with  
Where they'd stamp on burning bags of shit.  
Looking for a place to happen  
Making stops along the way  
  
Wayward ho! Away we go,  
It's a shame to leave this masterpiece  
With it's gallery gods and it's garbage-bag trees  
So I'll paint a scene, from memory,  
So I'd know who murdered me  
It's a vain pursuit, but it helps me to sleep  
Looking for a place to happen  
Making stops along the way  
  
Jacques Cartier, right this way,  
I'll put your coat up on the bed  
Hey man you've got a real bum's eye for clothes  
And come on in, sit right down,  
No you're not the first to show  
We've all been here since, God, who knows?  
Looking for a place to happen,  
Making stops along the way.

I've been interpreted and shrunk  
I've been as touch less as a drunk  
  
This is as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
This is as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a curse  
Be her world, all it deserves  
Love is a curse  
Get what you can not desert  
  
I know, I know it's all just first blurts  
That he who would try to own deserves it  
And I know it's got nothing to do with deserves it  
Just that you don't just blurt  
  
Love is a curse  
Love is a curse  
Love is a curse  
You don't just blurt  
Love is a curse  
  
Though I've been too weak to escape  
And I don't have the strength to pluck a grape  
  
Though it's as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
Though it's as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a first  
Felt the dull fangs of the truth  
Love is a first  
Their music they torture to  
Love is a first  
A song would power it first  
Love is a first  
Let's walk down the darkness's horse  
  
We were frozen until he saw us  
And smoke and murder fell on the floor  
And watch the own death of your TV  
And dreams are stuck in urgent tweeds  
Drain the ocean of words  
Like God's representatives on earth  
Learn to hurt and how not to hurt  
And the thing you taught me and what I learned  
Love is a first  
  
And it's as bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a curse  
Be her world, all it deserves  
Love is a first  
Go where the curtain occurs  
Love is a curse  
Get what you can't not desert  
Love is a first  
It just occurs and a occurs  
  
We were frozen until he saw us  
And smoke and murder fell on the floor  
And watch the own death of your TV  
And dreams are stuck in urgent tweads  
Drain the ocean of words  
Like God's representatives on earth  
Learn to hurt and how not to hurt  
And the thing you taught me and what I learned  
Love is a first

Is it a mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear?  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
Is it the way the dust clings to the air  
But you'd swear, you'd swear  
Is it a mean streak, a desolation sound?  
A copy of desire oh nothing's that far down  
A mean streak on a western swing  
On TV saying the damnedest thing  
Mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
It's the way the dust clings to the air  
After a stranger's been there, you'd swear, you'd swear  
Is it a mean streak to a certain degree?  
They come whistling down the crookedest street  
A mean streak in the ghost state  
Between the certain and the hesitating  
A mean streak, you'd swear, you'd swear  
We never seen a stranger 'round here  
It's the way that dust clings to the air  
After the stranger's been here, you'd swear you'd swear  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
Sssh sssh sound of the bottoms of their boots  
On the tops of the grass  
As their hay wagon rolled past  
And I'd swear I'd swear  
The way the dust clings to the air  
After the stranger's been here  
I'd swear I'd swear  
That that was you there  
Was that you there?  
That was you there  
I'd swear, I'd swear  
[Incomprehensible]  

The reactor's down  
I guess for Labour Day, today  
It's the first day I ain't seen  
A great plume of steam from across the lake  
From across the lake  
Hey, that's a morning moon, yeah.  
  
I'm not making strain  
Said, "Someone's paying  
When something's too cheap  
Somebody's paying something"  
You said, "Some one's paying something."  
Under a morning moon, yeah  
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better, yeah  
  
It didn't take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
To say one little thing that could make me feel better  
Under this morning moon, yeah  
  
The sun's a light bulb and the moon is a mirror  
There are times when you can see both the bulb and the mirror  
See the bulb and the mirror  
And that's the morning moon, yeah  
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better  
  
It doesn't take too much to upset her  
Nothing that could clear the room  
Just saying one little thing trying to make you feel better  
Under this morning moon, yeah  
Under this morning moon  
  
Morning moon, yeah  
Trying to make you feel better  
Nothing too far from the truth

Everything is bleak  
It's the middle of the night  
You're all alone and  
The dummies might be right  
You feel like a jerk  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Avoid trends and cliches  
Don't try to be up to date  
And when the sunlight gets the olive oil  
Don't hesitate  
The night's so long it hurts  
My music at work  
In a symbol to near or far  
Or the anatomy of a stain  
To determine where you are  
In a sink full of ganges, I'd remain  
No matter what you heard  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
I call it Olga Waits  
The cloud that entertains  
The dim possibility of  
Showing some restraint  
The rain came down berserk  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
On a star beyond the chart  
Or the dark side of a drop of rain  
Determining where you are  
In a sink full of ganges, I remain  
No matter what you heard  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Everything is bleak  
It's the middle of the night  
You're all alone and  
The dummies might be right  
Outside, the darkness lurks  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Hey fallen hummingbird  
My music at work  
From the middle of the earth  
My music at work  
Bound for bed without dessert  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work

Bourbon blues on the street, loose and complete  
Under skies all smoky blue-green  
I can't forsake a Dixie dead-shake  
So we danced the sidewalk clean  
My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?  
New Orleans is sinking man, and I don't wanna swim  
  
Colonel Tom, what's wrong? What's going on?  
Can't tie yourself up for a deal  
He said "hey north you're south shut your big mouth,  
You gotta do what you feel is real"  
Ain't got no picture postcards, ain't got no souvenirs  
My baby, she don't know me when I'm thinking 'bout those years  
  
Pale as a light bulb hanging on a wire  
Sucking up to someone just to stoke the fire  
Picking out the highlights of the scenery  
Saw a little cloud that looked a little like me  
  
I have my hands in the river  
My feet back up on the banks  
Looked up to the Lord above  
And said, hey man thanks  
Sometimes I feel so good I gotta scream  
She said Gordie baby I know exactly what you mean  
She said, she said, I swear to God she said  
  
My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?  
New Orleans is sinking man and I don't wanna swim  
Swim

Now, the apology done  
Applause can begin  
Now, the apologies done  
Applause begins  
  
If it bleeds it leads  
If it cries it flies  
If it feeds a need  
If it dies, it dies  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
It doesn't fade, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
And Honey Watson  
I struggle on  
  
Oh, Honey Watson  
We were born with sin  
Some truth, some reconciliation  
And gone with the wind  
  
If it feeds the need  
If it dies, it dies  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
We are the same, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
Honey Watson  
I struggle on  
  
Gone, like an attraction  
Like the sun in a mirror  
Gone, like it was destined  
To simply disappear  
  
Gone, like Honey Watson  
Applause can begin  
The song is almost done  
Applause begins  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
It doesn't fade, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
We are the same, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
And Honey Watson  
I struggle on

Here we are, now where are we?  
It's like nothing I've ever seen we got hoarse-throated huckster's whispered
gimmicks  
Rubbernecking the curious cynics and headlong-walkers,  
One born every minute do I plug it in? or do I stick it in?  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the  
Verge  
  
Here we are, now who are you? the long lost queen's of some hoodoo?  
Well we're the last of the big-time penetrators playin'  
Dead to fuck the undertaker the movie'll come out a little bit later the men,  
The legend, the goat, the satyr  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't say I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge  
  
Here we are, now don't ask how the time to leave was kind now well don't cry,  
Baby, there's no cause for grief  
  
Deadheading's never gonna kill the chief it's an empty road without relief  
And I'm a highway romance milking thief  
  
I don't know what came over me I'm too dumb for words  
I didn't think I'd like it here at all but, I swear, I swear I'm on the verge

He bought two-fifths of lead free gasoline  
Said, the bottle is dusty, but my engine is clean  
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find  
If his bride didn't like it, St Peter wouldn't mind  
  
Now I lie here so out-of-breath  
And over-opiated  
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no but  
Maybe he could have waited  
  
Well the medicine man started seeing red  
You think the snake just dreams up the poison in his head  
Addicted to approval, addicted to the air  
It was see if you like it or see you up there

Spring starts when a heartbeat's pounding  
When the birds can be heard above the reckoning carts doing some final
accounting  
Lava flowing in Superfarmer's direction  
He's been getting reprieve from the heat in the frozen food section  
  
Don't tell me what the poets are doing  
Don't tell me that they're talking tough  
Don't tell me that they're anti-social  
Somehow not anti-social enough, all right  
  
And porn speaks to it's splintered legions  
To the pink amid the withered cornstalks in them winter regions  
While aiming at the archetypal father  
He said with such broad and tentative swipes why do you even bother?  
  
Don't tell me what the poets are doing  
Those Himalayas of the mind  
Don't tell me what the poet's been doing  
In the long grasses over time  
  
Don't tell me what the poets are doing  
On the street and the epitome of vague  
Don't tell me how the universe is altered  
When you find out how he gets paid, all right  
  
If there's nothing more that you need now  
The lawn cut by bare breasted women  
Beach bleached towels within reach for the women  
Got to make it, that'll make it by swimming

I could make you scared if you want me to I'm not prepared, but if I have to
he said, I can make you scared, it's kinda what I do  
If you're prepared, here's what I can put you through you're in Russia and
more than a million works of art are wicked out to the  
Woods so when Nazis find the whole place dark they'd think god's left the
museum for good  
  
I make you scared, if that's what I do if you're prepared, if I have to if I
make you scared and you pay me to if that's the deal  
Now here's what I can do for you  
  
Now there's a focus group that can prove this is all nothing but cold
calculation  
  
Tests have shown that suspicious or hostile their lives need not be shortened
truth be told they can live a long, long while tickled  
To death by their importance  
  
If you make me scared, if that's what you do if I'm unclear can I get out of
this thing with me and you if you feel scared, a bit  
Confused, I gotta say this sounds a little beyond anything I'm used to  
  
Now there's a precious few that can prove that at the root this is all nothing
but a cold calculation  
  
Clearly entranced, you're leaning back now defanged destroyer limps into the
bay down at the beach it's attracting quite a  
Crowd as kids wade through blood out to it to play  
  
Okay you made me scared, you did what you set out to do I'm not prepared,
really had me going there for a minute or two he  
Said, you made me scare too, I wasn't sure I was getting through I gotta go,
it's been a pleasure doing business with you

Been to Reno  
Drives an El Camino  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Hip canteen  
You always make the scene  
You're a crazy child  
  
It's a sad thing  
Bourbons all around  
To stop that feeling when you're living  
In a small town  
  
You're long and lean  
But things don't get you down  
You're a top ten kingpin in the borders  
Of you're hometown  
  
You can't get hip  
You work the jobs I've quit  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Won't admit  
You just don't give a shit  
You're a crazy child  
  
Can't live to die - too easy  
Why stick around  
Not another small town hometown bringdown  
  
This is it  
You might as well get pissed  
Can you dig that style?  
  
Make your trip  
There ain't that much to miss  
You're a crazy child

Interesting and sophisticated  
Refusing to be celebrated  
It's a monumental big screen kiss  
It's so deep it's meaningless  
One day you'll just up and quit  
And that'll be it  
Just then the stripper stopped in a coughing fit  
She said sorry I can't go on with this  
  
Yeah that's awful close  
But that's not why  
I'm so hard done by  
  
It was true cinema a clef  
You should see it before there's nothing left  
In an epic too small to be tragic  
You'll have to wait a minute  
Cause it's an instamatic  
  
Yeah that's awful close  
But that's not why  
I'm so hard done by  
  
Just then the room became more dimly lit  
As the emcee carried on with it  
And now that I got you all strangely compelled  
I'm afraid that Candy's not feeling well  
  
Close, but that's not why  
I'm so hard done by

Instructions from the manual could not have been much more plain the blues are
still required the blues are still required again  
Past territorial piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from
the rooftops we live to survive our paradoxes  
  
Men here of the secret they pass in upholstered silence they only exist in
crisis they only exist in silence past territorial  
Piss-posts past whispers in the closets past screamin' from the rooftops we
live to survive our paradoxes we'll live to survive  
Our paradoxes

You did the best that you could do.  
You were a great crew,  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you.  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay, but why.  
  
You see a light and then another  
And everything you fought for naught's uncovered.  
You're not a fighter, you're a lover.  
You got no business in here, brother  
So, stay.  
Stay.  
  
Is it the worst that you could do?  
You were a great you,  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay and why.  
Cause you see a light and then another.  
Everything you thought you sought's uncovered.  
You're a fighter and a lover  
And there's no one up above her  
So, stay.  
Stay.  
  
All things being balanced, it's balanced and called balancing  
Somewhere beyond everything it's being balanced  
Not for the sake of balance  
But balancing between the throes of learning  
And the entire thing  
Entirely  
Balancing.

You were streets ahead, I couldn't sleep a wink  
Staring in the dark, by the light of your skin  
At myself sitting, on a suitcase  
Or as the sleeping youth, in the upset sleigh  
  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
  
Listen, you can hear, the sound of the sleigh  
The panting of the team, of all runners away  
And all the gentle work, of the traces  
Their jingle-jangle jerk, destroying all space  
  
They won't wait  
They don't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
Just stay together  
They don't wait  
  
Wait, wait, wait, wait  
Please, just stay together  
  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
They run with the weather  
They don't wait  
They don't wait  
They won't wait  
Just stay together  
They don't wait  
  
Wait, wait, wait, wait  
Please, just stay together

Does summer exist in its praises?  
Does summer exist in its praises?  
The summer lives here where this place is  
Come on up here, we've got something to show you  
Wanna show you everything we know  
Wanna show you we've been banished before you  
Wanna show you we've got our own roads  
And does your family know your wishes  
'Cause this chorus will do you like the dishes  
Summer's killin' us  
It's just sing, sing, sing all day  
It's as if summer existed in it's praises  
Come on over, I've got somethin' to play you  
'Back At Sunshine', it's the Shadow Band  
We can have strictly cactus relations  
Telling the waves to stop crashing  
And does anybody know your wishes  
'Cause this tune'll do you like the dishes  
This summer's killin' us  
It's just sing, sing, sing all day  
It's as if summer just exists in her praises  
A time for more to happen sooner  
A time to be a person you still know  
To float a while on your sure power  
Till you say, "Canada lost, go home"  
The summer's killin' us  
We sing, sing, sing all day  
And it's as if summer exists here in it's praises, ooh  
Summer exists in a doorway  
Summer exists at the fair  
Summer is forever changes  
Summer's taking me all the way  

I was first attracted by your scent  
Your heart must be a caramelized onion  
By the time I saw your flame  
It was all over for you and whashisname.  
  
I think it was Algonquin Park  
It was so cold and winter-dark  
A promised hibernation high  
Took me across the great black plate of ice.  
  
Now I'm the islander.  
I found a place to call my den  
And dreamt of the ferry and  
The enormous man  
Huge as were his children  
Following around after him  
  
I'm the islander  
Woke up in the furtive spring  
More capable of anything  
  
I waited for more men to come  
Hey docked their boats and cocked their guns  
The time for truth and reconciliation's gone  
But with my belly full I intended to get something done  
  
I'm the islander  
Woke up in the dead of spring  
More hungry than anything  
Islander

You lured me with your diamond flower  
You lured me with talk of still more talk  
You lured me with caramelizing power  
You lured me a lot  
Clearly lifeless bare feet  
And dogs just trained to sniff  
You saw him struggle  
Then you saw him cease his struggling  
You said, we're halfway come and meet us  
We're the completists  
  
You lured me with your bad intentions  
You lured me with your Mexican pot  
You lured me with desert dimensions  
You lured me a lot.  
You loaded up your gear so well  
You can pack so tight  
But I can still hear your tambourine  
Demeaning you through the night  
Don't want to sound defeatist  
But we're the 'complete-est'.  
  
Intimate, inaccurate, a family, in a way,  
Made the trip to Vulnerable and back  
On the same day.  
Don' t want to sound defeated.  
You lured me into repetition  
You lured me to want to go to sleep  
You lured me into open spaces  
You lure me  
Clearly lifeless bare feet  
And dogs just trained to sniff  
You showed him struggle  
Then you showed him cease his struggling  
You said, we're halfway, come, and meet us  
We're the completists.  
Halfway come and meet us  
The 'complete-est'

Under the pillow  
I bury my head and try to shut Chicago out  
As it turns out there's a whole other world of sounds  
Of perfect fifths low skids and Arctic howls  
  
All saying are you going through something?  
Are you going through something?  
  
Under the pillow a little room to breathe  
The early morning light's a pale cranberry  
I hear the not-wow-wow  
Of a siren faraway and closing steadily  
  
Saying Are you going through something?  
Are you going through something?  
Cause I-I-I-I I am too  
  
Under the pillow  
I can hear you whisperin' are you going through something?  
  
Well honey are you going through something?  
Are you going through something?  
Then I-I-I-I I am too  
Then I-I-I-I I am too  
  
Then I-I-I-I  
  
I am too  
  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme-gimme  
Gimme an opportunity gimme-gimme  
Put me put me put me put me-put me  
In the saddle I'll ride you'll see  
  
There's new work in the Day Room  
I can't lounge on-line  
Don't you laugh  
I'd sell a giraffe and I'd give you half  
Just to occupy my mind  
  
I'll be driven my eyes always moving  
I'll be riveted to the task yea  
No smiling! That's important  
I will make my face a mask  
  
And I'm thinking just in passing  
What if this song does nothing?  
What if this song does nothing  
  
Working in the new New Orleans World  
I'm emptying slots working like a ghost  
I move through huge rooms with no windows  
And no Gulf of Mexico  
  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme-gimme  
Gimme an opportunity gimme-gimme  
Put me put me put me put me-put me  
In the saddle please  
  
I'll be driven my eyes always moving  
I'll be riveted to the task yea  
No smiling! That's so important  
I will make my face a mask  
  
And I'm thinking just in passing  
What if this song does nothing?  
What if this song does nothing?  
What if this song does nothing  
What if this song does nothing  
  
Bring on the requisite strangeness  
It always has to get a little weird a little weird  
Yea you just bring on the requisite strangeness  
Bring it on then disappear disappear  
Go to be a man of the boom  
To Florida without the ocean  
But  
Don't you wanna see how it ends?  
When the door is just starting to open?  
When Athabasca depends?  
Don't you wanna see how it ends  
  
I can hear you  
But I can't stay here  
You left me lost in the Barrens  
You left me born on the stairs  
It's minus 11  
Inside my kettle  
I didn't come to get lost in the Barrens  
I didn't come to settle  
To be a man on the moon  
To get my little slice of heaven  
Yeah  
Don't you wanna see how it ends?  
When the door is just starting to open?  
And Athabasca depends  
Don't ya wanna see how it ends  
  
Don't you wanna see how it ends?  
The door is just starting to open.  
Athabasca depends.  
Don't you wanna see how it ends?  
Yeah  
Don't you wanna see how it ends?  
I'm holding the door to the Barrens  
And Athabasca depends  
Don't ya wanna see how it ends?

In that September off Isle Aux Morts  
The desultory sea grew more so through the night  
And made one think of tawny ports  
And aspen tremblin' in tomorrow's thorough light  
And of Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee  
Somewhere far-off, peaceful, sleeping and done with acting  
Past the Dire Wolf's lair on a Newfoundland's paws  
Close to nowhere, halfway across  
Never more here, expanse getting broader  
Though bigger boats been done by this water  
Though better boats been done by this water  
Though better boats been done by less water  
In that September off Isle Aux Morts  
Colourable seas grew more so through the night  
And made one think of yawnin' shores  
Gambier bleached in tomorrow's thorough light  
And the Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee  
Somewhere far-off, peaceful, sleeping they learned to love sleep  
At the Dire Wolf's crest the Newfoundland paused  
Desolate's best was gotten across  
We were never more here, expanse getting broader  
When better boats been done by this water  
At the Dire Wolf's best the Newfoundland paused  
So desperate as to be a lost cause  
You were never more here, expanse getting broader  
When better boats been done by this water  
When bigger boats been done by less water  
And better boats been done by this water  
When bigger boats been done by less water  
And better boats been done by this water  

There's me then there's you  
And I could dance with the puck  
In a telephone booth  
You said, I don't give a fuck  
Besides enough about you  
And your, 'Evil's Banal'  
'Cause as soon as Joni says, "Blue"  
You're somewhere else, somewhere else  
There's me then there's you  
And I could not hear it yet  
From a telephone booth  
I do my hungover best  
And say, enough about you  
And your representative hell  
I jump in when you do  
Like there's nowhere else  
And then of course there's the dorsal fin  
Closing in that you cannot outswim  
It's not him that I gotta outswim you said  
Just you, you said, just you  
And there's the heart of the melt  
There's the narrowest flume  
There's the somewhere else  
When I'm with you  
There's nowhere else  
There's me then there's you  
There's me then there's you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several you's  
That would not be enough  
There's me then there's you  
You're a beautiful you  
A beautiful you, a beautiful you  
You could not say enough  
If there were several you's  
It would not be enough  
We're a beautiful two  

We rode hard,  
For the boat, as we could,  
Tears you said, understood, understood,  
I said alright.  
A crowd will be born ,  
Only born,I,  
I want to watch for a sign,  
In the night,  
I watch a bomb go off in a young girls life.  
  
Who were you  
The last recluse  
Who were you  
The last Canada girl  
  
Who were you?  
What is it with you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
  
When the wind comes up,  
Surfers up,  
What a scuzz  
Nothing up, with surprise  
Just ride you said,  
Ride and shut up.  
  
I jump on broad,turned around  
To wave goodbye,  
You were only on your bike,  
Riding with my bike by your side  
  
Who were you?  
The black canoe.  
Who were you?  
The last of the ?  
Who were you?  
You rode a lot ?  
As far as I know, it was you.  
  
You broke my heart, from the start  
Made me work, work so hard.  
To where I am,  
To where I'd let you do it all again.  
  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
What do I do,  
Without you?  
  
Who were you?  
The last recluse.  
Who were you?  
The last of the ?  
  
The last color  
The last Canada girls  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?  
Who were you?

I go back to the water  
When I get nowhere in the air  
I thought you should know, it's no worse  
Covering ground you've heard before  
  
It's a power of, power of, power of  
Power of free and easy  
It's a power of, power of, power of  
Power of free and easy  
  
You weigh a snowflake  
Cause great trees to fall  
Descending  
On perfect arms  
Like Jeff Beck  
To give me the lookahead  
  
I go back to the brusque nurse  
Her heart a bad cake in a melting box  
I thought you should know, it's no worse  
Her blood is still clear and sanguineous  
  
It's a power of, power of, power of  
Power of free and easy  
It's a power of, power of, power of  
Power of free and easy  
  
You weigh a snowflake  
The glamor of the sky  
Descending  
Past perfect eyes  
And hearts leapt  
To give me the lookahead  
Come on, honey  
Just give me that lookahead

In the dark before the train  
Just beyond the barn glow  
Where no dissident remains  
Driving it like we stole it  
  
Snow falling, a silver poet  
To concentrate the gallows  
And subtracting us like the wolf does  
Driving it like we stole it  
  
But we're getting nearer, nearer  
Getting near that modern spirit, yeah  
I can hear it, hear it, hear it  
I can hear that modern spirit  
  
On the open road for boys  
A white and an open throat  
Night slips back with no noise  
Inside the hitch-hiker's coat  
  
But we're getting nearer, nearer  
Getting near that modern spirit, yeah  
I can hear it, hear it, hear it  
I can hear the modern spirit, yeah  
  
Can't you just hear it, hear it, hear it?  
Winter counting everything, we're near it  
We're getting nearer nearer, nearer  
Friendship changing everything, we're near it  
I can hear it  
  
Is this the modern spirit?  
Is this the modern spirit, yeah  
Is this the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah  
This is the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah  
This is the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah

You could write, you could think, you could have sex  
You could leave your jewelry in a bowl beside the bed  
Stare out the window, down the lawn, to the lake  
For as long as it takes  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
I know what winter's about  
Too many nights, not enough days  
I watched the birds fly south  
And no, I don't wait  
The last words out of my mouth  
Stay out of my way  
And I'm in a wrong place  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe it's the things we don't say  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
Maybe, love is the new maybe  
  

Richard talks too slow  
He'd get interrupted long before  
I always loved that guy  
And he's not on T.V. anymore.  
To get before he had  
The wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal  
  
You've got to coax him slow,  
That's the only way that he'll confess.  
Tell him that the truth will  
Help him live with less.  
To get out before he had the wherewithal  
To get out before he had the wherewithal.  
That's a breathy body of work  
Set your sights inward for a leaner look.  
  
Richard died real slow,  
He won't get interrupted anymore.  
I always loved that guy  
And he's not on T.V. anymore.  
To get out before he had the  
Wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal

Thompson Girl, I'm stranded at the Unique Motel  
Thompson Girl winterfighter's shot on the car as well  
Looks like Christmas at 55 degrees  
This latitude weakens my knees, Thompson Girl  
  
Grunt work somewhere between dream and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
  
Thompson Girl walking from Churchill  
Across the icy world with polar bears it's mostly uphill  
But when she saw that nickel stack  
She whistled hard and I whistled back, Thompson Girl  
  
Grunt work time between dream state and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
Grunt work somewhere between dreams and duty  
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty  
  
Thompson Girl we're down to the dead houseplants  
Thompson Girl we've jettisoned every thing we can  
She says springtime's coming  
Wait til you see  
It poking through with them shoots of beauty  
It's the end of rent-a-movie weather  
It's time to end this siege together, Thompson Girl  
Thompson Girl  
Thompson Girl  
Thompson Girl

Tom Thompson came paddling past  
I'm pretty sure it was him  
And he spoke so softly in accordance  
With the growing of the dim  
He said, "Bring on the brand new renaissance  
Cause I think I'm ready  
I've been shaking all night long  
But my hands are steady."  
  
Three pistols came and three people went, on their way  
Three pistols strong and three people spent  
  
Well he found his little lonely love  
His bride of the northern woods  
But, she took me to the Opera House  
Like she said she would  
Then she sighed and she fell from the balcony  
Shakespeare bent to touch  
She never had any time for me  
Cause I didn't protest enough  
  
Three pistols came and three people went, on their way  
Two pistols strong and three people spent  
  
Little girls come on remembrance day  
Placing flowers on his grave  
She waits in the shadows 'til after dark  
To sweep them all away  
  
I say, bring on the brand new renaissance  
Cause I think I'm ready  
I've been shaking all night long  
But my hands are steady  
  
Three pistols came and three people went, on their way  
Three pistols strong and three people spent  
Three pistols came and three people went on their way  
One pistols strong and three people spent

"Why is the world so creepy?", she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
I told her that, It isn't  
That, that it's exquisite  
But like love, it has it's barbarous threats  
Still in spite of the cads  
And the stoop-shouldered teens  
I know I'm losing you  
I know what that means, yeah  
I told her that it isn't  
That it's real exquisite  
But like love, it can have it's  
Stubbed-toe effects  
And juts like after she heard the word, 'Iridescent'  
And everything was iridescent for awhile  
It wasn't long before she exalted out of nowhere  
Isn't this exquisite?'  
Once you've said, 'mmm' in unison  
And, 'oh' in double surprise  
And shared relief with a mutual, 'phew'  
And a look in each others eyes  
I tell her that is isn't, insisted that it isn't  
Because like love it has too-cunning effects, yeah  
I told her that it isn't that it's just exquisite  
Because like love it has it's barbarous threats  
"Why is the world so creepy?", she asked  
After a car full of haircuts drove past  
A backseat full of the boys  
Breaking glass, throwing off glass  

Everyone's got their breaking point  
With me it's spiders and with you it's me  
Thugs in perpetuity  
When we're excited little birds around the feeder  
The cat's indifferent or he's just furious  
It seems that he's never neither  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Hair bird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog  
To build her nest she said I've looked around  
And I like your hair the best  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
I do the rolling you do the detail  
  
Ruby, honey are you mad at your man?

This is Tiger the Lion  
Gimme the Knuckles of Frisco  
If there's danger in the language,  
Gentlemen,  
I suggest no further use of  
The two-way radio.  
'John Cage had come to feel  
That art in our time  
Was far less important  
Than our daily lives,  
To which so many'd become  
More or less inclined.  
The purpose of it's not unique.  
Not to build masterpieces  
For a delectative elite  
But simply to wake to your life.'  
  
You'll be serving the song  
When you find out you won't change  
Serving the song  
Walking the range.  
  
'John Cage had come to feel  
Art in our time  
Was much less important  
Than our daily life  
If there's a perpetual plan  
For discovery days  
Where everyone can take part  
In what he called  
Purposeless play  
And there's a sign of life in this play  
Not to get order from chaos  
Tell you how to create  
But simply to wake to your life.'  
  
You'll be serving the song  
When we find out you won't change  
Serving the song  
Bombing the range  
  
This is Tiger the Lion  
Get me Into the Pillows  
If you're painted by radar, gentlemen,  
There'll be no further use of  
The two-way radio

Growin' up in a biosphere  
With no respect for bad weather  
There's still roaches and ants in here  
So resourceful and clever  
Her great grandfather saw the future  
Didn't know nothing 'bout panic  
He certainly probably thought  
That it was unthinkable  
There's a trace oh mint wafting in from the north  
So we don't fuck with the 401  
It's bigger than us or larger than we bargained  
I guess it's just not done  
His great grandfather worked for Goodyear  
He'd see the blimp on Sundays  
Wonder what the driver knew  
About making rubber tires  
Terrarium  
Oh, Terrarium  
There's submarines out there under the ice  
Avoiding and courting collision  
An accident's sometimes the only way  
To worm our way back to bad decisions  
My great grandfather was a welder  
He helped to build the Titanic  
He didn't certainly think  
That it is was unsinkable  
Building up to the larger point  
With an arrogance not rare or pretty  
We don't declare the war on idleness  
When outside it's cold and shitty  
We stay inside and try to conjure  
The fathers of the injured and faking  
If there's glory in miracles  
It's that they're reversible  
Terrarium  
Oh, terrarium  

Old lion's dying, got left behind  
Cut your teeth, lose your meat  
And man it's just a matter of time  
Key's to the cuffs, you might be king  
That's it, that's all, that's everything  
  
Skeletons come here to dance  
Where barrooms beat their brothers  
Into a bloody trance  
What's the deal? what did I do?  
Who cops all the cops is all I asked of you  
  
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down  
Something's up, taking time to get around  
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown  
It's just a matter of trickle down  
  
Twenty miles before the crash  
That's the style for a while  
And man I think it's gonna last  
"hit the brakes" is all you can say  
Conductor says we'll save them  
For another rainy day

Thar she blows, Jacques Cousteau  
Hear her sing so sweet and low  
Lull me overboard, out-cold  
Gathered in and swallowed whole  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want to? Twist my arm.  
  
You just hit me where I live  
I guess it looked quite primitive  
What was that supposed to prove?  
Throw the calf or he'll throw you  
  
Sucked in by the victim world  
Thirsty as a cultured pearl  
Culled and wooed, bitten, chewed  
It won't hurt if you don't move  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want you? Twist my arm.  
  
Musical chairs, double dares, memorized stairs,  
Shootin off flares, springtime hares and broken-down mares  
  
Coward phones, big soup stones, prideless loans,  
Grill sick crows, motel groans and big fat Jones  
  
Martyrs don't do much for me  
Though I enjoy them vicariously  
After you. No! After me.  
No, I insist! Please, after me.  
  
Do I want to? With all that charm?  
Do I want you? Twist my arm.

Use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
If there's music out there laying in wait  
To pounce and drain every ounce if you  
Wait or hesitate  
And music that'll help you be tough  
And come together on more than  
Springsteen  
Though most days it's been enough  
Then there's music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
Use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later  
  
If there's music out there staying awake  
To cry and drain every eye until  
Hatred's eliminated  
And music that can help you feel great  
And come together in 'the fictive dream'  
With a kind of Randy Newman take  
There's music that can take you away  
Away  
Away  
Away  
Where we can jump to our feet, agape  
Cause nothing is cruel  
And even if it is or was  
Indefeasibly cruel  
We don't care because  
Yer a fool  
I'm a fool  
Yer a fool  
And I'm a fool  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
For music that can take you away  
  
So use it up  
Use it all up  
Don't save a thing for later

So the chemistry set,  
And I'm not the saddest cheerleader  
To forget the American word.  
For the gang in the head  
That dwindles 'til no members won.  
The mysteries met,  
The sky looks threatened  
Heading home in the dust,  
Singing "Life is Forgetting",  
Good enough for the frivolous  
  
There's one thing I remember is  
This tear on your bare shoulder,  
This little silver boulder,  
This slowly falling star.  
We're rolling, so what?  
Never getting older where the moonshocked curtains part.  
The start of enough  
A teardrop, then a Vaccination scar.  
  
I'll tell ya if I'm involved, that is,  
I'll tell ya like it is.  
Random like a bad cartoon, like  
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge,  
Like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  
  
Swimming on a bit,  
'Stop, you're treading water' as the sun assimilated the words.  
For lighthouse fire  
Burning down to embers end.  
The mysteries met  
Sky just reddened  
Headin' home under dusk.  
Is life just forgettin' another word for frivolous?  
Little silver boulder, silence from Mars.  
For the heart of enough  
Or a teardrop, then a Vaccination Scar.  
  
Wherever you are,  
Scar

Titillations been replaced, by interstate brick face and coffee mate  
And by a list of phone calls, you'll like to make  
Where you could sit on the edge of your bed  
And you could stare into your own shoes  
And in the pools of light there, go wherever you choose  
Just rig up a complication, and if it derails  
You can throw away the rudder and float away like vapour trails  
there's nothin' funnier than pride in an utterly confident stride  
So I pulled the car on over to give you a ride  
Damn this sleepy weather he said, as he marched in soppin? wet shoes  
Through rain pools evaporatin?, says in this sign I?ll conquer you  
I pulled the car on over, to give you a ride  
But there's nothin? uglier than a man hittin? his stride  
Past Mexicans all dressed in beige shirts, leanin? over their hoes  
Now the mornin?s over, it?s time to let them sprinklers hose  
Past hills of chambermaids? dark bare arms  
And fields of muscles quilted to the bone  
Right now I'm flyin? over, ya right now I'm flyin? home  
Where I can sit on the end of my bed  
And I can stare into my own shoes  
And in the pools of light years, go wherever I choose  
And throw away the rudder, float away on vapour trails  
I rigged up a complication, totally derailed  
So I throw away the rudder, float away like vapour trails  
I pulled the car on over  
(It?s time to let them sprinklers hose)  
Woo, woo, woo, throw away the rudder  

Drip, drip, drip  
Baby, when'd you get so Zen?  
Drip, drip  
When I used to know you when  
Drip, drip  
When you thought all my dreams sucked  
Drip, drip  
I was just happy you gave a fuck  
Drip, drip  
  
And we don't want to do it  
Drip, drip, drip  
We want to be it  
Drip, drip, drip  
  
Tick, tick, tick  
The Smartest Guy In The Room  
Flick, flick  
Might as well be on the moon  
Click, click  
Or in his tower or his tomb  
Cricket  
'Cause all I'm hearing is you  
Drip, drip  
  
And we don't want to do it  
Drip, drip, drip  
We want to be it  
Drip, drip, drip  
  
Drip, drip, drip  
Baby, when'd you get so wrecked?  
Drip, drip  
And where are things at this moment?  
Drip, drip  
And all our friends gave us a week  
Drip, drip  
And we're still happening as we speak  
Drip, drip  
  
And we don't want to do it  
Drip, drip, drip  
We want to be it  
Drip, drip, drip  
Oh, drip drip drip  
  
And we don't want to do it  
Drip, drip, drip  
We want to be it  
Drip, drip, drip  
  
Drip, drip, drip  
Flick, flick, flick  
Cricket, cricket  
Cricket, cricket, cricket

To boldly clap in a room full of nothing  
You never know, it could be one of those  
Poignant evenings.  
Museum's locked and it's long since past  
Closing,  
You cannot know, you cannot not know  
What you're knowing  
What can you do, they're all gone  
And we'll go too.  
The curtain climbs over me every morning.  
I don't know why I'm so immunized  
Against reforming.  
To coldly slap at a face full of nothing,  
You never know it could've been one of those  
Looks of longing.  
What can you do, they're all gone  
And we'll go too.

Sundown in the Paris of the prairies wheat kings have all their treasures
buried  
And all you hear are the rusty breezes pushing  
Around the weather vane Jesus  
  
In his Zippo lighter, he sees the killer's face maybe  
It's someone standing in a killer's place twenty years for nothing, well
that's  
Nothing new, besides, no one's interested in something you didn't do  
Wheat kings and pretty things, let's just see what the morning brings  
  
There's a dreamy dream where the high school is dead and stark it's a museum  
And we're all locked up in it after dark where the walls  
Are lined all yellow, grey and sinister hung  
With pictures of our parents' prime ministers wheat kings and pretty things  
Wait and see what tomorrow brings  
  
Late breaking story on the CBC, a nation whispers,  
"We always knew that he'd go free" they add, "you can't be fond of living in  
The past, 'cause if you are then there's no way that you're gonna last"  
Wheat kings and pretty things  
Let's just see what tomorrow bring  
Wheat kings and pretty things  
Oh, that's what tomorrow brings

Afternoon, see a guy with rubies on his head  
And he's shifting like shifting like he was dead  
And he's hearing something, she never said  
On his way back home, under his bed  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
  
In the night there's a girl who doesn't mind her ragged sleeves  
Knowing someone soon is gonna grieve  
And a man he tells her a story, she just won't believe  
Called "Adam never could do right by Eve"  
  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
And the weight comes down  
Down on you, down on me  
And a girl walks by the burning bush  
She asks "what's going on here man?"  
And he smiles, says "open wide, wide, wide"  
  
In my dreams, a candy coated train comes to my door  
With a little girl, I can't have anymore  
You know a letter washes up to the shore  
That I cannot read and I probably should ignore  
  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down  
When the weight comes down

I don't want to put another thought  
In my head.  
  
The hummingbird is cleared for  
Maintenance,  
Evacuating long after it made no sense.  
It's not so much a load and stay any more  
As a gotta-get-down-the-road-before-the-  
Temperature-soars.  
  
I don't want to put a little thought  
In your head.  
  
Diplomacy goes even better with drinks  
(Until the big city trees began to shrink.)  
It's not so much a load out and stay  
Anymore  
It's gotta get down the road before the  
Snarling traffic roars.  
  
I don't want to ask you,  
'What you got in your head?'  
I'm not gonna ask you  
A whole bunch of questions.  
  
OK, we agree to disagree....  
Giving up....Giving Up the Embassy  
Is a whole lot better than,  
The Embassy's Surrendering.  
  
Flying home under the approval of the stars,  
I couldn't be more at home with the way  
Things are so hard.  
It's not so much a load-out  
And stay anymore  
Its a gotta get down the road before  
The confetti cannon blows  
With litigious force.  
  
I don't want to ask you,  
'What you got in your head?'  
I don't want to ask you,  
'Whatcha been thinking?'  
  
I don't want to put another  
Thought in my head.  
  
I don't want to put another  
Thought in my head.

One day in El Paso  
The cops go into the crowd  
Under a glaring bladder of light  
And the music is so loud  
And the tourists take their T-Shirts off  
A busload of kids gives you the finger  
Afternoon when the sidewalk's hot  
And the shadows too chilly to linger  
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends  
Past a strawman making a purchase  
Downtown where the river bends  
They're just waiting for you to resurface  
Take a look at this photograph  
Clearly his teeth were bared  
He coulda been yawning or snarling  
The story was never clear  
  
One night in El Paso  
The cops go into the crowd  
Under a throbbing bladder of light  
And the music is just so loud  
And the tourists turn their TV's off  
And a bat sees a bug with the sound of a linger  
Night time when the shadows cough  
And you're chilled to the tips of your fingers  
Walk past damaged goods and ugly trends  
Past ol' strawman making a purchase  
Downtown where the river bends  
They're just waiting for you to resurface  
Take a look at this photograph  
Clearly his teeth were bared  
He coulda been yawning or snarling  
He coulda been anywhere

You are everywhere, within and without  
Where it don't matter what we used to do now  
Where I feed my people when I get behind the plow  
When I write the tiger hangin' on by his eyebrows  
Somehow where the gang in me is bein' all that it can be  
Somehow part hope is a plan and part vigilante streak  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep on the train  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin' out, you're there  
You are there when I stop writing things down  
And when I forget about who I am now  
Forget about who's kissin' her, who's behind my plow  
Now it's time to drown all of that poetry out  
Somehow where democracy is how we all learn to sleep  
With ourselves drawing to ourselves everything we can carry  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep in the rain  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin' out, you're there  
There's no escaping  
This dream we're dancing  
With no distractions  
When I reel my Irish in, when I sleep on the plane  
In straight lines through shadows, you're there  
Where the future lies under no moon at night  
At the ballroom hangin', you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there  
You're everywhere, you're there
