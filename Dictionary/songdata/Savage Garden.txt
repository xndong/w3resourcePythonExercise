The moonlight  
Shines down interstellar beams  
And the groove tonight  
Is something more than you've ever seen  
The stars and planets taking shape  
A stolen kiss has come too late  
  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
  
You're never safe 'till you see the dawn  
And if the clock strikes past midnight  
The hope is gone  
To move under  
  
The moonlight  
Carry on, keep romancing  
Carry on, carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on, keep romancing  
Carry on, carry on dancing  
  
Move. Closer. Passion. Stronger.  
  
There's a magic only two can tell  
In the dark night  
Ultraviolet is a wicked spell  
The stars and planets taking shape  
A stolen kiss has come too late  
  
In the moonlight  
Carry on, keep romancing  
Carry on, carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on, keep romancing  
Carry on, carry on dancing  
  
Moving on  
Moving all night

We were standing all alone  
You were leaning in to speak to me  
Acting like a mover shaker  
Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me  
And I think about it all the time  
Sweet temptation rush all over me  
And I think about it all the time  
Passion desire so intense I can't take anymore because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
It's bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
I've got to be chained to you  
  
And when you look into my eyes  
Felt a sudden sense of urgency  
Fascination casts a spell and  
You became more than just a mystery  
And I think about you all the time  
Is this fate is it my destiny  
That I think about you all the time  
I no longer pretend to have my hand on the wheel because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
It's bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
I've got to be chained to you  
  
And I think about it all the time  
And I think about it all the time  
Tell me it's madness I barely know you  
We were standing all alone  
You were leaning in to speak to me  
Ten steps back you're still a mystery  
Acting like a mover shaker  
Dancing to Madonna then you kissed me  
I can't take anymore because  
  
I feel the magic all around you  
It's bringing me to my knees  
Like a wannabe  
I've got to be chained to you  
  
Tell me it's madness  
I barely know you

When you feel all alone  
And the world has turned it's back on you  
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart  
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you  
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold  
When darkness is upon your door and  
You feel like you can't take anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me be the one you call  
If you jump I'll break your fall  
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night  
If you need to fall apart  
I can mend a broken heart  
If you need to crash then crash and burn  
You're not alone  
  
When you feel all alone  
And a loyal friend is hard to find  
You're caught in a one way street  
With the monsters in your head  
When hopes and dreams are far away and  
You feel you can't face the day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because there has always been heartache and pain  
And when it's over you'll breathe again  
You'll breathe again  
  
When you feel all alone  
And the world has turned its back on you  
Give me a moment please  
To tame your wild wild heart  
  
[Chorus]

Woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
Whenever I feel like just giving up  
Whenever my dreams just fade away  
I just return to my heart 'cause I know that I'll find you  
There yes I will.  
  
And when the world is closing in  
You come save me once again.  
  
'Cause woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
Well, there's never been a boy, who's luckier  
There's never been more grateful man  
And although I don't show it and I  
I know what I've got with you  
Yes I do.  
  
'Cause Woman I need your guiding hand,  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
And if there's a storm that's close at hand  
You'll push it away, you'll understand  
And I'll do anything  
Just to please you  
I'll do anything just to know that I can hold on to you.  
  
Whenever I feel like just giving up  
Whenever my dreams just fade away  
I just return to my heart 'cause I know that I'll find you  
There yes I will.  
  
'Cause woman I need it  
Woman I need it  
Woman I need it  
I need it  
I need your guiding hand.  
  
Woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
'Cause woman I need your guiding hand  
Show me the way to the promised land  
The fever that burns in my heart  
You're the fire inside the man  
Yes you are.  
  
You are.

Love and other moments  
Are just chemical reactions in your brain  
And feelings of aggression  
Are the absence of the love drug in your viens  
  
In your veins  
Love come quickly  
Because I feel my self esteem is caving in  
It's on the brink  
  
Love come quickly  
Because I don't think I can keep this monster in  
It's in my skin  
  
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine  
They're morphine  
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen  
Rarely seen  
  
Love I beg you  
Lift me up into that privileged point of view  
The world of two  
Love don't leave me  
  
Because I console myself that  
Hallmark cards are true  
I really do  
  
I'm gunning down romance  
It never did a thing for me  
But heartache and misery  
Ain't nothing but a tragedy  
  
Love don't leave me  
  
Take these broken wings  
I'm going to take these broken wings  
And learn to fly  
And learn to fly away  
And learn to fly away  
  
I'm gunning down romance

Hey if we can't find a way out of these problems  
Then maybe we don't need this  
Standing face to face  
Enemies at war we build defenses  
And secret hiding places  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man  
  
Hey more than angry words I hate this silence  
It's getting so loud  
Well I want to scream  
But bitterness has silenced these emotions  
It's getting hard to breathe  
So tell me isn't happiness  
Worth more than a gold and diamond ring?  
I'm willing to do anything  
To calm the storm in my heart  
I've never been the praying kind  
But lately I've been down upon my knees  
Not looking for a miracle  
Just a reason to believe  
  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man  
  
Do you remember not long ago?  
When we used to live for the night-time  
Cherish each moment  
Now we don't live we exist  
We just run through our lives  
So alone  
That's why you've got to hold me  
  
Hey, if we can't find a way out of these problems  
Then maybe we don't need this  
Standing face to face  
Enemies at war we build defenses  
And secret hiding places  
I might need you to hold me tonight  
I might need you to say it's all right  
I might need you to make the first stand  
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man

Maybe it's intuition  
But some things you just don't question  
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant  
And there it goes,  
I think I found my best friend  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
There's just no rhyme or reason  
Only the sense of completion  
And in your eyes, I see  
The missing pieces I'm searching for  
I think I've found my way home  
I know that it might sound  
More than a little crazy  
But I believe  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
A thousand angels dance around you  
I am complete now that I've found you  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life  
  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I think I dreamed you into life  
I knew I loved you before I met you  
I have been waiting all my life

Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes  
And I am taken to a place  
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings  
Take up shelter in the base of my spine  
Sweet like a chica cherry cola  
I don't need to try to explain  
I just hold on tight and If it happens again  
I may move so slightly to the arms  
And the lips and the face  
Of The Human Cannonball that  
I need to I want to  
  
Come stand a little bit closer  
Breathe in and get a bit higher  
You'll never know what hit you when  
I get to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but  
Ooh I'd die to find out  
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but  
Ooh I'd die to find out  
  
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment  
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for  
But a look and then a smell of perfume  
It's like I'm down on the floor  
And I don't know what I'm in for  
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction  
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking  
Using symbols, using words can be likened  
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat  
  
Come stand a little bit closer  
Breathe in and get a bit higher  
You'll never know what hit you when  
I get to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
  
Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes  
And I am taken to a place  
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings  
Take up shelter in the base of my spine  
Sweet like a chica cherry cola  
I don't need to try to explain  
I just hold on tight and If it happens again  
I may move so slightly to the arms  
And the lips and the face  
Of The Human Cannonball that  
I need to I want to

Get me through the heart of the freeway  
I got to see the lights up in New York city  
I'm so close I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony  
Don't you want to feel amazing?  
Baby you know I do  
You'll get back ten times what you give freely  
Like my mamma told me  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life  
  
Climb into the heart of the subway  
Creepin' like a snake into New York city  
I'm so close I think I can see those lights  
Let the sun get closer to the ground  
Don't you want to feel amazing?  
Baby you know I do  
You'll get back ten times what you give freely  
Like my mamma told me  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life  
  
It's about the one thing  
It's about the one thing  
About the kind of shoes your wearin'  
About religion  
  
And I breathe the love you've given  
And I feel the love you've hidden  
And though it's cold down here well I can honestly say  
I can still stay  
  
That love can move you  
Love can move you, baby  
Love can move you  
That love can move you too child  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part  
  
Love can move you take you deeper every time  
Can make the darkest moments feel like heaven's come alive  
Love can move you to a place inside your heart  
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part  
  
And I breathe the love you've given  
And I feel the love you've hidden  
And though it's cold down here well I still, I still try  
  
Love can move you  
You know that love can move you too child  
Love can move you  
You know that love can move you  
  
And I breathe the love you've given  
And I feel the love you've hidden  
It's cold down here but I still, I still say

I'd never let you down when you're in a fix  
I'd come running when you call  
That's my weakness baby  
So connected are we  
You get your kicks from the ghost of a memory  
So busy turning away from reality baby  
That you just won't let it go  
But memories fade  
Yeah they're designed that way  
  
But you're so wrapped up in her you don't see straight  
Watch her mangle the truth while you take the bait  
So tell her can't you see?  
Your just turning yourself inside out for no need  
  
This thing you're using is worse then a photograph  
It picks you up and it turns you inside out now baby  
And it just won't let you go  
  
But memories fade  
Yeah they're designed that way  
  
She doesn't love you anymore  
Maybe she did long ago  
You're just a slave to the grind that she grew tired of baby  
So tell her can't you see?  
You're just turning yourself inside out for no need  
But memories fade  
Cause they're designed that way  
  
She doesn't love you anymore  
Maybe she did long ago  
You're just a slave to the grind that she grew tired of baby  
So tell her can't you see?  
You're just turning yourself  
You're just turning yourself inside out for no need  
You're just turning yourself inside out for no need

I wait in the darkness.  
Frozen winds surround my face.  
In the cover of darkness I can make believe it's you.  
I feel you like the rain, I feel you like a storm cloud building in my heart.  
I wonder if you know the pain, to want the one thing you haven't got.  
  
Just a twist in time and you could be mine  
Just a sip of wine and you could be mine  
Just a kiss divine  
  
A hand brushes by my love.  
A smile fuels a steel inferno  
You don't have to die to leave my world.  
Stand still and you've departed.  
It seems I'm now on your mind and I'm wasting my time.  
  
I'm just a fool to believe.  
In the death of the night can you feel me inside?  
I wish that you could conceive..  
  
Just a twist in time and you could be mine  
Just a sip of wine and you cloud be mine  
Just a kiss divine and you could be mine  
  
Won't you leave me in the darkness.  
Take away the pride, all the dignity that's burning inside.  
Can't you see I'm standing naked.  
I'll bear all the crosses and the crucifixes you can provide.  
If you could decide.  
  
Just a twist in time and you could be mine  
Just a sip of wine and you cloud be mine  
Just a kiss divine and you could be mine

Well don't you know I need a  
Little indulgence?  
Listen to the hunter becoming  
Hunted  
Everyday there's a million advances  
Don't be too forceful you'll ruin  
Your chances  
Well don't you know that time is a  
Broken glass  
That splinters against the wall?  
But the picture is coming back  
Now baby  
And I want to take it all  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
So let your body move a little bit closer  
Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone  
Don't you know that powerful thinking  
Can be a force you don't want  
To relinquish?  
Well don't you know that  
They say hanging on will justify the wait?  
But patience and elated wisdom  
Don't share a common phrase  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Well I'm only hanging on for what  
Goes down  
I'm floating high and my feet don't  
Touch the ground  
I'd take advantage but I can't see  
Through this charade  
So don't you, don't go make it harder  
That hell  
Cause it comes down to the making  
You'd better be damned sure you can  
Take it  
Hey baby  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Time will be the thief  
And your fallen king will end up...  
A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool  
Oh baby, 'cause I told you baby

In Santa Monica in the winter time  
The lazy streets so undemanding  
I walk into the crowd  
In Santa Monica you get your coffee from  
The coolest places on the promenade  
Where people dress just so  
Beauty so unavoidable  
Everywhere you turn  
It's there  
I sit and wonder what am I doing here?  
  
But on the telephone line I am anyone  
I am anything I want to be  
I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer  
And you wouldn't know the difference  
Or would you?  
  
In Santa Monica, all the people got  
Modern names  
Like Jake or Mandy  
And modern bodies too  
In Santa Monica, on the boulevard,  
You'll have to dodge those in-line skaters  
Or they'll knock you down  
I never felt so lonely,  
Never felt so out of place  
I never wanted something more than this  
  
But on the telephone line I am anyone  
I am anything I want to be  
I could be a supermodel or Norman Mailer  
And you wouldn't know the difference  
On the telephone line, I am any height  
I am any age I want to be  
I could be a caped crusader, or  
Space invader  
And you would know the difference  
Or would you?

Whether I'm right or wrong  
There's no phrase that hits  
Like an ocean needs the sand  
Or a dirty old shoe that fits  
And if all the world was perfect  
I would only ever want to see your scars  
You know they can have their universe  
We'll be in the dirt designing stars  
And darlin' you know  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Whether I'm up or down  
There's no crowd to please  
I'm like a faith without a clause to believe in it  
And if all the world was smiling  
I would only ever want to see your frown  
You know they can sail away in sunsets  
We'll be right here stranded on the ground  
Just happy to be found  
You make me feel so beautiful  
Nowhere else in the world I wanna be  
You make me feel so beautiful  
I have lost my illusions  
I have drowned in your words  
I have left my confusion to a cynical world  
I am throwing myself at things I don't understand  
Discover enlightenment holding your hand  
You are  
So beautiful  
Yeah darlin' you know!  
That you make me feel so beautiful

And we stare each other down  
Like victims in the grind  
Probing all the weakness and  
Hurt still left behind and we cry  
The tears of pearls  
We do it. Oh we do it.  
  
Is love really the tragedy the way you  
Might describe?  
Or would a thousand lovers  
Still leave you cold inside?  
Make you cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world  
  
Your kisses are like pearls,  
So different and so rare  
But anger stole the jewels away  
And love has left you bare,  
Made you cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
Well I could be the tired joker  
Pour my heart to get you in  
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win  
Maybe cry  
These tears of pearls  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world  
  
We twist and turn where angels burn  
Like fallen soldiers we will learn  
Once forgotten, twice removed  
Love will be the death  
The death of you  
  
All these mixed emotions  
We keep locked away like stolen pearls  
Stolen pearl devotions we  
Keep locked away from all the world

When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head  
And television freak show cops and robbers everywhere  
Subway makes me nervous people pushing me too far  
I've got to break away  
So take my hand now  
Cause I want to live like animals  
Careless and free like animals  
I want to live  
I want to run through the jungle  
With wind in my hair and the sand at my feet  
I've been having difficulties keeping to myself  
Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf  
Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie  
Which one is more human  
There's a thought, now you decide  
Compassion in the jungle  
Compassion in your hands, yeah  
Would you like to make a run for it  
Would you like to take my hand, yeah  
Sometimes this life can get you down  
It's so confusing  
There's so many rules to follow  
And I feel it  
Cause I just run away in my mind  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Superstars and cannonballs running through your head  
Television freak show cops and robbers everywhere  
Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie  
Which one is more human  
There's a thought, now you decide  
Compassion in the jungle  
Compassion in your hands, yeah  
Would you like to make a run for it  
Would you like to take my hand, yeah

Here I go again I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today  
It's been seven months and counting  
You've moved on  
I still feel exactly the same  
It's just that everywhere I go all the buildings know your name  
Like photographs and memories of love  
Steel and granite reminders  
The city calls your name and I can't move on  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me  
  
Am I all alone in the universe?  
There's no love on these streets  
I have given mine away to a world that didn't want it anyway  
So this is my new freedom  
It's funny I don't remember being chained  
But nothing seems to make sense anymore  
Without you I'm always twenty minutes late  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me  
  
And as time goes by so slowly  
The nights are cold and lonely  
I shouldn't be holding on  
But I'm still holding on for you  
  
Here I go again, I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today  
But I'm standing at your doorway  
I'm calling out your name because I can't move on  
  
Ever since you've been gone  
The lights go out the same  
The only difference is  
You call another name  
To your love  
To your lover now  
To your love  
The lover after me

I want to move in time with you  
I want to breathe in rhyme with you  
I want to feel the deepest kiss  
And I want to know you feel like this  
  
This one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
  
I want to feel your hand in mine  
I want to feel that rush in my spine  
I want to wear the scent of you  
And do all the things you want me to  
  
So baby this one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
  
I feel the danger of separation  
I want to take your invitation  
Separation, it's all around  
I need this side of me  
  
I want to move in time with you  
And I want to breathe in rhyme with you  
I want to stage my glows in sin  
And in the dark I want to find that golden glow within  
  
For this one time, one time  
Let my body do what it feels  
This one time one time  
Let this fantasy become real  
'Cause I am not afraid to let you see this side of me  
No I am not afraid to let you see this side of me

She's taking her time making up the reasons  
To justify all the hurt inside  
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes  
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one  
They're saying mamma never loved her much  
And, daddy never keeps in touch  
  
That's why she shies away from human affection  
But somewhere in a private place  
She packs her bags for outer space  
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come  
And she'll say to him  
  
I would fly to the moon and back if you'll be my baby  
Got a ticket for a world where we belong  
So would you be my baby?  
She can't remember a time when she felt needed  
If love was red then she was color blind  
All her friends they've been tried for treason  
And crimes that were never defined  
She's saying love is like a barren place  
  
And reaching out for human faith is like a journey  
I just don't have a map for  
So baby's gonna take a dive and  
Push the shift to overdrive  
Send a signal that she's hanging  
All her hopes on the stars  
What a pleasant dream  
I would fly to the moon and  
Back if you'll be my baby got a ticket  
For a world where we belong repeat

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy.  
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need.  
I love you more with every breath, truly madly deeply do  
I will be strong, I will be faithful 'cause I'm counting on a new beginning.  
A reason for living. A deeper meaning.  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain.  
I want to bathe with you in the sea.  
I want to lay like this forever.  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky,  
I'll make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry  
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty.  
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of  
The highest power, in lonely hours, the tears devour you  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain,  
I want to bathe with you in the sea.  
I want to lay like this forever,  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
Oh can you see it baby?  
You don't have to close your eyes  
'Cause it's standing right before you.  
All that you need will surely come  
  
I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy.  
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need.  
I'll love you more with every breath, truly madly deeply do  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea.  
I want to lay like this forever.  
Until the sky falls down on me  
  
I want to stand with you on a mountain  
I want to bathe with you in the sea.  
I want to live like this forever.  
Until the sky falls down on me

Well I'd like to take you as I find you  
Imagine our clothes are on the floor  
Feel my caress so soft and gentle  
So delicate you cry for more  
But you know baby  
You know baby does it right  
And you know baby does it right  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want  
  
Put time in a capsule  
Two minds consensual  
Entwined to perfection  
If we could  
  
Cuddle up close  
Lay on my chest now  
Listen my heart beats coming down  
If you get tired, you close your eyes now  
When you wake up I won't be found  
Cause I know baby  
I know you're the nervous kind  
With so much going on in your mind  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much,  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want  
  
But let me tell you that, this time,  
I'm gonna make you mine  
(I won't let you go)  
Cause I know, this time  
I'm gonna make sure I look out for me  
  
Cause you know baby  
Well you know baby does it right  
And you know baby does it right  
You will only end up lost in loneliness  
And wake up with the words already  
On your lips  
So I'll let you go, baby, oh baby  
So I'll let you go  
  
Universe inside of your heart  
You gotta let me know  
So you can be free baby  
You wanted it so much,  
And now that it's over  
You don't know what you want

If there's a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be  
Would you complain that it came too easy?  
Just like the games with you and me  
A resolution hard to see  
But that's OK 'cause I don't  
See things that are plain to see  
  
I've got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
You want to give ecstasy delivered  
With certainty  
But you're afraid that the pleasure  
Won't be needed  
In a way, we're the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies  
  
If there's a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
Contemplate jealousy intermixed  
With urgency  
A million things take a damned  
Good shot at you and me  
  
If there's a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
I'm gonna take you  
I'll do my best to break you  
I'm gonna take you higher  
And that's no lie  
  
Common sense is a game many  
People don't like to play  
But give it in and the moment takes  
You either way  
  
I've got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
If there's a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be,  
Would you complain that it came too easy?  
In a way, we're the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies

Cool breeze and autumn leaves  
Slow motion daylight  
A lone pair of watchful eyes  
Oversee the living  
Feel the presence all around  
A tortured soul  
A wound unhealing  
No regrets or promises  
The past is gone  
But you can still be free  
If time will set you free  
  
Time now to spread your wings  
To take to flight  
The life endeavor  
Aim for the burning sun  
You'll be trapped inside  
But you can still be free  
If time will set you free  
But it's a long long way to go  
  
Keep moving way up high  
You see the light  
It shines forever  
Sail through the crimson skies  
The purest light  
The light that sets you free  
If time will set you free  
Sail through the wind and rain tonight  
You're free to fly tonight  
And you can still be free  
And going higher than mountain tops  
And go high the wind don't stop  
And go high  
Free to fly tonight  
Free to fly tonight
