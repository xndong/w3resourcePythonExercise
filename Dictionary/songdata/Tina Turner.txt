There's something on my mind  
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong  
  
You're just a fool, you know you're in love  
You've got to face it to live in this world  
You take the good along with the bad  
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad  
You know you love him, you can't understand  
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man  
  
He's got me smiling when I should be ashamed  
Got me laughing when my heart is in pain  
Oh no, I must be a fool  
Cause I do anything you ask me to  
  
Without my man I don't want to live  
You think I'm lying but I'm telling you like it is  
He's got my nose open and that's no lie  
And I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied  
  
A wave of action speaks louder than words  
The truest thing that I ever heard  
I trust my man and all that he do  
And I, and I do anything you ask me to

If your child ain't all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
I'll show him what he could be now  
Just give me one night  
  
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
I'm the gypsy and I'm guaranteed  
To mend his aching heart  
  
Give us a room, close the door  
Leave us for a while  
You won't be a boy no more  
Young, but not a child  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen  
Pay me before I start  
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed  
  
To tear your soul apart  
  
Gather your wits and hold them fast  
Your mind must learn to roam  
Just as the gypsy queen must do  
You're gonna hit the road  
  
My work's been done, now look at him  
He's never been more alive  
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch  
Watch his body writhe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To break your little heart  
  
If your child ain't all he should be now  
This girl will put him right  
I'll show him what he could be now  
Just give me one more night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To tear your soul apart

I need you here beside me to chase the night away  
I need your love to guide me safe through another day  
I lie and watch the lights go down  
Say goodnight to another town  
And though it hurts to be alone  
I have my thoughts of you to keep me warm  
  
In the afterglow of your love  
Dreamings all I'm guilty of  
Everyday I'm playing tough  
But read my mind  
  
If you could see me now  
Just living my life in a limbo  
If you could see me now  
The me that only you would know  
Still burning in the afterglow  
  
When the beat of the drum has faded  
The show comes to an and  
The stage is clear and loaded  
And the highway calls again  
I stand and watch the lights go down  
  
In the afterglow of your love  
Dreamings all I'm guilty of  
Everyday I'm playing tough  
But read my mind  
  
If you could see me now  
Just living my life in a limbo  
If you could see me now  
The me that only you would know  
Still burning in the afterglow  
  
Stay with me right to the end  
Till I can hold you again

There's a time for love and a time for healing  
Can't go back and undo what's been done  
The word of mouth, time is revealing  
Just how far we've left this kingdom come  
Hand in hand we're finding our way  
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Kiss of life and the hand of fate  
Boy grows up into his father's son  
And he learns to love, has been taught to hate  
To carry on the way it had been done  
All our lives, it's debts to repay  
Maybe someday we can put the past away  
  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Turn the world around, tear the borders down  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Some will die for you, some will lie to you  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
Put your fear away, find a better way  
There's all kinds of people in this world  
  
Underneath a broken sky  
Love can heal the pain inside  
In a moment things can change  
One look behind and it's never the same

Can't you see, this is me  
Can't you see, this is me  
  
Don't walk crowded streets  
Choose every dream from a magazine stand  
I don't buy into that  
All-day TV shows  
Sell their souls just to make living easy  
I don't buy into that  
I don't need satin and lace, no no no  
I'll bring a smile to your face  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake, no  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want to be  
  
Can't you see, this is me (a woman)  
Can't you see, this is me  
  
Good times can't get enough  
Life can be tough but it's all for a reason  
I sure buy into that  
Life goes around and around  
We seek what we found 'cause it's all an illusion  
I sure buy into that  
I know the waters of fate, yeah, yeah  
Will keep on flowing my way  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake, no no  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want  
  
I've never been affraid of myself  
I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that  
I don't want to be nobody else  
I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame (be the flame)  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake (oh no no no)  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby baby can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want (all I want to be)  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame (be the flame)  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake (oh no no no)  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Can't you see this is me  
And I'm all the woman that I want to be

Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
When things are going wrong, why don't you ask me how I feel  
The night is awful cold, ask me how I feel  
You're much too loose to hold, why don't you ask me how I feel  
  
I close my eyes to follow you  
To my surprise you're so untrue  
And I'm crying, I'm dying  
  
Oh I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
When you keep me hanging on, why don't you ask me how I feel  
The waters run so deep, ask me how I feel  
When I don't get any sleep, why don't you ask me how I feel  
  
And when you're down you lean on me  
You're a fool, too blind to see  
That I'm crying, I'm dying  
  
Oh I'm waiting in the storm, why don't you ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on, why don't you ask me how I feel  
When you stay out late at night, ask me how I feel  
When you think that I'm uptight, why don't you ask me how I feel oh  
  
You don't treat me tender no matter what I do  
But I'm the great pretender  
  
I'm waiting in the storm, ask me how I feel  
What the hell is going on?  
When you stay out late at night  
You never ask me how I feel, you just say that I'm uptight  
When you're down, I do for you  
And now I find that you're untrue

Baby tell me what you're trying to prove  
Playing games with my heart  
Hey now listen, I ain't gonna take one more night  
You're the one who broke the rules  
And I'm the one who played the fool  
Now you're trying to tell me it's alright  
You should know better than to hurt a friend  
You'll never get another chance again  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted  
Back where you started  
You think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder  
  
You had a way with words  
One look and I was under your spell  
I didn't know should I stay or should I run  
You can't deny you told me lies  
Love 'em and leave 'em baby, that's your style  
I'm not afraid to take life as it comes  
You play with fire I guess you'll never learn  
You mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know how it feels when you've been discarded  
Back where you started  
You think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far  
  
Who's gonna help ya, throw you a lifetime  
I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time  
You took your one chance and let it slip away

A prisoner of your love  
Entangled in your web  
Hot whispers in the night  
I'm captured by your spell  
Oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion  
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion  
Should I, should I?  
  
You better be good to me  
That's how it's gotta be now  
Cause I don't have no use  
For what you loosely call the truth  
You better be good to me  
  
I think it's also right  
That we don't need to fight  
We stand face to face  
And you present your case  
And I know you keep telling me that you love me  
And I really do want to believe  
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith  
Oh sure babe, anything to please you  
  
You better be good to me  
That's how it's gotta be now  
Cause I don't have the time  
For your over loaded lines  
You better be good to me  
  
And I really don't see why it's so hard to be good to me  
And I don't understand what's your plan that you can't be good to me  
What I can't feel I surely cannot see, why can't you be good to me  
And if it's not real I do not wish to see, why can't you be good to me

Hey, ugh  
Things and stuff and stuff and things and stuff  
Grease me  
I'm a bold soul sister  
BSS  
Bold soul sister  
Oh  
Sock it to the biscuits  
Bring on down to the bone  
Cleaner than big boys with hairy backs  
Hey, hey ugh  
Bold soul sister

Do what you wanna

Hey, hey, ugh  
Bold soul sister  
  
Things and stuff and stuff and things and things  
Ugh alright

Alright now

Alright now yeah  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Do what you wanna  
When you wanna  
How you wanna now do your thing soul sister

Every road that I walk  
Every single flight I ever take  
Though I'm thousands of miles away  
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you  
I've been all around this world  
I've been in far too many states  
But I'm under your spell  
I've made my mistakes, oh you can probably tell  
  
You're every dream that I dream  
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen  
I'm always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
I'd even be your fool  
I'm so in love with you  
I'm in love with you baby  
I'm gonna break every rule  
  
I hope you can forgive  
Every white lie I'm forced to tell  
They say that everything's fair in love and in war  
And I'm not above cheating for you  
One night I'll catch you off your guard  
And you'll finally fall so hard  
Strategically speaking I'm already beaten  
I'll surrender to you  
  
You're every dream that I dream  
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen  
I'm always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
I'd even be your fool  
I'm so in love with you  
I'm in love with you baby  
I'm gonna break every rule  
  
Every road that I walk on  
Every flight that I ever take  
Every dream that I dream of  
Every journey brings me closer

Look for empty roads to travel  
And grab some peace of mind  
When my life seems to unravel  
Strength from you I'll find  
Like the ocean and the sunshine  
I'll keep trying till you're all mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Till the moment is right  
I won't give up the fight  
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
Like a phoenix arises  
Ain't no mountain too high  
I'll keep pushing till I break through the barrier  
  
Like the eyes of total strangers  
Our future is unknown  
In a world of hidden danger  
Don't want to be all alone  
Like a rainbow and the starlight  
I'll keep holding on till you're mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When it seems that odds are all against you  
Gotta reach inside and find the strength to pull you through  
  
It's not enough to love each other, baby  
To make it right is gonna take some time  
If I could only break through your barrier

Here come old flat top  
He come groovin' up slowly  
He got joo joo eyeballs  
He one holy rollers  
He got hair down to his knee  
Got to be a joker  
He just do what he please  
  
He wear no shoeshine  
He got toe jam football  
He got monkey finger  
He shoot Coca Cola  
He say I know you, you know me  
One thing I can tell you is  
You got to be free  
Come together, right now  
Over me  
  
He bad production  
He got walrus gumboot  
He got Ono sideboard  
He one spinal cracker  
He got feet down below his knees  
Hold you in his armchair  
You can feel his disease  
Come together, right now  
Over me  
  
He roller coaster  
He got early warning  
He got muddy water  
He one Mojo filter  
He say one and one and one is three  
Got to be good looking  
Cause he's so hard to see  
Come together right now  
Over me  
  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah  
Come together, yeah

She knows about me  
I heard about your secret life  
She thinks that you're a family man  
You got two babies and a wife  
  
I never thought you'd sink this love  
Two many lovers in this wrong  
I'm suffocating  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I can't run  
You're all that I remember  
  
It's been three hours  
Since she shared her story in this room  
She seems like such a gentle girl  
You came and left her much too soon  
  
She said it lasted just six months  
  
The fear of being completely wrong  
Has taken over  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I can't run  
You're all that I remember  
  
All the plans we were making  
Just got washed away with the tears  
I'm drowning  
But you can't save me  
This time  
  
Complicated disaster  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after

Somewhere out in the galaxy  
A number's up but not for me  
There's a light inside the window  
And the curtain's coming down  
Pig is on the spit, and turning round  
  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
  
Dropped in from Munich with a master plan  
Guess he left his wife and kids at home  
He's got so much money rollin'  
From the crimes he'll commit  
But the Siamese cats are gonna take a little bit  
  
[Chorus]  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
Will I turn and run, or do I stand and face the gun?  
Going crazy in the night  
Everybody seemed to've lost their way  
Crazy in the night  
Seems there's no way outta here  
Do I turn and run?  
No!  
  
Got no hands, but I've got my head  
I've come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe it's a dream  
If it weren't so beautiful, it would be obscene  
Drinking with the panthers, dancing for their life  
God, this place is hungry  
Come and see the players, but don't stay for the show  
The cats are out tonight, hungry for their rites  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got no hands, but I've got my head  
I've come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe its a dream  
If it weren't so beautiful...

I've been running from the truth  
I've been running since my youth, tired of running  
I will stand here till you see  
I am you and you are me, tired of running  
There really is no difference when you look beneath the skin  
Someday I know we'll go beyond this world we're living in  
  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Dancing in my dreams  
  
There's no hiding in the dark  
From the beating of my heart it's getting louder  
Just as long as we believe  
The truth will set us free, it's getting louder  
All that really matters is the light in your face  
In you I see the longing of the whole human race  
  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Now when I lay me down to sleep I will be dancing in my dreams  
Seeing the way it all should be I will be dancing  
Dancing in my dreams  
  
On and on the story goes  
Or it's the passing of the torch  
With one small voice it all begins  
Then there are millions more, millions more

Samson and Delilah they made it known that a man is weak  
For a woman's thrown use your power like Delilah  
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.  
You know god made man all muscles and strength  
But what he gave to woman no man can resist  
Use your power like Delilah even Samson couldn't deny  
Delilah's power yeah I'm talking about.  
  
Delilah's power I said Delilah's power  
Delilah's power Delilah's power use your powers like Delilah.  
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.  
King of the jungle the lion he roars but the lioness calmly  
Soothes his soul use your powers like Delilah  
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.  
  
Delilah's power I said Delilah's power  
  
Think you can do without a woman well I don't think you can.  
Cause in every land there's a woman for every man.  
Use your powers like Delilah even Samson couldn't deny  
Delilah's power  
Delilah's power I said Delilah's power

You don't give out, you don't give in  
You never seem to be attracted to the sin  
The sin of love, the sin of all above  
I give you my advice, it can be nice  
I know you can't solve the problems of the world  
But you don't have to be a precious little toy  
Do something, do something  
I'll wait a day, I'll wait a week  
And I don't just want to be dancing cheek to cheek  
It's serious, this thing I need to do  
Win or lose, it's all up to you  
I can't believe that you could let me go this far  
It can't be natural to be the way you are  
Do something, do something  
I've got this weakness, I'm losing power  
I need your sweetness right here and now yeah  
Deeper and deeper, hour after hour  
I should be ruling but I'm not satisfied no, no  
Not satisfied, I'm not satisfied  
When I'm alone, can't do it on the phone  
Won't let you go until I get just what I need  
My heart is breaking oh baby baby please  
Do something do something baby baby okay  
Come on come on come on do something  
Get down on your knees and do something  
Oh baby, please, do something

When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it  
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart  
  
Something's gone, I can't explain  
The heat is missing from the plain  
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain  
There's something wrong with you and me  
When more than one adds up to three  
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
when you do what you do without love, without love  
  
I'm gonna paint a picture of you  
The only colour I need is blue  
You're out of love, baby you know it's true  
Tell me why and I'll try to understand  
  
Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
When you do what you do without love  
  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up  
When you do what you do without love, without love  
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love

All of my life, all of my life  
I've been searching for a love like ours  
Somewhere to stay, somewhere safe in your arms  
I was so sure  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean goodbye  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Say what's on your mind, one thing at a time  
And I promise you we'll talk it through  
Don't walk away, there's so much more to say  
Though my words seem lost on you  
Can't believe you're talking like we're just friends  
Can't you see the tears I cry  
  
Don't leave me this way, no, no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
  
Are you really saying your heart's changing  
Do you really mean it this time  
Baby  
  
Don't leave me this way, oh no  
Don't tell me it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
You're leading me nowhere  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way  
No, don't tell me that it's over  
We've only begun and our love is so young  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (don't leave me this way)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (oh you're gonna leave me now)  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way  
  
Don't leave me this way  
If you'll just take a little bit of time  
You just might want to change your mind  
Don't leave me this way  
Don't leave me this way

Bought me a bottle of wine  
I'm gonna drink it tonight  
And you can join me  
It's gonna make us feel alright  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
I'm gonna sip it slowly  
I'm not gonna rock it back  
I am no historier but I  
I've learned from my past what I've learned  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
It's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job  
Don't rush good things tonight  
You and me baby  
No need to rush it tonight  
'Cause we got all the time in the world  
To get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get, get, get, get, get it, get it, get  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
'Cause it's a slow job falling in love  
It's a slow job, tonight  
It's a slow job falling in love  
I said, it's a slow job, tonight  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things in life  
Don't rush the good things  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get it, get it, get it, get it  
Get it, get it, get it, get it  
Don't rush the good things  
Don't rush the good things tonight  
I said we got all the time in the world  
Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right  
Get, get, get, get, get it, get it, get  

If you want to leave I won't beg you to stay  
And if you gotta go darling maybe it's better that way  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
Just walk out that door, see if I care  
Go on and go now but  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I won't miss your arms around me holding me tight  
If you ever think about me just know that I'll be alright  
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine  
Don't worry about this heart of mine  
I know I'll survive, sure I'll make it through  
And I'll even learn to live without you  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know  
I wish I could scream out loud that I love you  
I wish I could say to you don't go, don't go, don't go  
Don't turn around  
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking  
Don't turn around  
I don't want you seeing me cry  
Just walk away  
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving  
I'm letting you go  
But I won't let you know

Falling  
Help me, I'm falling  
Helplessly falling  
Falling for you  
And mountains  
There may be mountains  
The highest mountain  
Won't keep me from you, oh yeah  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I just keep...  
  
Falling  
Needing and wanting  
The only one thing  
That I want is you, oh yeah  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
For you I'd swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you I'd even dare to fly  
It's the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you, oh yeah  
And forever, forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
I fall for you

Really brings me down, I don't know how  
That you can say you're not my kind  
Couldn't find a cloud for miles around  
Why do you change your story line  
It all goes gray again sometimes I don't know when  
To come out of the storm  
It feels like forty days and forty nights I've been  
Beating on your door  
  
I'm falling like rain  
Oh I, I love ya, love ya, love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I, I'm coming down around ya  
I will always think about you  
  
My sentimental ways don't seem to phase you  
I don't ever want to force your hand  
If you met me one time, just half the way  
I could meet you where you are  
Just meet me where I am  
'Cause every now and then you've gotta drive right in  
Deeper than deep  
You take a chance and then you give the wheel a spin  
Anyone can see  
  
I'm falling like rain  
Oh I, I love ya, love ya, love ya  
Falling like rain  
Oh I, I'm coming down around ya  
I will always think about you

I used to jump when you called  
And I would cry when you leave  
I had to plan every move  
Just to keep you pleased  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I don't care no more  
About nothing you do  
Now I'm goin' shoppin'  
Finger, fingerpoppin' on you  
  
I got bags under my eyes  
From losin' sleep  
You gave me malnutrition  
'Cause I just couldn't eat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You never bought me no clothes  
I had to steal what I wear  
I wore shoes so long  
'Til my feet were bare  
  
[Chorus]

A one in a million chance  
You know the moment that you crossed over the line  
A casual glance  
No one has to read between the lines  
In the south of France it was spring time  
Special feelings come alive  
There's romance in the air, so they say  
Love could be a small cafe away  
  
Love is a piece of cake  
And making love is all there is to eat  
It's a heart out of a lamb  
When you start to feel forever in a kiss  
But you must remember there's no point of refuge  
You only have a part in a lover's play  
And you could be the one left in the dark  
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart  
  
All too soon you're touching for the last time  
No one has to tell you how it is  
It's just a memory two people share  
File it under foreign affair

I tied my bandana, took my pack from the floor  
You were still sleeping,as i stood at the door  
Once more i was heading to,God only knows where  
That's when it hit me,i was already there  
I could ramble,a thousand miles or more  
Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before  
  
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way  
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay  
Why keep on running,just to wish on a star  
Searching for Heaven,when i know where you are  
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone  
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home

Well hello there  
My it's been a long long time  
How am I doin'  
Oh well I guess I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love  
I hope that he's doin' fine  
Heard you told him, yes baby  
That you'd love him till the end of time  
Well you know, that's the same thing  
That you told me  
Well it seems like just the other day  
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  
Gotta go now  
Guess I'll see you hanging round  
Don't know when though, oh  
Never know when I'll be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time your gonna pay  
Well ain't it surprisin' how time slips away  
Yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away

I know you're a gangster, but I'm the queen of space  
A ruler of hearts I shoot the moon  
I take my tricks right from the start  
  
I'm a sucker for love, the joker's running wild  
My heart it can break, oh it can break  
Frail as a child  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that you play, don't you play 'em with me  
  
You're a visionary dreamer  
A fool leaving things to chance, risk is a hazard  
Oh such a hazard if you flirt with romance  
  
It's like a shooting the dice  
Flipping coins in the air  
You're running on luck the odds are against you  
If you're not playing fair  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that play, don't you play em' with me  
  
Stacking the deck, dealing those cards  
Watch what you take and stand it on guard  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are

Girls, we come and we go  
We kiss, come and we go  
Like a breeze, brushing your cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on a face  
  
Girls, we come and we go  
Like spirits, we vanish at dawn  
My heart, suspended in time  
Like you, vanish like tears in the rain  
  
Girls, we take our loves away  
Like spirits living so far away  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind, what are we giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember, so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
Could feel

See reflections on the water  
More than darkness in the depths  
See him surface and never a shadow  
On the wind I feel his breath  
  
Goldeneye, I found his weakness  
Goldeneye, he'll do what I please  
Goldeneye, no time for sweetness  
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to be the one who's left behind  
You'll never know the days and the nights, the tears, the tears I've cried  
But now my time has come and time, time is not on your side  
  
See him move through smoke and mirrors  
Feel his presence in the crowd  
Other girls they gather around him  
If I had him I wouldn't let him out  
  
Goldeneye, not lace or leather  
Golden chain take him to the spot  
Goldeneye, I'll show him forever  
It will take forever to see what I've got  
  
You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child  
You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied  
It's a gold and honey trap I've got for you tonight  
Revenge is a kiss this time I won't miss  
Now I've got you in my sight  
  
With a goldeneye  
Golden, goldeneye  
With a goldeneye, goldeneye

This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
This is gonna be  
See you later  
Tomorrow's calling  
I've gotta run  
It's so exciting  
A little scary  
I wish you could come  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
::Chorus::  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be real...fun  
The clock is tickin'  
Telephone ringin'  
How time does fly  
Don't look so sad  
Don't look so lonely  
Oh, this ain't goodbye  
I wish you could  
Maybe you could come  
::Chorus::  
I've got a full tank of gasoline  
I think it's enough to follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
Follow the dream  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be fun  
This is gonna be real  
From my feet to my fingers  
I'm gonna feel  
I'm gonna feel  
This is gonna be real...fun  
This is gonna be real...fun  
This is gonna be real  
  
  

Goodbye, Baby, You're drivin' me crazy.  
You thought you had me baby, but I was infatuated,  
Things ain't what they used to be and you can't do a darn thing for me.  
Hey, ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh waa ooh waa  
So long  
I said things ain't what they used to be and you can't do a darn thing for me  
I knew you was cheatin, boy it wasn't worth me competin', now  
I ain't gone cry no more, I'm gonna let you go  
I said things ain't what they used to be, and you can't do a darn thing for me  
Chorus  
  

When the earth was young  
And the air was sweet  
And the mountains kissed the sky  
In the great beyond, with its many paths  
Man and nature lived side by side  
  
In this wilderness of danger and beauty  
Lived three brothers, bonded by love  
Their hearts full of joy  
They ask now for guidance  
Reaching out to the skies up above  
  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls  
With all you know  
Show us that in your eyes  
We are all the same  
Brothers to each other  
In this world we remain truly  
Brothers all the same  
  
Give us wisdom to pass to each other  
Give us strength so we understand  
That the things we do  
The choices we make  
Give direction to all life's plans  
  
To look in wonder  
At all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
Every corner we turn  
Only leads to another  
A journey ends, but another begins  
  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls  
With all you know  
Show us that in your eyes  
We are all the same  
Brothers to each other  
In this world we remain truly  
Brothers all the same  
  
Brothers all the same

When I was younger, so much younger than today yeah  
Never needed anybodys help in anyway  
Now those days are gone and I'm not so self assured

And I do appreciate you being around

You're gonna lose that smile  
  
Because all the while

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away

That you still want me  
Well, that's as may be  
But you gotta stand trial  
  
Because all the while  
I can see for miles and miles

I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey window pain  
Tell me, do you remember  
How sweet it used to be  
  
When we were together  
Everything was so grand  
Now that we've parted  
There's just one sound  
That I just can't stand  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
  
Hey hey rain  
Get out of my window  
Cause he ain't here with me  
I can't stand the rain  
Against my window  
Bringing back sweet memories

(I can't stop loving you)  
I've made up my mind  
To live in memory of the lonesome times  
(I can't stop wanting you)  
It's useless to say  
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday  
(Dreams of yesterday)  
Those happy hours that we once knew  
Tho' long ago, they still make me blue  
They say that time heals a broken heart  
But time has stood still since we've been apart  
(I can't stop loving you)  
I've made up my mind  
To live in memories of the lonesome times  
(I can't stop wanting you)  
It's useless to say  
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday  
(Those happy hours)  
Those happy hours  
(That we once knew)  
That we once knew  
(Tho' long ago)  
Tho' long ago  
(Still make me blue)  
Still ma-a-a-ake me blue  
(They say that time)  
They say that time  
(Heals a broken heart)  
Heals a broken heart  
(But time has stood still)  
Time has stood still  
(Since we've been apart)  
Since we've been apart  
(I can't stop loving you)  
I said I made up my mind  
To live in memory of the lonesome times  
(Sing a song, children)  
(I can't stop wanting you)  
It's useless to say  
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday  
(Of yesterday)

I'm a new pair of eyes  
Every time I am born  
An original mind  
Because I just died  
  
And I'm scanning the horizon for someone recognizing  
That I might have been queen  
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning  
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation  
  
Let the waters rise  
I've ridden each tide  
From the gates of the city  
Where the first born died  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river won't stop for me  
No the river won't stop for me  
  
I'm a new pair of eyes  
An original mind  
With my senses of old  
And the heart of a giant  
  
And I'm searching through the wreckage  
For some great recollection  
That I might have been queen  
  
For every sage that falls  
There's an ancient child  
  
And I might have been queen  
I remember the girl in the fields with no name  
She had a love  
Oh but the river won't stop for me  
No the river won't stop for me  
  
I look up to the stars with my perfect memory  
I lived through it all, and my future's no shock to me  
I look down, but I see no tragedy  
I look up to my past, my spirit running free  
I look down, I look down, and I'm there in history  
Oh I'm a soul survivor  
  
(Soul survivor on the river, but it won't stop)  
I might have been queen!  
(Soul survivor on the river, but it won't stop)  
I know the secret combination  

The Lord knows I've tried  
To do what's right  
For five whole long years I stayed home  
Both day and night  
And I smell trouble  
I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
No they just won't let me be  
People talk about me  
Both night and day  
I cried Lord, please forgive them  
And I go the other way  
I smell trouble  
Lord, I smell trouble ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
No they just won't let me be  
And from now on  
I will not run and hide  
I'm gonna face trouble with a smile  
And hope they pass me by  
I smell trouble  
Lord, I smell trouble way up there ahead of me  
Yes, worries and trouble  
Lord, they just won't, they just won't  
They just won't let me be, oh, no  

Should you stay, should you go  
You're beginning to see  
I go hot, I go cold  
It's just the devil in me  
You've got to understand I am in love with a beautiful man  
So if you're feeling insecure you've really no cause to be  
  
I want you near me, don't you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me, come on here and stay  
Don't let me down  
  
You're so good with your hands  
To help me with a hook or a zip  
Indispensable that's what you are  
For the occasional kiss  
I'm only playing games with you, I can't be nice without being cruel  
I know it's not fair, but I make the rules  
  
I want you near me, don't you run away  
I just got used to having you around  
I want you near me, come on here and stay  
Don't let me down  
  
All I want, I've decided  
Is your attention undivided  
  
I want you near, don't turn away  
I want you near me, won't you stay

This is the life you saved laid out before you  
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now  
Nothing can change the way I feel about you  
Better we go on our separate ways  
Nothing is left but the endless days  
Nothing to cry but your name  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Maybe this time next year we'll be together  
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies  
There was a silent dream, we made a promise  
We'd be there for each other forever  
Aboard like a ship on an ocean's roar  
Beating a path to your open door  
Nothing will keep me away  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
Each night I pray to God above  
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
I will be there  
  
Don't you look back, don't say a word  
I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you  
Don't you despair  
I will be there for you  
Farewell to you, goodbye for me  
I will be waiting for you  
I will be lonely for you  
Don't you despair  
'Cause I will be there for you  
I will be there

Even though the night is early there's a fire that whispers hurry  
Darling please turn off the lights and lock the door  
Come lay down here beside me tell me that I'm soft and pretty  
And love me like you never have before  
  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Don't hold back the love you feel inside why should passion be ashamed  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Leave me with enough of sunshine to carry me through the rain  
  
In the morning you'll be leaving but tonight there'll be no grieving  
I'll have lots of time to cry when you're gone  
Let's not waste one precious moment take all of me I'm still your woman  
And love me up until the break of dawn  
  
If this is our last time...

I tossed and turned all last night  
I thought you weren't treating me right  
I love you much too much  
It's jealousy I guess  
  
I tossed and turned all last night  
I rolled and tumbled all last night  
I dreamed someone was holding you tight  
There ain't no use to lie, I?ll love you till I die  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess I'm jealous and can't help it  
But I love you much too much  
I asked the Lord to please help me  
So I don't dream of such  
  
I guess you think silly of me  
But I'm living down in misery  
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess I'm jealous and can't help it  
But I love you much too much  
I ask the Lord to please help me  
So I don't dream of such  
  
But I guess you think silly of me  
But I'm living down in misery  
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
Oh baby, now you know, you know I'm jealous of you  
So why don't you, why don't you come on and treat me right  
You know I love you daddy, show me that you love me too

I was happy with the fear  
Every moon was new  
I was searching for myself  
When I found an angel  
There in the clouds, I flew  
Now it seems like forever  
Since I said that I've never  
Find a love whose aim was true  
But I found that love  
And I found myself in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to listen to my heart and let you in  
I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
I was running off the runway  
Too scared to land  
There was stardust in my eyes  
When I crashed into something I've never felt before (whoa)  
I survived the dive  
Now I'm finally alive  
Cause I'm right here in your arms  
And it's time that I live and its time that I give you more  
  
Cause, I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to listen to my heart and let you in  
Now, I'm ready to touch somebody  
I'm ready to love someone  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
This was meant to be  
Cause you were sent to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm ready to finally feel something real in me  
  
I'm Ready

The sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
My heart is pumping for you  
And a mad thing starts  
Ooooohhh-oooooohhh  
  
Never in you wildest dreams  
Did you ever get this feeling  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could it ever be this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
  
The night is hot outside your window  
I hear people walking people talking  
I smell your skin I feel you breathing  
Don't let me go not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could you ever get this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Did it ever get this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  
  
And the world is slowly turning  
As it turns I see your face  
Touch your eyes, your lips. . .space  
  
We've arrived at the place  
Where they open hearts  
And fill them up with love  
Filled with love filled with love  
This on is pumping for you  
As a mad thing starts  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Did you ever get this feeling  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Could it ever be this easy  
Never in your wildest dreams  

One can have a dream, baby  
Two can make a dream so real  
One can talk about being in love  
Two can see how it really feels  
  
One can wish upon a star  
Two can make a wish come true, yeah  
One can stand alone in the dark  
Two can make a light shine through  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
  
One can have a broken heart  
living in misery  
Two can really ease the pain  
like a perfect remedy  
One can be alone in a bar  
like an island he's all alone  
Two can make just any place  
seem just like bein' at home  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
Yeah  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two, ha!  
  
One can go out to a movie  
looking for a special treat  
Two can make that single movie  
something really kind of sweet  
And one can take a walk in the moonlight  
thinking that's it's really nice  
But two lovers walking hand in hand  
is like adding just a pinch of spice  
  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh doo doo doo doo  
Oh  
It takes two, baby  
It takes two, baby  
just me and you  
You know it takes two, ha!  
It takes two, baby, yeah yeah  
Me and you, just me and you  
It takes two, baby

Baby's got sunshine 'cause she dances through the rain  
Momma's got a baby so she smiles through the pain  
Daddy's got a job so he's tired but inspired for a change  
Come out the window, you can see it from here  
It's like a new found restoration  
A destination that's clear, they've got each other  
And that's a whole lot more than some folks have it would be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Now, I've got a dream and it started this way  
I get myself early up in the morning and it shines on my face  
Anytime you can find a reason and a place it'd be a crime  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way to love somebody  
It would be a crime  
Some days make you want your feet on the ground  
Some days make you want to fly  
Some people make you want to keep your head down  
But you make me wanna try  
A crime if the sun forgot to shine  
A crime if the stars forgot to align  
It would be a crime if we don't find a way  
It would be a crime  
Oh, it would be a crime  
Yeah, it'd be a crime, it'd be a crime, be a crime  

When the feeling is ended  
There ain't no use pretending  
Don't you worry, it's only love  
When your world has been shattered  
Ain't nothing else matters  
It ain't over, it's only love  
And that's all  
  
When your heart has been broken  
Hard words have been spoken  
It ain't easy, but it's only love  
And if your life ain't worth living  
And you're ready to give in  
Just remember that it's only love  
Yeah, that's all  
  
You can live without the aggravation  
You gotta want to win, you gotta want to win  
You keep looking back in desperation  
Over and over and over again

One two three!  
One two three!  
  
Gotta know how to pony  
Like Bony Maronie  
Mashed potato  
Do the alligator  
Put your hands on your hip now  
Let your backbone slip oh  
Do the Watusi  
Like my little Lucy  
  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Come on, Ally  
Like Long Tall Sally  
Twistin' with Lucy  
Doin' the Watusi  
Gotta hold of your back  
I said I like it like that  
Do the Jerk, now  
Watch me work now  
  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Come on, Ally  
Like Long Tall Sally  
Twistin' with Lucy  
Doin' the Watusi  
Lord, help me!  
Oh, help me!  
Oh, help me!

Traveling down a different road  
Trying hard to leave the load  
We take it there but you can't let go  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Back in Eden we were tried  
Found ourselves dissatisfied  
Seeking wisdom that he denied  
Trying hard to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
Hide in me, confide in me  
Oh, don't you think it's time to be  
Everything we ever tried to be  
So you and me can lay it down  
  
Speak to me, don't be ashamed  
There's no need in playing games  
Cause after all we're all the same  
Just trying hard to lay it down  
  
Wish my words could make it well  
Wish that I could break the shell  
Take us from our self-made well  
Find a way to lay it down  
  
Burdened by the things I've learned  
I'm hurting because I'm too concerned  
Nonetheless I confess I yearn  
To find a way to lay it down  
  
Lay it down, lay it down  
Wish that I could lay it down  
Wish that I could lay it down

She's got legs  
She knows how to use them  
She never begs  
She knows how to choose them  
She's holdin' legs  
Wonderin' how to feel them  
Would you get behind them?  
If you could only find them  
She's my baby  
She's my baby

Every time she's dancin'  
She knows what to do  
Everybody wants to see  
To see if she can use it  
She's so fine  
She's all mine  
Girl, you got it right  
So right  
You got it right  
Alright  
[Incomprehensible]  
She's got legs  
She knows how to use them  
She never begs  
She knows how to choose them  
She's got a dime  
All of the time  
Stays out at night movin'  
Through time  
Oh, I want her  
So, I got to have her  
That girl's alright  
She's alright  
She's alright  
Right, right, right, girl  
Baby, alright

Since we've been together  
Loving you forever  
Is all I need  
Let me be the one you come running to  
I'll never be untrue  
  
Let's, let's stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

You'd never do that to me, would you baby?  
Cause being around you is all I see  
  
So baby let's we all stay together  
Loving you whether, whether  
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Last night we tried to touch but we never got close  
Last night we tried to talk, the words got caught in our throats  
When we finally fell asleep  
We couldn't have been further apart  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby  
And it's not in my mind  
Can't you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
You try to say that I'm hiding from you  
You act like a spy always looking for clues  
You've read about my past  
But why don't we try to make a new start  
  
Look me in the heart  
If you think that love is blind  
Baby look me in the heart  
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you baby  
And it's not in my mind  
Can't you look me in the heart  
Look me in the heart  
  
Remember how good we used to be together  
Remember baby, so be tender baby  
Remember the love we said would last forever  
I know we can make it like that again

Been so long since I left you  
Do all the things you used to do  
In all this time I can't forget you  
Everywhere I turn I think of you  
And I, I want to trust you baby  
You, you're all I need  
Soul to soul, Fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Baby it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Love is such a sweet emotion  
I want to share it all with you  
With your trust and endless devotion  
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my life complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing  
Tonight, I want to thank you baby  
You, you make my soul complete  
Soul to soul, fire to fire  
Nothing like this man's desire  
Love is a beautiful thing  
One and one, you and me  
Maybe it's our destiny  
Love is a beautiful thing

Saw you there, so confused  
I knew that I could make my move now  
Treading softly, I walked over you  
We talked about this thing called love  
Saw your eyes open wide  
And I knew your heart was in it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board, get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you, I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing, right now  
  
Close your eyes, follow me  
I'll show you a world you've never been to  
Take a ride in my love machine  
And I won't do anything you can't get into  
What I've got is what you need  
And you won't do a thing about it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board, get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you, I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing, right now  
  
I never want you to go  
I always want you to stay  
So come on baby, come on now

I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies  
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when he flies  
Turning on the world, the way he smiled upon my soul as I lay dying  
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of his eyes  
  
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin  
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I"ve been  
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying  
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend  
  
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
Coming close together  
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time  
He ain't ashamed to be a man or afraid to be a friend  
I don't know the answer to the easy way he opened every door in my mind  
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end  
Loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
  
Coming close together  
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time  
But loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again  
Loving him  
Loving him  
But loving him was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Well I never been to Spain  
But I kinda like the music  
Say the ladies are insane there  
And they sure know how to use it  
The don't abuse it  
Never gonna lose it  
I can't refuse it  
Well I never been to England  
But I kinda like the Beatles  
Well, I headed for Las Vegas  
Only made it out to Needles  
Can you feel it  
It must be real it  
Feels so good  
Oh, feels so good  
Well I never been to heaven  
But I been to Oklahoma  
Well they tell me I was born there  
But I really don't remember  
In Oklahoma, not Arizona  
What does it matter  
What does it matter  
Well I never been to Spain  
But I kinda like the music  
Say the ladies are insane there  
And they sure know how to use it  
The don't abuse it  
Never gonna lose it  
I can't refuse it  
Well I never been to heaven  
But I been to Oklahoma  
Well they tell me I was born there  
But I really don't remember  
In Oklahoma, not Arizona  
What does it matter  
What does it matter

Should've never made eye contact  
Should've been a heart of stone  
When you stopped me to say hello  
Would've been twice as easy  
To just say no  
'Cause I don't want to lose at love again  
But as a couple we were quite handsome  
And the moon was out that night  
So we let our hearts go dancing  
If that thing is missing in my life  
  
There's not enough romance in this world  
There's not enough romance in this world  
There's too many people thinking only of themselves  
You gotta give love for its return  
  
Want to sing about new lovers  
Stand up against the odds  
Nothing can change a thing that strong  
And myself I know my emotions  
I got my love to share  
And when you need something so tender  
What you're looking for is so rare  
  
There's not enough romance in this world  
There's not enough romance in this world  
You gotta believe in what your heart tells you is right  
And I'm here to say that I believe in love  
  
We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games  
But that's the only price that you gotta pay  
We gotta keep believing hungry hearts run free  
Everybody needs a good loving  
It's anything you want it to be

A church house, gin house  
A school house, outhouse  
On highway number nineteen  
The people keep the city clean  
They call it Nutbush, oh Nutbush  
They call it Nutbush city limits  
Nutbush city  
  
Twenty-five was the speed limit  
Motorcycle not allowed in it  
You go t'the store on Friday  
You go to church on Sundays  
They call it Nutbush, oh Nutbush  
Said they call it Nutbush city limits  
Nutbush city  
  
You go to the fields on week days  
And have a picnic on Labor Day  
You go to town on Saturday  
But go to church every Sunday  
They call it Nutbush, Nutbush  
They call it Nutbush city limits  
Nutbush city  
  
No whiskey for sale  
You get drunk, no bail  
Salt pork and molasses

They call it Nutbush, oh, Nutbush

Nutbush city  
  
A lil old town on the Tennessee  
Quiet little old community, one-horse town  
You got to watch what they're puttin' down  
Old Nutbush. They call it Nutbush  
They call it Nutbush  
Oh, Nutbush. They call it Nutbush  

There was a time when I would have followed you  
To the end of the earth  
I was willing to share it all with you, the love, the hurt  
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust  
But I never stopped believing in you  
I always thought our love was strong enough  
One you could hold on to  
  
You never see it coming you just let it fly  
On silent wings, silent wings  
You can't hide what you feel inside  
And the fire has left your eyes  
On silent wings  
  
I see us in my dreams and we're dancing  
I can almost hear the song  
But the prayers they go unanswered  
We both know, we're just hanging on  
I can feel the change but I'll never know the reason why  
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet  
I only know that something good has died  
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory  
  
You never see it coming, you just go separate ways  
On silent wings, silent wings  
There's no more promises to break, our love has slipped away  
On silent wings  
  
You never see it coming, but you know it has to end  
Silent wings, silent wings  
I will never be the same again  
I feel the whisper of the wind of silent wings

Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
Come to me when you're down  
I'll give you friendly advice  
I'll be your avenue, your trusting ear  
Release your deepest secrets  
I'll be sincere  
  
It's an age old situation  
There's nothing to fear  
Whatever life throws at you  
Your friend is here  
Right by your side  
  
When love leaves you cold  
Lies have been told  
I will be there with my open arms  
Hurting inside  
Please don't hide the pain  
I will be there with my open arms  
  
I know what you're saying  
I been there myself  
Promises withstand  
They left me for someone else  
Then the tables turn  
A lesson I had to learn  
I can't put my fingers 'cause  
Girls, my fingers have been burned  
  
It's an age old situation  
The message is clear  
Whatever life throws at you  
Your friend is here  
Right by your side

You say you want to live some, move out into the fast lane  
You say you need excitement to make you come alive  
Some place a million miles from the shadows that surround you  
I look for your attention, you're lost out in the future  
Where lovers ask no questions and shadows never fall  
Some pilgrim bound for paradise, no compromise  
  
Paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying  
The future is this moment and not some place out there  
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow  
  
Right now, I need your loving  
Right now, give it to me  
Right now, I want your loving  
Rigt now, now now now now  
  
You talk about your new plans to move on up the stairway  
You dream about the high life that's waiting for you there  
A world of fame and fortune just around the corner  
But I don't need no high life to make me feel a woman  
I don't need to reach for no castles in the sky  
Just put your arms around me, devour me  
  
Paradise is here, it's time to stop your crying  
The future is this moment and not some place out there  
Tonight I need your love, don't talk about tomorrow  
  
Right now, I need your loving  
Right now, give it to me  
Right now, I want your loving  
Right now  
  
Don't say tomorrow  
To give me sorrow

I want to tell all of you  
That ain't doin' nothin' for me  
And can't do nothin' for me  
You should tend to your business  
And leave mine alone  
Because as far as this man is concerned....  
  
I wanna tell you he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now let me tell ya he's mine!  
(Wake up and be strong)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(We know how you will feel)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah he's mine  
(But is his love for real?)  
  
I'm gonna shine  
(Oh yeah?)  
'Cause he's my man  
(Says who?)  
And he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
This man of mine is my every thought  
I'd give him Russia if it could be bought  
I'm not ashamed of nothing I do  
I'd guide a missile if he told me to  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Poor Fool!)  
I know he's mine!  
(Says who?)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
  
If I make my bed hard  
That's where I'm gonna sleep  
You people talking means nothing to me  
I work my fingers right down to the bone  
Do anything to please him, right or wrong  
  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Oh he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
I'm with my man in every way  
To keep him happy each and every day  
I'll never hurt him or make him frown  
I'm with my man if he's up or down

All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You don't look at their faces  
And you don't ask their names  
You don't think of them as human  
You don't think of them at all  
You keep your mind on the money  
Keeping your eyes on the wall  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
I want to make a million dollars  
I want to live out by the sea  
Have a husband and some children  
Yeah, I guess I want a family  
All the men come in these places  
And the men are all the same  
You don't look at their faces  
And you don't ask their names  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do  
  
Deutch marks or dollars  
American Express will do nicely, thank you  
Let me loosen up your collar  
Tell me, do you want to see me do the shimmy again?  
  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
I'll do what you want me to do  
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money  
And any old music will do

Why' know, every now and then  
I think you might like to hear something from us  
Nice and easy  
But there's just one thing  
You see we never ever do nothing  
Nice and easy  
We always do it nice and rough  
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song  
And do it easy  
Then we're gonna do the finish rough  
This is the way we do "Proud Mary"  
  
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river  
Listen to the story  
  
I left a good job in the city  
Working for the man every night and day  
And I never lost one minute of sleeping  
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been  
  
Big wheel keep on turning  
Proud Mary keep on burning  
And we're rolling, rolling  
Rolling on the river  
  
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis  
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans  
But I never saw the good side of the city  
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen  
  
Big wheel keep on turning  
Proud Mary keep on burning  
And we're rolling, rolling  
Rolling on the river  
  
If you come down to the river  
I bet you gonna find some people who live  
You don't have to worry if you got no money  
People on the river are happy to give

When I was a little girl  
I had a rag doll  
Only doll I've ever owned  
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger, in every way  
And it gets deeper, let me say  
And it gets higher, day by day  
  
And do I love you my oh my  
Yeah river deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
When you were a young boy  
Did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No I'll never let you down  
  
Cause it goes on and on, like a river flows  
And it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows  
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows  
  
And do I love you my oh my  
Yeah river deep, mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And I love you baby just like Robin loves to sing  
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet  
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high  
  
Do I love you my oh my, oh baby  
River deep, mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

Rock me baby, rock me all night long

I'm sitting at home and the phone doesn't even ring  
I'm all alone again  
Not a sound in the house save the radio  
FM DJ filling up the emptiness  
Baby's on the road again  
Six weeks nation-wide opening the show  
  
And I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
Rock'n roll  
  
Outdoor concert, watching him play for me  
I fall in love again  
He says his music is everything  
Helpless, caught by the melody  
When he begins to sing  
Go on, tell me he's like all the rest  
  
And I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
Rock'n roll  
  
Watching him run  
I've got the feeling that he's already lost in the life  
  
So I'm making it on my own like a rock'n roll widow  
Get my news from the Rolling Stone, wake by the telephone  
Wonder if he's alone  
Or is my man on a permanent loan to rock'n roll  
To rock'n roll

I made a resolution and I plan to keep my work  
But I need you to make it work  
You've got to read the message, understand what's on my mind  
Cause not to see would be a crime  
And we could lose it anytime  
  
We've got to show some respect  
We've got to learn to protect  
Don't take it for granted, I know  
That if you want to stay close  
We've got to show some respect  
  
But I believe in working, then I believe in a little help  
Cause I'm not a light unto myself  
Without a thing of value, why settle for second best  
We don't know what's up ahead  
And we can't let ourselves forget  
  
We've got to show some respect  
We've got to learn to protect  
Don't take it for granted, I know  
That if you want to stay close  
We've got to show some respect  
  
For the things that I love about you  
From the woman that you see inside  
Don't let it walk out the door  
Love follows every time

So fine  
So fine, yeah!  
And babe you're mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you  
Oh, there's nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you  
Because you're  
So fine  
So fine  
And every time we meet,  
My heart skips a beat.  
You're in my first cup of coffee,  
Gonna be my last cup of tea  
Because you're  
So, fine!  
And babe you're mine  
You make me walk  
You make me talk  
About you

There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
You make me feel like no one else before  
You make me wonder how easy it is to love  
You make me wonder how easy it is to love  
  
There's something special about a kiss  
It makes me want no other lover  
'Cause you make me feel like this  
When you're away I want no other  
  
I never found what I was looking for  
I got to wonder if no star would ever shine  
I can't explain it, but somehow deep inside  
I always knew that when it did I'd recognise you  
  
There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
Now I know what I've been doing here  
Now I know what it's all about  
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be  
In your arms is where I always want to be, 'cause  
  
There's something special about you  
When it comes to you there's something special  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
There's something special about you  
There's something special about a kiss  
There's something special about love  
I swear to God it comes from heaven up above  
  
There's something special about you  
There's something special about a kiss  
'Cause you make me feel like this  
  
Something special  
Something special

I found a friend, someone to help me  
And a place I can be myself when I'm in trouble now  
I've lost it and I don't know how  
I come to you 'cause you can show me  
Get me back to me I know with a remedy  
Baby I need your therapy  
With your healing kiss you know how to make my mind relax  
I will listen to the words you say and just lie back  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
  
I guess it shows I need attention  
Somehow you're asking all the right questions that I've gotta say  
What's been on my mind these days  
And I know you know just how to make my mind react  
When it's coming straight from you that's my first point of contact  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
  
I'm bad at making decisions  
But being alone with you just feels so right, feels so right  
I'm losing my inhibitions  
With every minute I share with you tonight, share it with you tonight  
  
Talk, talk to me  
To my heart, to my heart, oh yeah  
Come one, come on and reach out  
'Cause the words just mean so much  
I can hear you when you talk right to my heart  
  
Talk to my heart that's where real talkin' starts  
Words of love that cut straight to my heart  
Reach out and touch, so few words say so much  
I can hear you when you tell it like it is  
When you talk straight to my heart  
I can hear you, I can hear you

Let me tell you about a man I knew  
Yeah, I knew him all too well  
  
My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight  
But not for tomorrow  
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford  
More than you can borrow  
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I  
Pick their pockets hey  
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train  
And make my getaway  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
  
I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes  
Did something strange to me  
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride  
But there was a fork in the street  
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules  
That I've been taught  
You never get involved, never drop your defences  
But this time I got caught  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes  
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine  
  
Feels so good, I want more, it should be against the law

It's time to face the music  
Tonight I came to use it  
You never know  
Who you're gonna meet in here  
I thought I'd never find it  
The dark and handsome kind  
I used to dream of  
And now you're standing there  
Though you're looking good to me  
It doesn't mean that you can do as you please  
  
Oh baby you're the best thing in my life  
But a one-track mind is what you got  
Oh baby you're the best bet here tonight  
And a one-track mind is worth a lot  
I've got no good reason to believe we'll last for long  
But that's good enough for me till the right man comes along  
  
I've waited for a lover  
The kind who'll stay forever  
You look to me  
Like the sort of man I need  
It's not the best scenario  
But now I've found you I'm letting you go  
  
Oh baby you're the best thing in my life  
But a one-track mind is what you got  
Oh baby you're the best bet here tonight  
And a one-track mind is worth a lot  
For the perfect guy maybe I should be holding on  
And with you I could till the right man  
Till the right man comes along

Looking counter clockwise  
Knowing what could happen  
Any moment maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
Steadfast collapse  
Always certain any moment  
Maybe you maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
Recline complete dreams too sweet  
I can't do it not with you  
Not even with you  
Maybe never with you  
  
And I'd sell my soul for total control  
Yeah I'd sell my soul for total control  
  
Street wet tonight, lovers touch  
It's pure delight  
Always certain any moment  
Maybe even you  
  
Stay in bed stained sheets  
My head hurts I repeat  
Maybe you maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
And I'd sell my soul for total control  
Yeah I'd sell my soul for total control  
I'd sell my soul for total control  
Over you, over you  
Total control over you

Walking along  
(Walking along)

Some folks say there's a price on love  
Watch your freedom go, watch your freedom go  
Just can't breathe with your head in the glove  
Watch your freedom go, baby I don't know  
But how can they mean it  
How come they give it up  
How long until they see  
The modern laws of lovin' don't apply to me  
  
Twenty Four Seven, stay here with me  
Twenty Four Seven, throw away the key  
Twenty Four Seven, I don't want to be free  
  
You get by if you kiss and tell  
Hear the people say, hear the people say  
Two strong hearts gotta share one cell  
Hear the people say but it ain't my way  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
I'll give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I don't need parol  
  
Twenty four seven, stay here with me  
Twenty four seven, throw away the key  
Twenty four seven, I don't want to be free, free, free  
Twenty four seven, around the clock  
Twenty four seven, I never want it to stop  
Twenty four seven, mm, here with me  
  
I'm gonna count the time  
That you're gonna be mine  
Seven days a week  
Twenty four hours ain't enough for me  
  
How can they mean it  
How come they add it up  
I'm gonna give my heart and my soul  
If loving you is prison I don't need parol  
  
Twenty four seven, stay here with me

I want you twenty four seven

Two people living on the edge of life  
Are people running out of dreams and time  
I can hear it when you tell me so  
I can feel it but I can't let go  
  
Two people gotta stick together  
And love one another, save it for a rainy day  
Some people gotta stay whatever  
And give one another shelter on a rainy day  
  
Two people living in the way we do  
Are people trying to keep a love anew  
What to say to make some sense of it  
What to do to make the feeling fit  
  
Two people gotta stick together  
And love one another, save it for a rainy day  
Some people gotta stay whatever  
And give one another shelter on a rainy day  
  
I'll come running to your rescue  
You gotta stand by me  
There's a lot of love between us  
We should never let go

Tell me lawyer what to do  
I think I'm falling in love with you  
Defend me from the way I feel  
Won't you give me some advice  
On how to handle my private life  
I'm sure we can make a deal  
I confess I'm a fool for men with a clever mind  
But your intellect ain't no match with this heart of mine  
  
All I want is a little reaction  
Just enough to tip the scales  
I'm just using my female attraction  
On a typical male, on a typical male  
  
Your sense of justice I'll embrace  
But your defense don't help my case  
I'm deep in trouble with the law  
Something about authority  
Seems to bring out the bad in me  
Hey lawyer gotta catch me when I fall  
Oh they say that you match your wits with the best of them  
But I know when I'm close you're just like the rest of them  
  
All I want is a little reaction  
Just enough to tip the scales  
I'm just using my female attraction  
On a typical male, on a typical male  
  
So put your books aside  
Loosen off the suit and tie  
Gotta open up your heart and let me in  
Open up your heart and let me in

Under my thumb  
The girl who once had me down  
Under my thumb  
  
The girl who once pushed me around  
It's down to me  
The difference in the clothes she wears  
Down to me, the change has come,  
She's under my thumb  
Ain't it the truth babe?  
  
Under my thumb  
The squirmin' dog who's just had her day  
Under my thumb  
  
A girl who has just changed her ways  
It's down to me, yes it is  
The way she does just what she's told  
Down to me, the change has come  
She's under my thumb  
Ah, ah, say it's alright  
  
Under my thumb  
A Siamese cat of a girl  
Under my thumb  
She's the sweetest, hm, pet in the world  
It's down to me  
  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me, the change has come,  
She's under my thumb  
Ah, take it easy babe  
Yeah  
  
It's down to me, oh yeah  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me, the change has come,  
She's under my thumb  
Yeah, it feels alright  
Under my thumb  
Her eyes are just kept to herself  
Under my thumb, well I  
  
I can still look at someone else  
It's down to me, oh that's what I said  
The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me, the change has come,  
She's under my thumb  
Say, it's alright.  
  
Say it's all  
Say it's all  
  
Take it easy babe

Feels alright  
Take it, take it easy babe.

Baby, baby, baby  
I know that I've been mad in love before  
But how I can be with you  
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night?  
You're the book that I have opened  
And now I've gotten no much more  
Baby, baby  
The curiousness of your potential kiss  
Has got my mind and body aching  
You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby  
How could you have a day without a night?  
You're the book that I have opened  
And now I've gotten no much more, ohh  
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missing every part, hey yeah

Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missin' every part  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
And I'm missin' every part  
You really hurt me baby, you really hurt me baby  
Like a soul without a mind, and a body without a heart  
I'm missin' every part  
Ohh hey  

Out of the ruins, out from the wreckage  
Can't make the same mistakes this time  
We are the children, the last generation  
We are the ones they left behind  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
Looking for something we can rely on  
There's got to be something better out there.  
Mmmm, love and compassion, their day is coming  
All else are castles built in the air  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?  
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains.  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
So what do we do with our lives?  
We leave only a mark.  
Will our story shine like a light,  
Or end in the dark?  
Give it all or nothing!  
  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
All the children say,  
We don't need another hero,  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

Out of the ruins

I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind  
Just the way it used to sound, through the Georgia pines  
You were there to answer when I called, yeah  
You and me we had it all  
  
Remember how I used to touch your hands  
While reachin' for the feeling that was always there  
You're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh  
You and me we had it all  
  
I know that we can never lives these times again  
So I'll let these dreams take me back to where we've been  
Then I stay there with you just as long as I can  
  
Oh, it was so good, yeah, it was so good  
Oh, it was so good, when I was your man  
And I never stop believin' your smile  
Even though it didn't stay, it was all worthwhile  
  
Yes, you're the best thing in my life I can recall, oh  
You and me we had it all  
You and me we had it all

Some boys got the look of a Greek Adonis  
Some boys try to talk you off your feet  
Some boys think they're gods gift to woman  
Some boys think they're sweet enough to eat  
Try to change the habit of a lifetime  
Don't even try  
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing  
You realize  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
Some guys got lips that you can't help kissing  
And some guys got a smile you can't resist  
Some guys gotta build a reputation  
They just want to add you to the list  
You got a lot of physical attraction  
I can't deny  
But can you guarantee me satisfaction  
While I'm still waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
What you get is what you see  
Ain't nothing more to it  
And if you want to love a woman like me  
It takes a man to do it  
If what you get is what you see  
Then I don't want your kind of love  
  
So let me see your cards on the table  
Before I buy  
I always read the writing on the label  
So give me reason to believe there's more to you than meets the eye

In what other lives have I known your kiss  
And what forgotten moments have I felt like this  
The way you touch me I come undone  
You know me more than anyone  
Whatever you want  
  
In what other lives have I touched your face  
And what words did we whisper in a strange forbidden place  
To be with you baby is to find myself  
We're two of a kind, you and I  
I couldn't love anyone else  
  
You are my beginning, my end  
You are my lover, my friend  
In this life, in this time  
  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting, baby baby baby  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
In what other lives did I feel your skin  
And when exactly did I breathe you in  
Feel like I've known you for a thousand years  
You're so familiar to me and there is no fear  
  
You are my beginning, my end  
You are my lover, my friend  
In this life, in this time  
  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting, baby baby baby  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Watch the sun go down, yeah yeah  
My past and future in you are bound, oh yeah  
I watch as time moves on, I'm alive and strong  
And when I'm with you there's no right, no wrong  
  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting, baby baby baby  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
I'm gonna be right here waiting, baby baby  
Whatever you want (whatever you want)  
Whatever you need (whatever you need)  
I will be right here waiting, baby baby baby  
Whatever you want, whatever you need  
Whatever you want  
Right here, right here waiting  
Right here, right here waiting

Because it's love that I feel whenever you're really near  
I'm feeling sexual  
It's time that I breathe for the love that pleases me  
Too easily, easily, baby

You must understand though the touch of your hand  
Makes my pulse react  
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl  
Opposites attract  
It's physical  
Only logical  
You must try to ignore that it means more than that  
  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
What's love but a second hand emotion  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken  
  
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused  
When you're close to me  
If a tend to look dazed I've read it someplace  
I've got cause to be  
There's a name for it  
There's a phrase that fits  
But whatever the reason you do it for me  
  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
What's love but a second hand emotion  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken  
  
I've been taking on a new direction  
But I have to say  
I've been thinking about my own protection  
It scares me to feel this way  
  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion  
What's love got to do, got to do with it  
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

The rooms were so much colder then  
My father was a soldier then  
The times were very hard  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
I smoked my first cigarette at ten  
And for boys I had a bad yen  
I had quite a ball  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
When I was young it was more important  
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
I met my first love at thirteen  
He was brown, and I was pretty green  
I learned quite a lot  
When I was young  
When I was young  
  
When I was young it was more important  
Pain more painful, the laughter much louder, yeah  
When I was young  
  
My faith was so much stronger then  
I believed in fellow men  
I was so much older then  
When I was young  
When I was young  
When I was young

I'm feeling low, I tear out my hair  
Walking 'round in circles like I don't care  
One shoe off, the other one on  
Cause I threw the damn shoe the night that you were gone  
I'm in the mood, I'm in such a mess  
My heart is broken and I'm in distress  
Don't want to eat, don't want to sleep  
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout the dirty way you treated me  
I'm in no mood for company  
You see I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you yeah  
  
Looking down at the way I get dressed  
I need to know is that why you left  
My face is sweet but my head is wrecked  
By the things that you said on the night you left  
You can keep your sympathy  
Because I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I can live without you, I'm telling you girl now  
I can live without you, can you hear me  
  
You know you can keep your sympathy  
Because I just don't want your pity  
  
'Cause I call your name to drive me insane  
And I feel the need to make my heart bleed  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby  
  
I call your name (I call your name) to drive you insane (to drive me insane)  
'Cause I feel the need ('cause I feel the need) to make my heart bleed (to
make my heart bleed)  
And baby I don't know why I'm drowning in tears  
'Cause I don't want to die  
So I find myself another way to learn to live another day  
Without you baby
