For you to think of me  
It would only take a minute of your time  
To spare one thought for me  
Would you miss just one minute of your time?  
  
When you are far away  
I'd like to be part of your time each day  
So think of me  
  
A minute of your time  
Is all it takes to bring us close  
When we are far apart  
  
And if I'm on your mind  
I know that there's a chance  
You'll find that I'm right there in your heart  
One minute ev'ry day  
May help to keep the wolf away  
Until that moment you are back to stay  
But better still I'd like to think you think of me  
Ev'ry minute of your time

A new kind of fire, burning inside  
Wonderful feelings, I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Silent, sweet surrender  
A broken heart remembers the first time  
Last moments sweet and tender  
Cold and dying embers when love dies  
  
In the quiet of the mist  
When two lovers kissed the very last time  
But we're right here tonight  
It's love at first sight and we're doing alright  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Mexican morning, we danced until dawn  
In the moonlight  
In blue Acapulco, nobody that we know  
Is just right  
No thought of tomorrow  
And sorrow is clear out of sight  
But right here tonight  
Love is alright  
And we're lost in the light  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
A new kind of fire burning inside

Cold winds may blow over icy seas  
And I'll take with me the warmth  
A taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
I'll leave behind my heart to wear  
And may it always remind you of  
A taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
I'll return, I will return  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
He never came back to his love so fair  
And so she died dreaming of his kiss  
His kiss was honey  
Tasting more bitter than wine  
I'll return, I will return  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
I'll come back for the honey and you  

Right from the first day one man stood alone  
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known  
He looked all around him and lifted his head  
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said  
  
This place needs a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
Up through the ages, the story's the same  
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain  
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why  
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny  
  
The need of a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed  
So reckless and wild but lost like a child  
Whose dreams never came  
  
Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness  
One look in her eyes and I realized  
I've truly been blessed  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man

Do you want a shoulder  
I only want to hold you  
In your hour of need  
I hate to say I told you so  
But you should've let him go  
It just wasn't meant to be  
  
Let me make your pain a little lighter  
I can help you make your world a little brighter  
  
I'll be there when the shouting's over  
I'll be here after the tears  
You just may need me to hold you  
I'll be here after the tears  
  
Just a matter of time now  
Till I make you mine now  
It could happen any day  
Waited patiently  
Now it looks like you're gonna be free  
The tide is turning my way  
  
I'll see you through all the confussion  
I'll be your only true solution  
  
I'll be here when the party's over  
I'll be here after the tears  
You just may need another lover  
I'll be here after the tears  
  
Hold on  
Love is not so far away  
Can you hear it calling  
Be strong  
I'll be waiting in the wings  
  
(I'll be here when the shouting's over)  
i can make it better  
(I'll be here after the tears)  
I can make it better  
(You just may need me to hold you)  
I can make it better  
(I'll be here after the tears)  
(I can make it better)  
  
I'll be here when the party's over  
(I can make it better)  
I'll be here after the tears  
(I can make it better)  
You just may need another lover  
(I can make it better)  
I'll be here after the tears  
(I can make it better)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away  
  
I know  
She's gone to stay  
It's breakin' me up  
Anytime she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's gone much too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
I wonder if she's gone to stay  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't a home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I know  
She's gone to stay  
It's breaking me up  
Any time she goes away  
Gotta leave the young thing alone  
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
I wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
Any time she goes away

Little girl don't you want to stay?  
I want to be your lover man  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I don't need no one to love you  
I'm gonna love you all by myself  
  
You'll find, little girl, you know it too,  
Don't you know I'm in love with you  
All by myself  
All by myself.  
  
I don't want no one to love you  
I want to love you all by myself  
  
Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one,  
We'll go on down and have some fun  
All by ourselves,  
All by ourselves,  
We don't need nobody with us  
We gonna do it all by ourselves.  

Sometimes when I'm down and all alone  
Just like a child without a home  
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on  
Oh honey, all I ever need is you  
You're my first love, you're my last  
You're my future, you're my past  
And loving you is all I ask, honey  
All I ever need is you  
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow  
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do  
Give me a reason to build my world around you  
Some men follow rainbows, I am told  
Some men search for silver some for gold  
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey  
All I ever need is you  
Without love I'd never find the way  
Through ups and downs of every single day  
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey  
All I ever need is you  

Hey Robbie are you ready for  
this - I'm always ready Tom,  
You know that  
I think you were born ready - Ha ha, Come On  
  
I was born long ago  
I am the chosen, I'm the one  
I have come to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  
So that's why you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don' t know why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We haven't changed and rearranged  
And turn this planet back to one  
So tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
we've got to love and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and fall in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know got to know

What did you think  
I would do At This Moment  
When you're standing before me  
With tears in your eyes  
Trying to tell me that you  
Have found you another  
And you just don't love me no more  
  
What did you think  
I would say At This Moment  
When I'm faced with the knowledge  
That you just don't love me  
Did you think I would curse you  
Or say things to hurt you  
Cause you just don't love me no more  
  
Did you think I could hate you  
Or raise my hands to you  
Now, come on, you know me too well  
How could I hurt you  
When Darlin' I love you  
And you know, I'd never, never hurt you  
  
What do you think  
I would give At This Moment  
If you'd stay, I'd subtract  
Twenty years from my life  
I'd fall down on my knees  
Kiss the ground that you walk on  
If I could just hold you again

The falling leaves pass by my window  
The autumn leaves of red and gold  
I see your lips your summer kisses  
The sunburned hands I used to know  
Um since you went away  
The days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
Oh, but I'll miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall  
Oh I said I miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall

I really can't stay  
But baby, it?s cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Ahh, baby, it?s cold outside  
  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I?ll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to that fireplace roar  
  
So really I?d better scurry  
Oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Oh baby, it?s bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink  
There's no cabs to be had out there  
  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I?ll take your hat, your hair looks well  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least there'll be, oh, that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride  
  
I really can't stay  
Baby, don't hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside  
Yeah  
  
I simply must go  
Oh, baby, it?s cold outside  
The answer is no  
You know it?s cold outside  
  
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Oh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Like waves upon a tropical shore  
  
My maiden aunt?s mind is vicious  
Eww, your lips are delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home  
Ahh, baby, you would freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
You know it?s up to your knees out there  
  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me  
  
there's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
  
I really can't stay  
Get over and hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside, yeah  
  
Bloody, freezin' ain't it

I've known bad women  
I've had bad wine  
I've had nights filled with bad dreams  
Tasted bad food and bad water  
And I've read about bad rain  
  
Yeah, I only know of one thing  
With an ironclad guarantee  
'Cause I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I've never really seen no bad love  
Well, no bad love well, no bad love  
  
You know how I love music  
As long as it ain't square  
To be bad music is don't move  
Too smooth, no groove happening there  
  
I've known a few bad ladies  
All of them got me hurt  
Some of them women that seemed sweet  
Complete, they treat you like dirt  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I never really seen no bad love  
No bad love, no bad love  
  
I've seen a lot of bad movies  
I saw one just last night  
Ain't got no action, and it ain't got no plot  
That's not what I like  
  
You can even get a bad education  
But that won't get you nowhere  
But somebody's gonna say  
That school ain't cool  
What fool wants to go there  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I've had bad days and had bad nights  
But I never had me no bad love  
And a Cadillac Fleetwood with a bad ride  
But I never had me no bad love  
I've had bad things happen to me all my life  
But I never had me no bad love  
  
Whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, hoo  
But I never had me no bad love  
Had a Cadillac car

Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Got a gal named Lucinda  
They call her the great pretender  
Got a gal named Lucinda  
They call her the great pretender  
'Cause when she talks  
She says Bama Lama, Loo  
  
Well, Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Bama Lama, baby, Bama Loo, yeah  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
  
The way she smiles, she drives me wild  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Oh, yeah, yoo, wah  
  
Well, I asked my little baby for a kiss  
She shook her head around like this  
Asked my little baby for a kiss  
She shook her head around like this  
  
She said, wah, all right  
Yeah, Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
Bama Lama, baby, Bama Loo, yeah  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo  
  
The way she smiles  
She drives me wild  
Bama Lama, Bama Loo

I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman  
  
My arms will stay strong  
My love will burn along  
Like the fire in the heart's song  
If she's the right one  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire  
  
'Cause I am a strong man  
Not such a young man  
I will do all I can  
For that special woman, ooh  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire  
  
Oh, I've searched for you  
So you must know that it's true  
And how I found you  
Yes, I found you  
I'm gonna leave it all up to you  
  
I know how to love  
I ain't no liar  
There's a flame in my heart  
It burns like a fire  
  
I've got all this love  
I can give you if you let me  
And I'll be your baptism by fire  
I'll be your baptism by fire

Watch out you might get what you're after  
Cool babies strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary guy  
Burning down the house  
  
Hold tight wait till the party's over  
Hold tight We're in for nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
Burning down the house  
  
Here's your ticket pack your bag: time for jumpin' overboard  
The transportation is here  
Close enough but not too far, Maybe you know where you are  
Fightin' fire with fire  
  
All wet hey you might need a raincoat  
Shakedown dreams walking in broad daylight  
Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees  
Burning down the house  
  
It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself  
Gonna come in first place  
People on their way to work baby what did you except  
Gonna burst into flame  
  
My house S'out of the ordinary  
That's might Don't want to hurt nobody  
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet  
Burning down the house  
  
No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet  
Everything's stuck together  
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set  
Fighting fire with fire..

What good is sitting, alone in your room?  
But come, hear the music play!  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! Come to the cabaret!  
  
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom  
It is time for a holiday  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! Come to the cabaret!  
  
Come taste the wine Come hear the band  
Come blow that horn Start celebrating  
Right this way your table's waiting  
  
What good's committing prophet of doom?  
To wipe every smile away  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! So come to the cabaret!

I watch the leaves falling to the ground  
I'm walking up and down  
The streets of my hometown  
You're here with me like it used to be  
I look around and then I'm on my own again  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop now that you  
Made me part of you  
I've heard some people say  
I'm dreaming my life away  
But what else can I do  
Can't stop loving you  
  
Your face I see in my memory  
I close my eyes and then  
I start to live again  
You're holding me like it used to be  
I open my eyes and then  
I'm on my own again  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop now that you  
Made me part of you  
I've heard some people say  
I'm dreaming my life away  
But what else can I do  
Can't stop loving you  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop feeling blue  
Can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
Oh I can't I can't I can't...

I'm carrying a torch for you  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it costs  
To keep carrying a torch  
  
Flame of love it burens so bright  
That is my desire  
Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up  
Higher and higher  
  
You're the keeper of the flame  
Girl, you burn so bright  
Baby, why don't we reconnect?  
Move into the light  
  
I've been going to and fro on this  
And I'm still carrying a torch  
You must know how much it's worth  
But I'm carrying a torch  
  
Baby, you're the keeper of the flame  
And you burn so bright  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Why don't we reconnect  
And move on further into the light?  
  
I've been calling you on the phone  
'Cause I'm carrying a torch  
I can't do it all on my own  
'Cause I'm carrying a torch  
  
I'm carrying a torch for you, baby  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it's worth  
When I'm carrying a torch  
  
I'm carrying a torch for you, baby  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it's worth  
When I'm carrying a torch

Come on, come on, baby  
Come on, come on, baby  
Come on, come on, come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
I gotta tell you  
Really gotta swingin' bad now  
You really gotta swingin' bad now  
We do, want you to come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
Every time I see you  
Dancing 'round and 'round, yeah  
And it makes me wanna jump  
Right straighted up and down  
'Cause I really dig you, baby  
I really dig you, baby  
I do, love you so come on  
And let's do the dance of love  
Come on, baby  
Do the dance of love...  

I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window  
I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind  
She was my woman  
As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind  
  
My my my Delilah  
Why why why Delilah  
I could see, that girl was no good for me  
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free  
  
At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting  
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door  
She stood there laughing  
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more  
  
My my my Delilah  
Why why why Delilah  
So before they come to break down the door  
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more  
  
She stood there laughing  
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more  
  
My my my Delilah  
Why why why Delilah  
So before they come to break down the door  
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more  
  
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take any more

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
I dreamed about them cotton fields of home  
I dreamed about my mother, dear old pappy, sister and brother  
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waitin' for so long  
  
I want to go home  
I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home  
  
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think I'm just fine, yes they do  
But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars  
If only they could read between the lines  
  
('Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time  
You know what I'm gonna do?  
I'm gonna take my foolish pride  
Get it on a southbound freight and let it ride  
I'm gonna go back to the loved ones  
The ones I left waiting so far behind)  
  
I want to go home, yeah  
I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home (Can't you hear me?)  
  
I want to go home  
Whoa, baby I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home (Somebody help me)  
  
I want to go home, yeah  
I want to go home, whoa oh  
Oh, how I want to go home  
  
[To Fade:]  
Hmm, I want to go home

This old house is falling down round mice  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone, you can hear me pray  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my bed aside  
  
The days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise for a broken heart  
Now all the bonny birds, have flown away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
Come tonight you're only what I want  
Come tonight you can be my comfort doll  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night, we can steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day

First the tide rushes in,  
Plants a kiss on the shore,  
Then rolls out to sea,  
And the sea is very still once more.  
So I rush to your side  
Like the oncoming tide,  
With one burning thought - Will your arms open wide?  
At last we're face to face,  
And as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell, I can feel you are love, your are real.  
Really mine in the rain,  
In the dark, in the sun.  
Like the tide at its ebb,  
I'm at peace in the web of your arms.

Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind  
As I lay searching for sleep.  
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name  
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.  
  
And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Started walkin' all over my mind.  
It's sad, so sad to watch love go bad,  
But a true love would not have gone wrong.  
  
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had  
For without them I could not go on,  
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Walkin' all over my mind.  
  
I must go on, be strong,  
Tho' a million teardrops may fall,  
Before these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Stop walk' all over my mind

Well hello there  
My it's been a long long time  
How am I doin'  
Well I guess I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love  
I hope that he's doin' fine  
I heard you told him  
That you'd love him till the end of time  
Well you know, that's the same thing  
That you told me  
Seems like just the other day  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now  
Guess I?ll see you hanging 'round  
Don't know when though  
Never know when I?ll be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time, it's going to be okay  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
Yeah, ain't it funny' how time slips right on, slips right on  
Away, away, away  

An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw  
A ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat  
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet  
'Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
If you want to save your soul from hell a ridin' on our range  
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky

Oh man  
I can't go to work  
I got 2 more sick days  
  
This is for my people working  
Waking up at six in the morning  
Try to make an honest living  
Oki oki oki oki oh  
  
Let me see your hands up high  
Touch the cloud reach for the sky  
Need some time peace of mind  
To make money, money, make money, money, money  
  
[Chorus]  
Holiday, holiday  
Cause I work hard everyday, everyday  
Need some time to get away, get away  
So tell my boss I need a holiday, holiday

Wining, dining when the bill comes

First one, last one on the scene  
A pocket little drives so I need the queen  
I gotta make money, money, make money, money, money

And we don't need no water

HONKY TONK WOMEN  
WRITERS MICK JAGGER, KEITH RICHARDS  
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis, She tried to take me upstairs for
a ride. She had to heave me right across her shoulder, Cause I just can't seem
to drink you off my mind. It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme
the honky tonk blues. I laid a divorcee in New York City, I had to put up some
kind of a fight. The lady, then she covered me in roses, She blew my nose and
then she blew my mind. It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme the
honky tonk blues.  
  

I believe for every drop of rain that falls  
A flower grows,  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night  
A candle glows,  
I believe for everyone who goes astray,  
Someone will come to show the way,  
I believe, I believe.  
  
I believe above the storm a smallest prayer  
Will still be heard,  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere  
Hears every word,  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,  
Or touch a leaf, are see the sky,  
Then I know why,  
I believe.  
  
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,  
Or touch a leaf, are see the sky,  
Then I know why,  
I believe.

I watch you as you're sleeping  
As I'm standing at the door  
I don't want to let you go  
But I can't hold on anymore  
I just can't find the strength  
To say I'm leaving you  
It's over now, it's over now  
And there's nothing I can do  
I couldn't say goodbye  
Couldn't stand the pain  
Couldn't watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldn't say goodbye  
I'm walking down this rainy street  
Thinking you're awake by now  
As you read my letter  
And the tears fall from your eyes  
Just know I tried to make it work  
It just wasn't meant to be  
I needed you, I needed you  
But not the way you needed me  
I couldn't say goodbye  
Couldn't stand the pain  
Couldn't watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldn't say goodbye  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
I didn't want to make you cry  
It's over now, yes it's over now  
I just couldn't say goodbye  
I couldn't say goodbye  
Couldn't stand the pain  
Couldn't watch you cry  
Knowing that your heart would break  
So I let you sleep  
Till the morning light  
When you wake up and you read the note I write  
Telling you that I  
I couldn't say goodbye

I wake up crying after tossin' and turnin'  
And a yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby oh, my love since you went away  
Haven't spent a happy day  
I wake up crying after sobbin' and sighin'  
And a wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby well I know I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
I need your arms to hold me tight now  
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
(Oh, now, now, now, well, well, well, now baby)  
I tell you I wake up crying after tossin' and turnin'  
And a yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby, why don't you please come back to me  
And save me from this misery I want you to save me  
Ah save me baby  
Mhh  

I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Adore you, and want you so  
I'm just a no one,  
With nothing to give you but Oh  
I Love You  
  
He, He buys you diamonds  
Bright, sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, dear when I say,  
That he can give you the world,  
But he'll never love you the way  
I Love You  
  
He can take you anyplace he wants  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
  
I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Must watch you, go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling it's I  
Who Loves you  
  
I Love You  
I Love You  
  
I Looove Yoooou

Your captivating eyes  
The clever way they smile stops him in his tracks  
And add your pretty face you keep him in his place  
He'd do anything you ask  
  
They've broken the mold  
More precious than gold  
When you're standing there the world disappears  
  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares  
You're a cut above the rest  
He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Be careful what you do he?s so in love with you, you might tear him apart  
To watch the way you move, it?s obvious that you were made for breaking hearts  
The pout of your lips, those soft fingertips  
The curve of your waist, you?re perfectly made  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares you?re a cut above the rest  
He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Your captivating eyes  
The subtle way you smile sets him in a spin  
The subtle way you smile

I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
That's when my love comes tumbling down,  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
When these no one else around,  
  
I'm gonna take you,  
Girl and hold ya,  
And do all the things I told ya,  
In the midnight hour,  
  
Yes I am,  
Wooh yes I am,  
One more thing I just want to say right here,  
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out,  
  
To see that twinkle in your eye,  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,  
That's when my love,  
Began to shine,  
  
Your the only girl I know,  
That really loves me so,  
In the midnight hour,  
Oh yeah,  
  
In the midnight hour,  
Yeah, alright,  
Play it for me one time now,

It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her, knowing if I forget her  
How much better off she would be  
  
The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on  
The harder that it's going to be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
I'd never desert her, God knows when I hurt her  
That's the last thing that I want to do  
She tries, but she can't tell how she feels  
But I know, too well, just what she's going through  
  
If I love her so much, I don't know why I can't do  
The right thing and just let her be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her, "This time it's all over"  
Making two times I've told her goodbye  
Last night, we broke up, this morning I woke up  
And for the fifth time, I'm changing my mind  
  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her  
Than most foolish men will ever see  
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her

Someday, some way, you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes, darling, you're going to need me again  
It's just a matter of time  
Go on, go on, until you reach the end of the line  
But I know you'll pass my way again  
It's just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had You laughed and called me a clown  
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love was a true love  
It's just a matter of time

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone  
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone  
But when I see you hanging about with anyone  
It's not unusual to see me cry,  
Oh I wanna' die.  
  
It's not unusual to go out at any time  
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime  
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,  
It's not unusual  
  
It happens every day  
No matter what you say  
  
You find it happens all the time  
Love will never do what you want it to  
Why can't this crazy love be mine.  
  
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone  
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone  
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime  
It's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Love that runs away from me  
Dreams that just won't let me be  
Blues that keep on bothering me  
Chains that just won't set me free  
  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face  
Memories time cannot erase  
Then I awake and find you gone  
I'm so blue and all alone  
  
So far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Oh honey, you know, what lonesome feeling that I have all the time  
It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine  
And the dreams that always keeps on hurtin' me in my sleep  
I know they're only vows that you and I could never keep  
  
Too far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

You don't have to be beautiful  
To turn me on  
I just need your body, baby  
From dusk till dawn  
You don't need experience  
To turn me out  
You just leave it all up to me  
I'll show you what it's all about  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss  
  
You got to not talk dirty, baby  
If you wanna impress me  
You can't be too flirty, mama  
I know how to undress me  
I want to be your fantasy  
Maybe, you could be mine  
You just leave it all up to me  
We could have a real good time  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss  
  
I think I'd better dance now  
  
Women, not girls, rule my world  
I said they rule my world  
Act your age woman, not your shoe size  
Maybe we could do the twirl?  
You don't have to watch Dynasty  
To have an attitude  
You just leave it all up to me  
My love will be your food  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign, I'm more compatible with,  
I just want your extra time and your kiss

'Cause of a lust for life  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
With my torture film  
Drive a G.T.O.  
Wear a uniform  
All on a government loan  
I'm worth a million in prizes  
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the  
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains  
With the liquor and drugs  
With the liquor and drugs  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before  
'Cause of a lust for life  
'Cause of a lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again  
With the liquor and drugs  
And the flesh machine  
He's gonna do another striptease  
Hey man where'd you get  
That lotion? Your skin starts  
Itching once you buy the gimmick  
About something called love  
Oh love love love  
That's like hypnotizing chickens  
Well I am just a modern guy  
Of course I've had it in the ear before

Want some whiskey in your water?  
Sugar in your tea?  
What's all these crazy questions they're askin' me?  
This is the craziest party that could ever be  
Don't turn on the lights 'cause I don't want to see  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
  
Open up the window, let some air into this room  
I think momma's chocking from the smell of stale perfume  
And the cigarette you're smoking about to scare me half to death  
Open up the window, let me catch my breath  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son, son, son"  
  
Some radio is blastin'  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend  
She just passed out on the floor  
I've seen so many things  
I ain't never seen before  
Don't know what it is  
I don't want to see no more  
  
Mama told me not to come  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me)  
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, no" (no, no)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mana told me, mama told me  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, no, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son" (Mama told me)  
  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mama told me, mama told me  
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"  
"That ain't the way to have fun" (oh no, no)

One bright and guiding light  
That taught me wrong from right  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Those baby tales she told  
Of pathways paved with gold  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul  
I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
God's gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mother's eyes  
I found in my mother's eyes  
  
Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul  
I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal  
  
God's gift sent from above  
One true unselfish love  
I found in my mother's eyes  
I found in my mother's eye

When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing  
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart  
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray  
My prayer is to linger with you  
  
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine  
My prayer is a rapture in blue with the world far away  
And your lips close to mine  
Tonight while our hearts are aglow  
  
Oh, Why don't you to tell me the words that I'm longing to know  
My prayer and the answer you give  
May they still be the same for as long as we live  
That you'll always be there  
At the end of my prayer

Now let me ask you something:  
Have you ever felt that you weren't responsible for the things that you do?  
When the girl that you are with is just too much  
She is so out of sight, baby, that all you can say is:  
Well, all right!  
  
I'm not responsible, not responsible  
For anything I do when I'm with you  
I'm not responsible, it's impossible  
To be so very near and not feel part of you  
You've got such a hold on me  
You make it seem so easy, but it's true, oh yeah  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too  
  
Whoa..oa, baby, all right  
  
I'm not responsible, not responsible  
When you can make a man do what you want him to  
I'm not responsible, it's impossible  
To be so very near and not know what to do  
You got such a hold on me  
You make it seem so easy but it's true, oh yeah  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too  
I get such a happy feeling  
Knowing that you feel the same way too  
Believe me baby, etc....

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City,  
And I dreamed about those cotton fields at home.  
I dreamed about my mother,  
Dear old papa, sister and brother,  
  
I dreamed about that girl  
Who's been waiting for so long.  
I wanna go home, I wanna go home,  
Oh, how I wanna go home!  
  
Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City.  
From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine.  
But by day, I make the cars,  
And by night I make the bars,  
If only they could read between the lines!  
  
[Spoken]  
  
You know,  
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City.  
After all these years,  
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.  
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride,  
Put on a south bound freight and ride,  
Goin' back to the love ones,  
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.  
  
I wanna go home, I wanna go home,  
Oh, how I want to go home.

Why do I go on fooling myself When I know you love somebody else?  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
I pretend I don't see you walking with him on the street  
Only a fool breaks his own heart  
  
I have to admit even though it hurt me so I can't forget  
If I'm a man, I'll let you go  
There's no sense in holding on to an old love that's gone  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart  
  
I have to accept even though it hurt me so I can't forget  
If I'm a man, I'll let you go  
There's no sense in holding on to an old love that's gone  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart  
Only a fool, breaks his own heart

Only in America  
Can a guy from anywhere  
Go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire  
  
Only in America  
Can a kid without a cent  
Get a break and maybe grow up to be President  
  
Only in America  
Land of opportunity, yeah  
Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me  
  
Only in America  
Can a kid who's washin' cars  
Take a giant step and reach right up and touch the stars  
  
Only in America  
Could a dream like this come true  
Could a guy like me start with nothing and end up with you  
  
Only in America  
Land of opportunity, yeah  
Would a classy girl like you fall for a poor boy like me  
  
Only in America (poor boy like me)  
Only in America (only in America)  
Only in America (only in America)  
Only in America (only in America)  
Only in America (only in America)  
Only in America  

He always runs while others walk  
He acts while other men just talk.  
He looks at this world, and wants it all,  
So he strikes, like thunderball.  
He knows the meaning of success.  
His needs are more, so he gives less.  
They call him the winner who takes all.  
And he strikes, like thunderball.  
  
Any woman he wants, he'll get.  
He will break any heart without regret.  
His days of asking are all gone.  
His fight goes on and on and on.  
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all.  
So he strikes like thunderball  

Summer's gone  
It could not stay  
It ran it's path  
It's yesterday  
  
Like a moment's fire  
That lost it's burn  
It fade it fast  
And wont return  
  
[Chorus]  
So I walk on  
And make my memories  
And hope is not gone  
Because I still believe  
There's a reason for passing time  
These are the seasons of my life  
  
I've long for spring  
And the winter's cold  
I felt the sing  
Of the unknown  
My frozen heart  
Held me bound  
Until the time  
It turn around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There more I live  
Then more I grows  
No more than this is  
Is all I know  
For time as run  
But I don't mind  
For life's begone  
Once more inside  
  
[Chorus]

I forgot how much it hurts, to see you cry  
And just how inconsistent the world seems when you smile  
There was a little kiss in the back of the car  
Looking right at me, his eyes spells with the stars  
I felt so happy and so true  
In that moment he remind me of you  
  
I've seen that face looking back at me  
It's like a mirror reflecting everything  
A faded distant memory  
Pulling at my heart  
  
I wanna to protect to you, from any pain  
Keep you close to me, so you will always feel safe  
You know how much I love you, my sweet precious child  
I would do anything, I'll walk trough fire  
I see part of me in you,  
And when you look at me it all come shinning trough

Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion  
Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
If you see me comin', better step aside  
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died  
One fist of iron, the other of steel  
If the right one don't a-get you  
Then the left one will  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store

Sometimes we know, sometimes we don't  
Sometimes we give, sometimes we won't  
Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're wrong  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes it's bad when the going gets tough  
When we look in the mirror and we want to give up  
Sometimes we don't even think we'll try  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Well we're gonna have to sit down and think it through  
If we're only human what more can we do  
The only thing to do is eat humble pie  
Sometimes we cry  
  
'Fore they put me in a jacket, and they take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we can't see anything straight  
Sometimes everybody is on the make  
Sometimes it's lonely on the lost highway  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Gonna put me in a jacket, and take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry

Blue Spanish eyes,  
teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes Please,  
please don't cry, this is just "adios" and not "goodbye"  
Soon I'll return bringing you all the love your heart can hold

If you could see me here this way  
Looking backwards from today  
Would you do it all again  
  
If I could roll it back to you  
Just like lovers always do  
I'm stoned in love but not with you  
  
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love  
It's how I'm feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
We're not feeling stoned in love  
  
If we could wash the past away  
Would we go our separate ways  
I'll do it all again, as if I care  
  
Is this the way it's meant to be  
Stoned in love but not with me  
You're stoned in love in love me  
  
Good luck, cause we're not feeling stoned in love  
It's how I'm feeling now  
I feel the love is made of stone  
We're not feeling stoned in love

We're not feeling stoned in love  
  
Stoned in love  
Stoned in love but not with you  
As if I care

I've got male intuition  
I've got sexual ambition  
I'm the last great tradition  
Let me state my position  
  
The older I get  
The better I was  
It's all just a show  
It's all just because  
The show must go on  
What else can it do?  
I'm gonna drop the load on you  
  
Sugar, sugar daddy, Sugar  
  
I got no inhibition  
I got all the ammunition  
Got the moves with position  
Can't you see my condition?  
  
You gotta get your hands dirty  
When you're digging a ditch  
And, gods  
Revenge on the rich  
  
Got the money got the moves  
Got the looks and the brakes  
Got the shirt got the shoes  
Got what it takes  
  
You've got to lay it down  
Tell me what you need  
You've got to lay it down  
Get up, up from your feet you know  
I get it down  
You wanted sorrow, want it sweet  
Daddy always gives you what is good for you  
  
Sugar, sugar daddy, Sugar  
  
I've got male intuition  
It's a desperate condition  
Nearly out of ammunition  
Sexual ambition  
  
Whoa!  
Holy schmoly

Yeah, a one man mob  
Woo-hoo  
I'm the McDaddy  
You don't send a boy to do a man's job  
  
And you make me feel  
Like I'm not alone  
I've been singing this song  
Since before you were born  
Baby, you're invited  
But your friend can't come  
He's a little too excited  
Maybe a little too young  
  
Ah baby, you're invited  
But your friend can't come  
He's a little too rich  
Maybe a little too young  
The show must go on  
What else can it do?  
I'm gonna drop it all on you  
  
Sugar, sugar daddy  
Sugar, sugar daddy  
Sugar, sugar daddy  
Sugar, sugar daddy

In the summertime  
The taxman's taken all my dough  
And left me in my stately home  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
And I can't sail my yacht  
  
He's taken everything I've got  
All I've got's this sunny afternoon  
Save me, from this squeeze  
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me  
And I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
In the summertime  
In the summertime (everything seems fine)  
  
My girlfriend's gone off with my car  
And gone back to her ma and pa  
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty  
And now I'm sitting here  
Sipping on my ice cold beer  
  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
Help me, sail away  
Give me two good reasons why I ought to stay  
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
Everything is fine because it's the summertime  
  
In the summertime  
(I don't care about a doggone thing)  
In the summertime  
(I'm broke, I've skint, but it's the summertime)  
In the summertime  
(even though I ain't got a dime, in the summertime, I don't have a dime)  
In the summertime  
(I just got this ice cold beer, everything seems fine)  
In the summertime  
(Nothing seems to matter)

I don' know why I love her like I do  
All the changes you put me through  
Take my money, my cigarettes  
I haven' seen the worst of it yet  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river, drop me in the water  
Take me to the river, dip me in the water  
I don' know why you treat me so bad  
Think of all the things we could have had  
Love is an ocean that I can't forget  
My sweet sixteen I would never regret  
  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river, drop me in the water  
Push me in the river, dip me in the water  
Washing me down, washing me  
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me  
Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't take no more of it  
  
I don' know why I love you like I do  
All the troubles you put me through  
Sixteen candles there on my wall  
And here am I the biggest fool of them all  
  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river and drop me in the water  
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water

Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed  
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said  
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies  
Except for the few that were there in your eyes  
  
Dear, as I held you close in my arms  
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms  
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low  
"Darling, I love you so"  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time  
  
Darling, I love you so  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the moon deserts the sky  
Till the all the seas run dry  
Till then I'll worship you  
Till the tropic sun turns cold  
Till this young world grows old  
My darling, I'll adore you  
  
You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the rivers flow upstream  
Till lovers cease to dream.  
'Til then I'm yours, be mine

Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
Wishing for something  
Other than love  
Wishing that I had  
Never known love  
Wishing I could forget  
  
Wishing that I have  
Never tasted  
Kisses that suddenly  
Are wasted  
Wishing I could forget you  
Wishing we've never met  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
If I could stop  
The willow weeping  
If I could stop  
The sun from sleeping  
Then I could stop  
The shadows creeping  
Over my love for you  
Guess I'm still  
Missing you  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you

I used to think that life was sweet  
I used to think it was so complete  
I can't believe you, you've thrown it away  
I used to think we had it made  
I used to feel we would sail away  
Can you just imagine how I feel today  
Well, it seems a long time ago  
You were the lonely one  
Now it comes to letting go  
And you're the only one  
Do you know what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It really doesn't matter to me  
I guess your leaving was meant to be  
It's down to you now  
You want to be free  
Well, I hope you know which way to go  
You're on your own again  
Don't come running to me when you're the lonely one  
Remember what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny how we don't talk ..... anymore.......

Lonely am I  
Only my thoughts crowd the room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Time passes me by  
The cold touch of dawn tells me so  
Still, I can' t cry  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
Flames in the fire  
Can't warm the chill of my room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Feel I want to die  
Just how much more can I take  
If I can't cry?  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
I multiply all of the hours you've been gone  
Still, I can't cry  
Lonely am I  
Why can't I cry?

Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo-doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh, of New Orleans  
Of New Orleans  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Strange as it now seems  
Of zombie voo-doo gris gris and  
The witch queen of New Orleans  
She lived in a world of magic  
Possessed by the devil's skew  
From a shack near the swamp lands  
Of mud pie brick  
Marie stirred her witches brew  
  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh, of New Orleans  
Of New Orleans  
  
Dime or a nickel any one could buy  
Voo-doo of any kind  
She had potions and lotions, herbs and tanna leaves  
Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew  
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes  
Though she'll never return all the Cajuns knew  
A witch queen never dies  
  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh  
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans  

I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair  
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah  
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
Without love I've had nothing  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
I have conquered the world  
All but one thing did I have  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me  
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no  
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see  
That a heart without love cannot live  
Without love I've had nothing  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
I have conquered the world  
All but one thing did I have  
Without love I've had nothing at all

Yesterday  
All my trouble seemed so far away  
Now it looks as though they're here to stay  
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
  
Suddenly  
I'm not half the man I used to be  
There's a shadow hanging over me  
Oh, yesterday came suddenly  
  
Why she had to go I don't know  
She wouldn't say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
  
Why she had to go  
  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Baby take off your coat, real slow  
Baby take off your shoes  
I'll help you take off your shoes  
Baby, take off your dress, yes yes yes  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
  
(You can leave your hat on)  
(You can leave your hat on)  
You can leave your hat on  
  
Go on over there turn on the light  
No, all the lights  
Come back here stand on that chair  
Ooh baby, that's right  
Raise your arms in the air  
Ooh ooh ooh, now shake 'em  
  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
  
(You can leave your hat on)  
You can leave your hat on baby  
(You can leave your hat on)  
  
Suspicious minds are talkin'  
They're tryin' to tear us apart  
(They don't believe in this love of mine)  
They don't know what love is  
(They don't know what love is)  
(They don't know what love is)  
(They don't know what love is)  
I know what love is  
  
(You can leave your hat on, leave it on)  
Tell me baby  
(You can leave your hat on)  
(Leave it on, leave it on baby)  
Gotta hear it again  
(You can leave your hat on)  
(yeah on, leave it on yeah)  
You can leave your hat on, yeah  

Well, well, well, seems like you pulls only yesterday  
When mama told me, don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way  
She was pretty and nice and I took her fast and passed her by  
Years have passed and moved like love's gonna give me a second try  
More than loved than you first tells me you understand  
Could it be your love life like mine, I need a girlfriend's hand  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(take it girl) I know it ain't fine and proper for a girl to talk this way  
But I can't cope with this loneliness not one more damned on day  
Everyday bringing up your clown to keeping my hopes of love  
Judging from your silence, boy you must be in the same boat  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
I can't begin to tell the many nights I set down lonely  
Come on, tell me girl, has it ever happened to you  
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me, it ain't no joke  
My love life is just like a sinking boat  
I can understand a person beeing without money  
You can show me the reason for a person to be without luck  
Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy (yes it's true)  
Come on naked and love and try (haha, yeah)  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
Finding true love is a dream everybody wants to come true  
Can't you see it's up to us to make this dream come true  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Well, well) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, yes it's so true  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well  
You need love too  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Hey, hey) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirrow, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true girl  
Well, I'm in love  
I need love  
And I need you  
And I need you toooo.....au

You're my world--you're every breath I take  
You're my world--you're every move I make  
Other eyes see the stars up in the sky  
But for me they shine within your eyes  
  
As the trees reach for the sun above  
So my arms reach out to you for love  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
You're my world--you are my night and day  
You're my world--you're every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
You're my world--you are my night and day  
You're my world--you're every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
End of my world  
End of my world  
End of my world for me

When you're down and troubled  
And you need a helping hand  
And nothing, nothing is going right  
Close your eyes and think of me  
And soon I will be there  
To brighten up even your darkest night  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
You've got a friend  
  
If the sky above you  
Grows dark and full of clouds  
And that old north wind begins to blow  
Keep you head together  
And call my name out loud  
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
  
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend  
When people can be so cold  
They'll hurt you, and desert you  
And take your soul if you let them  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
You've got a friend  
You've got a friend  
  
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend  
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
