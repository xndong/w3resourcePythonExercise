Maybe we forced the deal, delivered some kind of blow  
Maybe we broke the seal, cracks began to show  
Maybe we crossed the line, got everything off the ground  
Maybe we lit the fuse, a habit hard to lose  
  
All I can remember, all I can recall is you  
Telling me there's been an accident  
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence  
  
Maybe we ran the lights, somehow we caused the scene  
Maybe we learned to fight, as part of a routine  
Maybe we jumped the wall, suddenly tipped the scale  
Maybe we tried too hard, so afraid to fail  
  
All I can remember, all I can recall is you  
Telling me there's been an accident  
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence  
  
Something's lost, for what it's worth  
You and me, this is our church  
There is still some love 'round here  
  
All I can remember, all I can recall is you  
Telling me there's been an accident  
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence

You'd think by now I've learned to fake it  
You'd think by now I'd find my peace  
And there's no risk for me worth taking  
You'd think that I'd go quietly  
But the journey's still on for my America  
  
You'd think by now I'd take the easy way  
And be content with what I've seen  
You'd think by now I'd get it in to my head  
I'm the same boy I have always been  
So the journey's still on for my America  
  
You'd think by now I'd be to jaded  
To feel what love can do  
You'd think by now that I've done everything I can  
In finally reaching you  
  
But the journey's still on for my America

I take the picture  
A picture in my hands  
We have everything  
All the good times that we have  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was bright  
We had love  
But there's nothing sacred  
Sacred anymore  
That's why I need your lovin'  
Oh just like I did before  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was bright  
We had love  
So by the light in the morning  
I'm gonna make my way  
Not a way not a warning  
To be a harder way  
So by the light in the morning  
That's where I'll be  
Oh darling darling darling  
Just blame it on me  
I'll be searching  
Time to time again  
Since I lost your lovin'  
It has never been the same  
There was a time in our lifes  
When everything was right  
We had love  
So by the light in the morning  
I gonna make my way  
Not a word, not a warning  
To be a harder way  
Just by the light in the morning  
That's where I'll be  
Oh darling, darling, darling  
Just blame it on me  
Blame it on me  
So by the light in the morning  
I gonna make my way  
Not a word, not a warning  
To steal your heart away  
Just by the light in the morning...

It's curtain call  
Guess you can't outrun  
All the truth  
  
We've staggered on  
With broken parts  
Like you do  
  
But it's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
Well, I'd take them back  
Those early years  
Oh anytime  
  
As we make our beds  
We get to shine  
Once in a while  
  
But it's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
It's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs along the way  
Thank you for coming along  
Bring it all home  
Thank you for coming along  
Let's bring it all home

When lights go down, I see no reason  
For you to cry. We've been through this before  
In every time, in every season,  
God knows I've tried  
So please don't ask for more.  
  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
This might be our last goodbye  
  
Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend  
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again  
  
I read your mind, with no intentions  
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain  
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience  
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.

They lived in peace, not long ago  
A mighty Indian tribe  
But the winds of change,  
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
The white man's greed, in search of gold  
Made the nation bleed  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.  
  
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.  
  
They were driven hard, across the plains  
And walked for many moons  
Cause the winds of change,  
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.  
  
So much to bear, all that pain  
Left them in despair  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn.  

You look out that window  
For someone you know  
But it all looks the same and time and again  
It hurts you so  
You wonder if always  
You'll stand on your own  
But hear in your mind, you'll get through this time  
You're not alone  
  
When time seems so lonely  
And your day seems too long  
You wonder if you will ever get through  
And still be strong  
With eyes full of sadness  
You stand on your own  
It tears you apart, but you know in your heart  
You're not alone  
  
Coast to coast and land to land  
We're together hand in hand  
Coast to coast and land to land...  

Hey girl I can feel your heart  
We had something goin' on right from the start  
When I look at you I just feel so good  
Hear the music breakin' up the ground  
Can you feel it I just love the sound  
And I'm lettin' go just like I should  
There's something goin' on that's so hard to describe  
Well, I can dance the night away  
There's nothin' else that I want to do  
I can dance the night away  
There's no one else that I want but you  
Tomorrow never gets in my way  
When I feel like dancin' night and day  
I just want to get up and never ever get down  
Seems to me I won't get old  
And my heart will never ever get cold  
It's so hard to feel bad when you're around  

Today, I'm the dirt beneath your feet  
At your beckon call  
Today, I'm down on my bended knees  
I learn to crawl  
  
Days like these  
It's like I never lived at all  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Today, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Today, the Devil sings the blues  
  
Tonight, angels' presence fill the room  
So, this is how it feels  
Tonight, the Devil takes the long way round  
There will be no deal  
  
Times like these  
It's like I never lived at all  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Tonight, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Tonight, the Devil sings the blues  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Tonight, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Tonight, the Devil sings the blues

I've been making some enemies  
I've been taking some liberties  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
I've been running right or wrong  
Always running right or wrong  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
Oh my Lord  
My sweet Lord  
What have you done  
Are you ever  
Are you ever  
Are you ever gonna take me home  
  
I've been making some enemies  
I've been taking some liberties  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
Just living my life  
It's been a hell of a ride  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always, always, always in the doghouse

He is down by the riverside  
Late one night  
He's tryin' to count the stars  
In each of the signs  
All alone by the riverside  
  
And time passes by  
Gathering thoughts of the past  
And maybe he'll cry  
  
So they say he's a madman  
And he don't understand  
But I know that he's tryin' hard  
To act like a man  
All those years he has suffered,  
My friends  
  
All those years of pain  
But I don't think he knows for sure  
If those years were in vain  
He's a dreamer  
  
And he's fightin' for his life  
He's tryin' to understand  
He's a dreamer  
  
But he wants to carry on  
Yet I know he's a lonely man

The pressure is mounting,  
I'm ready and countin'  
There's something I've got to be  
  
I'm fearless, I'm feeling  
Scared senseless, who needs this,  
Still something I've got to be  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
My heart's racing, my legs shakin',  
Is more drama in the making  
I had a feeling this day would come  
  
So are we really good or just delirious,  
But if you stop us now it could get serious  
I'm sorry, mama, for what I've become  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
You can turn it off, but it never stops,  
Madness or not, I risk everything I've got  
And if I've got to do it all over again  
I'd still believe in these friends  
And the mess they get me in  
  
There is no going back, this is what we know  
We come to entertain, asking you to follow  
Be born to self-destruct, here it comes again  
A desire to go down in flames  
  
Flames flames

A voice that fly is broken just the same  
You spin this life around  
You bring me where some heart and soul remain  
From a cold cold place in time (and you sing)  
  
I just know how you make me feel  
You take it all the way  
You send me all the way  
Oh I just know where I want to be  
Forever wandering forever traveling  
  
A voice that cry but I'm smiling just the same  
You show me where to look  
Just skin and bones just circling the sun  
One glimpse was all it took (and you sang)  
  
I just know how you make me feel  
You take it all the way  
You send me all the way  
Oh I just know where I want to be  
Forever wandering forever traveling  
  
Somewhere in my mind I'm under the golden gate  
Somewhere in my heart I'm in the city by the bay  
Sometimes I can feel the wheel in the sky it's still turning

The race is on  
I found my way  
Something has changed since I've been away  
The fear is gone  
And I can't wait  
I feel the rut, still got dues to pay  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
  
Full speed ahead  
I waste no time  
Now I know how to live my life  
I've been knocked down - come back around  
It put some soul in this heart of mine  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
  
I get the feelin'  
I can go that extra mile  
I get the feelin'  
I can reach that open sky  
I get the feelin'  
Things will never be the same  
I get the feelin'  
That I can win again!  
  
Well I had enough  
Gonna stand up straight  
Rebuild my life  
Well you gotta have faith  
And it will be tough  
Gonna fight each day  
'Til I'm back on top  
Well you gotta have faith  
Well you gotta have faith  
Well you gotta have faith

I've told you once and I've told you twice  
Wait for that day, when our love will rise  
To that song that brought our hearts together.  
  
Even though you're mistreating me  
I know the girl that you used to be  
For me those days were meant to last forever.  
  
Time after time I'm wondering why  
Am I to be all alone  
Day after day I pray that you'll stay  
Cause you've got a heart of stone.  
  
I walk the streets like a broken man  
Oh I wish that you would understand  
Even though you're still the one I wait for.  
  
I guess in love there's no guarantee  
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be  
Even though you're still the one I care for.  

Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
  
As I walk down this dusty road  
My heart weights down like a heavy load  
My spirit finds its way across the ocean  
  
And my soul cries out for leaving now  
I have got to get back home somehow  
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried  
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
I see tomorrow in a different light  
This long and lonely night  
  
I've got a weary head and worn out shoes  
A bottle of rum and as I sing the blues  
The bitter wind sends shivers down my spine  
  
I'm a ramblin' man with a ramblin' mind  
I left my loved ones far behind  
She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried  
Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
This long and lonely night  
  
Oh bless my soul, what have I done  
I'm bound to face this world alone  
A drifter I was meant to be  
With no one there for company  
But if one day down there road I can,  
Would you look my way  
Would you take me back again  
  
Here comes the night  
It's gonna be a long and lonely night  
Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright  
This long and lonely night  
  
As my souls cries out for leaving

It's not like I wouldn't dream  
If you had not shown the way  
It's not like I wouldn't fight  
Not knowing 'bout your life  
It's not like I wouldn't stand  
Right here with my friends  
  
You threw us all alive  
When our days slipped away  
You gave us of your time  
  
'Cause you are my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
And gave me something  
To hold on to  
When i was growing up  
You were the rock  
In my life  
  
It's not like I live my days  
By every word you spoke  
Like I'm up every night  
Drinking with your ghost  
It's not like I can't look back  
Without movin' on  
  
You threw us all alive  
When our days slipped away  
You gave us of your time  
  
You are my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
And gave us kiss  
A chance to dream  
Days when I had enough  
You were the rock  
In my life  
  
You still throw me that like  
As my days slip away  
You give me of your time  
  
You're still my hero  
My Friday night  
You wrote the soundtrack to my life  
You give me something  
To hold on to  
As I'm still growing up  
You are the rock  
In my life

Live, baby life is loud  
We'll make it through the filth and the glory  
Give, more of what you've got  
Funk it up and tell your story  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all  
  
Time, there's no remedy  
Just hold our broken hearts together  
Your touch, all that chemistry  
Now I'm lost, unlikely defender  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all  
  
It's alright, when the day is done  
It's alright, there's something better  
It's alright, when the morning comes  
It's alright, there's nothing better  
  
For every dream that got away  
We found our ordinary day  
For every blue sky turning gray  
We found imaginary ways  
I look at you and where we are  
We're human after all

So many tears ago the people on this earth  
They were laughin'  
They didn't think of anything else  
Than love and peace  
But generations failed to see  
That they were causin'  
Trouble for the future  
They didn't know that one single war  
  
Would continue to increase  
But I'll be beside you  
'Cause I want to hide you  
  
I'll cover my pain  
Or I'll gone insane  
Oh Lord where will it end  
When tomorrow is done  
Oh Lord can we stop to pretend  
That we can survive in the future to come  
  
As long as you can see  
As long as you can feel  
There's no cause for alarm  
As long as you can touch  
As long as you can more  
  
It ain't too bad  
But one day or another  
This world would maybe  
Be destroyed forever  
A holocaust maybe be spread  
And drive us all mad

I can walk on fire, it ain't stoppin' me  
It's just showin' me the way  
Come thunder, lightning all over me  
I'd still be on my way  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
It's just the beginnin' and not the end  
No use in pretendin' cause you can't win  
It's just a beginnin', the beginnin'  
Not the end  
  
It's not a strange behavior, it's the way I am  
Nothin' puts me down  
And if a situation would get out of hand  
I'd still be back around  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But never bring me down  
  
It's just the beginnin' and not the end...  
I can walk on fire, it ain't stoppin' me...  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
  
It's just the beginnin', and not the end...

I'm calling out tonight.  
I wanna feel his might  
And I won't be quiet.  
  
Cause I've seen the truth  
Wanna fight for you.  
And we just can't buy it.  
  
This is your life.  
Are you gonna stand by.  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing and walk away.  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me.  
  
Are you still not there.  
The ones who really care.  
Who's open minded.  
  
This is your life.  
Are you gonna stand by  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing  
And walk away.  
  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me.  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing  
And walk away.  
  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
To night  
Come with me.

My mother would tell me  
Better stay in line  
You gotta look for the magic  
If there's a way there comes a time  
  
My dad used to tell me  
You gotta work real hard  
Keep it straight and simple  
From the head, then the heart  
  
If you'd ask my brother  
I know what he'd say  
Let the children play  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need a line to get us there  
  
My sister would show me  
To land on your feet  
You gotta suffer fools  
Before you get the life and need  
  
So God would you tell me  
Is there another way?  
Let the children play  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line to get us there  
  
My mother would tell me  
Better stay in line  
You gotta look for the magic  
If there's a way there comes a time  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line  
  
It's not where we're coming from  
It's how we turn from here  
We know where we want to go  
We just need the line to get us there

You say that you want me  
I hope that you do  
Cause tell me just where I would be in this world  
Without someone like you  
  
When you say that you need me  
Like only you can  
Oh baby you don't really know what you've done  
To the heart of this man  
  
So baby tonight we will celebrate  
And talk of the times til it gets real late  
Yes baby tonight we'll appreciate  
Just what we've got  
So let the good times rock  
  
Oh when you squeeze me  
And say that you care  
There's nothin' I know that could drag me away  
When that feelin' is there  
  
Oh the way that you move me  
And makin' me feel  
Well I could have sworn that I lived in a dream  
If it wasn't for real  
  
Oh baby tonight we will celebrate...  

One night she came, in from the cold  
Like a long lost friend, someone to hold  
She said, don't ask me now  
Cause what's in a name  
But when I'm gone you'll never be the same  
  
So won't you hold me now  
Can't you see what I came here for  
Save me now, cause I now  
We'll keep on headin' through  
Lights and shadows  
We're talkin' lights and shadows  
  
She came from far, with so much to tell  
Cause when you're lookin' for love  
You can walk through hell  
Just like a ricochet, she might come and go  
And one look can say more than you'll ever know  
  
So won't you hold me now...  
  
Oh lights and shadows  
We're talkin' lights and shadows  
  
So won't you hold me now...  
  
Oh lights and shadows...  
  
We keep on headin' through  
Lights and shadows  

Driving home I saw her on the street  
Her dress so tight, yeah she looked so neat  
All the boys as they were passing by  
They tried to catch that little girls eye  
I said to myself, don't it seem like a crime  
To think that little girl used to be mine.  
They call her little sinner (little sinner)  
Cause they can see, she's got the devil in her  
Little sinner (call her little sinner)  
There's nothin that I wouldn't do  
To have a little sinner like you.  
It's comin back to me, the times we had  
How could something so good, ever get so bad  
Yeah, me and Jimmy we got drunk that night,  
God knows baby, I didn't do you right.  
They say you haven't loved until you've lost  
I'll get you back no matter what the cost  
They call her little sinner (little sinner)...  
Wild, wild days and wild, wild nights  
I stood up for you baby, and you were worth the fight  
Didn't care about tomorrow...  
Cheap red wine, we couldn't get much higher  
So reckless and young, full of lust and desire  
How could I waste it, I want you so bad I can taste it.  
Hey, don't it seem like a crime  
To think she used to be mine

We're gonna rock so hard, we're gonna let it go  
If ya want it loud, hey let me know  
It's been a while since we've been gone  
We had it tough, now the hurt is gone  
Well, when the day is done, when the day is through  
Listen close this is what we'll do  
Comin' down like a ton of lead,  
Like a ton of lead that's what I said  
It's been a long time comin'...  
Hey, you can tear us up, tear us down  
Before too long we'll be back around  
Fallin' in, fallin' out  
Well this time around there ain't no doubt  
We'll walk on through the break of day  
Once again we'll be on our way  
Ain't no time to wonder why  
Just try to keep the drive alive  
It's been a long time comin'...

Someone's at your door tonight  
Someone wants your love  
Is it real or just imagination  
You decide to wait inside 'til the break of dawn  
In dreams you see yourself seeking affection.  
  
He'll know just who you are  
He'll know just where you've been  
He'll know just what to do.  
  
Love chaser - If you look deep in his eyes  
Then you're in for a big surprise  
He can take your breath away  
There's nothing you can do or say.  
  
You can feel that someone's at your back  
You can hear his pounding heart  
But something tells you not to be afraid  
Cause even in the darkest night  
Someone's at your side  
But when morning comes it all starts to fade away.  

It's glowing on the outside  
Coming by the moonlight  
Looking at this blue thing  
Falling by the waste time  
  
The years keep on calling  
Riding on a moonbeam  
Having on a daydream  
  
Crash the barricades, raise the alarm  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Looking at the bright side  
Walking in the sunshine  
Loving this blue thing  
Want it in my life  
  
The years keep on calling  
We headed for Venus  
No sign of life  
  
Crash the barricades, don't be afraid  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
  
Crash the barricades, raise the alarm  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need, oh  
  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer

I can tell just by the look in your eyes  
That the love is gone that I once took  
  
So much has changed in the way you live  
I bet there's nothing left that you could ever give  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess I'm not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
Oh yeah, you look as cold as ice  
  
It's in your blood  
It floats in your veins  
I've sacrificed myself  
But all I feel is pain  
You've done me wrong  
You've been so bad  
It's the last time a battle is lost  
When I'm the one who's sad  
  
The words of a madman have spoken  
I guess I'm not the only one  
The heart of a sad man is broken  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
You can fool anyone without disguise  
Eyes, lyin' eyes  
Oh yeah, you look as cold as ice  
  
I wish you'd die  
I wish you'd break down and cry  
I wish you'd move  
And then I know I'll be satisfied  
  
Can't you see, I'm on the edge  
I can't look down  
It is me who's lost and never found  

It's kind of crazy  
How we are slaves to an early grave  
So we get wasted  
To see clearer through the haze  
  
You gotta shake it off  
Get back up  
Show what you're made of  
Make your own luck  
  
And raise your heart above these streets  
Put some soul under your feet  
Take only what you need  
Raise your heart above these streets  
Mercy you mercy me  
  
It's kinda frightening  
To see how much this place has changed  
  
You gotta shake it off  
Get back up  
Show what you're made of  
Make your own luck  
  
And raise your heart above these streets  
Put some soul under your feet  
Take only what you need  
Raise your heart above these streets  
Mercy you mercy me  
  
Oh, get your head 'round what you need  
Oh, get your head 'round what you feel  
'Cause this is real

Now he walks in shadows  
He's tryin' to pretend she never walked away  
But it's not deceivin'  
He's closer to an end he never could foresee  
  
Where love goes  
When love dies, heaven knows  
  
But it's more than meets the eye  
So much more than just a last goodbye  
It's a cold and lonely heart  
So sad and torn apart  
Yes it's more than meets the eye  
  
Now he's in for trouble  
His luck has turned away, nobody seems to care  
Well there's a cold moon risin'  
And another lonely day has passed and she's not there  
  
Where love goes...  
  
But it's more than meets the eye...  

Another day you didn't go to school,  
You were in my arms breakin all the rules  
Another night without you by my side,  
This ain't the way to spend our lives  
Sometimes I wanna leave this town  
Find a better place where they won't put us down  
I know time is on our side, so I'm hangin on somehow  
Never gonna give you up  
Never gonna say goodbye  
As long as were together baby we'll survive  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna turn away  
Cause I don't wanna lose you  
Never gonna give you up  
People talk about us on the street  
Rumors fly everytime we meet  
But we don't never have to be ashamed  
Our love is real it ain't no game  
You say that we should hide away  
I promise baby we don't have to be afraid  
I know time is on our side, we've just gotta hang on somehow

Oh who took that shot  
Well I couldn't say, I was already down  
Oh who set me up  
Well I couldn't say cause I saw no one around  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation  
I had it all worked out  
Everything I hear is consolation  
I've got this feelin' you should never say die  
  
In my fantasy  
There were days to come that I wanted so bad  
Someone sold me out then it all was done  
That dream was all that I had  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...  
  
Oh who took that shot...  
  
Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...  

Tell me the story, tell me the legend  
Tell me the tales of war  
Tell me just one time,  
What it was like before  
Bring me the feeling, right in that moment  
When a heart for battle cries  
Find me the treasure where the legend lies.  
  
If I were a noble ancient knight  
I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight  
It will always feel the same  
When I call out your name.  
  
Ninja survive, in dreams I walk by your side  
Ninja survive, with you there's no need to hide.  
  
A handful of sayings are more than a reason  
For me to feel this way  
I'd like to be near you  
Maybe for just one day  
So tell me the legend, tell me the story  
Tell me the tales of war  
Tell me just one time  
What it was like before.  

Born in 1963  
In the shadow of Kennedy  
I'm still a kid when the levee breaks  
Man, oh man, that's all it takes  
  
And I'm on my way  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
But all I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Back in black and I'm 17  
I've been told, son, let it be  
I got these lines upon my face now  
A room at the heartbreak hotel  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh well, oh well  
Ah yeah  
  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
If you walk across those railroad tracks  
Son, you're on your own  
All I know is what I feel, and it can't be wrong  
Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done  
  
Oh well, oh well

Boy, you're not supposed to sing the blues  
  
Where you come from  
Where you come from  
It's just not done

Little Jeanie cried, she believed in all his lies  
So much for being good, oh.  
Johnny did not rest he did what he thought was best,  
He did the best he could.  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days.  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you'll have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky  
  
Now he's feeling bad  
His heart is cold it's oh so sad  
Somehow he did her wrong, yeaheah  
Little Jeanie's heart  
Is melting fast oh so fast.  
Now she feels so strong  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days.  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how you'll have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
Don't try to see the world in different ways  
Those moments and all those days  
Don't let them faint away...  
  
On Broken Wings

Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
On Broken Wings

Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...  
  
On Broken Wings  
I guess that's how.. how you have to fly  
Two broken hearts...  
Across the sky...

Running out on the streets  
He lives from day to day  
Looking for something to do  
He needs to get away.  
  
Hoping that maybe one day  
He could be someone  
Praying that maybe someday  
He could be number one.  
  
In his world of make believe  
He always tends to be  
  
On the loose, so young, so tough, so wild  
  
On the loose, again.  
  
Dreaming, dreaming about  
All the things he'd like to do  
Trying, trying so hard  
To make it all up to you.  

Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow  
I don't know just what to do  
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow  
Everything depends on you  
  
I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door  
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before  
  
Open your heart and tell me what's wrong  
Why can't you talk like you used to do before  
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong  
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore  
  
I've been waiting...  
  
Open your heart, let me hear you  
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call  
Open your heart, want to come near you  
Make up your mind, oh girl, before I fall  
  
Maybe the sun will continue to shine  
Maybe the rain will continue to fall  
Maybe you want to leave me behind  
Maybe you'll change and give me a call  

Lay your hand upon my shoulder say something  
That I want to hear  
Time will wash out every trace of sadness  
If only you are near  
I've tried so hard just to be somebody  
But now I'm found  
And we can be together  
And travel far away  
And we can love forever  
In some old paradize bay  
Carry me oh bring me out of fantasy  
And tell me this is real  
Tell me that you won't give up  
And tell me it's a good thing to feel  
The wind is carrying your voice  
The message is " don't ever walk away "  
And the only answer I can give to you  
Is that I'm always gonna stay

Lock the door, thin the light  
Here's the tale for you tonight  
Let me take you away  
Well, take my hand and follow me  
Mother Mary's child to be  
Well, I got something to say  
Rainbow warrior  
Shine on  
Rainbow warrior  
Sign your will across the sky  
Follow me 'til the day you die  
One for all and all for one  
Walking through the gates of dawn  
We've been waiting so long  
Children sent from near and far  
Come and see their newborn star  
See it shining so strong

And everybody will get to play  
The hand they're given  
And everybody will deserve  
The space they live in  
And everybody will get to feel  
Some peace within  
And everybody will get  
Someone to talk with  
  
'Cause there must be a reason  
Why you're keeping me alive  
On broken days like this  
There must be a reason  
A hope that God exist  
  
And everybody will lead a life  
They feel will matter  
And everybody will know such a simple thing  
Like laughter  
  
'Cause there must be a reason  
Why you're keeping me alive  
On broken days like this  
There must be a reason  
A hope that God exist  
  
After all the fear is gone  
There's place where everybody goes  
After all the feelings show  
There's a secret everybody knows  
After all the fear is gone  
There's place where everybody goes  
After all the feelings show  
There's a secret everybody knows

I've gone through changes  
I've gone through pain  
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane  
I know the feeling, when it grows  
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.  
  
You know it ain't easy  
Running out of thrills  
You know it ain't easy  
When you don't know what you want.  
  
Rock now, rock the night  
'Til early in the morning light  
Rock now, rock the night  
You'd better believe it's right.  
  
I know my limit  
Just what it takes  
When things ain't good enough  
I just pull the brake  
Sometimes it's easy  
Sometimes so tough  
But just have one thing clear  
I can't get enough.  

When you feel out of place let me revolve around you  
When your light fades I have the strength to find you  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
When the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
When you're so sorry and don't know why  
It came to be a sad time in your life I roll with you we'll get you through  
  
When you shut your eyes I'll show the images you're missing  
When you've heard enough through me you can listen  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
And the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
And when you're crawling through all the hurt  
And you can't find a real friend in this world I roll with you  
We'll get you through  
  
When you feel out place  
Let me revolve around you

I won't live to see tomorrow  
There won't be another prayer  
None of them will ever sorrow  
Those who've sentenced me to death  
  
I've been waiting here for ages  
For the hangman to appear (the hangman to appear)  
Soon the priest will read some pages  
From the Bible for my fear  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
Oh no  
  
I feel like screaming out my anger  
There is so much left here to do  
When it happened I was younger  
And my destiny was you  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
  
And what can I do about leaving you  
We were only halfway through  
And what can I say, there was no other way  
They wouldn't let me stay

Don't misunderstand me I was just a little kid  
Thinking that the street life was the only way to live  
Always holding out for another thrill  
  
We've come a long long way  
So tell me why can't we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why can't we settle for love before it's too late  
  
Whatever it is you think you're missing  
Time to let your heart go  
'Cause when you've walked this kind of distance  
We can't fool each other anymore  
Maybe there is a light that won't go out  
  
We've come a long long way  
So tell me why can't we settle for love  
Is it that hard at the end of the day  
Tell me why can't we settle for love before it's too late

Four hundred years back in this time  
Seven Doors Hotel  
A massacre took place and a young man died  
Opened one gate to Hell  
The Eibon is open use your eyes  
To read and learn  
In the end it could be your turn  
  
1981 traces were found  
That could not exist in one's mind  
A woman could lead you totally deceive you  
Without your knowing she's blind  
  
Seven Doors Hotel  
One of seven gates to Hell  
Seven Doors Hotel  
One of seven gates to Hell  
  
Do always watch out for things  
That you see but don't understand  
The Devil is there always somewhere  
Ready to command  

Thought you were ordinary  
Would not amount too much  
I guess they never knew you  
You found the place they couldn't touch  
  
Said you were nothing special  
Always kept to yourself  
You had to fight your own way  
There's always been touch too much at stake.  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
  
You'll never pass for someone  
Who'll find a place in life  
You'd sooner take that last breath  
To give away your heart and mind  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark  
  
What you gonna do?  
'Cause you're just like me  
What you gonna do?  
Tonight  
Tonight, this is where we go  
To find out who we really are  
We've got nothing left to lose  
Tonight, this is how we breathe  
To put some strength back in our hearts  
We've got nothing left to lose  
We start from the dark  
Start from the dark

I like to sit beside the fire  
When the light is going down  
I like to hear the wild wind blow outside my door  
I have so much left to remember  
I have so much left to forget  
And I know I just don't have to search for more  
But you want to change my world  
  
Stay out of my life  
Storm wind, you're just like a wind  
Comin' to drag me away  
Storm wind, what can I say  
I just don't want you to stay  
I like to walk around in dreams at night  
And play with kings and queens 'til the morning light  
I like to wake up in the morning unaware  
Of the fact that you are calling me  
To ask me if I want to be  
Someone who you could love and always care for

One thing I remember  
I was headed for the door  
Then I felt an anger  
Like never before  
I guess you had your reasons  
For makin up your lies  
But when I saw you later  
You had tears in your eyes  
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna make it all right now  
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna take it all the way  
Stranded, Stranded  
Though you left me standing there alone  
Stranded, Stranded  
I always will believe that life goes on  
The next thing I remember  
I pretended I was strong  
I asked you to surrender  
But the words came out wrong  
You know I feel mistreated  
Wounded deep within  
I'll never stand defeated  
No I'll never give in  
Nothin can stop me now

She stands in the doorway  
In the pale moon shine  
When she looks at me, every part of me,  
Brings my soul back to life  
  
Eyes like a rainbow  
They cut right through  
Oh I'm lost in time  
All through my mind  
I'm in love what can I do  
  
Sweet love child...  
  
I shiver, I shiver and shake  
It's been a long, long time  
When she touches me, every part of me  
Just comes back alive  
  
She rides like the wind  
On a summers night  
And she gives and takes  
In the love she makes  
Sweet Love Child  
  
She makes everything so right  
  
My sweet love child...  
  
By the light of the morning  
Like an angel's sigh  
I can feel her breath  
Lying next to me  
With the world locked outside  
  
I can feel  
A taste so sweet  
And she gives me love  
All the precious love  
It makes my life so complete  
  
So sweet

Can't keep me out forever  
'Cause now I'm back around  
Put your best defense

If you just let me in  
Well I remember better days  
With you by my side  
I'll keep you warm forever  
And if it takes all night

Long for the sailor, beneath the skies  
Long for the white dove, no matter where she flies  
Long for the stranger you know so well.  
  
Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad  
Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad  
Pray for the stranger you know so well.  
  
Cause I'm coming home.  
  
Now the time has come  
  
For me to come back home.  
  
Long for the eagle, on wings so strong  
Long for the hunter, he won't be long  
Long for the stranger you know so well.  

Will you be there beside me  
If the world falls apart  
And will all of out moments  
Remain in your heart  
Will you be there to guide me  
All the way through, I wonder will you  
  
Walk by my side, and follow my dreams  
And bear with my pride, as strong as it seems  
Will you be there tomorrow  
  
Will you be there beside me  
As time goes on by  
And be there to hold me  
Whenever I cry  
Will you be there to guide me  
All the way through, I wonder will you  
  
Walk by my side, and follow my dreams...  

All set ready to go, but little does he know  
He ain't comin' back no more  
All set ready to fly, into that deep blue sky  
Like so many times before  
  
Now the tower's callin', there's no reply  
And there's nothin' they can do  
Now the night is fallin' before they eyes  
Still no one's comin' through, callin'  
  
Somewhere out in time, God knows what's on his mind  
Is there a reason for his doubt  
Somehow unaware just like he didn't care  
There must be ways of gettin' out  
  
Not the tower's callin', there's no reply

Hey girl don't come to me and ask me for a helpin' hand  
'Cause by the way things seem to be, I would never ever understand  
When he comes to you, you always take him back  
Hey girl, just wait and see, you're bound to have a heartattack  
'Cause whenever you meet  
It always turns out the same  
You're treated bad again  
Treated bad again  
Hey girl why can't you learn that changes can be made  
'Cause when he comes to you, you got to turn and walk the other way  
Go out, hit the town, try to look for something new  
Go out, mess around, understand what you are going through  
'Cause whenever you meet  
It always turns out the same  
You're treated bad again  
Treated bad again  
So many nights  
My thoughts bring me to you  
I've seen him come and go  
And so many years  
You don't know I've been watching you  
But baby, baby  
Would something change if you knew  

Hello what keeps you going  
The way we're running through these years  
I guess they're showing  
  
I don't have no clever lines  
To explain my state of mind  
Well it doesn't matter  
It's just a while since I could feel  
This song is what I need  
Like a wake up wake up call  
  
Hello what made you come here  
You defy all kinds of logic  
When you don't stay clear  
  
I don't talk the way you do  
I guess you feel the same way too  
But it doesn't matter  
We meet somewhere in between  
This song and what we need  
Like a wake up wake up call  
  
We're just laying down this track  
Guess I'll have to call you back  
But it doesn't matter  
We'll connect again one day  
An the song will find it's way  
Like a wake up wake up call

[Verse 1]  
I am coming from the edge of madness  
A Northern mourns the world of men  
Gonna drive them into exile  
Or never let them breathe again  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
  
[Verse 2]  
In a land thrown into darkness  
An army would arise  
The heathens died laughing  
At the kings bent his bone high  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
  
[Chorus]  
On that night under the raging Northern sky  
The seeds of legend lie  
Swollen almost to a man  
The War of Kings began  
The War of Kings began  
The War of Kings began

Blood's been spilled throughout all times  
We should know better since we've been around  
There's been changes there's no denyin'  
But in what direction is good sense flying  
This world so endless blue  
Is better for lovers  
You cry 'cause you don't know if it's true  
If all those years've been wasted time  
Evil strikes, you feel the fear  
The vision of the future is no longer clear  
In your mind you see yourself  
Running and hiding you're somebody else  

You must be dreamin'  
Or going out of your mind  
There's no way of changin'  
The world over one night  
  
Baby you need to recover  
From all the things you've been through  
Baby you need to discover  
There ain't much to do but  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
The wings of tomorrow  
Ride, ride, ride  
To change the world  
  
You feel sorry for the nations of 1984  
And it cuts you like a razor  
Cause you've seen it all before  
  
You've seen one war after another  
So many lives on the line  
You must take care of one another  
Or reach the end of time  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
The wings of tomorrow  
Ride, ride, ride  
To change the world  

If you let me, I will  
Pick up the remains  
Of your day  
  
If you let me, I will  
Take a hold of your hand  
Tell you that you're sane  
  
You say, give me what you've got  
Give me, what you've got  
Show me what we're not  
Must be a plan for the every man  
Just give me what you can  
  
Cause I, wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know I can't believe in God  
Time to move ahead, yeah, yeah  
  
If you let me, I will  
I will soften the blow  
Of the forces that play  
  
If you let me, I will  
I will find some grace  
In the modern day  
  
You say, give me what you've got  
Give me, what you've got  
Show me what we're not  
Must be a plan for the every man  
Just give me what you can  
  
Cause I, wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know, I can't believe in God  
Time to move ahead  
  
Cause I, wish I could believe in God  
So I could move ahead  
I know, I can't believe in God  
Time to move ahead, yeah, yeah

So many words have passed through my mind  
Never thought I'd be so blind  
Wish I could understand you  
So many things I've heard and seen  
But still don't know what you mean  
  
When you say "I'm leaving you"  
I wish I could remember  
Everything I've learnt  
I've tried and tried to be so good  
And I know I should  
Say something before you go  
Cause every time I've done something wrong  
It's so hard to be strong  
  
Gone are the feelings I want to show  
(Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) teach me more  
(Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) so much more

Are there years between us?  
Have you seen me when I didn't see you?  
Its so good to know that someone can  
Love me as much as I think you do...  
Do I love you?  
Your a fool if you don't know  
Or maybe I'm so good at hiding  
Even the truth is hidden from you  
But somehow I doubt that your  
As smart as I could ever be  
But still my question remains  
Is our love meant to be?  
Cause it feels too good to be true  
Can someone love me so much more than I love myself  
Is this all true?  
Does love resonate in your heart  
Like the songs say it does?  
I can't even begin to believe my dreams  
When they actually come true...
