What good is a photograph of you  
Every time I look at it  
It makes me feel blue  
  
What use is a souvenir  
Of something we once had  
When all it ever does is  
Make me feel bad  
  
I wish I could tear it up  
But then again I haven't the guts  
I wish I could throw it on the fire  
I wish I could  
But to say I would  
I'd be a liar  
  
What good is a color print  
Of a little baby doll  
When just one little glance  
Is enough to make me feel dull  
  
I hoped I would misplace it  
But then I take such good care of it  
I wish it would disappear  
I say I wish  
But then I relish  
It being here

Fragile  
Like a baby in your arms  
Be gentle with me  
I'd never willingly  
Do you harm  
Apologies  
Are all you seem to get from me  
But just like a child  
You make me smile  
When you care for me  
And you know  
It's a question of lust  
It's a question of trust  
It's a question of not letting  
What we've built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Independence  
Is still important for us though (we realise)  
It's easy to make  
The stupid mistake  
Of letting go (do you know what I mean)  
My weaknesses  
You know each and every one (it frightens me)  
But I need to drink  
More than you seem to think  
Before I'm anyone's  
And you know  
It's a question of lust  
It's a question of trust  
It's a question of not letting  
What we've built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Kiss me goodbye  
When I'm on my own  
But you know that I'd  
Rather be home  
It's a question of lust

I've got to get to you first  
Before they do  
It's just a question of time  
Before they lay their hands on you  
And make you just like the rest  
I've got to get to you first  
It's just a question of time  
Well now you're only fifteen  
And you look good  
I'll take you under my wing  
Somebody should  
They've persuasive ways  
And you'll believe what they say  
It's just a question of time  
It's running out for you  
It won't be long until you'll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
I can see them now  
Hanging around  
To mess you up  
To strip you down  
And have their fun  
With my little one  
It's just a question of time  
It's running out for you  
It won't be long until you'll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
Sometimes I don't blame them  
For wanting you  
You look good  
And they need something to do  
Until I look at you  
And then I condemn them  
I know my kind  
What goes on in our minds  
It's just a question of time  
It should be better  
It's just a question of time  
It should be better with you  
It's just a question of time

I was there when you needed me most  
I was there when you wanted me least  
I was your father, your son,  
And your holy ghost and priest  
  
Through your failures and success  
Through your losses and gains  
I didn't see much happiness or pain  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't fill that hole  
Alone  
  
I saw you at your best  
I knew you at your worst  
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed  
  
There's a thin grey line  
Between the black and white  
It's evidently hard to find at night  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't play that role  
Alone  
  
Now it's too, too late for  
words That should have been said  
Long ago  
  
I was there when you needed me most  
I was there when you wanted me least  
I was your father, your son,  
And your holy ghost and priest  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't fill that hole  
Alone

The well is dry and the streams runs shallow  
The sun is high and the field lies fallow  
My tongue is tied and my body aching  
Now I'm opened wide and afraid of breaking  
  
The food is hot and the table's ready  
But the stomach knots make my hands unsteady  
So I take to pacing and up and down the room  
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's consumed  
  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
  
The bed is made and the candles burning  
All your games are played and the clock keeps turning  
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting  
And the dagger stick as the doors keep shutting  
  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
Always, always, always, always (forever)  
Always (forever), always (forever)  
Always (forever), always

Girl of sixteen  
Whole life ahead of her  
Slashed her wrists  
Bored with life  
Didn't succeed  
Thank the Lord  
For small mercies  
  
Fighting back the tears  
Mother reads the note again  
Sixteen candles burn in her mind  
She takes the blame  
It's always the same  
She goes down on her knees  
And prays  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
I don't want to start  
Any blasphemous rumors  
But I think that God's  
Got a sick sense of humor  
And when I die  
I expect to find Him laughing  
  
Girl of eighteen  
Fell in love with everything  
Found new life in Jesus Christ  
Hit by a car  
Ended up  
On a life support machine  
  
Summer's day  
As she passed away  
Birds were singing  
In the summer's sky  
Then came the rain  
And once again  
A tear fell  
From her mother's eye  
  
[Chorus x 5]

Put it on  
And don't say a word  
Put it on  
The one that I prefer  
Put it on  
And stand before my eyes  
Put it on  
Please don't question why  
Can you believe  
Something so simple  
Something so trivial  
Makes me a happy man  
Can't you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
You'll know what makes the world turn  
Put it on  
I can feel so much  
Put it on  
I don't need to touch  
Put it on  
Here before my eyes  
Put it on  
Because you realise  
And you believe  
Something so worthless  
Serves a purpose  
It makes me a happy man  
Can't you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
You'll know what makes the world turn  

You don't understand  
This is a demand  
And I think that I have to show you  
Try to look inside  
Take me for a ride  
In the day and the night  
Get to know you  
  
Boys meet boys get together  
Boys meet boys live forever  
Don't say no  
Boys say go  
  
I can run away  
If you never stay  
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow  
I'm not very sure  
When you close the door  
If the end is the same as tomorrow  
  
Boys!  
Boys!  
Boys say go!

I heard a rumor  
They travel far  
You know what it's like  
The way people are  
They talk and they talk  
Though they don't understand  
They'll whisper and whisper  
And lie on demand  
Please tell me now  
I want to know  
I have to hear it from your lips  
Say it's not so  
  
I heard it on Monday  
And I laughed a while  
I heard it on Tuesday  
I managed to smile  
I heard it on Wednesday  
My patience was tried  
I heard it on Thursday  
And I hurt inside  
I want to know  
The depths of your mind  
Tell me this whole thing is madness  
And we're doing fine  
Put your little hand in mine  
And believe in love  
Put your head on my chest  
And breathe love  
Breathe love  
Breathe love  
Breathe love  
  
I heard it from Peter  
Who heard it from Paul  
Who heard it from someone  
I don't know at all  
I heard it from Mary  
Who heard it from Ruth  
Who swore on the Bible  
She's telling the truth  
I heard it from Simon  
Who heard it from James  
Confirming with Sarah  
That I was to blame  
I heard it from Joseph  
Who heard it from John  
Who said with conviction  
That all hope was gone  
So I need to know  
Your alibis  
I need to hear that you love me  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye

Oh God, it's raining  
But I'm not complaining  
It's filling me up  
With new life  
  
The stars in the sky  
Bring tears to my eyes  
They're lighting my way  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
Just for a day  
On a day like today  
I'll get away from this  
Constant debauchery  
  
The wind in my hair  
Makes me so aware  
How good it is to live  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
But they're not like tonight  
  
Oh God, it's raining  
And I'm not containing  
My pleasure at being  
So wet  
  
Here on my own  
All on my own  
How good it feels to be alone  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
When my eyes have been so red  
I've been mistaken for dead  
But not tonight

Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Take a light  
Start the flame  
Play the game  
I am lost  
In your eyes  
Hypnotized  
Here I believe  
Dreams never deceive  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Life has no meaning  
  
Bodies move  
Colors change  
Girl, you're strange  
Here inside  
I'm at home  
I'm alive  
  
Don't be afraid  
I'm floating away  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose

[Chorus]  
Come back Come back to me  
I've been waiting here patiently  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way  
  
Weeks turn into months  
Months turn into years  
Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way  
  
Weeks turn into months  
Months turn into years  
Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Come back Come back to me

Maybe I'm still hurting  
I can't turn the other cheek  
But you know that I still love you  
It's just that I can't speak  
I looked for you in everyone  
And they called me on that too  
I lived alone but I was only  
Coming back to you  
Ah they're shutting down the factory now  
Just when all the bills are due  
And the fields they're under lock and key  
Though the rain and the sun come through  
And springtime starts but then it stops  
In the name of something new  
And all the senses rise against this  
Coming back to you  
And they're handing down my sentence now  
And I know what I must do  
Another mile of silence while I'm  
Coming back to you  
There are many in your life  
And many still to be  
Since you are a shining light  
There's many that you'll see  
But I have to deal with envy  
When you choose the precious few  
Who've left their pride on the other side of  
Coming back to you  
Even in your arms I know  
I'll never get it right  
Even when you bend  
To give me comfort in the night  
I've got to have your word on this  
Or none of it is true  
And all I've said was just instead of  
Coming back to you

Charms in limited supply  
And refusing to stretch  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow keeps pushing you  
Finding the right words  
Can be a problem  
How many times must it be said  
There's no plan  
It had to happen  
Got to move on sometime  
And it's about time  
By putting one foot in front on another  
And repeating the process  
Cross over the street  
You're free to change your mind  
Strength through diversity  
Couldn't have put it more plainly  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Charms in limited supply  
Under threat of extinction  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow motivates you  
Finding the right words  
Can be a problem  
How many times must it be said  
There's no plan  
It had to happen  
Got to move on sometime  
And it's about time  
By putting one foot in front on another  
And repeating the process  
Cross over the street  
You're free to change your mind  
Strength through diversity  
Couldn't have put it more plainly  
Got to move on sometime

I could corrupt you  
In a heart beat  
You think your so special  
Think your so sweet  
What are you trying don't even tempt me  
Soon you'll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be  
You'll be calling out my name  
When you need someone to blame  
  
I can corrupt you  
It would be easy  
Watching you suffer  
God, it would please me  
  
I wanna touch you with my little finger  
I know it will crush you my memory would linger  
You'd be crying out in pain  
Begging me to play my games  
  
I can corrupt you  
It will be ugly  
They could sedate you  
But what good would drugs be  
I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips  
It would be too much to  
Place my lips on your lips  
You'll be calling out my name  
Begging me to play my games

The things you do  
Aren't good for my health  
The moves you make  
You make for yourself  
The means you use  
Aren't meant to confuse  
Although they do  
They're the ones that I would choose  
  
And I wouldn't want it any other way  
You wouldn't let me anyway  
  
Dangerous  
The way you leave me wanting more  
Dangerous  
That's what I want you for  
Dangerous  
When I am in your arms  
Dangerous  
Know I will come to harm  
  
The lies you tell  
Aren't meant to deceive  
They're not there  
For me to believe  
I've heard  
Your vicious words  
You know by now  
It takes a lot to see me hurt  
  
And I couldn't take it any other way  
But there's a price I have to pay

Ooh, I've been dirt  
And I don't care  
Ooh, I've been dirt  
And I don't care  
  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
I'm the fire of life  
Yeah alright  
  
Ooh, I've been hurt  
And I don't care  
Ooh, I've been hurt  
And I don't care  
  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
'Cause I'm burning inside  
  
And do you feel it  
Said do you feel it when you touch me  
I said do you feel it when you touch me  
  
I'm a fire  
Well there's a fire  
Yeah, alright  
  
It's just a burning inside  
It's just a burning inside  
Said do you feel it  
Said do you feel it when you cut me  
Said do you feel it when you cut me  
  
There's a fire  
There's a fire  
A fire  
Inside  
  
It was just a dreaming

Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
As your bony fingers close around me  
Long and spindly  
Death becomes me  
Heaven, can you see what I see?  
  
Hey, you, pale and sickly child  
You're death and living reconciled  
Been walking home a crooked mile  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
There's no time for hesitating  
Pain is ready, pain is waiting  
Primed to do it's educating  
  
Unwanted, uninvited kin  
It creeps beneath your crawling skin  
It lives without, it lives within you  
  
Feel the fever coming  
You're shaking and twitching  
You can scratch all over  
But that won't stop you itching  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
Blame it on your karmic curse  
Oh, shame upon the universe  
It knows its lines  
It's well rehearsed  
  
It sucked you in, it dragged you down  
To where there is no hallowed ground  
Where holiness is never found  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on

She's dressed in black again  
And I'm falling down again  
Down to the floor again  
I'm begging for more again  
But oh what can you do  
When she's dressed in black  
  
My mind wanders endlessly  
On paths where she's leading me  
With games that she likes to play  
And words that she doesn't say  
Not when we're alone  
And she's dressed in black  
  
As a picture of herself  
She's a picture of the world  
A reflection of you  
A reflection of me  
And it's all there to see  
If you only give in  
To the fire within  
  
Dressed in black again  
  
Shadows fall onto me  
And she stands there over me  
And waits to encompass me  
I lay here helplessly  
But oh what can you do  
When she's dressed in black  
  
Dressed in black again

Words like violence  
Break the silence  
Come crashing in  
Into my little world  
Painful to me  
Pierce right through me  
Can't you understand  
Oh my little girl  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
They can only do harm  
Vows are spoken  
To be broken  
Feelings are intense  
Words are trivial  
Pleasures remain  
So does the pain  
Words are meaningless  
And forgettable  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
They can only do harm  
Enjoy the silence

I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
Oh what heartache  
Oh what heartbreak  
Following me  
Calling to me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness  
  
See what I've prayed  
Hear what loves sings  
Sad melodies  
Enticing me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness

I will have faith in man  
That is hard to understand  
Show some humility  
You have the ability  
Get right with me  
Friends, if you've lost your way  
You will find it again some day  
Come down from your pedestals  
And open your mouths that's all  
Get right with me  
Life is such a short thing  
That I cannot comprehend  
But if this life were a bought thing  
There are ways I know we'd mend  
People, take my advice  
Already told you once, once or twice  
Don't waste your energy  
Making apologies  
Get right with me  

There's more besides joyrides  
Little house in the countryside  
Understand, learn to demand,  
Compromise, sometimes lie  
Get the Balance right, get the balance right  
Be responsible, respectable,  
Stable but gullible  
Concerned and caring, help the helpless  
But always remain ultimately selfish  
Get the balance right, get the balance right  
You think you've got a hold of it all  
You haven't got a hold at all  
When you reach the top, get ready to drop  
Prepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall  
It's almost predictable  
Don't take this way, don't take that way  
Straight down the middle until next Thursday  
Push to the left, back to the right  
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right  
Get the balance right  

I'm the ghost in your house  
Calling your name  
My memory lingers  
You'll never be the same  
I'm the hole in your heart  
I'm the stain in your bed  
The phantom in your fingers  
The voices in your head  
  
One touch is all it took  
To draw you in  
To leave you hooked  
One kiss, you paid the price  
You had a taste  
Of paradise  
  
Now you're running in circles  
Chasing imaginary footsteps  
Reaching for shadows  
In the bed where I once slept  
  
I'm the ghost in your house  
Calling your name  
My memory lingers  
You'll never be the same  
I'm the hole in your heart  
I'm the stain in your bed  
The phantom in your fingers  
The voices in your head  
  
One thought is all it takes  
You lose control  
You make mistakes  
This pain will never leave  
Until I die  
You'll always grieve  
  
Now you're falling to pieces  
Seeing my face wherever you go  
Talking to strangers  
From a place they'll never know

So tired so soon  
What happened to you  
What happened to you  
You got lost  
Somewhere between  
There and here  
Somewhere between  
So far so near  
You got lost  
Somewhere between  
What happened to you  
Someone has been removed  
What happened to her  
What happened to her  
She got lost  
Somewhere between  
There and here  
Somewhere between  
So far so near  
She got lost  
Somewhere between  
What happened to her  
You used to be so young  
Used to be so young  
It was going to take so long  
It had almost gone  
What is his name  
What is his name  
What is his name  
What is his name

It was you that stripped my soul  
And threw it in the fire  
And tamed it in the rapture  
And filled me with desire  
  
Now I'm pure  
Now I'm clean  
I feel good and serene  
In you  
  
There is no denying  
How I have been changed  
You won't hear me crying  
Now misery is strange  
  
I can dream  
I can fly  
Now it seems I get by  
With you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again  
  
I was always looking  
Looking for someone  
Someone to stick my hook in  
And pull it out and run  
  
Now I'm caught on your line  
All my thoughts are entwined  
In you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again  
  
If you see me walking  
Through the golden gates  
Then turn around stop talking  
Stop and hesitate  
I'll be waiting up there  
With my fate in the air  
For you

Here, somewhere in the heart of me  
There is still a part of me  
That cares  
  
And I'll, I'll still take the best you've got  
Even though I'm sure it's not  
The best for me  
  
When you're born a lover  
You're born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
I, I can see the danger signs  
They only help to underline  
Your beauty  
  
I'm not looking for an easy ride  
True happiness cannot be tried  
So easily  
  
When you're born a lover  
You're born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
You can take your time  
I'll be waiting in line  
You don't even have to give me  
The time of day  
  
When you're born a lover  
You're born to suffer  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers  
  
Like all soul sisters  
And soul brothers

You wear guilt  
Like shackles on your feet  
Like a halo in reverse  
I can feel  
The discomfort in your seat  
And in your head it's worse  
  
There's a pain  
A famine in your heart  
An aching to be free  
Can't you see  
All love's luxuries  
Are here for you and me  
  
And when our worlds they fall apart  
When the walls come tumbling in  
Though we may deserve it  
It will be worth it  
  
Bring your chains  
Your lips of tragedy  
And fall into my arms  
  
And when our worlds they fall apart  
When the walls come tumbling in  
Though we may deserve it  
It will be worth it

No need to feel ashamed  
There's nothing to be gained  
When your dreams are in the past  
  
Like stars we crush and burn  
Only to return  
Life goes by so fast  
  
So who is left to play  
Nothing's quite the same  
We can't live in the past  
  
I'm burning inside as the sun  
And I only just begun  
Love it fades so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes I'm not sure  
What I'm fighting for  
It happens all the time  
  
I know I've had enough, maybe far too much  
It's easy to be kind  
And when it's just me and you  
I know what I have to do  
I know I can leave this world behind  
  
No need to feel ashamed  
When there's nothing to be gained  
When your dreams are in the past  
Like stars we crush and burn  
Only to return  
These lines are change so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes I'm not sure  
What I'm fighting for  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time

Sometimes I slide away  
Silently  
I slowly lose myself  
Over and over  
  
Take comfort in my skin  
Endlessly  
Surrender to my will  
Forever and ever  
  
I dissolve in trust  
I will sing with joy  
I will end up dust  
I'm in heaven  
  
I stand in golden rays  
Radiantly  
I burn a fire of love  
Over and over  
  
Reflecting endless light  
Relentlessly  
I have embraced the flame  
Forever and ever  
  
I will scream the word  
Jump into the void  
I will guide the world  
Up to heaven

Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together  
And is it happens  
It happens here in this house  
  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
And there's someone  
Calling on the telephone  
Let's stay home  
It's cold outside  
And I have so much  
To confide to you  
  
With or without words  
I'll confide everything  
  
Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together  
And as it happens  
It happens here in this house  
  
So we stay at home  
And I'm by your side  
And you know  
What's going on inside  
Inside my heart  
Inside this house  
And I just want to  
Let it out for you  
  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
  
Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together

We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
When you get, what you need  
It's no way of knowing  
What you get is another hole to feed  
  
Your name was the one that was always chosen  
Your words and the kindness that set me free  
Words can leave you broken inside  
You'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe  
  
This world has left me broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
Words can leave you broken inside  
You'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here  
  
This world can leave you broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe

You have bound my heart with subtle chains  
So much pleasure that it feels like pain  
So entwined now that we can't shake free  
I am you, and you are me  
  
No escaping from the mess we're in  
So much pleasure that it must be sin  
I must live with this reality  
I am yours eternally  
  
There's no turning back  
We're in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No, no, no  
No excuses to give  
I'm the one you're with  
We've no alternative  
No, no, no  
  
Dark obsession in the name of love  
This addiction that we're both part of  
Leads us deeper into mystery  
Keeps us craving endlessly  
  
Strange compulsions that I can't control  
Pure possession of my heart and soul  
I must live with this reality  
  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
  
There's no turning back  
We're in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No, no, no  
No excuses to give  
I'm the one you're with  
We've no alternative  
No, no, no

It's the dark night of my soul  
And temptation's taking hold  
But through the pain and the suffering  
Through the heartache and trembling  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel loved  
I feel loved  
  
As the darkness closes in  
In my head I hear whispering  
Questioning and beckoning  
But I'm not taken in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the depths of my emptiness  
Comes a feeling of inner bliss  
I feel wanted, I feel desired  
I can feel my soul on fire  
  
[Chorus]

I want you now  
Tomorrow won't do  
There's a yearning inside  
And it's showing through  
Reach out your hands  
And accept my love  
We've waited for too long  
Enough is enough  
I want you now  
  
My heart is aching  
My body is burning  
My hands are shaking  
My head is turning  
You understand  
It's so easy to choose  
We've got time to kill  
We've got nothing to lose  
I want you now  
  
And I don't mean to sound  
Like one of the boys  
That's now what I'm trying to do  
I don't want to be  
Like one of the boys  
I just want you now  
  
Because I've got a love  
A love that won't wait  
A love that is growing  
And it's getting late  
Do you know what it means  
To be left this way  
When everyone's gone  
And the feelings they stay  
I want you now

Ice Machine  
Running through my head secretly  
The shout of the boys in the factory  
I'll ring you on the telephone silently  
Like blood, like wine in the darkroom scene  
Darkroom scene  
  
A letter once composed  
Seven years long  
And as tall as a tree  
Written on the wall efficient  
Efficiency  
  
Resurrect, as a feeling, on my window,  
Of a past reunion  
Resurrect as a feeling on my window  
Of a past reunion  
Mission of a picture like the city and the air we breathe  
The air we breathe  
Air we breathe  
  
She stood beside me once again  
I knew her face  
We met before in the street  
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet  
Their dancing feet  
Dancing feet

In a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That I could never forget the way  
You told me everything  
By saying nothing  
In a manner of speaking  
I don't understand  
How love in silence becomes reprimand  
But the way I feel about you  
Is beyond words  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me everything  
In a manner of speaking  
Semantics won't do  
In this life that we live  
We only make do  
And the way that we feel  
Might have to be sacrificed  
So in a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That like you I should find a way  
To tell you everything  
By saying nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words

The way you move  
Has got me yearning  
The way you move  
Has left me burning  
I know you know what you're doing to me  
I know my hands will never be free  
I know what it's like to be  
In chains  
  
The way you move  
Is meant to haunt me  
The way you move  
To tempt and taunt me  
I know you knew on the day you were born  
I know somehow I should've been warned  
I know I walk every midnight to dawn  
In Chains  
  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains  
  
You've got me dying for you  
Its you that I'm living through  
You've got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
You've got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too  
You've got me singing to you  
Bringing to you anything you ask me to  
  
The way you move  
Is mesmerizing  
The way you move  
Is hypnotizing  
I know I crumble when you are around  
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound  
Straggle, stumble, shackled and bound  
In chains  
  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains  
  
You've got me dying for you  
Its you that I'm living through  
You've got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
You've got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too  
You've got me singing to you  
Bringing to you anything you ask me to  
  
I'm in chains  
  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains

Put up the barriers  
Shut down your senses  
Cover up with all of your pretenses  
See no evil  
Your eyes are blunted  
We are the hunters  
We are the hunted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But don't forget  
  
Taking a tumble  
I'm taking a dive  
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up  
Reaction levels  
Seem strangely muted  
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But don't forget

In your room  
Where time stands still  
Or moves at your will  
Will you let the morning come soon  
Or will you leave me lying here  
In your favourite darkness  
Your favourite half-light  
Your favourite consciousness  
Your favourite slave  
In your room  
Where souls disappear  
Only you exist here  
Will you lead me to your armchair  
Or leave me lying here  
Your favourite innocence  
Your favourite prize  
Your favourite smile  
Your favourite slave  
I'm hanging on your words  
Living on your breath  
Feeling with your skin  
Will I always be here  
In your room  
Your burning eyes  
Cause flames to arise  
Will you let the fire die down soon  
Or will I always be here  
Your favourite passion  
Your favourite game  
Your favourite mirror  
Your favourite slave  
I'm hanging on your words  
Living on your breath  
Feeling with your skin  
Will I always be here  

As I lay here with you  
The shame lies with us  
We talk of love and trust  
That doesn't matter  
  
Though we may be the last in the world  
We feel like pioneers  
Telling hopes and fears  
To one another  
  
And oh what a feeling  
Inside of me  
It might last for an hour  
Wounds aren't healing  
Inside of me  
Though it feel good now  
I know it's only for now  
  
The feeling is intense  
You grip me with your eyes  
And then I realize  
It doesn't matter

I'm going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine  
It is written in the stars above  
The gods decree  
You'll be right here by my side  
Right next to me  
You can run but you cannot hide  
Don't say you want me  
Don't say you need me  
Don't say you love me  
It's understood  
Don't say you're happy  
Out there without me  
I know you can't be  
'Cause it's no good  
I'll be fine  
I'll be waiting patiently  
Till you see the signs  
And come running to my open arms  
When will you realize  
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide  
Open up your eyes  
You can't turn back the tide  
Don't say you want me  
Don't say you need me  
Don't say you love me  
It's understood  
Don't say you're happy  
Out there without me  
I know you can't be  
'Cause it's no good  
I'm going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine  
It is written in the stars above  
Don't say you want me  
Don't say you need me  
Don't say you love me  
It's understood  
Don't say you're happy  
Out there without me  
I know you can't be  
'Cause it's no good  

Is simplicity best  
Or simply the easiest  
The narrowest path  
Is always the holiest  
So walk on barefoot for me  
Suffer some misery  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
Man will survive  
The harshest conditions  
And stay alive  
Through difficult decisions  
So make up your mind for me  
Walk the line for me  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
Idle talk  
And hollow promises  
Cheating Judases  
Doubting Thomases  
Don't just stand there and shout it  
Do something about it  
You can fulfill  
Your wildest ambitions  
And I'm sure you will  
Lose your inhibitions  
So open yourself for me  
Risk your health for me  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  

When I'm with you baby  
I go out of my head  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
All the things you do to me  
And everything you said  
I just can't get enough  
I just can't get enough  
  
We slip and slide as we fall in love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of  
  
We walk together  
We're walking down the street  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
Every time I think of you  
I know we have to meet  
And I just can't get enough  
I just can't get enough  
  
It's getting hotter  
It's a burning love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I just can't seem to get enough  
  
And when it rains  
You're shining down for me  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
Just like a rainbow  
You know you set me free  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
  
You're like an angel  
And you give me your love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of  
  
[Repeats]  
I just can't get enough

I've told myself so many times before  
But this time I think I mean it for sure  
We have reached a full stop  
Nothing's gonna save us from the big drop  
Reached our natural conclusion  
Outlived the illusion  
I hate being in these situations  
That call for diplomatic relations  
If I only knew the answer  
Or I thought we had a chance  
Or I could stop this  
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  
We've been running around in circles all year  
Doing this and that and getting nowhere  
This'll be the last time  
(I think I said that last time)  
If I only had a potion,  
Some magical lotion  
That could stop this, I would stop this  
I would set the wheels in motion  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  

[Chorus: x2]  
Come on and lay with me  
Come on and lie to me  
Tell me you love me  
Say I'm the only one  
  
Experiences have a lasting impression  
But words once spoken  
Don't mean a lot now  
Belief is the way  
The way of the innocent  
And when I say innocent  
I should say naive  
So lie to me  
But do it with sincerity  
Make me listen  
Just for a minute  
Make me think  
There's some truth in it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Promises made for convenience  
Aren't necessarily  
What we need  
Truth is a word  
That's lost its meaning  
The truth has become  
Merely half-truth  
So lie to me  
Like they do it in the factory  
Make me think  
That at the end of the day  
Some great reward  
Will be coming my way  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Take my hand  
And walk in the light  
Understand, there's a fire to ignite  
You know we have a responsibility  
It's true we've been chosen  
And now we have the possibility  
Of melting what's frozen  
  
Walk with me with the rapture inside  
Can't you see it's not our place to decide  
You know we have to make a case for love  
It's more of a duty  
It's clear we have a mission from above  
A mission of beauty  
  
You know I wouldn't lie to you  
What would I achieve by that  
It's more than I would try to do  
These are the facts  
  
Take your place here  
With love in your heart  
Just embrace what you've known from the start  
We are fulfilling our only destiny  
The angels have spoken  
And all the gods in the universe agree  
The spell can't be broken

Oh, Lillian  
Look what you've done  
You've stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I'm a poor man's son  
And precious jewels  
Weren't found in schools  
Where I came from  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I should have run  
I should have known  
Each dress you own  
Is a loaded gun  
  
Oh, Lillian  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I need protection  
I hear your voice  
And any choice I had is gone  
  
Oh, Lillian  
Once I begun  
I couldn't stop  
'til every drop of blood was sung  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got  
  
Oh, Lillian  
Look what you've done  
You stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh, Lillian  
Oh, Lillian  
Oh, Lillian  
Oh, Lillian

My little light  
Is going to shine  
Shine out so bright  
And illuminate your mind  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
This little voice  
Is going to sing  
I have no choice  
It will infinitely ring  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
I'm channeling the universe  
It's focusing its love inside of me  
A Singularity  
  
My little words  
Are going to sting  
Haven't you heard  
The pain and joy they bring  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
I'm channeling the universe  
It's focusing its love inside of me  
A singularity  
  
Your little eyes  
They're going to see  
I can't disguise  
The beauty inside me  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint

It's been a while since you did something  
Not so long since you complained  
Can sit around here doing nothing everyday  
You're the coward who points the finger  
I understand that I'm helping you  
You have delusions and some spaced-out fantasies  
That's what you do  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie  
  
Don't you ever look in the mirror  
Don't you know there's so much more  
Locked up inside that box behind your door  
All your twisted conversations  
When you're sitting all alone  
Just remember we know your secret while you moan  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie

All of these insurmountable tasks  
That lay before me  
All of the firsts and the definite lasts  
That lay in store for me  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself  
Consequently, I've a tendency to be unhappy  
You see the thoughts in my head  
All the words that were said  
All the blues and the reds get to me  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself  
All of these absurdities  
That lay before us  
All of the doubts and the certainties  
That lay in store for us  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love (love love love)  
Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself

Overflowing senses  
Heightened awareness  
I hear my blood flow  
I feel its caress  
Whispering cosmos  
Talking right to me  
Unlimited, endless  
God breathing through me  
  
See the microcosm  
In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation  
  
Thundering rhythm  
Pounding within me  
Driving me onwards  
Forcing me to see  
Clear and enlightening  
Right there before me  
Brilliantly shining  
Intricate beauty  
  
See the microcosm  
In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation

I've been a martyr for love  
And I will die in the flames  
As I draw my last breath  
As I'm closing on death  
I will call out your name  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Nailed up on the cross  
While you're having your fun  
As the damage is done  
I'm assessing the cost  
  
I knew what I was letting myself in for  
I knew that I could never even the score  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I need to be by your side  
I have knelt at your feet  
I have felt your deceit  
Couldn't leave if I tried  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Tortured every hour  
From the day I was born  
I've been moved like a pawn  
By the greatest of powers  
  
I knew that I would have to suffer in vain  
Aware that I would never outgrow the pain  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love

There's a new game  
We like to play you see  
A game with added reality  
You treat me like a dog  
Get me down on my knees  
We call it master and servant  
We call it master and servant  
It's a lot like life  
This play between the sheets  
With you on top and me underneath  
Forget all about equality  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
It's a lot like life  
And that's what's appealing  
If you despise that throwaway feeling  
From disposable fun  
Then this is the one  
Domination's the name of the game  
In bed or in life  
They're both just the same  
Except in one you're fulfilled  
At the end of the day  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
Come on, master and servant  

You know what I need  
When my heart bleeds  
I suffer from greed  
A longing to feed  
On the mercy in you  
I can't conceal  
The way I'm healed  
The pleasure I feel  
When I have to deal  
With the mercy in you  
I would do it all again  
Lose my way and fall again  
Just so I could call again  
On the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I feel inclined  
To wrongly treat you unkind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you  
I would lose my way again  
Be led hopelessly astray again  
Just so I could pray again  
For the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I have been blind  
Emotionally behind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you  

When the site was found  
We laid the foundations down  
It didn't take long before  
They came back tumbling down  
Don't build at night  
You need a little light  
How else are you going to see  
What it is going to be like  
  
So we picked up our tools  
And we worked in the morning light  
With the last stone placed  
Wasn't it a wonderful site  
But it fell back down  
And scattered all around  
Anything passes  
When you need glasses  
  
My monument  
It feel down  
My monument  
It feel down  
  
Work all of my days for this kind of praise  
It fell down  
Work all of my days  
It fell down

My secret garden's not so secret anymore  
Run from the house holding my head in my hands  
Feeling dejected, feeling like a child might feel  
It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it!  
My secret garden's not so secret anymore!  
  
No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore!  
Run through the fields, down to the edge of the water  
Can't stay long, here comes the reason why,  
She'll catch me if she can,  
Take me by the hand  
I'll have to keep on running  
And I just can't see the fun in  
My secret garden not being secret anymore!  
  
It used to be so easy  
On days such as these she'd  
Search and search for hours  
In among the flowers  
I loved it!, I loved her!  
Play the fool, act so cruel, I loved it!  
Read her book, take a look, I loved her!  
  
It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it!  
My secret garden's not so secret anymore!

I'm taking a ride  
With my best friend  
I hope he never lets me down again  
He knows where he's taking me  
Taking me where I want to be  
I'm taking a ride  
With my best friend  
We're flying high  
We're watching the world pass us by  
Never want to come down  
Never want to put my feet back down  
On the ground  
I'm taking a ride  
With my best friend  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Promises me I'm as safe as houses  
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Never let me down  
See the stars they're shining bright  
Everything's alright tonight

Sex jibe husband murders wife  
Bomb blast victim fights for life  
Girl Thirteen attacked with knife  
  
Princess Di is wearing a new dress  
  
Jet airliner shot from sky  
Famine horror, millions die  
Earthquake terror figures rise  
  
Princes Di is wearing a new dress  
  
You can't change the world  
But you can change the facts  
And when you change the facts  
You change points of view  
If you change points of view  
You may change a vote  
And when you change a vote  
You may change the world  
  
In black townships fires blaze  
Prospects better premier says  
Within sight are golden days  
  
Princess Di is wearing a New Dress  
  
You can't change the world  
But you can change the facts  
And when you change the facts  
You change points of view  
If you change points of view  
You may change a vote  
And when you change a vote  
You may change the world

I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger  
  
Complicating, circulating  
New life, new life  
Operating, generating  
New life, new life  
  
Transitions to another place  
So the time will pass more slowly  
Features fuse and your shadow's red  
Like a film I've seen now show me  
  
Your face is hidden and were out of sight  
And the road just leads to nowhere  
The stranger in the door is the same as before  
So the question answers nowhere  
  
I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger

I saw you in the picture  
I saw you play the part  
This ain't no disco  
There's a thousand watts in you  
You take this too far  
This ain't no disco  
  
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance  
This ain't no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby don't you let go  
This ain't no disco  
  
Part one  
Act one  
Everyone pretend  
This ain't no disco  
This is more a story  
And we're reaching the end  
This ain't no disco  
  
Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance  
This ain't no disco  
And you know how to dance  
  
Move me disco  
Baby don't you let go  
This ain't no disco

Sitting target  
Sitting waiting  
Anticipating  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Life  
Is full of surprises  
It advertises  
Nothing  
Nothing  
What am I trying to do  
What am I trying to say  
I'm not trying to tell you anything  
You didn't know  
When you woke up today  
Sitting target  
Sitting praying  
God is saying  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Always  
Knows the prospects  
Learnt to expect  
Nothing  
Nothing

Just give me a reason some kind of sign  
I'll need a miracle to help me this time  
I heard what you said and I feel the same  
I know in my heart that I'll have to change  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothing's impossible  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothing's impossible  
  
How did we get to be this far apart?  
How did we get to be this far apart?  
I want to be with you have something to share  
I want to be hear I'm not there  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothing's impossible  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothing's impossible  
  
Even the stars look brighter tonight  
Nothing's impossible  
If you believe in love at first sight  
Nothing's impossible  
  
I still believe in love at first sight  
Nothing's impossible

It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Something beautiful is happening inside for me  
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery  
I feel hypnotized, I feel paralyzed  
I have found heaven  
There's a thousand reasons  
Why I shouldn't spend my time with you  
For every reason not to be here I can think of two  
Keep me hanging on  
Feeling nothing's wrong  
Inside your heaven  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear  
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here  
I feel satisfied  
I belong inside  
Your velvet heaven  
Did I need to sell my soul  
For pleasure like this  
Did I have to lose control  
To treasure your kiss  
Did I need to place my heart  
In the palm of your hand  
Before I could even start  
To understand  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  

Peace will come to me  
Peace will come to me  
  
I'm leaving bitterness behind  
This time I'm cleaning up my mind  
There is no space for the regrets  
I will remember to forget  
  
Just look at me  
I am walking love incarnate  
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate  
I'm going to light up the world  
  
Peace will come to me  
Peace will come to me  
  
I'm leaving anger in the past  
With all the shadows that it cast  
There is radar in my heart  
I should have trusted from the start  
  
Just look at me  
I am a living act of holiness  
Giving all the positive virtues that I possess  
I'm going to light up the world  
  
Peace will come to me  
Just wait and see  
Peace will come to me  
It's meant to be  
Peace will come to me  
Just wait and see  
Peace will come to me  
It's inevitability

On another world by another star at another place and time  
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind  
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,  
That you may reach a different verdict,  
If all the judges missed the case  
  
In a parallel universe that's happening right now  
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how  
  
And everything could have been perfect  
Everything in the right place  
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect  
Accused, abandoned and disgraced  
  
I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger  
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer  
I heard the sound, i turned my head around  
To watch our love shot down  
  
In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side  
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide  
  
And everything is almost perfect  
Everything is almost right  
There are never any conflicts  
There are never any fights

A white house, a white room  
The program of today  
Lights on, switch on  
Your eyes are far away  
The map represents you  
And the tape is your voice  
Follow all along you  
Till you recognize the choice  
  
I take pictures  
Photographic pictures  
  
Bright light  
Dark room  
Bright light  
Dark room  
  
I said I'd write a letter  
But I never got the time  
And I'm looking to the day  
I mesmerize the light  
  
The years I spend just thinking  
Of a moment we both knew  
A second boss looking into  
It seems it can't be true

Get out the crane  
Construction time again  
What is it this time  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Let the beads of sweat flow  
Until the ends have met through  
Could take a long time  
Working on the pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy  
  
On this golden day  
Work's been sent our way  
That could last a lifetime  
Working on the pipeline  
  
From the heart of our land  
To the mouth of the man  
Must reach him sometime  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy

You had something to hide  
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you  
Now you're not satisfied  
With what you're being put through  
  
It's just time to pay the price  
For not listening to advice  
And deciding in your youth  
On the policy of truth  
  
Things could be so different now  
It used to be so civilised  
You will always wonder how  
It could have been if you'd only lied  
  
It's too late to change events  
It's time to face the consequence  
For delivering the proof  
In the policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
  
Now you're standing there tongue tied  
You'd better learn your lesson well  
Hide what you have to hide  
And tell what you have to tell  
You'll see your problems multiplied  
If you continually decide  
To faithfully pursue  
The policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before

Precious and fragile things  
Need special handling  
My God what have we done to You?  
  
We always try to share  
The tenderest of care  
Now look what we have put You through  
  
[Chorus]  
Things get damaged  
Things get broken  
I thought we'd manage  
But words left unspoken  
Left us so brittle  
There was so little left to give  
  
Angels with silver wings  
Shouldn't know suffering  
I wish I could take the pain for you  
  
If God has a master plan  
That only He understands  
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray you learn to trust  
Have faith in both of us  
And keep room in your heart for two  
  
[Chorus]

Get that feeling  
Head is reeling  
You think you're in control  
But you don't know me babe  
I can move you  
I can soothe you  
I can take you places in a different way  
  
I don't think you understand  
What I'm trying to say  
I'll be your operator baby  
I'm in control  
  
Watch your action  
Close reaction  
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head  
Conversation, my creation  
Nothing that you do  
You do unless I said  
  
You don't know the consequences  
Of the things you say  
I'll be your operator baby  
I'm in control  
  
All the things you tried to do babe  
And all the words we said before  
Are only part of what I started baby  
And you can't stop me anymore

I'm not going down on my knees,  
Begging you to adore me  
Can't you see it's misery  
And torture for me  
When I'm misunderstood  
Try as hard as you can, I've tried as hard as I could  
To make you see  
How important it is for me  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue  
In situations like these  
Understand me  
Some people have to be  
Permanently together  
Lovers devoted to  
Each other forever  
Now I've got things to do  
And I've said before that I know you have too  
When I'm not there  
In spirit I'll be there  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue  
In situations like these  
Understand me  

Do you ever get that feeling  
When the guilt begins to hurt  
Seeing all the children  
Wallowing in dirt  
Crying out with hunger  
Crying out in pain  
At least the dirt will wash off  
When it starts to rain  
  
Soap won't wash away your shame  
  
Do you ever get that feeling  
That something isn't right  
Seeing your brother's fists  
Clenched ready for the fight  
Soon the fighting turns to weapons  
And the weapons turn to wounds  
So the doctors stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch  
  
Surgery won't improve your pain  
  
It all seems so stupid  
It makes me want to give up  
But why should I give up  
When it all seems so stupid  
  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That something can be done  
To eradicate these problems  
And make the people one  
Do you ever get that feeling  
Something like a nagging itch  
And all the while the doctors  
Stitch and stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch  
  
Hope alone won't remove the stains  
Shame

I dream of a day  
When I dare to believe  
You're the answer  
  
When the shame  
And the guilt are removed  
And the truth appears  
  
Of the touch of your hand  
I lose who I am  
If I want to  
  
I try to resist but  
Succumb to the bliss  
Of your kiss  
  
You should be higher  
I'll take you higher  
Well don't be afraid  
You'll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
Your arms are infected  
They're holding the truth  
Oh stop all your crying  
This one you'll lose  
  
You should be higher  
I'll take you higher  
So don't be afraid  
You'll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
You should be higher  
You should be higher  
  
Love, love  
Love, love

Plans made in the nursery  
Can change the course of history  
Remember that  
  
Mummy's annoyed, says go and play  
Don't show your face  
Stay away all day  
Shouldn't have done that  
  
A small boy and his infantry  
Marching around so naturally  
Shouldn't have done that  
  
Grows up and goes to school  
Such a nice boy  
Obeys all the rules  
Mummy's proud of that  
  
Leaves school to follow his ambition  
Knows what he wants  
To be a politician  
Shouldn't have done that!

She was silent trying to be  
Like the girl who acted on the TV  
Always knowing when to say  
Wishing for a moment so that they could see  
  
Staring in the night  
A picture in my room  
And I think that she knew her lines  
  
Break away tonight  
I want to hold your hand  
We've got to get it right  
We've got to understand  
  
Carefully watching waiting as I  
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play  
I was screaming louder as the  
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way  
  
Staring in the night  
A picture in my room  
And I think that she knew her lines  
  
Break away tonight  
I want to hold your hand  
We've got to get it right  
We've got to understand  
  
Placing all the questions in the  
Minutes of a game we won so long ago  
Dangerous and beautiful the  
Radio transmission that I have to know  
  
You could never run  
You could never stay  
And I think you belong to me  
  
Break away tonight  
I want to hold your hand  
We've got to get it right  
We've got to understand

There'll be times  
When my crimes  
Will seem almost unforgivable  
I give in to sin  
Because you have to make this life livable  
But when you think I've had enough  
From your sea of love  
I'll take more than another riverful  
And I'll make it all worthwhile  
I'll make your heart smile  
  
Strangelove  
Strange highs and strange lows  
Strangelove  
That's how my love goes  
Strangelove  
Will you give it to me  
Will you take the pain  
I will give to you  
Again and again  
And will you return it  
  
There'll be days  
When I stray  
I may appear to be  
Constantly out of reach  
I give in to sin  
Because I like to practice what I preach  
I'm not trying to say  
I'll have it all my way  
I'm always willing to learn  
When you've got something to teach  
And I'll make it all worthwhile  
I'll make your heart smile  
  
Pain will you return it  
I'll say it again, pain  
Pain will you return it  
I won't say it again  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
Will you give it to be  
I give in  
I'll say it again  
I give in  
  
I give in  
Again and again  
I give in  
That's how my love goes  
I give in  
I'll say it again  
I give in

Come with me  
Into the trees  
We'll lay on the grass  
And let the hours pass  
Take my hand  
Come back to the land  
Let's get away  
Just for one day  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Metropolis  
Has nothing on this  
You're breathing in fumes  
I taste when we kiss  
Take my hand  
Come back to the land  
Where everything's ours  
For a few hours  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you  
Make decisions  
Without your television  
Let me hear you speaking  
Just for me  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you speaking  
Just for me  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you crying  
Just for me

There is darkness and death in your eyes  
What have you got buried inside?  
The shallow grave in your soul  
The ghosts that have taken control  
  
You really should have dug a little deeper there  
Body parts are starting to appear and scare  
The child inside away  
  
Each tear that flows down your face  
Trickles then picks up the pace  
And turns to a river inside  
A river that will not subside  
  
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound  
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned  
The child inside your heart  
  
I can see you drifting away  
Heading for the light  
I can see you drifting away  
Every night  
  
Why were you always inside?  
On days when the weather was fine  
And while we were running around  
You were nowhere to be found  
  
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed  
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead  
The child inside you died

Oh you sad one  
Playing the Angel  
Isn't so easy where you're from  
  
Oh you wild one  
Devil's companion  
You won't stay satisfied for long  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want you to change anything you do  
I don't want you to be someone else for me  
  
Oh you dark one  
Eternal outsider  
Caught in the spider's web you've spun  
  
Oh you blind one  
Gentle and kind one  
Seeing the world as a loaded gun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stay as you are the Darkest Star  
Shining for me  
Majestically  
  
[Chorus]

We're the horniest boys  
With the corniest ploys  
Who take the easiest girls  
To our sleaziest worlds  
  
With our lecherous plans  
In our treacherous hands  
You'd be wasting your time  
Saying no, it's a crime  
  
All that we live for you'll regret  
All you remember we'll forget  
  
We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room  
We're twilight's parasites  
With self-inflicted wounds  
  
We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room  
Heavenly oversights  
Eating from silver spoons  
  
With our decadent minds  
And our innocent lines  
You'll be playing our games  
With your bodies in flames  
  
When delirious fun  
Has seriously begun  
You'll be down on your knees  
You'll be begging us please  
  
All we're demanding you'll supply  
All we're accused of we'll deny  
  
We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room  
We're twilight's parasites  
With self-inflicted wounds  
  
We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room  
Heavenly oversights  
Eating from silver spoons

I've read more than a hundred books  
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times  
But despite all the places I've looked  
It's still no clearer  
I'm still no nearer  
The meaning of love  
  
Noted down all my observations  
Spent an evening watching television  
Still I couldn't say with precision  
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above  
But what's the meaning  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
Next I asked several friends of mine  
If they could spare a few minutes of their time  
Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind  
Tell me the answer  
My Lord high above  
Tell me the meaning  
The meaning of love  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
Tell me the meaning of love  
(tell me)

Wine is sweet and gin is bitter  
Drink all you can but you won't forget her  
You talk too much, you laugh too loud  
You see her face in every crowd  
  
That's the price of love, the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love, the price of love  
It costs you more when you're to blame  
  
Kiss one girl, kiss another  
Kiss them all but you won't recover  
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast  
You're happy now, but that won't last  
  
That's the price of love, the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love, the price of love  
It costs you more when you're to blame

One subtle look  
God help me  
Is all it took  
To sell me  
One single word  
Unspoken  
Your name unheard  
And I'm broken  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
They've seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
It's the same thing  
They can't take any more  
  
One gentle touch  
And I'm helpless  
It's all too much  
For my senses  
One simple prayer  
Denied me  
When you're not there  
Beside me  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
They've seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
It's the same thing  
They can't take any more

I need to be cleansed  
It's time to make amends  
For all of the fun  
The damage is done  
And I feel diseased  
I'm down on my knees  
And I need forgiveness  
Someone to bear witness  
To the goodness within  
Beneath the sin  
Although I may flirt  
With all kinds of dirt  
To the point of disease  
Now I want release  
From all this decay  
Take it away  
And somewhere  
There's someone who cares  
With a heart of gold  
To have and to hold

And do those feet in modern times  
Walk upon the flowers  
And walk upon their brothers  
While their heads are busy lying low  
Trying to keep to cover...oh  
  
Something went wrong  
Along the way  
Everybody's waiting for  
Judgment day  
  
So they can go  
Told you so  
  
Bring me my gun of itching desire  
Bring me my bullets and I will fire  
Sights set higher than the tall church spire  
  
Standing in line  
The blind lead the blind  
Waiting and waiting  
For an overdue sign  
Brothers and sisters  
Playing Chinese whispers  
If things aren't suited  
Then they'll get diluted  
  
There's one more dead with a hole in his head  
He shouldn't have said all the things he said  
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled

Saturday night, you look so chic  
Been waiting for this moment, been waiting all week  
The pub is crowded, much too hot  
The boys, they're dancing, they just can't stop  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
Ice cold drinks, get sold tonight  
We're gonna get happy, the occasion is right  
You start to move, you take the floor  
The music is better than ever before  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
3 am, I just can't last  
The music is loud and much too fast  
You cannot get out, you wanna stay  
You gotta hang out, another dancing day  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride

They were raining from the sky  
Exploding in my heart  
Is this a love in disguise  
Or just a form of modern art  
  
From the skies you could almost hear them cry  
Tora Tora Tora  
In the town they were going down  
Tora Tora Tora  
  
I had a nightmare only yesterday  
You played a skeleton  
You took my love then died that day  
I played an American  
  
From the skies you can almost hear them cry  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
In the town they were going down  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
  
I played an American

Echoing, echoing in my mind  
  
Well, it's about time  
It's beginning to hurt  
Time you made up your mind  
Just what is it all worth  
  
Watch the clock on the wall  
Feel the slowing of time  
Hear a voice in the hall  
Echoing in my mind  
  
Here I stand the accused  
With your fist in my face  
Feeling tired and bruised  
With the bitterest taste  
  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
Time  
  
Time, time  
Time, time  
Time, time  
Time

I'm waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a star in the sky  
Guiding my way with its light  
And in the glow of the moon  
Know my deliverance will come soon  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a sound in the calm  
Someone is coming to harm  
I press my hands to my ears  
It's easier here just to forget fear  
And when I squinted  
The world seemed rose-tinted  
And angels appeared to descend  
To my surprise  
With half-closed eyes  
Things looked even better  
Than when they were open  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
I knew that it would save us all  
Now everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
Now everything is bearable  
And here in the still  
All that you feel is tranquility  

I would tell you about the things  
They put me through  
The pain I've been subjected to  
But the Lord himself would blush  
The countless feasts laid at my feet  
Forbidden fruits for me to eat  
But I think your pulse would start to rush  
  
Now I'm not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
  
Morality would frown upon  
Decency look down upon  
The scapegoat fate's made of me  
But I promise now, my judge and jurors  
My intentions couldn't have been purer  
My case is easy to see  
  
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience  
Peace of mind after what I've been through  
And before we talk of any repentance  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
Now I'm not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes

Welcome to my world  
Step right through the door  
Leave your tranquilizers at home  
You don't need them anymore  
  
All the drama queens have gone  
And the devil got dismayed  
He backed up and fled this town  
His master plan delayed  
  
And if you stay a while  
I'll penetrate your soul  
I'll bleed into your dreams  
You'll want to lose control  
I'll weep into your eyes  
I'll make your vision sing  
I'll open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
  
Watch the sunrise set  
And the moon begin to blush  
Our naked innocence  
Translucently too much  
  
And I hold you in my arms  
I keep you by my side  
And we sleep the devil's sleep  
Just to keep him satisfied  
  
And if you stay a while  
I'll penetrate your soul  
I'll bleed into your dreams  
You'll want to lose control  
I'll weep into your eyes  
I'll make your vision sing  
I'll open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world

I was born with the wrong sign  
In the wrong house  
With the wrong ascendancy  
I took the wrong road  
That led to the wrong tendencies  
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme  
On the wrong day of the wrong week  
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
There's something wrong with me chemically  
Something wrong with me inherently  
The wrong mix in the wrong genes  
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means  
It was the wrong plan  
In the wrong hands  
With the wrong theory for the wrong man  
The wrong lies, on the wrong vibes  
The wrong questions with the wrong replies  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
I was marching to the wrong drum  
With the wrong scum  
Pissing out the wrong energy  
Using all the wrong lines  
And the wrong signs  
With the wrong intensity  
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book  
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook  
Made the wrong move, every wrong night  
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
Too long  
  
Wrong  
  
I was born with the wrong sign  
In the wrong house  
With the wrong ascendancy  
I took the wrong road  
That led to the wrong tendencies  
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme  
On the wrong day of the wrong week  
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique  
  
Wrong
