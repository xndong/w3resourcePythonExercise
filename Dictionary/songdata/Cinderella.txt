I hit the road wide open at seventeen  
Mama cried herself to sleep  
Lost a dad I'd never seen  
Took all my childhood friends  
Guitar, and a dream  
Some say I got it bad  
I say I've got the cream  
  
No, no, no  
I roll into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black  
Go, go, go  
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back  
  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home  
  
I worked from nine to five at twenty-two  
Felt good to stay alive  
Good times were far and few  
  
Trustin' my hopes and dreams  
With someone who said they knew  
Just how to make ends meet  
They haven't got a clue  
  
No, no, no  
I rolled into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black  
Go, go, go  
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back  
  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home  
Take me back  
  
I'm back  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home again  
I'm back  
Back home

Well I've been walkin'  
Down a one way dirty street  
Tryin' to find the answers  
And I've been hopin'  
For a chance to meet  
The rat that spread the cancer  
  
And the lies they've been spinnin'  
And the smiles they've been grinnin'  
There has sure been some sinnin'  
But nobody's winnin'  
When the walls start to crumblin'  
You feel like you're stumblin'  
And nobody wants you when you're down  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city from  
the boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get blood from a stone  
You can't get blood from a stone  
  
Well I'm a rollin'  
But my train's gone off the tracks  
and my wheels are spinnin'  
And I'm a walkin'  
Down a one way dirty street  
But my heart's not sinkin'  
  
From the love they've been buyin'  
And the blues they've been cryin'  
Now the time keeps a flyin'  
But nobody's tryin'  
Cause the love of the money  
Didn't turn out so sunny  
When the well's dry  
No one comes around  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city from the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get from a stone  
  
You can try  
But I still got the fight in my eyes  
Suck it dry  
Cause I've had about enough of your lies  
  
They took the boy from the city  
But they can't take the city form the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's lookin' like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get blood from a stone  
  
They took the boy form the city  
But they can't take the city from the  
Boys lookin' pretty  
Now he's looking like a pity  
Cut the flesh down to the bone  
But you can't get  
You can't get blood from a stone

When I was just a little girl  
My momma used to tuck me into bed  
And she'd read me a story  
It always was about a princess in distress  
And how a guy would save her and end up with the glory  
I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be  
Then one day I realized the fairy tale life wasn't for me  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
Don't want to depend on no-one else  
I'd rather rescue myself  
  
Someday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart, and mind  
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me  
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am  
Don't need nobody taking care of me  
I will be there for him just as strong as he, will be there for me  
When I give myself then it has got to be, an equal thing  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
Don't want to depend on no-one else  
I'd rather rescue myself  
  
I can slay, my own dragons  
I can dream, my own dreams  
My knight in shining armour is me  
So I'm gonna set me free  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
Don't want to depend on no-one else  
I'd rather rescue myself  
  
I don't wanna be like Cinderella  
Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar  
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free  
I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting  
For a handsome prince to come and save me  
On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side  
Don't want to depend on no-one else  
I'd rather rescue myself

I took a walk down a road it's the road I was meant to stay  
I see the fire in your eyes but a man's gott make his way  
  
[Chorus]  
So are you tough enough for my love  
Just close your eyes to the heaven above  
I'm comin home, I'm comin home  
  
I took a ride in a world I'll be spinnin for the rest of my life  
I feel your heart beating baby  
Ooh sometimes it cuts like a knife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm coming home where your love tonight can shine on me  
I'm coming home where your loving arms can set me free  
  
I took a walk down a road it's the road I was meant to stay  
I see the fire in your eyes but a man's gotta make his way  
  
[Chorus]

Ten minutes ago I saw you  
I looked up when you walked through the door.  
My head started reeling,  
You gave me the feeling  
The room had no ceiling or floor.  
Ten minutes ago I met you  
And we murmured our how-do-you-do's.  
I wanted to ring out the bells  
And fling out my arms  
And to sing out the news.  
  
I have found her, she's an angel  
With the dust of the stars in her eyes.  
We are dancing, We are flying,  
And she's bringing me back to the skies.  
In the wings of my love I'm flying  
Over mountain and meadow and glen.  
And I like it so well  
That for all I can tell  
I may never come down again.  
I may never come down to earth again.

Oh  
  
Oh yeah!  
  
Me and Billy boy and old lady Jane  
We hitched a ride took a fast movin' train  
got to the top with our heads spinnin' round  
You never know just what you got until it's comin' back  
  
Down on the farm in the Mississippi shade  
The folks down there they told me  
Take it day by day  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)  
  
I got a long way to go before I reach the light of day  
Monkey's on my back I gotta find a better way  
Same ole story never get just what you want  
The more you get the more you want  
so tell me to and get picked up  
I guess I've always been a traveling man  
'Cause when I'm movin' I can make a stand yeah, yeah  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)  
  
Don't know where I'm going but I know where I've been  
Look around me everybody's trying to win  
  
And walk the last mile (before I sleep)  
It'll be awhile (before I get my peace)  
Last Mile (I walk slowly)  
The last mile (I can rest my feet)
