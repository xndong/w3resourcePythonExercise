She can't put her finger on a single lipstick stain  
Perfume doesn't linger on a shirt on  
There's no matchbook in his pocket with a number and name  
So why does she still hurt  
  
'Cause a woman knows, when there's another woman  
She can feel her, all over her man  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
  
What she don't know, won't hurt her  
That's what he tells himself  
So he hides his cheatin' heart inside his chest  
He thinks he's put one over, but what he don't know is  
He's already confessed  
  
'Cause a woman knows, when there's another woman  
She can feel her, all over her man  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
  
A woman knows, when there's another woman  
You can't fool her, so don't try to think you can  
You can't fool her, so don' try to think you can

I heard a song 'bout a ramblin' man  
Bought a guitar and I started a band  
I got a gig at the local Am Vet  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet, yeah  
  
'69 bored out and jacked up  
A quarter mile that was all it was  
I burned the cool off of that Corvette  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet  
  
Lookin' back at the moments, black and white  
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse, for the better  
Man, I was gone, gone forever  
  
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen  
Man, we were matches and gasoline  
First taste of love never will forget  
I was gone and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet  
  
Lookin' back at the moments, black white  
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life  
For the worse, for the better  
Man, I was gone, gone forever  
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears  
It's hard to hate what got me here  
What got me here  
  
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile  
We missed it all by a country mile  
Went out one night for some cigarettes  
And I was gone and I ain't back yet  
  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet  
I was gone and I ain't back, ain't back, ain't back  
Gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, and I ain't back yet  
I was gone, gone and I ain't back yet

I will always remember the first time that we met  
And the first time that I kissed your lips.  
Is a thing I wont forget.  
The special way you held me is the way you hold me still.  
And I knew right then you love me and I know you always will.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
My grandpa and my grandma,  
My momma and my dad,  
Didn't have a lot of things.  
But love is what they had,  
Their love kept them together through the many years.  
Though life was hard,  
They shared it all through the laughter and the tears.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
Baby your the sunshine that brightens up my day,  
And I will always stand by you.  
Darling come what may,  
And I will always love you,  
To have and to hold.  
And I'll keep my every promise to you with this band of gold.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
Heaven sent from up above,  
Ain't that love.

With a little luck this ol' truck will get me home today  
With a little more I'll still have this job tomorrow  
Weather man says a wet weekend he just might be right  
But rain or shine you'll be mine tonight  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
  
Heaven knows I ain't even close to bein' God's gift to women  
But in your arms I feel like I am  
I don't know it all, I sure can't solve  
The problems of the human race  
But I know how to bring a smile to your face  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
  
Darlin', say it one more time  
You will forever be mine  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
I'll always have you to hold  
That's all I need to know

Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin' silent night with the palm trees a blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well if you're thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a present this year  
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear  
How 'bout two tickets to a tropical shore  
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore  
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi mahi grillin'  
And pina coladas in the blender chillin'  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
Take me to the islands put my feet in the sand  
Rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Singin' silent night with the palm trees blowing  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Well everybody's praying for a Christmas of white  
Come to think about it that'll be alright  
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground  
And everyday our skin gets a little more brown  
  
Well string some lights in a coconut tree  
I rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand  
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean  
Baby won't you say you and me will be goin'  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
I can almost feel my toes in the sand  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
Don't worry baby we'll celebrate plenty  
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini  
We won't have to worry 'bout the holiday rush  
It'll be you and me falling deeper in love  
  
Ooooo Ooooo Ooooo  
Don't you think it's a pretty good plan  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan  
  
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

I could jump on some ol' highway  
Run a thousand miles or more  
Unlock some hidden mystery  
Behind a distant door  
I could sail the seven oceans  
Til I crawl upon some long forgotten shore  
  
But it's always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you I'm lookin' for  
  
I could climb a hundred mountains  
Leave a hard ol' world behind  
Wander right across some prairie  
Like a man out of his mind  
I could walk and stare into the sun  
Let it all just burn me deaf and blind  
But it's always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you I'm tryin' to find  
  
Where does a man go for redemption  
Where does he take a broken heart  
Shouldn't there be some small exemption  
If he does all that it takes  
To admit to his mistakes  
Til the truth batters and breaks his world apart  
  
I could ask for my forgiveness  
From the heavens high above  
Tell myself my prayers are gonna somehow be enough  
And lay down in some angels bed  
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreamin' of  
But it's always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you that I love.  
  
Where does a man seek his salvation  
When does his mind finally go free  
Is the pain he feels the only explanation  
For believing lies are true  
For the stone inside his shoe  
The endless ways that you keep haunting me  
  
I could find an empty church  
Get down on my knees  
Tell myself the mercy  
Is a matter of degrees  
Then lay down in some angel's arms  
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreamin' of  
But it's always gonna be you  
Always gonna be you that I love  
  
Always gonna be you that I love  
That I love

Gonna cash my check before the drive-through closes  
Get my baby a couple Quick-Sak roses  
Put five dollars worth of gas in my pride and joy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Gonna take her out to the Tasty-Freeze then  
We'll go dancing at the American Legion  
When ole Bobby does Elvis, you swear it was the real McCoy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town  
But we don't let that slow us down  
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
When we've had enough of that shakin' and a shoutin'  
We go fog up the windows in the Smoky Mountains  
Have more fun than a couple of tourists and a Polaroid  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Aw there ain't much to do in the one-light town  
But we don't let that slow us down  
If it's too quiet, we make our own noise  
Now you can bet your boots by the end of the week  
My pretty little girl is ready for me  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy  
Another Friday night in the life of a country boy

Walking along beneath the lights of that miracle mile  
Me and Mary making our way into the night  
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides, the pinball  
Bells, and the skee ball signs  
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight  
  
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean  
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street  
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand  
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet  
  
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I don't see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
There's a local band playing at the seaside pavilion  
And I got just enough cash to get us in  
And as we are dancing, Mary's wrapping her arms around me  
  
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin  
  
In the midst of the music  
I tell her I love her  
And we both laugh, cause we know it isn't true  
Oh, but Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight  
And there's so much that I long to do to you  
  
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I don't see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
And I don't see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
Mary, I don't see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine  
  
In the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland  
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine  
Hey, I don't see how you could ever be  
Anything but mine

Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus lays down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lays  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle 'till morning is nigh  
  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky look down where he lays  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

They always said that hindsight's twenty-twenty  
And when it comes to mistakes in love girl I've got plenty  
But the one that sticks out the most in my mind  
Is the night I left you standing on the front porch drying  
Living for the day I could make it all up to you  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
  
Well I'm getting to know this old town like never before  
Walking every street knocking on every door  
Girl wherever you are I want you back  
I love you baby and I'm sure about that  
What ever it takes there's nothing that I won't do  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
  
I must have been a fool I confess  
To ever let you go but I ain't gonna rest  
  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again  
Till you're back in my arms I'll be old lonesome till then  
And honey I won't eat and I won't even sleep  
I'll be walking these toes off of both of my feet  
Till you're back in my arms, back in my arms again

The summer breeze, made ripples on the pond  
Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond  
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress  
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest  
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood  
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud  
  
And it was down with the old man, up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
  
Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound  
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground  
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone  
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home  
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay  
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day  
  
And it was down with the old man, up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
  
This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed  
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again  
  
Down with the old man, up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Man, I could use a Pina Colada  
Little bit of sun on my skin  
A hammock, a book  
Never gonna look back  
Once my feet hit the sand  
I've had it up to here with this rat race  
Need a smile on my face  
  
I want to go where I can lighten up the load  
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road  
Get this laying low off to a flying start  
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star  
And be as you are  
  
Gettin' stuck sure would be easy  
In this palm tree paradise  
Ambition fades with every wave  
For the finer things in life  
Maybe I'll just hang around here  
Go home later next year  
  
I want stay down here, lighten up the load  
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road  
Get this laying low off to a flying start  
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star  
And be as you are  
  
I want to play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star  
And be as you are  
Be as you are

Baby I don't understand  
How just the touch of your hand  
Can make me feel invincible  
Do you know just where you take me  
Do you know how high you make me  
I need your kiss like oxygen  
With your arms warm around me  
When your eyes look deep into me  
Its unstoppable, baby anything is possible  
  
Everything I want to be  
Any dream I want to dream I can  
Because of your love  
Anywhere I ever go  
With all of my heart I know I am the man I am  
Because of your love  
  
Don't know how I lived before you  
Now I live to explore you  
Take me girl to your secret world  
Where I can swim in your deep blue passion  
Or I could feel your love come crashing  
Over me endlessly  
Whether you're right by my side  
Or whether you and I are a million miles apart  
I can always feel you in my heart  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
Oh baby  
Because of your love

[Verse:]  
Seems like everythin' that's good in life you gotta wait for  
My can't poke lumber dad said on a lake in Tennessee  
And it's like sittin' there and learnin' just to watch  
The morning sunrise, all I know is what it does to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
  
[Verse 2:]  
That old jam-box playin' in the background takes me somewhere  
Back to some ol' late night country highway radio  
I've got all my friends hangin' out, sittin' right here with me  
I get this old feeling I just know...  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Would you look at this night that we've been given?  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
Would you look at this night that we've been given?  
It makes life worth livin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like Friday night workin' on a 3 day week-end  
Somethin' in a jar just made for sippin'  
It's feelin' like a feel good time - bomb tickin'  
Standin' round waitin' on a beer can chicken  
It's the lil things that make life worth livin'  
Turn it up, let's go! Pretty girl dancing backroom  
By the seashore, dirt track, turn to 4(!?)  
Pedal to the metal, gonna show ya what we're here for  
6 strings, good songs, ol' wooden bowl with a skull and a crossbow  
Full moon, that's right! Green grass, good laughs  
Just waitin' on high time and beer can chicken  
Just look at this life that we've been given

Starin' out into the wild blue yonder  
So many thoughts to sit and ponder  
'Bout life and love and lack of  
And this emptiness in my heart  
  
Too old to be wild and free still  
Too young to be over the hill  
Should I try to grow up?  
But who knows where to start  
  
[Chorus]  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Sun comes up and sun sinks down  
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town  
Up for days in a rage  
Just tryin' to search my soul  
  
From the answers and the reasons why  
I'm at these crossroads in my life  
And I really don't know  
Which way to go  
  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Maybe I'll settle down, get married  
Or stay single and stay free  
Which road I travel  
Is still a mystery to me  
  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Down in Mexico

Well I drank till I stumbled,  
I drank till I fell,  
When the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell.  
I know about drinkin',  
So I know one things true,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you  
  
'Cause I loved till I stumbled,  
I loved till I fell,  
When the loving was over it hurt me like hell.  
Now I what a taste of the wrong love can do,  
Being drunk's a lot like lovin' you  
  
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink,  
And, at that I've done reasonably, well I think.  
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me  
At that I've failed miserably.  
  
Well I felt the hangover of loving all night.  
I've sat at the bar all alone in a fight.  
I've bottled up feelings, and poured them out too,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you.  
  
And I've woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink,  
And, at that I've done reasonably, well I think.  
But I haven't done well swearing off you and me  
At that I've failed miserably.  
  
Well I drank till I stumbled,  
I loved till I fell,  
When the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell.  
Now I know about drinkin' so I know one things true,  
Being drunk's a lot like loving you.  
  
Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do,  
Sometimes I still get drunk loving you.

I move on like a sinner's prayer  
Letting go like a levee breaks  
Walk away as if I don't care  
Learn to shoulder my mistakes  
I'm built to fade like your favorite song  
I get reckless when there's no need  
Laugh as your stories ramble on  
Break my heart but it won't bleed  
My only friends are pirates, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I'm never sure when the truth won't do  
I'm pretty good on a lonely night  
I move on the way a storm blows through  
I never stay, but then again, I might  
I struggle sometimes to find the words  
Always sure until I doubt  
Walk a line until it blurs  
Build the walls too high to climb out  
I'm honest to a fault, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I see you lean in, you're bound to fall  
I don't wanna be that mistake  
I'm just a dreamer, nothing more  
You should know it before it gets too late  
  
'Cause good-bye's are like a roulette wheel  
You never know where they're gonna land  
First you're spinning, then you're standing still  
Left holding a losing hand  
One day you're gonna find someone  
Right away, you'll know it's true  
That all of your seeking's done  
Was just a part of the passing through  
Right there in that moment  
You'll finally understand  
That I was better as a memory than as your man  
Better as a memory than as your man

Their shadows danced closer on the honky tonk walls  
As the band plays the last verse to that goin' home waltz  
And they'll start to peril 'neath the parking lot moon  
And some cars and a pickup won't be picked up 'til noon  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
It's an after hours merry-go-round  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found  
  
I wish I could say now that I've learned it all  
From my observations as a fly on the wall  
But if lonesome's a crime oh, I'm guilty as sin  
'Cause tomorrow I'll pickup my ol' pickup again  
  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
It's an after hours merry-go-round  
Somewhere between midnight and daylight  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found  
There's a whole lot of love lost and found

She was aware of her insecurities  
As she took the stage  
But she was convinced if she got up there  
That she'd be discovered some day  
So she belted it  
She hit the high notes fearlessly  
Oh, she melted them  
She brought them to their feet  
  
She was a big star  
At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She was a big star  
  
She made the local cable shows  
Where the camera fell in love with her face  
After a couple of weekends  
The groupies were crawling all over the place  
And she signed autographs  
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt  
And in the aftermath  
That small time town was hers  
  
She was a big star  
At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She was a big star  
  
Hey, she doesn't care anymore  
That her high school girlfriends cut her down  
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't  
And where she is now  
  
A few old neighbors swear they are certain  
She slept her way to the top  
She knows you don't get where you're goin'  
Unless you got something they ain't got  
So she sings tonight  
To twenty thousand plus  
And the young girls scream out loud  
Man that could be us  
  
She's a big star  
She eats caviar  
Just before she performs every night  
She says if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She's a big star

She comes from Boston  
Works at the jewelry store  
Down in the harbor  
Where the ferries come to shore  
She never really knew how good it would feel  
To finally find herself in a place so warm and real  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
She comes from Boston  
Talks to her family now and then  
Through e-mails and postcards  
She tries to explain to them  
That education and occupation will have to wait for now  
She loves the Rasta, reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand  
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
The girl she was in New England  
Is different now and dead  
In all the local bars  
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'  
She's from Boston  
  
She wears a Red Sox cap  
To hide her baby dreads  
From Boston  
She came to this island from Boston

(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda)  
  
There's a port on a western bay  
And it serves a hundred ships a day  
Lonely sailors pass the time away  
And talk about their homes  
  
And there's a girl in this harbor town  
And she works layin' whiskey down  
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"  
She serves them whiskey and wine  
  
The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)  
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)  
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"  
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)  
  
Brandy wears a braided chain  
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain  
A locket that bears the name  
Of a man that Brandy loves  
  
He came on a summer's day  
Bringin' gifts from far away  
But he made it clear he couldn't stay  
No harbor was his home  
  
The sailor said " Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)  
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)  
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"  
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)  
  
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes  
When he told his sailor stories  
She could feel the ocean fall and rise  
She saw it's ragin' glory  
But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man  
And Brandy does her best to understand  
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)  
  
At night when the bars close down  
Brandy walks through a silent town  
And loves a man who's not around  
She still can hear him say  
  
She hears him say " Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)  
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)  
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"  
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)  
  
Yeah, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl)  
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)  
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"  
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)  
  
[MUSiC FADES OUT]

She lived at the end of a little dirt road  
In a house where secrets go untold  
Barefoot in a cotton dress, dark hair in a tangled mess  
And a head full of crazy dreams  
She said  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
You can't help, but feel a little bit touched  
When your daddy loves you a little too much  
You can wish on four leaf clovers, but all the fields have been plowed  
Over  
And there's nothin' left to do but fly away  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
Stars burn like candles on that two-lane highway  
She made her wish, and disappeared on her eighteenth birthday  
And she said  
  
I'm going to California  
A place where the sun always shines  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin everything behind  
  
I'm goin' to California  
And I'm leavin' everything behind  
  
Oh California  
I'm goin to California  
  
Oh California  
Leavin' it all behind  
California...

By now in New York City, there's snow on the ground  
And out in California, the sunshine's falling down  
And, maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights  
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight  
  
Christmas in Dixie, it's snowin' in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight  
It's windy in Chicago. The kids are out of school  
There's magic in Motown. The city's on the move  
In Jackson, Mississippi, to Charlotte, Caroline  
  
And all across the nation, it's the peaceful Christmas time  
Christmas in Dixie, it's snowin' in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama  
And Knoxville, Tennessee  
Merry Christmas tonight

Tank top, love handles  
Tube socks, Jesus sandals  
Cheap blender, ice bucket  
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it  
  
Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri  
And laughs, here's to the boys at the factory  
  
No more building transmissions  
He's going deep sea fishing  
Catch a marlin, catch a tan  
Catch a local cover band  
  
Hey, you gotta watch that man  
He'll go coastal on ya  
  
Silver hair, silver Buick  
Winter's coming, better move it  
Southbound before they get snowed under  
Call the kids, tell 'em see you next summer  
  
No more freezing their tails off  
It's cataract sunglasses and a round of golf  
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track  
Before you know it Mom and Dad  
They'll go coastal on ya  
  
Sounds so good, got me thinking  
What do y'all say after I'm done singing  
  
We just take a little getaway  
Cruise it down the A1A  
Florabama to the Keys  
Better keep your eye on me  
  
I'll go coastal on ya  
I'll go coastal on ya  
Yeah, I'll go coastal on ya

Everybody's got a place they go  
When the old battery gets running low  
I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea  
If I had my way, hey I'd always be  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut tree  
  
Not to green, not too brown  
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down  
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece  
And you can do alright if you ain't afraid to be  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Yeah, there's less stress and the world's alright  
It's a different point of view  
When you're looking at life  
  
Way up high in a coconut tree  
(Layin' low) low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
High in a coconut tree  
Layin' low, just my baby and me  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Layin' low, just my baby and me (Sunny skies as far as I can see)  
High in a coconut tree  
  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
High up in a coconut tree  
Up here with Willie  
Sunny skies as far as I can see  
Let's get high in a coconut tree

She's thinkin' about what her kids are doing  
Five miles away it's almost time for bed  
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story  
And in the mirror, she paints her lips bright red  
  
She wishes she could call and say she loves them  
But the boss man says no calls go out or in  
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty  
If she didn't have to take it off again  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, is the price she has to pay  
  
They tell her in this job there is no future  
So get it while you can cause looks don't last  
There's money in those pockets for the taking  
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast  
  
The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water  
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall  
The business men stare at the single mother  
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll have a house out in the country  
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn  
And no one will ever know what it was she did before  
But she just heard the DJ say "you're on"  
And the lights come up and they play her song  
  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, smiling while she dances  
Is the price she has to pay  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
It's the price she has to pay

Sometimes they're in a bottle  
Sometimes a pair of high heal shoes  
Some come rolled in paper  
Some have six strings and only play the blues  
Once you meet the devil  
There's no way he'll let you be  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
Skeletons in closets  
Ghost underneath the bed  
They hide out in pictures  
And in words better left unsaid  
They hang around like perfume  
And haunt me like an ancient melody  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's things I can?t leave alone  
'Cause they won't leave me alone  
What I want ain't what I need  
Still I reach for the things I crave  
Better try to runaway  
Maybe I'm afraid of being free  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
So roll one up and light it  
Pickup my old guitar  
I'm playing crossroads  
Drinkin' whiskey from the mason jar  
There's heartache at my front door  
Says she needs my company  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me  
  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
There's demons chasing me  
  
When I'm not chasing demons  
There's demons chasing me

I turned on the evening news  
Saw a old man being interviewed  
Turning a hundred and two today  
Asked him what's the secret to life  
He looked up from his old pipe  
Laughed and said "All I can say is"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't blink  
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you  
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your
wife  
Don't blink  
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did  
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your "better half"  
Of fifty years is there in bed  
And you're praying God takes you instead  
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think  
So don't blink  
  
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said  
"Best start putting first things first"  
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand  
You can't flip it over and start again  
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I've been tryin' to slow it down  
I've been tryin' to take it in  
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Naw, don't blink  
Life goes faster than you think

[Verse:]  
13 in the thick of a cornfield  
I learned to fight, kick, roast, tied a knot shoe  
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train  
My first chance I got out of Smallville  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
My first stop was a pawn shop  
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it  
I had a quick right hand, and an old band  
I thought good friends would make a good band  
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
So there I was, a long way from nowhere  
Frightened mind, spare time and a blank stare  
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang  
After all we didn't share a set of rings  
Besides, how bad could it be!  
She never found out I'd never come clean  
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been right and I've been wrong  
Somewhere in between for so long  
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it  
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?  
On-Time ballroom  
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch  
Nobody follows  
Everybody's got their own past  
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh  
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

When I was a boy  
  
Four houses down from me  
Was a family with an only child  
She was the only girl  
In this whole world that can make me smile  
  
Down the road  
I made up reasons to go  
Down the road  
  
Somewhere inside of me  
There was something she took a liking to  
I asked her to marry me  
She said she really wanted to  
  
Down the road  
To see what life's gonna hold  
Down the road  
  
Her momma wants to know  
If I'm washed in the blood or just in the water  
Her daddy wants to know  
If I make enough to take his daughter  
  
Down the road  
Before he could let her go  
Down the road  
  
Now down the street from here  
There's an engineer with an only son  
And our baby girl says  
She believes that he is the only one  
  
Down the road  
  
Her momma wants to know  
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water  
And I want to know  
That he makes enough to take my daughter  
  
Down the road  
When it comes time to go  
Down the road  
  
Down the road  
You know I want to help her go  
Down the road  
  
Down, down, down that road  
Down, down, down that road

She says most men her age want younger women.  
She thinks her self esteem's  
Not quite itself any more.  
But she sees herself as more than  
What the mirror shows,  
Why that's so important,  
Heaven only knows.  
When the important part for her is,  
Souls and heart's and...  
  
Dreams of sharin' a life and a home.  
Dreams...of never ever bein' alone again.  
Dreams...not even diamonds, just a little gold.  
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old.  
Dreams...the kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers and forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
She swears she won't divorce a 3rd time.  
She swears the more she knows about love,  
The harder it is to find.  
Her perfect picture of her white horse prince,  
Is now dependability and common sense,  
Someone kind and brave.  
Someone not afraid of...  
  
Dreams...of never ever bein' alone again.  
Dreams...mot even diamonds, just a little gold.  
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old.  
Dreams...the kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers, forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
Ohhh...dreams,  
The kind you know will never end.  
Forever lovers, and forever friends.  
Someone really there, to love and care,  
And share...dreams.  
  
She says most men her age want younger women.

[Verse:]  
Drink it up, don't waste a drop  
Squeeze every second out of that old clock  
Kick it back, man, enjoy the ride  
Keep livin' everyday like it's Saturday night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Let it roll at the big wheels turns  
Swing a lil gravel goin' through those turns  
You and me, we gotta soak it in  
Keep it plankin' like this party's gonna neva end  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Get it while you can, take it to the limit  
Live out every single minute while you're in it  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz you only get so much lighting in the bar  
It's only so many times you get to feel like this  
Light it up, burn it down, that's what life's all about  
And you can't just take a lil sip, fill yo cup, drink it up

I been hangin' round this place, I been lookin' through your space  
I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you  
All the places that you go, all the people that you know  
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard  
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars  
They all say they're goin' far  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along  
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,  
Were you even here at all?  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight  
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked  
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say  
And if you ever were here baby they ain't givin' you away  
  
Now it's been two days  
I'm still lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
  
Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place  
That's the last time I saw that pretty smile upon your face  
I've been lookin' for you baby

Preacher told me last Sunday morning  
Son, you better start living right  
You need to quit the women and whiskey  
And carrying on all night  
  
Don't you wanna hear him call your name  
When you're standing at the pearly gates  
I told the preacher, "Yes I do"  
But I hope they don't call today  
I ain't ready  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven  
Have a mansion high above the clouds  
Everybody want to go to heaven  
But nobody want to go now  
  
Said preacher maybe you didn't see me  
Throw an extra twenty in the plate  
There's one for everything I did last night  
And one to get me through today  
Here's a ten to help you remember  
Next time you got the good Lord's ear  
Say I'm coming but there ain't no hurry  
I'm having fun down here  
Don't you know that  
  
Everybody wants to go to heaven  
Get their wings and fly around  
Everybody want to go to heaven  
But nobody want to go now  
  
Someday I want to see those streets of gold in my halo  
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so  
  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
But nobody wanna go now  
  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout  
Everybody wanna go to heaven  
But nobody wanna go now  
I think I speak for the crowd

I just found this old picture in my wallet  
Of you and me, down in Mexico  
Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket  
That look on our face says all that you need to know  
  
Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  
Everywhere, every time our hearts meet, love is all around us  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
Sometimes I dream, we're alone on an island  
Nowhere to go, we don't want to leave  
All we have is a world full of time  
We spend it all on you and me  
It's all we need  
  
Seems like everywhere we go baby, love goes  
Everywhere, every time our hearts meet, love is all around us  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
I'm so alive when I'm near you  
This fire in my heart lights my world when I'm with you  
  
Every road we take, darlin' love takes  
Every turn, livin' right inside us  
I believe love goes  
Everywhere we go  
  
I believe love goes, everywhere we go  
Everywhere we go

A little country church on a two lane road  
A bride and groom coming out the door  
White lace dress and a red bouquet  
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet  
  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Don't that look like a picture of us  
A match made in heaven if there ever was  
Don't that make you want to fall  
That just makes me want to give you my heart  
Ever forever needs a place to start  
Gotta be a sign from up above  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
  
Old folks sittin' in a front porch swing  
Still holdin' hands like they were sixteen  
Fifty good years they're a lover's dream  
Darlin' that could be you and me  
  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Don't that look like a picture of us  
A match made in heaven if there ever was  
Don't that make you want to fall  
That just makes me want to give you my heart  
Ever forever needs a place to start  
Gotta be a sign from up above  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Yeah, yeah.  
Don't that make you want to fall in love

Do you smoke, do you drink do you yell out, "Hank"  
Do you fold it in your pocket do you lock it in the bank  
Jack it up, drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick it back chillin' or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now, it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you kick the dirt, or work a Vegas stop  
Do you hit the strip, or roll a country mile  
Do you wear 'em uptight, or do you keep it loose  
Do you leave it in the truck or sneak it in, in your boot  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick it back chillin'  
Or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Now, whether you're pimped up hangin' in the VIP  
Or way up high in the cheapest seats  
Hey, pretty mama, if you roll with me  
There'll be diamonds in the sky and the radio screen  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah, you can kick back chillin' or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now it's your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you smoke, do you drink do you yell out, "Hank"?  
Do you fold it in your pocket do ya lock it in the bank?  
  
Do you jack it up or drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
(Whatever makes you feel like a rock star)  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star

Finally Friday, Kenny Chesney  
  
I got a hundred dollars smoking in my bill fold  
I know I outta save it but it's burning a hole  
Right through my pocket and into my skin  
Come Monday morning i'll be broke again  
  
Cause It's finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
I got a little sugar baby down the road  
She's sittin' on ready and rockin' on go  
We'll dance up a storm and later on tonight  
We'll be working on a doing all the wrong things right.  
  
Cause It's finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Monday i'll be hurtin with my head in a vice  
Tuesday i'll be wondering if i'll ever survive  
Wednesday and a Thursday i'll be slowly tuning in  
Friday i'll be rev-in up my motor again  
  
Finally Friday, I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday, I'm outta control  
Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll  
  
Finally Friday, I got my motor running for a wild weekend

Forget the workin blues and let the good times roll

Sprin's sprung, the sun's up and shinin'  
School's out, and everyone's smilin'  
Let's pop the top off, and lie for a while  
And some take it easy days.  
  
Let's tell that old grind where to stick it  
Put the rest of the stress in there with it  
Don't you think we've had enough  
It's time to get away.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
Put your coat away in the closet  
You won't need it, baby  
Because it's a clear blue sky  
And the weatherman says it looks that way for weeks  
Baby, we'll cruise down to Montigo  
Raise us a glass as we pass Puerto Rico  
It don't matter 'cause wherever we go  
Its where it's good to be.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
Let's sail away, where no problems can find us  
We've got 90 days  
To watch that ole Tequila sun rise  
And leave all our troubles behind us.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
It's a flip flop summer...

There's somethin' sacred when your seventeen  
'Bout a football jacket and a high school ring  
And it sure looked nice  
When you wore mine  
That late October at a homecoming dance  
We slipped outside and we took a chance  
In the middle of the night  
Man it sure felt right  
We let go right then and there  
We were loved and we were scared  
  
[Chorus]  
For the first time  
Lovin' blind we dove right in  
For the first time  
We gave everything and then  
Graduation came  
And our dreams called our names  
With broken hearts we moved on with our lives  
For the first time  
  
Well I heard the other day  
Your a Sunday school teacher got the pta  
Got a real good life  
Your a real good wife  
I'm livin' in this circus world  
No I ain't married but I got a girl  
And I'm her man  
We're makin' plans  
But I still smile when I think of us  
Together we learned how to love  
  
[Chorus]

People always tell me their life story  
Love they lost, their taste of glory  
He sat next to me at the counter in the diner  
Said I used to be wall street but this is much finer  
  
He had a leather look on a steal horse harley  
A dark eyed girlfriend he called charlie  
He looked a little lost walking out the door  
I think I knew what he was looking for  
  
Freedom, sweet Freedom  
  
I gassed her up climbed back in my cab  
To my wife I'm a husband, to my kids I'm a dad  
To the credit card companies I'm just another sucker  
To the IRS a long hall trucker  
  
Some say that freedoms the power do one pleases  
You can live like the devil or hold on to Jesus  
I found the one thing I was born to do  
Girl that's why I'm running back to you  
  
Freedom, sweet freedom  
  
Oooh,  
He climbed up in my truck with his green duffel bag  
I knew he was a soldier cause I saw his dog tags  
We talked about it  
We cried about it  
Then a steel horse Harley came roaring on past  
I knew it was charlie hangin' on real fast  
We talked about it  
We laughed about it  
  
Through the joy and pain that living brings  
Just know we all own the same thing  
  
Freedom, sweet freedom  
  
Its what the junkie needs that the needle can't give  
Depressed and forgotten are praying for it  
Its what the brave and courageous are fighting for  
An open sail on a distant shore  
  
Freedom

Don't really know what day it is  
Been rocking nine days in a row  
All I know is it's hurricane season  
And any minute she's gonna blow  
  
I need a shave and I need some rest  
I know some people are worried about me  
But I'm french kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Went through customs and immigration  
Still this feels like home  
I'm floating 'round through Gorda Sound  
With a cooler and a bong  
  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
  
Tonight I don't need to feel famous  
Out here all I feel is free  
  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea  
Maybe I could've been a pirate  
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be  
French kissing life square in the mouth  
Sailing out on the sea

On a hillside in Hazzard  
Sets a new double-wide  
God's little acre  
Your paradise  
  
A poor boy found heaven  
With a good country girl  
He had all he wanted  
She was his whole world  
  
But working the coal mine  
Can wear a man down  
He started spending  
Too much time in town  
  
He found temptation  
Fell under it's spell  
And hillbilly Heaven  
Went to honky tonk Hell  
  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
Somewhere in Hazzard  
On a dark, dead-end street  
Where whiskey and heartache  
And old memories meet  
  
He looks for salvation  
In a bottle each night  
And just goes on livin'  
Though he's lost his life  
  
Now there's a job in the coal mine  
That needs to be filled  
And a heartache in Hazzard  
That won't ever heal  
  
He had it all  
Now it's all for sale  
And hillbilly Heaven's  
Gone to honky tonk Hell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
From a warm home fire burning  
To a cold, cheap motel  
And an angel is crying  
'Cause her good man fell  
From hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell  
  
He's gone from hillbilly Heaven  
To honky tonk Hell

Steel drums still ringing in my head  
Well I feel pain, so I'm not dead  
From the looks of things, it looks like  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Could I get your name again?  
Some situation that we're in  
Woke up by each other's side  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Are these your shoes that I have on?  
Is this your bed, is this your home?  
All I know is it's not mine  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
I think I feel a fresh tattoo  
What is it of, I wish I knew  
It couldn't get more out of sight  
It got a little crazy last night  
  
Last thing I remember  
I told the bartender  
Mix rum and whatever you have  
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you  
So I know things can't be all that bad  
But it's still a little hazy, sounds a little shady  
I think she might have paid me, but  
It got a little crazy last night  
It got a little crazy last night  
Got a little crazy

If I quit my job for the simple life  
Honey would you stand by me  
If I bought a little cabin on a mountainside  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
Would you be my one true friend  
Stick with me through thick and thin  
If the roof was old and the rain came in  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
If I tried my luck in Hollywood  
Honey would you stand by me  
If my break never came like I thought it would  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
Would you be my heart of gold  
And never complain when the money was low  
If your coat was thin and your shoes were old  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
And if I joined up with the rodeo  
Honey would you stand by me  
If we traveled around from show to show  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
Would you be a cowboy's dream  
And smile right on when times got lean  
If you didn't have nothin' but boots and jeans  
Honey would you stand by me  
  
Honey would you stand  
Honey would you stand by me  
Honey would you stand  
Honey would you stand by me  
Honey would you stand  
Honey would you stand by me

Big orange ball, sinkin' in the water  
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter  
Little umbrella shaped margaritas  
Coconut oil, tan senioritas  
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels  
  
Hands on the wheel, cruisin' down the interstate  
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away  
I was going fast as a Rambler goes  
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes  
Now I know how Richard Petty feels  
  
I've been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun  
But there is one thing that I haven't done  
  
Saved two months, bought a little diamond  
Tonight's the night, feels like perfect timin'  
Down on one knee on momma's front steps,  
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
  
I've been around the block a time or two  
Done almost everything a boy can do  
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun  
But there is one thing that I haven't done  
  
I want to know how forever feels  
Hey, I want to know how forever feels  
Girl, I want to know how forever feels

Kenny:  
You know that restaurant on highway 1  
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun  
Where we ran in our barefeet  
Built a castle on the beach  
Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go there  
'cause that's just too much us  
I can't go there  
I still feel your touch  
There's places in my heart and here that feel as empty  
As our bed  
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs  
'cause I can't go there  
  
Remember San Francisco on that cable car  
Our reflection in the window of that store  
How we danced the night away  
With the lights out on the bay  
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go there  
'cause friscos too much us  
I can't go there  
I still feel your touch  
Now there's places in my heart and here that  
Still feel as empty as our bed  
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs  
'cause I can't go there  
  
If it was only florida or California  
Maybe I could let myself move on  
But it's everywhere we've been  
And everywhere I turn  
I can't love again  
'cause I've learned  
  
That I can't go there  
Its somethin I can't do  
I can't go there  
I'll run into you  
I can't go there  
  
Tim Mcgraw:  
When the sun shines, when it rains  
Christmas partys, football games  
  
Kenny: I can't go there  
  
Tim: Winter, summer, fall or spring  
I see you in everything  
  
I can't go there..  
Its too much us  
I can't go there

Well I finally found somebody,  
Who lives to give their love to me, only me.  
She takes away my worries,  
Shows me how true love's meant to be, what a relief.  
  
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain,  
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string.  
Danglin' you around,  
Like you got no mind all.  
  
Love don't fade when the dog days come,  
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun.  
And I finally found somebody who,  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
  
Well I finally found somebody,  
Who welcomes me with open arms, into their heart.  
Thank God, my search is over.  
I found a four-leaf clover, love took me long enough.  
  
Now love don't have to be a ball and chain,  
Or somebody pullin' on a puppet string.  
Danglin' you around,  
Like you got no mind all.  
  
Love don't fade when the dog days come,  
And hangs in tough 'til it sees the sun.  
And I finally found somebody who,  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
  
Lets that love light shine on through.  
Well I finally found somebody.  
Well I finally found somebody.  
I finally found somebody.  
I finally found somebody.

"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,  
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me  
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy  
Drivin' my first love out to the levy  
Livin' life with no sense of time  
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"  
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies  
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along  
'Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor  
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore  
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends  
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  
Takes us to another place and time  
  
So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir  
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church  
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back  
  
To the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine  
I go back (I go back)  
To watchin' summer fade to fall  
Growin' up too fast and I do recall  
I go back (I go back)  
To the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
I go back, I go back, I go back

I had a hundred dollar ring in my hand,  
So weak and tired,I can barely stand,  
From being up all night, praying she'd say yes.  
So with a hopeful heart, I hit one knee  
With a tear in her eye, she looked at me  
It was the moment of truth, I was scared to death.  
My life hung on what that tear meant,  
Then she smiled at me,  
And I lost it.  
  
[Chorus]  
No one can make me cry,  
Make me laugh,  
Make me smile,  
Or drive me mad,  
Like she does.  
It's like a curse,  
That is the cure,  
Better or worse,  
One things for sure,  
It's real love,  
And I don't know what I'd do,  
If I lost it.  
  
Well the honeymoon ended, and life began,  
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends,  
And the apartment got smaller every day.  
Then one night, the walls finally closed in,  
I came home late, she said "Where have you been?  
You used to call and tell me, "you're on your way."  
She said, "If this is how this is gonna be, then I quit."  
She walked out the door,  
I lost it.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I picked myself up off the floor,  
She walked back through the door,  
We made love like it was the first time.  
  
[Chorus]

Well, I opened my heart, and I let you in  
I promised I'd never love again  
And still doin' what I'd said I'd do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
I wear my ring on a chain now, still on my hand  
And I deal with your memories the best I can  
I've even been out on a date or two  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh, I never thought I'd see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life, but I can't take another day  
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
If I could ever feel the way I felt  
I'll take a chance with someone else  
And if my heart takes chances too  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh, I never thought I'd see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life, but I can't take another day  
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
Well, I opened my heart, and I let you in  
I promised I'd never love again  
Right now it's still somethin' I can't do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Thought it may not be til my life is through  
Someday I might get over you

I'm sittin' here alone,  
Thoughts of you run wild.  
I'm longin' for your touch,  
Haunted by your smile.  
No use tryin' to erase,  
No one could ever take your place.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I remember how it used to feel,  
Back when our love was strong and real.  
And I remember tears in your eyes,  
As I looked at you and said goodbye.  
All I want right now is to forget,  
Every single thing that I regret,  
And drown out these embers...but I remember.  
  
It's yesterday again,  
Here inside my mind.  
And I can't find a way  
To leave your love behind.  
I want to wake up to the day  
Your memory won't stand in my way.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well I want to wake up to the day  
Your memory won't stand in my way.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And I remember... ohhhhhh  
Oh I remember ya' baby...all of you my baby.

He was there when I started,  
In Knoxville Tennessee  
Hope none for patty and loveless,  
November of ninety-three  
  
Full of friends, mom, and uncle Butch  
And the crowd was really small  
He'd say I was a scared kid,  
If this bus could talk  
  
Some nights we'd dance with the devil  
Some nights we'd pray to the Lord  
Between vibrant passes and margarita glasses  
He was never really bored  
  
We were starry eyed dreamers,  
Bouncing off the wall  
And all the stories he could tell,  
If this bus could talk  
  
He'd sing of pool halls in Texas  
And have a corn dog in county fair  
Girls that we made cry,  
Some crowds that didn't care  
  
And Bobby road us down in Bama  
He kept rocking through it all  
All the stories he could tell,  
If this bus could talk  
  
Late night conversations,  
Full of drunk philosophy  
On politics and religion, football and family  
  
The lovers that we missed,  
And the lovers that we lost  
All the secrets he could share  
If this bus could talk  
  
He'd seen Virginia Beach,  
Caught in a hurricane  
He roads I wish I never met  
But he ain't naming names  
  
We learned the code of the road at the grizzly roads  
When we had a bone  
All the stories he could serve  
If this bus could talk  
  
Many years of summers,  
And I hope it never ends  
Been down so many highways,  
Full of twists and turns and bends  
  
We caught lightning in a bottle,  
Somehow we survived it all  
All the stories he could tell,  
If this bus could talk  
  
As I leave the stage,  
Still high from your applause  
He'd tell you that I love you,  
If this bus could talk  
If this bus could talk,  
If this bus could talk  
If this bus could talk

Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
You know I hate the cold  
That's why I always go  
Down south to drink some rum  
On a island in the sun  
  
There's nothing like St. Croix  
With the palm trees swaying slow  
Or being there on an open dock  
When the New Year comes and goes  
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh

We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard  
He liked sleeping out on top of the car  
He drank beer out of a mason jar  
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed.  
  
A wide frame house in a college town  
A bunch of people always hanging around  
No real problems we needed to drown  
But we tried our best anyway.  
  
We went to class just to pass the time  
Back in '89.  
  
We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet.  
  
This old guitar taught me how to score  
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch  
Mary Ann taught me a little more  
About wantin' what you can't have.  
  
Sweatshirts and flag football  
Spring breaks down in Panama  
For a while we had it all  
We never dreamed it wouldn't last.  
  
We went to class just to pass the time  
Back in '89.  
  
We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet.  
  
We all kind of went our separate ways  
But I swear it seems like yesterday.  
  
Keg in the closet, pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didn't really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet...

It's the third thatched roof on the right  
Right beside crystal blue water  
First wave of the day  
Almost got away but my sail board caught her.  
  
Funny, when you called I was thinking how good it'd be to see you again.  
The key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
  
Been here bout a month  
Not doing much of nothing at all  
  
Dodging man o wars  
Man it's hard to get bored when you're having a ball  
  
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
  
Don't bring nothing but that sunshine smile  
Come on baby stay a while, stay a while.  
  
My favorite bar's in view  
Work there a day or two just to cover my tab  
Other than that, it ain't cost me a dime for the time I've had  
The only thing I need is some company from where have you been?  
  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.  
Make yourself at home, there's a good chance I'll be gone reeling on in  
Girl, the key's in the conch shell, come on in.

She said, "You never tell me that you love me anymore  
So I can't help but wonder if you do?"  
She said, "If things don't change you'll see me walk right out that door  
'Cause I've done everything I know to do?  
I said, "I don't know just what it is you want from me?"  
She said, "I only want us back the way we used to be ?"  
Then she said  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Hold me, hold me like you want me  
Like you'll never let me go?  
She said, "Show me that you really love me"  
And then tell me  
'Cause I really need to know?  
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me?"  
  
I got down on my knees right there and I promised her I'd change  
'Cause deep inside I knew that she was right  
I said, "I know we've drifted and there's only me to blame"  
But I don't want to waste another night?  
And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start  
As I took every word she whispered straight to heart  
When she said  
  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
Hold me, hold me like you want me  
Like you'll never let me go?  
She said, "Show me that you really love me"  
And then tell me  
'Cause I really need to know?  
She said, "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me?"

Some say we're the land of misfit toys  
An insane mix of girls and boys  
Nothing really changes, like a stretch of sand time forgot  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
Well you don't lose your lover, you just lose your turn  
Drivin' on the left side gotta be learned  
Happy hour's from 3 to 6 but it never really stops  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
We got Rasta religions, and parrots and pigeons  
Mango and salt on a stick  
Life is a lime and from time to time  
I gotta go get my fix, yea  
  
We roll with the flow, friends come and go  
Usually by the edge of the dock  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
Oh, I love livin', I love livin'  
I love livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
Life on a rock  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
I love livin'  
Life on a rock

Drivin' down the road again  
A highway that never ends  
Takin' naps in my old car  
Singin' in guitar bars  
Killin' time with cafe queens  
And truckers playin' slot machines  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Charlie runs the Produce Shack  
Livin' in a van out back  
Sellin' peas and homemade syrup  
Cantaloupes and Elvis shirts  
Braggin' on future plans  
With whiskey breath and shaky hands  
I meet a lot of wannabes  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes  
To another one-night show  
'Cause that's where I was born to be  
Have guitar, will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin' this lifetime lottery  
  
Here's to faces I have seen  
A carnival of those who dream  
Rodeos seekin' fame  
Table dancers I can't name  
Willie T. in Abilene  
Karaoke's all-time king  
And every six string wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
  
Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes  
To another one-night show  
'Cause that's where I was born to be  
Have guitar, will travel light  
Here today and gone tonight  
Playin' this lifetime lottery  
  
To every dreamer I have known  
May Lady Luck take you home  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me  
I pray for every wannabe  
Dreamin' big and livin' free ... like me  
  
Livin' free like me  
Livin' free like me  
Livin' free like me

Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate  
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans  
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent  
Not a minute left for me to be me  
  
Been going like nothing can wait  
I gotta get my priorities straight  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do  
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath  
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found  
Maybe Miss Wonderful, I haven't met yet  
  
It just hit me like a wrecking ball  
She's giving me a wake up call  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot  
  
Step back, smell the rose  
Feel the sand between your toes  
Unplug, unwind  
Step out in the sunshine  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little  
  
I need to live a little, have some fun  
Take some time, waste it on number one  
Take the girl, get a map and pick any ol' dot  
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot

Saw him sittin' on a sidewalk in Fresno...  
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on.  
Talkin' to himself about Vietnam,  
About the tour he did and the deal he got.  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedence.  
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue.  
I'd be knee-deep in sand on  
A Panama Beach In the spring of '72.  
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay,  
Watchin' the tide roll in.  
He said,"What I wouldn't give just to  
Live those songs again."  
  
Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens...  
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree.  
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal,  
Cussin' Uncle Sam and the GI bill.  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He said,"This world ain't the same if you ask me.  
If I could be somewhere else,  
I'd tell you where I'd be...  
  
[Chorus:]

She comes in every morning at nine and sits down at her desk  
Smiles and says hello to everybody and tries to do her best  
To act like nothing's wrong and nothing's missin' in her life  
But her eyes tell a story  
That her smile can't disguise  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Sometimes I want to walk on over and tell her I can help  
'Cause I know losing a love is tough  
I've been there myself  
You still feel the pain long after all the tears have dried  
And it's so hard to cover up  
The hurt you feel inside  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Well I wish I could hold her right now  
And take her in my arms and show her  
That love can still be found  
  
She's got that needin' somebody, wantin' somebody who  
Will treat her like somebody for once in her life  
She's lonely for love  
Is that asking too much  
For someone to treat her right  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
She's got that lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes  
  
Somebody look in her eyes  
Lonely, needin' lovin', wantin' somebody look in her eyes

I believe there's magic here in these sails  
In the wake of these old pirate trails  
That cut through the water and the atmosphere  
I believe there is magic here  
  
It's in buried treasure under the sea  
In the music that drifts out on the street  
It's in the barflies drinking their beer  
I believe there's magic here  
  
This crazy rock has got a lot  
Of romance and sex appeal  
It's lazy days with Hemingway  
And I gotta say that it captures me still  
  
'Cause I believe there's magic in those beach side dives  
Under the moon as it's changing the tides  
Friends they go away, then they reappear  
I believe there is magic here  
  
This crazy rock has got a lot  
Of romance and sex appeal  
It's lazy days with Hemingway  
And I gotta say that it captures me still  
  
'Cause I believe there's magic in those beach side dives  
Under the moon as it's changing the tides  
Friends they go away, then they reappear  
I believe there is magic here  
  
Friends they go away, then they reappear  
I believe there is magic  
A whole lotta magic  
I believe there is magic here  
I believe there is magic  
A whole lotta magic  
I believe there is magic here

Stepped off the airplane, I saw your face  
It's been forever, but it don't feel that way  
Your hand took my hand like it knew what to do  
Girl it's so easy to be with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why we're not in love  
  
Caught up over coffee, then walked around town  
Some sidewalk singer was laying it down  
You started dancin' right there on the curb,  
Thought to myself man there's somethin' 'bout her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I been thinkin' 'bout her  
Still can't tell ya why  
All I know is that it's hard to say goodbye  
  
I got on that airplane, you got in your car  
Looked out on that city wondering where you are  
And if you're feeling like me just a little bit sad  
I already miss you, now what's up with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why we're not in love

How did I drink in here, playing the same song  
Eating potato skins  
There's nowhere to go  
We're still in Ohio  
Mountain dew  
  
Drinking Coca-Cola, eating cheeseburgers  
Where the french fries are  
Hungry for my life and putrefactive  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time, I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
That's my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
Every night I slept  
My face don't wanna turn red  
All I want to do  
I thank my friends to meet  
That I had to dream  
Mountain dew  
  
Every time, I drank it all at once  
At the restaurant  
That's my name  
I could make it after all  
Even if I drank again  
  
How did I drink in here, playing the same song  
Not another thing  
I think I'm grown up  
Making pizza crust  
Mountain dew  
Mountain dew

There must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin' a fist  
I don't call it living, I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah, there must be something I need  
Something in a cage that wants to be freed  
I should be happy but yes indeed  
There must be something I need  
  
Yeah, we live and learn, crash and burn  
'Til it's our turn again  
It's the way it's always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why can't I just let go?  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin' a fist  
I don't call it living, I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah, there must be something I crave  
I try to be good but I misbehave, well  
Maybe I'm too far gone to save  
There must be something I crave  
  
Yeah, we live and learn, crash and burn  
'Til it's our turn again  
It's the way it's always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why can't I just let go?  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed  
Yeah, there must be something I missed

Friday night butterflies  
Like clockwork they'd arrive  
A little chill and the October sky  
Nervous till the kickoff game  
4 quarters win or lose  
Spent Saturdays black and blue  
But it was what I love to do  
And it was more than just a game  
  
It was my life and it was fun  
Another season of my life is done  
Another race I'm glad I got to run  
Another chapter of my life it's over  
No I'm never gonna feel like that again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Never be as young as I was then  
No I'm never gonna feel like that again  
  
Practice dancin in my garage  
Two left feet and a white corsage  
Daddy let me borrow the dodge  
Said don't bring her home on empty  
Swung by and picked up Cindy Lou  
Took her to the prom for a dance or two  
Then we drove down to the water blue and that's where she kissed me  
  
It was my life and it was fun  
Another season of my life is done  
Another race i'm glad I got to run  
Another chapter of my life it's over  
No i'm never gonna feel like that again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Never be as young as I was then  
No i'm never gonna feel like that again  
  
I got a call one July day  
Cindy Lou was in that way  
Had a big decision to make  
And I couldn't take it lightly  
At first I thought of leavin town  
But I couldn't let our families down  
Now I'm out here throwin this ball around  
With a boy that looks just likes me  
  
Its my life and it's sure fun  
Another season of my lifes begun  
Another race I'm glad I get to run  
Another chapter of my life I'm writin  
No I'm never gonna feel like this again  
Times rushin by me like the wind  
Got to grab each moment that I can  
Cuz I'm never gonna feel like this again  
No I'm never gonna feel like this again  
Nooooooooo I'm never gonna feel like this again

I couldn't wait to turn sixteen  
And drive all the boys around  
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel  
Was all I could think about  
  
A little rust in the bed of that truck  
And a four speed on the floor  
Five hundred dollars  
It was mine all mine  
And I never wanted nothing more  
  
I took Katie down by the river  
With a six dollar bottle of wine  
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool  
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line  
  
And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell  
I'd never been that far before  
The first time's a one time feeling  
And I never wanted nothin' more  
No I never wanted nothin' more  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not  
And I'm sure happy with what I've got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And that's all I need  
  
My buddies all tried to change my mind  
But I told them that I thought it through  
Well Katie laughed and my momma cried  
When they heard me say I do  
  
Her little ring was a little thing  
But it was all that I could afford  
Now shes mine all mine  
Till the day I die  
And I never wanted nothing more  
No I never wanted nothing more  
  
Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not  
And I'm sure happy with what I've got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And that's all I need  
  
One Sunday I listened to the preacher  
And I knew he was preaching to me  
I couldn't help it I walked up front  
And I got down on my knee  
  
Right then and there I swear  
I changed when I found the Lord  
Glory Hallelujah good God Almighty  
I never wanted nothing more  
No I never wanted nothing more  
  
Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not  
And I'm sure happy with what I've got  
I live to love and laugh a lot  
And that's all I need  
  
I never wanted nothing more  
And I never wanted nothing more

I've been up to my neck  
Workin' six days a week.  
Wearin' holes in the soles  
Of the shoes on my feet.  
Been dreamin' of gettin' away  
Since I don't know.  
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico  
  
[Chorus]  
No shoes, no shirt, and no problems  
Blues, what blues?  
Hey I forgot 'em.  
The sun and the sand,  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,  
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,  
No problems.  
  
Want a towel on a chair  
In the sand by the sea,  
Want to look through my shades,  
And see you there with me.  
Want to soak up life for a while,  
In laid back mode.  
No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code  
  
No shoes, no shirt, no problems  
Blues, what blues?  
Hey I forgot 'em.  
The sun and the sand,  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,  
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,  
  
Babe lets get packed  
Tank tops and flip flops,  
If you got 'em.  
And no shoes, and no shirt, and no problems,  
No problems.

In a little town down south  
There's little plow board house  
With a wolf outside the door  
And in the bedroom there's a light  
Its been staying on all night  
For at least a month or more  
The heartaches and the bills keep coming due  
And with all they're going through  
  
[Chorus]  
Its no small miracle that love hangs on  
Hearts get weary when hope is gone  
In a world where roses wither and die  
Its no small miracle when love survives  
  
It's been uphill for a while  
But he still makes her smile  
Every now and then  
Lately they been finding out  
It's the little things that count  
And they do what they can  
He tells her he loves her everyday  
She says things will be ok  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a world where roses wither and die  
It's no small miracle when love survives

[Verse 1]  
Wrecking balls, downtown construction  
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing  
Cardboard sign says the lord is coming  
Tick, tick, tock  
Rumors turn the mills back home  
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown  
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it off, off, off  
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here  
Seems like all we ever hear is  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Verse 2]  
24 hour television, get so loud that no one listens  
Sex and money and politicians talk, talk, talk  
But there really ain't no conversation  
Ain't nothing left to the imagination  
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it stop, stop  
  
[Chorus]  
This noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Bridge]  
Every room, every house, every shade of noise  
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise  
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise  
We can't take the noise, so we just make...  
  
[Chorus]  
Noise  
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice  
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothing but noise  
Drowning out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy  
Just tryna be heard in all this noise  
  
[Outro]  
All this noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't take the noise  
Can't stand the noise  
Can't take the noise

Like an empty bottle washed up by the waves,  
Like an old scooter slipping slowly to it's grave,  
Like ghosts of old sailors caught somewhere in time,  
Like a lone palm watch the world unwind  
  
[Chorus]  
Nowhere to go and nowhere to be,  
"Trinidad Charlie" on a stool next to me,  
Reading his book bout the "have" and "have-nots,"  
In between chapters we take another shot.  
And one by one we slide from reality,  
With nowhere to go, and no where to be  
  
There's jerk chicken grilling on the grill.  
Sure feels good for some time to be still.  
Even if its only for a little while.  
Sight of the sails in the wind makes me smile.  
  
Days turn into night,  
When you're stuck in still life.  
  
[Chorus]

Sometimes I'm mad at the world  
Mad at this town  
Mad 'cause I can't lose the same five pounds  
That I've been tryin' to lose for three or four years now.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a truck that just won't run  
On the side of the road in the July sun  
There ain't another car for miles  
That I can thumb down.  
  
I guess every now and then  
You're going to land on a bad day  
Though I still do  
I know I can't complain.  
  
'Cause I love what I do  
Love where I'm at  
The stage, my band, and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin' you  
Baby, I love lovin' you.  
  
Now heaven to me it's a simple thing  
It's just you and me  
And a phone that don't ring  
Popcorn poppin' on a lay around Friday night.  
  
Seein' you smile when I wake up  
The way you slide to the middle of my pick up truck  
The way you say baby, it's all gonna be all right  
When I walk in at the end of a worn out day  
And I see you baby, how can I complain.  
  
'Cause I love what I do  
Love where I'm at  
The stage, my band, and my old black hat  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love lovin' you  
Baby, I love lovin' you  
Yes, I do.  
  
Well, I love where I've been  
I don't look back  
I thank God for the life he lets me have  
My big wool blanket  
Sleepin' in my cowboy boots  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run  
My red guitar I bang around on some  
And I love loving you  
Baby, I love lovin' you.  
  
Baby, I love  
Oh yes I do.  
Love lovin' you.  
  
I love my old bird dog  
I like to watch him run.  
  
Lovin' you...

There's a blue rocking chair  
Sittin' in the sand  
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands  
It sways back and forth with the help of the winds,  
Seems to always be there,like an old trusted friend  
  
I've read a lot of books,  
Wrote a few songs  
Looked at my life where it's goin', where it's gone  
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares  
To the way that I see it,  
To the way that I see it,  
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair  
  
From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays  
And I've watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay  
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart  
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start  
  
I've read a lot of books,  
Wrote a few songs  
Looked at my life where it's goin',where it's gone  
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares  
To the way that I see it, to the way that I see it,  
To the way that I see it when I sit in  
That old blue chair  
  
That chair was my bed one New Year's Night  
When I passed out from too much Malibu and diet  
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites,  
I swear got 'em all sittin' right there  
In that old blue chair  
  
There's a blue rockin' chair  
Sittin' in the sand  
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands

Woke up this morning my house was cold  
Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'  
Went out and hopped in my old Ford  
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'  
We've given each other some hard lessons lately  
But we ain't learnin'  
We're the same sad story that's a fact  
One step up and two steps back  
  
Bird on a wire outside my motel room  
But he ain't singin'  
Girl in white outside a church in June  
But the church bells they ain't ringing  
I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight  
But all I'm thinkin' is  
I'm the same old story same old act  
One step up and two steps back  
  
It's the same thing night on night  
Who's wrong baby who's right  
Another fight and I slam the door on  
Another battle in our dirty little war  
When I look at myself I don't see  
The man I wanted to be  
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track  
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back  
  
There's a girl across the bar  
I get the message she's sendin'  
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married  
And me well honey I'm pretending  
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms  
The music was never-ending  
We danced as the evening sky faded to black  
One step up and two steps back

We went out last night  
Like we swore we wouldn't do  
Drank to much beer last night  
A lot more than we wanted to  
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas  
Maine, Alabama, and Panama  
All mixed together and having a ball  
  
Yeah we went out last night  
One thing started leadin' to another  
Out last night  
Hittin' on everybody and their mother  
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare  
Singing "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher  
Yeah life was good everywhere  
We went out last night  
  
Well you know I'm a music man  
I grew up in East Tennessee  
But last night I was everything  
When I got a few drinks in me  
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son  
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run  
Anything I thought would get the job done  
  
Yeah we went out last night  
One thing started leadin' to another  
Out last night  
Hittin' on everybody and their mother  
There were people doin' body shots up on the bar  
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car  
Everybody was some kind of star  
When we went out last night  
  
Well the fact that I'm still breathing  
Means that I must have survived  
And that I'll live to go out with  
My friends again tonight  
  
Oh we went out last night  
One thing started leadin' to another  
Out last night  
Everybody started lovin' on each other  
They were dancin' on the tables, howlin' at the moon  
Pairing off together and pretty soon  
There was not a soul in sight  
When we went out last night

I may not have a whole lot of money  
But I got enough girl for you and me  
I'm takin' off won't you come with me honey  
Gonna take you all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
  
I want to show you the Riviera  
Got good tires and a good CB  
Put on some lipstick your mascara  
'Cause we're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
  
Baby I adore you  
And don't say I've never done nothin' for you  
Girl, that just ain't true  
  
Here we go....  
  
Baby I adore you  
And don't say I've never done nothin' for you  
Girl, that just ain't true  
  
We might not see no Eiffel Tower  
But I got a cousin that I want you to meet  
He can pick the wildwood flower  
Better'n anybody down in Paris, Tennessee  
  
We're goin' all the way to Paris, Tennessee  
Ooooh, la-la, baby  
Vous le vous  
Barbecue

It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape  
And that I've been waking up alone  
Just me and the tv and a sinking feeling  
That you ain't ever coming home  
  
But today,  
The tears ain't gonna hit the floor  
Cause the boat's in the bay  
And it's calling my name  
So I'm heading on out the door  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
When I turned the ignition  
I knew I'd be missing  
The feel of the wind on my face  
I was stuck in a habit  
  
Wondering what happened  
Two days of taking all the blame  
Got a drink, or two,  
That's as fool proof as what it will be  
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl  
Kind of making eyes at me  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah, the music's too good,  
My friends are all out  
And they're all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
I've got nothing to say  
I'll save it for a rainy day  
  
They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's  
And how'd I let you get away  
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head  
Is just gonna have to wait  
  
Cause the sun's too bright,  
The sky's too blue  
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
Yeah, the music's too good,  
My friends are all out  
And they're all too high to be bringing them down  
If they ask about you  
I've got nothing to say  
I'll save it for a rainy day  
  
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away  
Save it for a rainy day  
Save it for a rainy day

Not a day goes by that I don't tell her  
How beautiful she is  
How kind and caring, I'm always swearing  
She's the reason that I live  
  
I make it a point to point out every good thing that she does  
How she has everything I need  
And I can't get enough  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost I'd be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
Not a night goes by that I don't tell her  
I'm a lucky man  
Pull her close and let her know  
How proud of her I am  
And I'm so into her I swear  
It tears me inside out  
And I make sure she sees that she's what  
This old boy's about  
  
Well I always tell her I love her  
And how lost I'd be without her  
And God knows I mean every word  
I always tell her I love her  
But she always says it first  
  
She always says it first

If you see her down at a local bar  
Showin' all the signs of a lonely heart  
Don't you be concerned  
There ain't nothin' wrong  
It's not her fault  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
If she's on the floor for a dance or two  
Don't mean she's lookin' for a rendezvous  
She'll only be in his arms  
'Til the end of the song  
There's no harm done  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
She gets that way but I understand  
I know in her heart that I'm her only man  
And I can't stand to think of her home all alone  
  
So I really don't mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesn't have to be said  
It's a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
That's why I don't worry none  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
She gets a little restless but I don't mind  
'Cause a woman like her  
Surely deserves to have herself a real good time  
  
So I really don't mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesn't have to be said  
It's a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
That's why I don't worry none  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
No it's not her fault  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
No there's no harm done  
She gets that way when I'm gone

Sherry's living in paradise  
Slinging drinks at a bar down by the beach  
And you know she came here from LA.  
Southern California could not hold her dreams  
She's happy now it seems  
  
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise  
Chasing something or running from something  
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing  
And she's thought about leaving once or twice  
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life  
Sherry's living in paradise  
  
Sherry's living in paradise  
Somehow the salty air, it soothes her soul  
Says it makes her whole  
She gets hit on by the tourists  
But she brushes it off 'cause she's heard every line  
She just takes it in stride  
  
'Cause Sherry's living, living in paradise  
Chasing something or running from something  
Had a lot of lovers that were good for nothing  
And she's thought about leaving once or twice  
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life  
Sherry's living in paradise  
  
She's thought about leaving once or twice  
But she's still in the sun and this laid-back life  
Sherry's living in paradise

Shift work, hard work, tired bar  
Blue-collar shirt and a baseball cap  
You knew me  
  
He's hot, sweat drops, 'round the clock  
Door never locks  
Noise never stops  
Not all day  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Shift work, tough work for the convenience store clerk  
Two feet that hurt, going insane  
She's mad at some lad  
Drove off and didn't pay for his gas and he won't be the last  
'round the clock pain  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol' pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Well I work, shift work,  
Ten years man, I hated that work  
I made a break with the money I made  
It took me to the beach to have a beer by the edge of the sea  
And this 'round a clock place  
I drank my money away  
We partied  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol' pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven

Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and loved  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Sheppard's quake at the sight  
Glories stream from Heaven afar  
Heavenly ghosts sing Alleluia  
Christ the savor is born  
Christ the savor is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy night  
Son of God  
Loves pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Silent Night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and loved  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace

He was selling an old guitar at a bar  
I saw her smiling picture in his wallet  
He said "I call her 'baby' but her Christian name is Charlotte"  
  
She spends her days downtown hooked up to some machine  
The say time can heal but time can't heal everything  
The Lord's gonna take her home real soon flying on angel's wings  
  
I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay  
We're all gonna die someday  
You won't remember a single word I'm trying to say  
  
It's all a grand illusion when you think you're in control  
She's all I got left of sellin' everything I own  
There's no good in a goodbye it's the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing 'em good my friend  
  
This old guitar and case has been in a million bars  
Been a fools disciple miss dance recitals  
And the birth of every child  
Honestly honesty never goes out of style  
So sing the pain my friend  
  
So the world she's her as just desperate grey and old  
All I see is my true love my heart my life my soul  
At least for one more night, I got a beautiful wrinkled hand to hold  
So sing the truth my friend  
  
I'm gonna cry right now and that's okay  
We're all gonna die someday  
You won't remember a single word I'm tryin' to say  
  
It's all a grand illusion when you think you're in control  
She's all I got left of selling everything I own  
There's no good in a goodbye it's the beginning of the end  
I left some songs in the guitar  
Sing 'em good my friend  
  
I'm gonna sing the pain I'm in  
I'm gonna sing the truth within  
I'm gonna sing them good for my old friend  
  
Well I cried when I got in my truck so I put on my shades  
Looked up at the crimson sky as the sun began to fade  
And for the first time in a long time I swear  
I think I prayed  
  
I'm gonna sing the pain I'm in  
I'm gonna sing the truth within  
I'm gonna sing them good for my old friend  
Yeah my old friend

Honey, you think he's got an attitude  
So you treat him just a little too rude  
Buddy, you think she's a little too cold  
So you act like a two year old  
  
Don't it make you feel low, Joe?  
Don't it make you feel mean, Jean?  
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?  
Don't it make you feel small, y'all?  
  
Boy, you say something bad about her brother  
Girl, you say something mean about his mother  
Tempers flare and insults fly  
And you're both wanting to die  
  
Don't you feel like a jerk, Kirk?  
Don't you feel like a ninny, Jenny?  
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?  
Don't it make you feel small, y'all?  
  
Lady, you say you don't love him no more  
And mister, you kick down the bedroom door  
She calls you names you never heard before  
And now it's a full scale war  
  
Don't it make you feel crazy, Daisy?  
Mentally ill, Bill?  
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?  
Don't it make you feel small, y'all?  
  
Six o'clock, eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten  
The neighbors, all know that you're at it again  
And two little kids just a few feet away  
Hear every word you say  
  
Don't it make you feel bad, Dad?  
Don't it make you feel wrong, Mom?  
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?  
Don't it make you feel small, y'all?  
  
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?  
Don't it make you feel small, y'all?  
  
With a pickle in the middle  
And a mustard on top

Stuck here at a Holiday Inn near Austin, Texas  
Seen all the road that I want to see  
God I hate the snow, they even canceled the show  
Makes me long for where I really want to be  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum  
Or kickin' back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Got cold fajitas and only one channel on the TV  
Andy and Barney on Nick at night  
Seen an ad for Mexico, God I really want to go  
Anywhere out of mind and out of sight  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum  
Or kickin' back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Here's a toast to you on the coast and the sailors out at sea  
Drink your ales, hoist your sails  
Ride the winds and think of me, 'cause  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxy's Firewater rum  
Or kickin' back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldn't take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Somewhere in the sun

If you're going out with someone new  
I'm going out with someone too  
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk  
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three a.m.  
You're fighting with your mom again  
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you  
  
I won't sit outside your house  
And wait for the lights to go out  
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed  
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you  
  
Like we did on the beach last summer  
When the rain came down and we took cover  
Down in your car, out by the pier  
You laid me down, whispered in my ear  
  
"I hate my life, hold on to me  
Ah, if you ever decide to leave  
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go."  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes  
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you  
  
If you see me out on the town  
And it looks like I'm burning it down  
You won't ask and I won't say  
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you  
  
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah  
Driving around on a Saturday night  
You made fun of me for singing my song  
Got a hotel room just to turn you on  
  
You said pick me up at three a.m.  
You're fighting with your mom again  
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go  
  
I can go out every night of the week  
Can go home with anybody I meet  
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes  
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you  
  
Somewhere with you  
I'm somewhere with you  
I'm somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you  
Somewhere with you

There's a spirit of a storm in my soul  
A restlessness that I can't seem to tame  
Thunder and lightning follow everywhere I go  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul.  
  
There's a hurricane that's raging through my blood  
I can't find a way to calm the sea  
Maybe I'll find someday the waters aren't so rushed  
Right now they've got the best of me  
And oh, it's been a long, long time  
Since I had real peace of mind  
So I'm just going to sit right here  
In this old chair till this storm rolls by.  
  
Oh, maybe it's just the way I am  
Maybe I won't ever change  
So I'm just going to sit right here  
In this old chair and just soak up the rain.  
  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul  
Every time I think it's gone away  
Dark clouds gather, that old wind begins to blow  
The sun's going to shine someday I hope  
There's a spirit of a storm in my soul, in my soul.

All God's children we got to come together

Summertime is finally here  
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear  
Out on forty nine  
Man I can see the lights  
  
School's out and the nights roll in  
Man, just like a long lost friend  
You ain't seen in a while  
And can't help but smile  
  
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime  
  
Temperature says ninety three  
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee  
But that swimmin' hole  
It's nice and cold  
  
Bikini bottoms underneath  
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat  
When them girls shimmy off  
Them old cutoffs  
  
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Don't matter how old you are  
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Yeah baby when you got  
  
Two bare feet on the dashboard  
Young love and an old Ford  
Cheap shades and a tattoo  
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard  
  
Perfect song on the radio  
Sing along 'cause it's one we know  
It's a smile, it's a kiss  
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime  
Sweet summertime

If it weren't for kids have you ever thought  
There wouldn't be no Santa Clause  
Look what the store just brought  
Thank God for Kids  
  
We'd all live in a quiet house  
Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse  
And cool-aid on the couch  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for kids there's magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
Daddy how does this thing fly?  
A hundred other where's and why's  
You really don't know but we try  
Thank God for Kids  
  
When you look down in those trusting eyes  
That look to you, you realize  
Its love that you can't buy  
Thank God for Kids  
  
Thank God for there's magic for a while  
A special kind of sunshine in a smile  
Do you ever stop to think? or wonder why?  
The dearest thing to Heaven is a child  
  
When you get down on your knees tonight  
To thank the Lord for his guiding light  
And pray they turn out right  
Thank God for Kids

Up in the morning  
Out on the job  
Work like the devil for my pay  
Lucky old sun  
Aint got nothing to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Fuss with my woman  
Toil for my kids  
Sweat til I am wrinkled and grey  
But that lucky old sun  
Aint got nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear lord above  
Can't you see I'm cryin  
Tears are in my eyes  
Send down a cloud with a silver lining  
Take me to paradise  
  
Show me that river  
Lead me across  
And take all my troubles away  
Like the lucky old sun  
I'll have nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear lord above  
Can't you see I'm cryin  
Tears are in my eyes  
Send down a cloud with a silver lining  
Take me to paradise  
  
Show me that river  
Lead me across  
And take all my troubles away  
Like the lucky old sun  
I'll have nothin to do  
Roll around heaven all day  
  
But roll around heaven all day...

Get ready for the big revival  
Get ready for the big revival  
  
Get ready for the big revival  
Everybody get in the van  
There's a little church on Eagle Mountain  
It's called The Blood of the Blessed Land  
If your faith ain't strong enough, child, you might wind up dead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
Now Reverend Jones, he struts and dances  
While the guitar plays Amazing Grace  
He testifies in tongues of fire  
With tears of joy running down his face  
He ain't sure and we ain't sure exactly what he said  
But praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
  
[Bridge]  
You won't find many hypocrites that'll take the chance on getting bit  
(The big revival, the big revival, the big revival, the big revival)  
But a true believer can survive rattlesnakes and cyanide  
  
Now when you hold that deadly viper  
Keep the holy spirit in your mind  
Do not lose your concentration  
That serpent's surely bound to strike  
Either way you won't forget the first time that you said  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead  
Praise the Lord and pass me a Copperhead

When I feel that chill, smell that fresh cut grass  
I'm back in my helmet, cleats, and shoulder pads  
Standing in the huddle, listening to the call  
Fans going crazy for the boys of fall  
  
They didn't let just anybody in that club  
Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood  
To get to wear those game-day jerseys down the hall  
The kings of the school, man, we're the boys of fall  
  
Well it's turn to face the stars and stripes  
It's fighting back them butterflies  
It's call it in the air, alright  
Yes sir, we want the ball  
And it's knocking heads and talking trash  
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass  
It's I got your number, I got your back  
When your back's against the wall  
You mess with one man, you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
In little towns like mine, that's all they've got  
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops  
The old men will always think they know it all  
Young girls will dream about the boys of fall  
  
Well it's turn and face the stars and stripes  
It's fighting back them butterflies  
It's call it in the air, alright  
Yes sir, we want the ball  
And it's knocking heads and talking trash  
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass  
It's I got your number, I got your back  
When your back's against the wall  
You mess with one man, you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
Well it's turn and face the stars and stripes  
It's fighting back them butterflies  
It's call it in the air, alright  
Yes sir, we want the ball  
And it's knocking heads and talking trash  
It's slinging mud and dirt and grass  
It's I got your number, I got your back  
When your back's against the wall  
You mess with one man, you got us all  
The boys of fall  
  
We're the boys of fall  
We're the boys of fall

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight  
So I drove around till I saw the neon light  
The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up.  
Not a soul around but the old bar keep  
Down at the end lookin' half asleep  
But he walked up and said, what'll it be?  
I said the good stuff.  
He didn't reach around for the whiskey.  
He didn't pour me a beer.  
His blue eyes kinda went misty.  
He said you can't find that here.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date.  
Momma's all worried when you get home late  
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate  
'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much  
And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair.  
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year  
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up  
Yeah man, that's the good stuff.  
  
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass.  
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that.  
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends.  
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare.  
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair  
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed.  
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me.  
But I've been sober three years now  
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey  
  
Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl  
The way she adored that string of pearls  
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl  
Married his high school love.  
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa.  
Bein' right there as our time got small  
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up  
Yeah man that's the good stuff.  
  
He said, when you get home she'll start to cry.  
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I.  
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up  
'Cause that's the good stuff.  
  
That's the good stuff.

It was early one morning  
Playa del Carmen  
That's when I first met Jose  
He had a 12 foot Schooner  
A 3 foot cooler  
Full of the catch of the day  
And he was wrinkled from grinning  
From all of the sun he had been in  
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand  
He said "Gracias senor", when I paid him too much for  
All of the Snapper he had  
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing  
In the best broken Spanish I knew  
I said I make a good living  
Back home where I'm from  
He smiled and said Amigo me too  
  
He said I fish and I play my guitar  
I laugh at the bar with my friends  
I go home to my wife  
I pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Somewhere over Texas  
I thought of my Lexus  
And all the stuff I work so hard for  
And all the things that I've gathered  
From climbing that ladder  
Didn't make much sense anymore  
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet  
They keep holding my feet to the fire  
They call it paying the price  
So that one day in life  
I'll have what I need to retire  
  
And just fish  
And play my guitar  
And laugh at the bar with my friends  
And go home to my wife  
And pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made  
When the truth is I'm really just dying  
To live like Jose  
  
And just fish  
Play my guitar  
Laugh at the bar with my friends  
Go home to my wife  
Pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Wouldn't that be the life?  
Wouldn't that be the life?

Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio  
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know  
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles  
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while  
  
Clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
  
Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed  
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette  
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme  
Threw up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign  
  
And some clarity and inspiration  
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find  
It may take some time  
But in my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
  
In my mind there's something more  
And I'll open up a brand new door  
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind  
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
  
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ...  
The road and the radio  
The road and the radio  
Mmmm-mmm-mmm ...

A fat man who was chubby that really ate too much  
How I could that I eat again  
Then I didn't want to die from my heart attack  
And this weightiness hunger can exercise again  
  
It's time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And I'll never eat again  
I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food  
  
I couldn't have some chocolate pudding  
You ate some of this again  
Even now I rode an exercise bike  
But I know I don't be gaining  
'Cause as I'm jogging my body  
The fat is gone that I never eat again  
  
It's time for me  
I thought I was the thin man  
You should weigh some more of this  
And I'll never eat again  
I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food  
  
(Refrain)  
Yes, I'll be overweight, got to be the thin man  
And I should've pumped more blood, and I couldn't eat more food

She hit the door 6:55 sack full of groceries split down the side.  
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb.  
Look on her face saying don't say a word.  
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing.  
Western sky all turning red.  
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said:  
  
Been gopherin', chaufferin', company chairmen.  
Coffee maker, copy repairman.  
Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that I don't do.  
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.  
Dancing backwards in high heels.  
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you  
  
She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize
me.  
I was gonna run the bank.  
I was gonna run the map.  
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath.  
Back then you know I had this plan.  
Before all of this reality set in.  
Here comes life boy ready or not.  
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got.  
  
'Cause I'm gopherin', chaufferin', company chairmen.  
Coffee maker, copy repairman.  
Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that  
I don't do.  
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.  
Dancing backwards in high heels.  
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you.  
  
She said I'm gopherin', chaufferin', company chairmen.  
Coffee maker, copy repairman.  
Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that I don't do.  
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.  
Dancing backwards in high heels.  
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.  
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman the woman with you.  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
The woman with you

All he could think about was I'm to young for this  
Got my whole life ahead  
Hell I'm just a kid myself  
How'm I gonna raise one  
  
All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke  
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast  
Oh well, those plans are long gone  
  
And he said  
There goes my life  
There goes my future, my everything  
Might as well kiss it all good-bye  
There goes my life  
  
A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later  
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator  
Oh yeah...he loves that little girl.  
  
Momma's waiting to tuck her in  
As she stumbles up those stairs  
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear  
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls  
  
He smiles  
There goes my life  
There goes my future my everything  
I love you, daddy goodnight  
There goes my life  
  
She had that Honda loaded down  
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American express  
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go  
She hugged them both and headed off to the west coast  
  
He cried  
There goes my life  
There goes my future, my everything  
I love you  
Baby good-bye  
  
There goes my life  
There goes my life

(Verse)  
Got nowhere to go and how am I to get there  
But I'm goin' there with you  
Tonight we're runnin' on luck  
If we're gonna use it all there's only one thing left to do  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Verse 2)  
You look way 2 good and this feels way 2 right  
It's been way 2 long to start  
But it's sure worth drinkin' to, so baby here's to you  
I don't wanna waste a drop  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
(Bridge)  
One life, one chance!  
One ticket to the big dance!  
You and me still holdin' on  
Ride it down to the last song  
  
(Chorus)  
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in  
Twirl you around till my head spins  
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin  
Till it's gone, till it's gone  
Break every rule we eva learned  
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn  
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone  
Till it's gone, till it's gone...  
  
(Outro)  
I'm gonna drink it all up  
Till it's gone, then it's gone, it is gone

So you got a little heartbreak  
Feeling like a dumb chump  
Laying in left field  
Can't believe you got dumped  
Everything gone wrong  
But you're listening to the right song  
  
Grab yourself a cheap seat  
Floating or flying  
Anything southbound  
Heading to the islands  
Grab a little white sand  
Maybe get your blues tanned  
  
Riptides rippin'  
The sunset's dippin'  
You smile that smile  
Keep on sippin'  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
When you're feeling numb  
Time flies  
When you're having rum  
When you're having rum  
  
Yeah, you find a little beach bar  
Down on the water  
Sail away the Captain  
Feeling Jolly Roger  
Talking to a cutie  
Heading for the booty  
  
Riptides rippin'  
The sunset's dippin'  
You smile that smile  
You'll be saying  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
Yeah, when you're getting some  
Time flies  
When you're having rum  
When you're having rum  
  
Yeah  
  
Riptides rippin'  
The sunset's dippin'  
You smile that smile  
You'll be saying  
  
Time flies  
Yeah, when your in the sun  
Yeah, when you're feeling numb  
Time flies  
  
Time flies  
Sitting in the sun  
Yeah, when you're getting some  
  
Time flies  
When you're having rum  
When you're having rum  
When you're getting some  
When you're feeling numb

Put off the mail and I  
Left on a light and I  
Locked up the house and I  
Jumped on a flight and I'm  
Still by myself but I'm  
Thinking more clear if I'm  
Gonna be down, gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
Where no one will ask cause nobody knows  
That you're not in my life anymore  
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
Untied my lines and I  
Slid through the sound and I  
Mixed me a drink now I  
Sit on the bow and I'm  
Watching the sun just like you'll disappear  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down way down here  
Way down here  
  
If you want me back now  
I can be found  
Way down here  
If I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down  
Way down here

I keep tellin' myself this is the right thing to do  
I was wastin' her time, waitin' on dreams that just weren't comin' true  
And this old highway seems to understand  
Leadin' me on to somewhere that no one knows my name  
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up  
I'm doin' all that I can to get my mind off us  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her, take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard  
But I drive on, and on, and on  
  
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue  
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do  
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee  
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep  
Now the sun's goin' down on my broken heart  
Lord, I gotta go back before I get too far  
  
What I need to do is turn this car around  
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown  
And run to her, take her in my arms  
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard  
But I drive on, and on, and on  
  
But I drive on  
Yes I drive on, and on, and on  
  
Knowin' what I need to do  
Girl, I'm comin' home to you  
  
Knowin' what I need to do  
Girl I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you  
Knowin' what I need to do...

Well, I've been drawing little hearts in the morning paper  
Lookin' for a house an' a couple of acres  
You'll be mine some time, sooner or later and I can't wait  
  
Like a busy ol' bee savin' up it's honey  
Honey I'm savin' up all my money  
To have you I'll do anything I have to, whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
  
Well I've been yellin' your name from a lookout mountain  
Tossing my pennies in a downtown fountain  
Makin' my wishes I'm hopin' they're countin' for love's sake  
  
I swim upstream in a ragin' river  
Walk through fire do you get the picture  
I swear I bare anything to get there Whatever it takes  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
  
Whatever it takes to win your love  
I hire me an airplane, have it paint your name up in the sky above  
Yeah I tell the world I'm yours, put it on a billboard out on the interstate  
If it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.  
Well if it takes forever to get us together  
Honey I'll do whatever it takes.

Well I see the souls of so many friends  
And I see us all back here again  
With sandy floors and ceiling fans  
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs  
That fill my memories like a tip jar  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
I see tourists at Christmas time  
And I taste beers with a hint of lime  
I feel lonely 'cause it's not the same  
Different faces and different names  
Living like pirates out among the stars  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
And I see a kid coming into his own  
And a man learning to move on  
Somehow trying to find his way  
A dreamer betting on blind faith  
Chasing that sun and following his heart  
Yeah, that's what I see  
When I see this bar  
  
Pieces of our past slowly slip away  
But time just stands still when I walk in this place  
  
A few have moved on back to Maine  
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne  
Some are still living the dream  
Stuck in still life it seems  
No matter where they've been  
Or where they are  
Yeah, I see 'em here  
When I see this bar  
When I see this bar  
  
I wonder where we go from here  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
Life ain't over but it's always near  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
I think about all the good times that we had  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
Makes me happy and it makes me sad  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
How could we be so close, now so far apart  
(That's what I see when I see this bar)  
That's what I feel, that's what I see  
Yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars  
That's what I see when I see this bar  
  
That's what I see when I see this bar

You know some times me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it
makes me wonder  
Are we're ever gonna get it right  
  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
What my life would be like if I were back to being free  
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer
to  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
  
You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had
all he could  
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye  
  
When I think about leaving I think about him  
That little apartment cross town he's living in  
Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other
weekend  
When I think about leaving oh I think about him  
  
I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he
walked out on her  
And her mom when she was just a kid  
  
When I think about leaving oh I think about her  
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt  
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are
you coming  
Back  
When I think about leaving I think about her  
  
You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we
got something  
Special  
When I think about leaving I think about us  
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender
way we touch,  
All those nights we spent making love,  
When I think about leaving oh I think about us  
  
When I think about leaving I think again  
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then  
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would
rather be  
When I think about leaving I think again  
  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving: I think again

Sun tan toes, ticklin' the sand,  
Cold drink chillin' in my right hand,  
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light,  
Restin' up for a long long night.  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',  
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,  
When the sun sinks down, over the water,  
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.  
  
All day long, just taking it easy,  
Laying in a hammock, where it's nice and breezy,  
Been sleepin' off the night before, 'cause when the sun goes down,  
We'll be back for more.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
This old guitar,and my dark sunglasses,  
This sweet concoction is as smooth as molasses,  
Nothing to do, but breath all day,  
Until the big moon rises and its time to play.  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]  
  
When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',  
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright,  
When the sun sinks down, over the water,  
She thinks crackers sexy when the sun goes down.

There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house  
Where Mama used to measure us  
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised  
But that ain't where I grew up  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
The summer my Granddaddy died  
The first time I saw Mama cry  
Man, that sure was tough  
  
Felt like I put on a few years  
Watching Daddy wipe her tears  
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud  
That's where I grew up  
  
My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank  
Getting a head start on twenty one  
That's the place that made me feel just like a man  
But that ain't where I grew up, no  
  
See I gained a little on Father Time  
That night I crossed that center line  
I bet I rolled a dozen times  
  
Next thing I knew I was waking up upside down  
Praying "God, just get me out"  
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck  
Hey, that's where I grew up  
  
You learn as you go, that's how you grow  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
When me and her, had our first big fight  
I said some things, I made her cry  
She packed all her stuff  
  
The boy in me said let her go  
But the man in me said pull her close  
It was time to find out which one I was  
Standing in a doorway holding on to love  
  
That's where I grew up  
Oh, that's where I grew up

White Lightnin'  
(Written by S. Wooley)  
  
Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills  
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still  
He brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down  
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around  
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well the "G" men "T" men revenuers, too  
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew  
They were looking, tryin to book him,  
But my pappy kept a-cookin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew  
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin' started clashin'...  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Well a city slicker came and he said "I'm tough"  
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff  
He took one slug and drank it on down  
And I heard him a moanin' as he hit the ground  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin started clashin'  
Mmmmm.... White lightnin'  
  
(repeat chorus)

Sunny days seem to hurt the most  
I wear the pain like a heavy coat  
I feel you everywhere I go  
I see your smile, I see your face  
I hear you laughing in the rain  
I still can't believe you're gone  
  
It ain't fair you died too young  
Like a story that had just begun  
But death tore the pages all away  
God knows how I miss you  
All the hell that I've been through  
Just knowing no one could take your place  
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today  
  
Would you see the world, would you chase your dreams  
Settle down with a family  
I wonder what would you name your babies  
Some days the sky's so blue  
I feel like I can talk to you  
I know it might sound crazy  
  
It ain't fair you died too young  
Like a story that had just begun  
But death tore the pages all away  
God knows how I miss you  
All the hell that I've been through  
Just knowing no one could take your place  
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today  
  
Today, today, today  
Today, today, today  
  
Sunny days seem to hurt the most  
I wear the pain like a heavy coat  
The only thing that gives me hope  
Is I know I'll see you again someday  
  
Someday, someday

Looks like a roll and a thrift store dress  
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess  
She goes where the wind suggests she goes,  
Who knows?  
  
Got a spirit that can't be tamed  
She's a calico pony on an open plain  
I know I'll never be the same no more,  
For sure  
  
She's a wild child,  
Got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
You're falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
Never heard of her favorite band unless you  
Been to bono roux or burning man  
She's penny lane in a Chevy van,  
She loves to love  
  
She loves me  
Wild child, got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
You're falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
She'll be here until she runs  
Some just have to chase the sun  
  
She's a wild child,  
Got a rebel soul and a whole lot of gypsy  
Wild style,  
She can't be tied down  
But for a while  
  
Be falling free and so in love  
I'll break my heart  
But God she drives me  
Wild child  
  
A kaleidoscope of colors in her wild shot  
A touch of crazy hides behind her wild smile  
So simple yet experimental  
Innocent but still a little wild child  
Wild child

I walked in, there sat Slim  
Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin  
Mr. Pain grabbed my arm and pulled me aside  
And said kid are you ready for the wild ride  
  
I looked up, there she stood  
I say, didn't look so great, I say you look good  
Aww she took her hand ran it up my thigh  
And said, cowboy you ready for the wild ride  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on now junior take a wild ride (wild ride)  
See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Things start breakin' on the wild ride (wild ride)  
Yes it does  
  
Out on the highway, I saw my mind  
In tiny little pieces blown from side to side  
My heart was shattered along with my pride  
Guess you can't keep 'em on the wild ride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was crawling cross the floor, I was tryin' to leave  
When I felt something tugging what was left of my sleeve  
I heard a little voice with a gold plated vibe  
Say I bought a ticket for the wild ride  
  
[Chorus x2]

Baby, here I am again  
Kicking dust in the canyon wind  
Waiting for that sun to go down  
Made it up Mulholland Drive  
Hell bent on getting high  
High above the lights of town  
  
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
  
Thirty days and thirty nights  
Been putting up a real good fight  
And there were times I thought you'd win  
It's so easy to forget  
The bitter taste the morning left  
Swore I wouldn't go back there again  
  
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
  
When it comes to you  
Oh, the damage I could do  
It's always your favorite sins, that do you in  
  
You and Tequila make me crazy  
Run like poison in my blood  
One more night could kill me, baby  
One is one too many, one more is never enough  
Never enough, you and tequila, you and tequila make me crazy

One word, that's all was said,  
Something in your voice called me, caused me to turn my head.  
Your smile just captured me, you were in my future as far as I could see.  
And I don't know how it happened, but it happens still.  
You ask me if I love you, if I always will  
  
Well, you had me from "Hello"  
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes,  
You won me, it was over from the start.  
You completely stole my heart, and now you won't let go.  
I never even had a chance you know?  
You had me from "Hello"  
  
Inside I built a wall so high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall.  
One touch, you brought it down  
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground  
And I swore to me that I wasn't going to love again  
The last time was the last time I'd let someone in  
  
Well, you had me from "Hello"  
I felt love start to grow the moment I looked into your eyes,  
You won me, it was over from the start.  
You completely stole my heart, and now you won't let go.  
I never even had a chance you know?  
You had me from "Hello"  
  
That's all you said  
Something in your voice calls me, caused me to turn my head  
You had me from "Hello"  
You had me from "Hello"  
Girl, I've loved you from "Hello"

Nothing left, no regrets  
No hard feelings wish you all the best  
No blame, no shame  
Just time to say it's over I guess  
We both agree it's the right thing  
The only thing left to do  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
Sometimes love don't work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didn't start out to say goodbye  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
You take yours, I'll take mine  
We'll leave nothing but the memories behind  
Of a love, and a dream  
That just somehow faded with time  
You say you're goin' your way  
I'm goin' somewhere too  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
Sometimes love don't work out  
No matter how hard you try  
Lord knows we didn't start out to say goodbye  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
If it's a win-win situation  
Then why am I feelin' so blue  
You win, I win, we lose  
  
If you win, and I win, we lose  
We lose

Lookin' back now well it makes me laugh,  
We were growin' our hair,  
We were cuttin' class,  
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,  
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn.  
  
Listenin' to our music just a little too loud,  
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,  
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,  
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear,  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast, just like that,  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young  
  
Talked a good game, we were right with the guys  
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy  
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,  
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast, just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young, young  
  
Yeah and wishing we were older  
Young  
Hey I wish it wasn't over  
  
Man I don't know where the time goes,  
But it sure goes fast, just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done  
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly  
Young, young  
  
Hey and wishing we were older  
And I wish it wasn't over
