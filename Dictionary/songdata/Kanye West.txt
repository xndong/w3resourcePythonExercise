To my surprise, a nigga replacing me  
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (All of the lights)

Her mother, brother, Grandmother hate me in that order  
Public visitation  
We met at Borders  
Told her she take me back

Courts suck me dry  
I spent that bread  
She need a daddy  
Baby please,  
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (All of the lights)  
  
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights

It's amazing  
I'm the reason  
Everybody fired up this evening  
  
I'm exhausted  
Barely breathing  
Holding on to what I believe in  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)  
  
I'm a monster  
I'm a killer  
I know I'm wrong, yeah  
  
I'm a problem  
That'll never  
Ever be solved  
  
And no matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a monster  
I'm a maven  
I know this world is changin'  
  
Never gave in  
Never gave up  
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of  
  
No matter what  
You'll never take that from me  
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

If i ain't on my grind  
Then what you call that?  
  
Victorious  
Yeah we warriors  
We make history  
Strive for victory  
Standing at my podium  
I'm trying watch my sodium  
Die high blood pressure  
You even let the feds get cha!  
I'm amazin'  
Born on the full moon  
I was bred to get in  
No spoon  
That's why I'm so goose  
Summer time, no juice  
Big family, small house no rooms  
They like oh god!  
why you go so hard?  
Look what he's been through  
He deserves an applause  
  
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' [Repeat: x3]

It don't really matter what you do

[Verse 1]  
There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
We ball til we fall  
Hit the mall  
After we  
Hit don't call  
We fill your lives  
With nothing but lies  
And I would like to  
Apologize  
  
But you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is going to be alright  
Cause until the day a real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No no, you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
Cause until that real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)  

[Verse:]  
You don't need me to ever write  
I read your last message at least 1000 times  
At least 1000, at least 1000 times  
Alright, alright, alright  
Why did you ever listen to  
People trying to hate on you  
At least you know that's nothing new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
So awesome  
You look too good to be at work  
You feel too good to ever hurt  
I hope you ready for tonight  
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert  
You can't be still  
You gotta move, you gotta dance  
I gotta live, I gotta love  
I got a hope, I got a chance  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
You don't need to listen to your manager  
You're way too hot for them to handle you  
Baby, not doing nothing? You  
Came for something that I've got it  
Why you fallin' on me  
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park  
You're so after dark  
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right  
Oh, you nnannanaa  
I know you must be tired  
From running through my mind  
Can I come inside?  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Also, I'm also awesome, also

Y'all know  
And I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park, you're so after time  
You're so breaking?, oh it feels so right

Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now  
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?  
She say she only here for her girl birthday  
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty  
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty  
I know I got a bad reputation  
Walking 'round, always mad reputation  
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation  
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation  
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement  
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining  
How you gon' be mad on vacation?  
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans  
Uh, this that prom shit  
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit  
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit  
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch  
  
I know you're tired of loving, of loving  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures  
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, bound  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink  
After that, give you something to drink  
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink  
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?  
Hey, you remember where we first met?  
Okay, I don't remember where we first met  
But hey, admitting is the first step  
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect  
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep  
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect  
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving  
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas  
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist  
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?  
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps  
But first, you gon' remember how to forget  
After all these long-ass verses  
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept  
  
I know you're tired of loving, of loving  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody  
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party  
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)  
  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth  
  
Bound to fall in love  
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up  
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters  
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "heat" It Up  
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front  
I make history E'ry day - I don't need a month  
The survey says - by the streets according  
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan  
Was to the Nba when he was scorin'  
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and...

Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  
  
Why you actin' all  
Shy and all  
Why is y'all

"I never did this before"  
Stop that  
What, you want some patron?

I mean I promise y'all  
You fine and all  
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw  
But she not like you  
No, she not like you  
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue  
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol  
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all  
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off  
But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some Cris and some Mo  
And we about to let it flow  
Had some problems before but see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that dro  
And we about to let it blow  
  
Yeah, you know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that, I grab yo ass  
  
See you know my style  
I'm very wild  
And I vow that my child will be well endowed  
Like his daddy  
And tell him that your mama had a fattie  
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"  
Yep, we was practicing  
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging  
You know what though? You my favorite accident  
So go head pop some Cristal  
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all  
  
Know what this is  
It's a celebration, bitches!  
Grab a drink, grab a glass  
After that I grab yo ass  
But, I just thought you should know  
We hit the liquor store  
Got some cris and some mo  
And we about to let it flow  
Had some problems before but see we let em go  
Got an ounce of that dro  
And we about to let it blow  
  
Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!

(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?  
You don't see just how fly my style is?  
I don't see why I need a stylist  
When I shop so much I can speak Italian  
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids  
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects  
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit  
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"  
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son  
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones  
'Cause every summer he'll get some  
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from  
And I don't know what he did for dough  
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live  
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious  
Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
  
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'  
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'  
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion  
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'  
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?  
I guess me if it isn't you  
Last week I paid a visit to the institute  
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school  
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do  
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle  
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems  
Like I dropped out of P.E.  
They used to feel invisible  
Now they know they invincible  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
This is the story of a champion  
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns  
Stand up stand up! Here he comes  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
Tell me what it takes to be number one?  
  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)  
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib  
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live

Mm hm, that's that shit  
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this  
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)

Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought  
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out  
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about  
And they still want to know when the album comin? out  
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters  
Everybody co-signing even non-believers  
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas, made you look, before the haters  
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus  
This is classic  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Kanye West:]  
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness  
It?s performin?, look how long the line is  
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless  
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?  
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened
to my pace  
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I
expected it  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Nas:]  
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this  
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur
night is show time  
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you
could afford it the car ain?t important  
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment  
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty
for doing wrong  
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[KRS One:]  
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded  
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect  
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop  
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?  
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear
more local MC?s  
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and
rap  
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they
people  
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One  

Kanye West! (Swag King Cole) DJ Khaled!  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without no drawers?  
  
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik  
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music  
In the projects one day, to Project Runway  
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it  
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up  
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it  
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid  
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!  
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute  
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!  
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you  
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more? (ah)  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without no drawers?  
  
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick  
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz  
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim  
Around the same time she had fell in love with him  
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang  
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team  
La Familia, Roc Nation  
We in the building, we still keep it basement  
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute  
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news  
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you  
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you  
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh  
Anything else, we detest, detest  
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts  
All that said, let me ask this quest'  
  
Can't a young nigga get money any more?  
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor  
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws  
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga,  
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you  
Way too cold, I promise you'll need some theraflu  
  
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the theraflu  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the theraflu  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh uh) Get the theraflu

On lonely nights I start to fade  
(On lonely nights I start to fade)  
Her love is a thousand miles away  
(Her love is a thousand miles away)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
  
It's 4am and I can't sleep  
(It's 4am and I can't sleep)  
Her love is all that I can see  
(Her love is all that I can see)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Winter, winter  
  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
If spring can take the snow away  
(If spring can take the snow away)  
Can it melt away all of our mistakes  
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes)  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again  
  
Never again

[Chorus]  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(That's that crack music nigga)  
(That real black music nigga)  
  
How we stop the black panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that?  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit  
We ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a, home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look there's hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?  
  
That's that crack music, crack music  
That real black music, black music  
  
That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
  
That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music  
  
Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our
daily bread  
See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's  
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use
it

[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Lupe Fiasco]  
Head to the sky, wings raised in  
She's about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground  
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around  
But aint no going back, this is how it must be  
He told her, she'll be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly  
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that, because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her  
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter, it opens up another part  
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)  
  
[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
[Kanye West]  
Don't let me hold you back  
I only hold you back  
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac  
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye  
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet  
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best 'Ye  
You see it all in my veins, like varicose  
I know that's very gross but we getting very close  
To our end, though I killed most with a pen  
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin  
  
[Mos Def]  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial  
  
How could you do it  
How could you do it  
  
[Big Sean]  
Okay now baby here we go, we go  
No baby, me go  
You got my heart  
Baby this what it be for  
I give it all as far as my feet go  
What do you mean, me go  
Why can't it be, we go  
What happens when people turn to tears  
Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years  
Huh? Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks  
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man, our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me  
Now I'm testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One, two, three, four, five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday  
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask "Y" sometimes like a f-cking vowel  
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.  
So I could see you smile  
  
I-I know you can see me now  
  
[Mos Def]  
  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do  
Don't look down, it's an impossible view  
Spread your wings, aerial

But come, get some, you little bums

I bake the cake, get two of them for one  
Then I move the weight like I'm Oprah's son  
Uh, I'll show you how to do this son  
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings  
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (you-uh)  
He padded hisself the rap J. F. K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis  
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class  
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask  
Have you in your long-legged life  
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?  
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice  
'Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light  
Need a light?

[Jay-Z]  
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo  
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos  
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough  
When they see him, whips be European  
If you're a ten, chances you're with him  
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them  
Sick with the pen nigga, no physician in the world could fix him  
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction  
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'  
You can't rain dance on his picnic  
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness  
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you cb-4  
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the are. O. C. Bitch  
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!  
  
[Hook:]

[Verse Three: Kanye West]  
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin  
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics  
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out  
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother  
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?  
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group  
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo  
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals  
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials  
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential  
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential  
That have fun breakin her fundamentals  
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium  
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium  
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney  
And Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam  
  
[Hook:]  
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la  
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la  
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five  
It's the are. O. C. Bitch, sing our lullaby  
C'mon!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit  
You should come, hang with me, basically  
Whoa, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal  
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal  
This game you could never win  
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again  
Get away from me misery  
Get away from me lonliness  
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness  
Get away from me wack tracks  
I can only make only hits  
I'm an only child lost in the World  
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring  
It's Feeling like hell rings  
Bringing me back down  
Checking my background  
It's ironic what's happening  
Imagine if I didn't have the ends  
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends  
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk  
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk  
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more  
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore  
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him  
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again  
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul  
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed  
  
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now  
Feeling like my life froze  
I'm about to hit the ground  
  
I sold my soul to the devil,  
I know it's a crappy deal,  
At least it came with a few toys,  
Like a Happy Meal,  
I'm spaced out dog,  
I be on that moontalk,  
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?  
You know the entertainment Angels  
Adriana for Giselle,  
Lets exchange Angels  
Photoshoot at my crib,  
Lets exchange angles  
Rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles,  
I'm so anxious I'm gettin anxiety  
Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me,  
They say I've been an asshole,  
I said if you acquire me,  
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting  
Give me your herbal chai tea  
I'll be calm as Tai Chi  
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T  
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off,  
I'm Paranoid Like bonin' Raw dog  
And wakin up with a slight cough  
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft  
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off  
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off  
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

[Intro: Father's Children]  
Dirt and grime and filth inside  
The story of my lifetime

What if we fucked right in the middle  
Of this motherfuckin' dinner table

Shut down the whole party  
Would everybody stop buggin'?

I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's  
I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called "I miss the old Kanye"  
Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye  
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

Flashing lights, lights  
Flashing lights, lights  
Flashing lights, lights  
  
She don't believe in shootin' stars

Wood floors in the new apartment  
Couture from the store's department

Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit  
They don't want black people to think at trial  
He think he live  
  
(Common)  
He think he live, he think he cold  
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode  
Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts  
The streets are like the high road that I go across  
  
(Kanye)  
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets  
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week  
And the weather wasn't barely hot

Sellin' kilos through your ipod nano  
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal  
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle  
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires  
Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers  
Euro tank top, Dior inspired  
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required

A nigga seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall  
Mc hunting season, putting heads up on the wall

Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers  
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs  
All over double Ds, I be absent all week  
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for  
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door  
Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring?  
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything

Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"  
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz  
Having' money's the everything that having' it is  
I was splurging' on trizz  
But when I get my card back activated  
I'm back to Vegas cause  
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it  
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life  
  
Is the good life better than the life I live  
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy  
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby  
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky  
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh

On this day we become legendary  
Everything we dreamed of  
I'm like a fly Malcolm X  
Buy any jeans necessary  
Detroit wear cleaned up  
From the streets of the league  
From an eighth to a key  
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets  
From the moments of pain  
Look how far we done came  
Haters sayin' ya changed  
Now ya doin' ya thang  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future  
While I hop in the Delorean  
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student  
Some people graduate, but we still stupid  
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around  
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus  
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness  
After all of that, you receive this

My people, no goodbyes to you

Right now I can see it so vivid  
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it  
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip  
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits  
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that  
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph  
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh  
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass  
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'  
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'  
What do it mean when you never dream at all then  
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them  
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to  
People you never got a chance to say bye to  
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams  
Into real life, if you try to  
So close, but so far  
And so far, no cigar  
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today  
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow  
No goodbye  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you  
I'm just gonna say good night  
  
Uh, to you  
If I part my heart will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
My art will live through you  
Dream beautiful and unusual  
Wake up like everyday new to you  
Stay true to you, a hood musical  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye to you  
So I'll just say good night to you  
My people, no goodbyes to you

But you niggaz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami  
  
GLC gon' be stoned as Angie  
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me  
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign  
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T  
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man  
  
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest  
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas  
From the Chi, the city of hella haters  
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators  
  
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus  
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us  
Turn the radio down I mean every song  
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian  
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on  
  
Until Khaled turned up the volume  
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'  
Nas done told you come on homie we major  
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'  
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'  
  
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family  
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep  
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep  
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side  
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family  
  
It's the Cons fool, word  
  
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family  
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry  
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B  
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie  
  
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me  
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley  
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys  
No different than Grand Prix's  
  
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze  
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed  
I started independent with owners from land speed  
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed  
  
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be  
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B  
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy  
  
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties  
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby  
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby  
  
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath  
And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed  
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step  
  
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check  
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is  
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is  
  
The Grammy Family  
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night  
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah

It was all good just a week ago  
Niggas feel they selves  
And then Watch The Throne drop  
Niggas kill they selves  
What niggas gon' do Hov?  
This a new crack on a new stove  
I'm in the two-door, true that  
Niggas tellin' me "You back" (you back)  
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?  
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?  
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh  
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga  
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it  
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it  
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me  
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically  
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga  
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga  
And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids  
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit  
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit  
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit  
Got 'em jumpin' out the building  
Watch out below, a million out the door  
  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
I'm about to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
  
Fuck y'all mad at me for?  
Y'all don't even know what I've been through  
I play chicken with a Mack truck  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved  
I swam waters with great whites  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed  
I hustle with vultures late nights  
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food  
Fuck wrong with these dudes  
Try to walk around in these shoes  
See the shit I saw growing up  
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's  
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like  
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really  
I'm like really half a billi nigga  
Really you got baby money  
Keep it real with niggas  
Niggas ain't got my lady money  
Watch the Throne don't step on our road  
Bad enough we let you step on our globe  
When my nephew died, daddy dead  
Niggas took the price on my uncles head  
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled  
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread  
Bow down, brother pay homage  
Don't spill hate all on my garments  
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh  
Head shots nigga fuck your vests  
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork  
Peace God 'cause you know a nigga just went Ham  
  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM  
Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am  
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM

[Chorus]  
In the night, I hear 'em talk,  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..  
How could you be so heartless?  
Oh, how could you be so heartless?  
  
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo  
Just remember that you talkin' to me though  
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo  
I mean after all the things that we've been through  
I mean after all the things we got into  
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me  
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me  
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me  
So you walk around like you don't know me  
You got a new friend, well I got homies  
But in the end it's still so lonely  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know  
I decided we weren't goin' speak so  
Why we up three A.M. on the phone  
Why does she be so mad at me for  
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold  
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up  
Cause I already know how this thing go  
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me  
They say that they don't see what you see in me  
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
You'll never find nobody better than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk  
Baby let's just knock it off  
They don't know what we been through  
They don't know 'bout me and you  
So I got something new to see  
And you just goin' keep hatin' me  
And we just goin' be enemies  
I know you can't believe  
I could just leave it wrong  
And you can't make it right  
I'm goin' take off tonight  
Into the night  
  
[Chorus]

I think I just fell in love with a porn star  
Turn the camera on, she a born star  
Turn the corners in a foreign car  
Call the coroners do the C.P.R.  
She gave that old nigger an ulcer  
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh)  
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh)  
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh)  
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh)  
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what)  
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh)  
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah)  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grab my hand and  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
Never in your wildest dreams  
Never in your wildest dreams  
In your wildest  
You can hear the loudest screams  
Comin' from inside the screen  
You a wild bitch  
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy  
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy  
Or do anal, or do a gang bang  
It's kinda crazy, it's opposite the same thing  
Well I guess a lot of niggers do gang bang  
And if you run trains, we all in the same game  
Run away slaves all on a chain gang  
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star  
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard  
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids  
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s  
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over  
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja  
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day  
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day  
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change  
That's a dress of her back and told her get away  
How can they say they live they life wrong  
When you never fuck wit' the lights on  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)  
  
Have you lost your mind  
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line  
No more drugs for me  
Pussy and religion is all I need  
Grand my hand  
Baby we'll live a hell of a life  
  
I think I fell in love with a porn star  
And got married in the bathroom  
Honeymoon on the dance floor  
And got divorced by the end of the night  
That's one hell of a life

(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine  
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine  
I'm finna take yall back to them better times  
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind  
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi  
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold  
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul  
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?  
You work late nights just to keep on the lights  
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike  
And you would give anything in this world  
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl  
And you never put no man over me  
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?  
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes  
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry  
As we knelt on the kitchen floor  
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more  
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more  
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford  
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable  
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot  
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do  
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates  
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate  
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with  
But still supported me when I did the opposite  
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get  
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you  
You was getting through, can the choir please  
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"  
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry  
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy  
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet  
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)  
  
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low  
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo  
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)  
  
Tell your job you gotta fake em out  
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out  
To a restaurant, upper echelon  
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want  
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?  
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right  
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday  
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)  
  
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you  
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)  
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school  
I appreciate what you allowed for me  
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

(Do or Die)  
Yo Kanye Blow the Hook you a genius boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now when you hear this song you know it's on (Babygirl)  
When you hear this song you know it's on  
When you hear this song you know it's on  
I swear your lovin got me so high I'm gone

Let me hit you when I get the notion  
On I-55 you and I  
Let's ride hit the motion  
Some say she freaky freaky  
Let me guess your lidro needa  
I'm hittin through the back and curves  
Hell, they sell the herb  
  
Now open up your mind to this concept  
Then you take one step  
Straight from the feelin of a wordsmith  
That's the herb shit  
Up on my 22 spins  
In my baby blue benz  
Girls say dat boys ben actin up  
But that's the way he is  
  
You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold  
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold  
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game  
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it  
So now let me sugarcoat it  
It's like I'm on that tight herb  
And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
(Chorus)(x2)  
  
When I'm layin in the back of my 745  
With my lips on you  
Spittin good game  
With the hustler grain  
Gettin brained like a hustler should  
Hustler would  
And you know when I hear the stuff  
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do  
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you jus got me sprung  
What that do  
  
Oh yes she's one of the best  
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin  
Lurkin searchin for the virgin  
But when my babygurl it's workin  
Let me know whats that you smokin  
From the hands as I stick my tounge in  
Then from the back but she want an autograph  
But still we sexin'  
  
Open back up last time  
As I spit a little dough in my mind  
She jus like one of a kind  
No c's no stand in her hind  
Shes jus like me rappin a line  
Perfect let me drop in a dime  
I'm on a roll again  
I'm bought to blow again  
  
Your my latest, and my geatest  
My latest, my greatest  
[Chorus:]

That's what my old chick used to clash with me  
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)  
Actually you should be happy I purchased that  
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat  
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye  
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye  
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye  
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye  
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye  
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye  
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes  
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes  
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye  
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye  
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye  
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye  
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye  
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

[Chorus]  
Find your dreams come true  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
I've been waiting on this my whole life  
These dreams be waking me up at night  
You say I think I'm never wrong  
You know what, maybe you're right, aight  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
You say he get on your fucking nerves  
You hope that he get what he deserves, word  
Do you even remember what the issue is  
You just trying to find where the tissue is  
You can still be who you wish you is  
It ain't happen yet  
And that's what the intuition is  
When you hop back in the car  
Drive back to the crib  
Run back to their arms  
The smokescreens  
The chokes and the screams  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means, what it means  
And I wonder if you know  
What it means to find your dreams  
  
And I'm back on my grind  
A psychic read my lifeline  
Told me in my lifetime  
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline  
And that's what I'm  
Seven o'clock, that's primetime  
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines  
Why he keep giving me hot lines  
I'm a star, how could I not shine  
How many ladies in the house  
How many ladies in the house without a spouse  
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused  
What you about  
On that independent shit  
Trade it all for a husband and some kids  
You ever wonder what it all really mean  
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Some glad morning when this life is over  
I'll fly away  
To a home on God's celestial shore  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
When the shadows of this life have flown  
I'll fly away  
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
I'll fly away  
To a land where joy shall never end  
I'll fly away  
  
I'll fly away, O Glory  
I'll fly away  
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye  
I'll fly away

I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right  
  
Stop all your blood clot cryin, I was flyin'  
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in  
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear ya mom  
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31  
They said the best classes go to the fastest  
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get  
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?  
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?  
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin  
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin  
Man, this is an insult  
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow  
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo  
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro  
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?  
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all depends, oh, oh  
Stop your cryin baby  
  
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that  
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that  
I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right  
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that  
I think I was made for that  
So I'm comin in when I feel like  
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right  
  
You know when you be late you miss all the lights  
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)  
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight  
That night (that night) that night  
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow  
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close  
With the freshest hoes, the professors know  
We about to get real unprofessional  
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?  
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like  
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that  
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that  
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later  
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it  
I'm so live with it, look how I did it  
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it  
I know it's late and I took all year but  
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah

[Chorus:]  
Just gots me a crib and a new car too  
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
C'mon let's get married  
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house  
A lil white fence, just like this, babe  
C'mon let's get married babe  
Let's get married  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Meet me at the alter  
In your white dress (your white dress)  
You won't ever need another man  
You never, ever want from another thing, no  
I've been feeling you  
I must confess (must confess)  
Ain't no gonna break this thang up  
I ain't going nowhere, no  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Jagged Edge]  
Said you want some karats  
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)  
Is it good enough for you to brag on  
When you show your friends (show your friends)  
I just want to be with you  
Girl there ain't I think I won't do  
Want you to be the one to say I do  
We can start a family  
Cuz when I think about you and think about me  
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Kanye West]  
With my tuxedo  
He asked me do you take this  
Woman to hold and keep the safest  
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper  
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics  
Diamonds your bestfriend  
That makes sense because  
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts  
But as long as you gots your defenses up  
You can never get the love that was meant for ya  
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna  
Club  
Real thugs don't never fall in love  
Always on the g-o, for the d-o  
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie  
Since my money get right theses days  
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades  
I gots the church, the ring  
There's something I'm forgetting  
Oh, we gotta have J. E. Sing at the wedding  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate  
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate  
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate  
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga 'scape  
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake  
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break  
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand  
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan  
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name  
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game  
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them  
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...

[Man]  
Hey Jimmy where you going?  
  
[Jimmy]  
I don't know where I'm going.  
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.  
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?",  
But he just kept learning.  
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,  
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.  
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.  
And now I'm just glad he left me these.  
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have.  
These are documented.  
My father left them for me.  
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.  
I'm going to learn too.  
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.  
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.  
Who has that

I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my mind  
I'm building a still  
To slow down the time  
  
I'm up in the woods  
I'm down on my line  
I'm building a still  
Down the time ooh  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night  
Said shes down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Your my devil, your my angel  
Your my heaven, your my hell  
You're my now, you're my forever  
You're my freedom, your my jail  
You're my lies, your my truth  
You're my war, you're my truce  
Your my questions, your my proof  
Your my stress your masseuse  
Mama say mama say mama gos-an  
Lost in this plastic light  
Let's break out of this fake ass party  
Turn this into a classic night  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid in that afterlife  
If we die in each others arms  
Still get laid yea  
  
I'm up in the woods  
(Run from the lights, run from the night  
Run for your life  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night)  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
And I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Ya oh wow  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
Who will survive in America?  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
I'm lost in the world  
I'm down on my line  
I'm new in the city  
But I'm down for the night  
Down for the night, down for the night  
  
Hey oh wow oh

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
What I had to do, had to run from you  
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong  
And that haunted me, all the way home  
So ya never know, never never know  
Never know enough, til it's over love  
Til we lose control, system overload  
Screaming no no no, no no  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you  
So I keep it low, keep a secret code  
So everybody else don't have to know  
  
[Chorus]  
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown  
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose  
  
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to  
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true  
I got something to lose, so I gotta move  
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too  
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own  
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone  
How many times did it take til I finally got through  
You lose, you lose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
See I had to go, I had to move  
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life  
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
I met no one new, I got no one new  
No I said I'm through, but got love for you  
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going  
Keep it on a roll, only god knows  
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused  
You choose, you choose  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
Way I wanna go, I don't need you  
I been down this road, too many times before  
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus:]  
I never liked you n-ggas  
Who knew one day I'd be just like you n-ggas  
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas  
Uh uh uh alright you n-ggas  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?  
  
He walked in our lives  
I was only five  
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly  
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize  
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy  
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband  
I was the man of the house when there wasn't  
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm  
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum  
We are the voices of our parents bad choices  
The aftermath of divorces  
The kids of bitter split ups  
And baby sitters  
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us  
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new n-gga  
You old Old Spice wearing  
Short chain wearing  
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing  
Church sock wearing  
When you first stop caring about your appearance  
When you get here anyway I already got parents  
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons  
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance  
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance  
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring  
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud  
But the door was locked and the tv up so loud  
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon,  
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"  
  
I don't like you n-gga  
If I was old enough I would fight you n-gga  
I wanna run over you in my bike you n-gga  
Don't go to sleep at night you n-gga  
  
And it seems like I wasted time  
If that's what it's all about  
Mama if that's moving up than I  
  
When I become my mama's boyfriends  
Twenty years later where has the time gone  
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own  
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around  
I never thought I'd ever raise another n-ggas child  
He don't like his mama's boyfriend  
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing  
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then  
Cause when she here he be quiet  
When she leave he be talking again  
He be wylin again  
Be calm I don't drink the drama  
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on  
You gon marry my mom look  
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms  
And I did take little man to church  
And took little man to school  
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules  
Even though I aint raised you  
You your mama angel  
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

Yeah  
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is  
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas  
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses  
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses  
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles  
Rubber band together in cashless bundles  
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains  
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change  
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'  
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson  
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell  
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?  
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail  
Children are unheld  
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale, Horse"  
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it  
  
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again  
I'm on my way home  
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone  
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it  
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"

Yeah, grandmama  
Told you I won't let you down  
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found  
I know you'll neva let me down  
Get up I get

Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts  
First had they ear now I have they're heart  
Rappers came and went, I've been hear from the start  
Seen them put it together, watch them take it apart  
  
See the rollers roll up wit ribbons  
I see the we poe, we sold then we driven  
So when I reload, he holds number one position  
When you hot I'm hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin'  
  
It's plain to see, nigga's can't fuck wit me  
'Cuz I'ma be that nigga for life, this is not an image  
This is got given, this is hard liven  
Mixed wit crystall sippin', it's the most consistent  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma  
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat  
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in  
With that in my blood I was born to be different  
  
Now niggas can't make it to battles to chose leadership  
But we can make it to jacobs to [unverified] the dealership  
That's why I hear new music and I just dun b feelin' it  
Racism still alive they just be concealin' it  
  
But I know they don't want me in the damn club  
They even made me show I. D. To get up in to sam's club  
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed  
That why I've baptized at least 3 or 4 times  
  
But in the land where nigga's pray, you con's are getting paid  
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get [unverified]  
Notin' sadder than that day my girl father past away  
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter  
  
And you know I'd like to thank you for they way that she was brought up  
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her  
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye  
'Cuz look what a accident did to left eye  
  
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die  
I know a got angels watchin' me from the other side  
  
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me  
One thing I found, one thing I found

[Intro]  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say  
  
[Hook 1]  
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand  
  
[Bridge]  
So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly  
  
[Hook 3]  
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun  
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Outro]

Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
You'll never figure out real love  
  
It's so crazy  
I got everything figured out  
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about  
No doubt  
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is
about  
  
Do you think I sacrificed real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
Do you think I sacrifice a real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights?  
  
There is no Gucci I can buy  
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on  
There is no YSL that they could sell  
To get my heart out of this hell  
And my mind out of this jail  
There is no clothes that I could buy  
That could turn back the time  
There is no vacation spot I could fly  
That could bring back a piece of real life  
Real life, what does it feel like?  
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight  
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight  
To live a real life  
I just want to be a real boy  
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy  
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy  
  
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it  
I tell the truth and I keep runnin  
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something  
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing  
  
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?  
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel  
Do you really have the stamina...  
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'  
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'  
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'  
You oughtta laugh  
I just want to be a real boy,  
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes...  
  
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me  
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more,  
I can't find her no more I cant...  
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...  
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream,  
Chasing everything we seen  
Up on the TV screen  
And when I- the Benz was left  
And the clothes was left  
And the hoes was left  
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-  
You spent the doughs to death  
And tell me what tf for a real boy  
  
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy  
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way  
The wise man say, you'll find your way  
The wise man say

I'm living' in that 21st century  
Doing something mean to it  
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it  
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it  
I guess every superhero need his theme music  
  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours  
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power  
(21st century schizoid man)  
  
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open  
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling  
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'  
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands  
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen  
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'  
Huh? I see you in the mornin'  
This is way too much, I need a moment  
  
No one man should have all that power  
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours  
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)  
  
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast  
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass  
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole  
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes  
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon  
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in  
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic  
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted  
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts  
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault  
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty  
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts  
Reality is catchin' up with me  
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody  
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me  
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece  
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power  
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours  
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder  
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours  
  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say  
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man)  
  
Holy, powers, Austin, Powers  
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation  
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"  
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation  
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit  
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit  
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick  
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?  
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin'  
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'  
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'  
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
Now this would be a beautiful death  
Jumping out the window  
Letting everything go  
Letting everything go  
  
You got the power to let power go?

Steady flickin'

Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras  
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas  
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's  
  
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome  
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man  
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit  
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?

Girls be so thirsty, thirsty  
Fast forward to the end of my song  
And say third verse me, verse me  
Whenever I hit the block I see  
  
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me  
From manicure sets to silky weaves  
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus  
Turkey, germy, dirty  
  
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no  
Let the pioneer blast my shit  
Wait a minute, hold up, nigga  
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh  
  
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa  
Acrylic base, top all gold  
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes  
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold  
  
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

That'll turn my life to Stephen King's  
Up late night, like she on patrol  
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole  
I told her it's some things she don't need to know  
She never let it go, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now  
You never stop it now

Well let's agree to disagree

Keep it up enough to keep it going on

Somebody please make it stop  
  
Stop, drop, roll, pop

So I can never be your Robot  
Fast or slow

And I just blame everything on you

Split and go where?  
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha  
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off  
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off  
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers  
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas  
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet  
Comes with a price tag, baby face it  
You should leave if you can't accept the basics  
Plenty bitches in the baller-nigga matrix  
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless  
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless  
P!  
  
Never was much of a romantic  
I could never take the intimacy  
And I know it did damage  
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me  
I guessin' you're at an advantage  
'Cause you could blame me for everything  
And I don't know where I'ma manage  
If one day you just up and leave  
  
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong  
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long  
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most  
So I think it's time for us to have a toast  
  
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,  
Let's have a toast for the assholes,

Unless you will  
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'ma make sure these light skinned niggaz  
Never ever never come back in style  
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business  
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'  
No, I decided I was finished  
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned  
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned  
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there  
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year  
This nigga graduated at the top of my class  
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'  
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora  
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or'a Shirley

See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow  
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style  
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style  
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style  
And I ain't even pledge  
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead  
If I could go through all that and still be breathing  
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel a woo coming on, cause  
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause

I feel a woo coming on, 'cause  
  
There it was  
A couple woos coming on, cause  
A couple woos coming on, 'cause  
  
There they was

Now beat that  
And your mothers saying "go to college"  
So you finish college and its wonderful  
You feel so good  
And after all the partying and crazing  
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around
your peers  
Hey now you'll get that 25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money  
No more borrowing money from mom for my high  
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it  
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!  
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that  
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level  
Which is being a secretary's secretary!  
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary  
Who never went to college  
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family  
You know what college does for you?  
It makes you really smart man  
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok  
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be,  
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes  
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied  
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"  
I say "no, I don't know what it is,  
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".

Cus how we on it all the time (uh)  
So imma get my money lets go  
  
(Kanye - Verse 1)  
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy  
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolaty  
"what's up wooo" that's old news  
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes  
Ha?  
I swear my whole collection so cruise  
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes  
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods  
That nigger crazy I told you  
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else)  
If you fall on the concrete that's your asphalt  
If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought  
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought  
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low  
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow  
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo  
When you getting money cuts don't matter cus a nigger past go  
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole  
Right next to lucifer, tell him I said hello  
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him I said hell no.  
  
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh?  
  
(Beyonce)  
My niggers is home, I guess I got everything  
Everything I want, but I don't  
Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before  
No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud  
Doing things not allowed  
And I swear it's going down right now  
I know one thing my momma would be proud  
And you see me looking up  
Cus I know she's looking down right now  
  
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)  
I know you see me now right now,  
  
(I know you see me now right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now)  
I know you see me now right now  
  
(Kanye - Verse 2)  
Poor the champagne let your watch show  
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal  
I admit my first watch was a fossil  
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils  
Attention to detail is so uncanny  
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie  
Somebody needs to put us on camera  
The world of rollies and everyones family  
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes  
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?  
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini  
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo  
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical  
This the cris year, last year was magic 32  
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye'  
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae  
I got style ask julie she heard in may  
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate  
FIrst of all we all know the beats is  
Like a mix between fergie and jeez  
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception  
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys  
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored  
All my hommies GD's but I am lord  
Rap god, Greek mythology  
And this life to crazy to think logicaly  
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy  
My life is like a childs solutions become reality  
  
(Beyonce)  
Now go get my throne cus I don't wanna stop  
I just go in my zone and imma make it hot  
Till it's time to go when it's time to go  
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know  
  
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)  
I know you see me now right now,  
(I know you see me now right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)  
I know you see me now right now (Right now)  
I know you see me now right now

I got the right to put up a fight  
But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
I got my life and its my only one  
I got the night, I'm running from the sun  
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)  
After tonight, there will be no return  
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road  
I'm taking off on the road  
  
And that you know (that you know)  
Tell every one that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)  
  
Okay I'm back up on my grind  
You do you and I'm just gone do mine  
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine  
Okay I got you out my mind  
The night is young, the drinks is cold  
The stars is out, I'm ready to go  
You always thought I was always wrong  
Well know you know,  
Tell everybody everybody that you know!  
Tell everybody that you know  
That I don't love you no more  
And that's one thing that you know  
That you know

But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
Baby girl I'm finished!  
I thought we were committed  
I thought we were cemented  
I really thought we meant it  
But now we just repentin'  
And now we just resentin'  
The clouds is in my vision  
Look how high I be gettin'  
And its all because of you  
Girl we through

And I don't see you with me no more

Reliving the past  
Yuh lost  
  
Rock star bitch call me Elvis  
M.O.B, she call me selfish  
Success got 'em jealous  
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling  
Tattoos, how they break the news  
It was real if you made the news  
Last night my bitches came in twos  
And they both suck like they came to lose  
Dropped out the first day of school  
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move  
I be going hard, I got a name to prove  
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
This the greatest shit in the club  
Since "In Da Club"  
It's so packed I might ride around  
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club  
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"  
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"  
If not, treat your friends like my Benz  
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end  
When I go raw, I like to leave it in  
When I wake up, I like to go again  
When I go to work, she gotta call it in  
She can't go to work, same clothes again  
And her heart colder than the souls of men  
Louboutin on the toes again  
Tight dress dancing close to him  
Yeezus just rose again  
  
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down  
  
Memories don't live like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have  
  
Memories don't live like people do  
They always 'member you  
Whether things are good or bad  
It's just the memories that you have

What a world that I'm livin' in  
Will the rainstorms ever end?  
Still I feel my path narrow I run again  
See happiness is gone again  
  
And then you see 'em gray clouds up above, man  
Metaphor to my life, man  
Still I feel my heart stronger then it's ever been  
Strong will to my journey ends  
  
'Til then I roll more then I've ever rolled  
Not pills but the marioll  
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go  
Nothing helping with my head dose  
  
But I ain't sleepin', awake in another state  
Livin' in a new space  
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace  
God help me so I'll win the race  
  
'Til then I call  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
Come on, come on  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
  
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
Hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
  
Grey clouds took together fam  
Lining piercing to another land  
Over the desert wit' the lost play  
Soul searching each in every way  
  
An then you see the  
Awesome sounds so profound within it'll grip you  
You can see it if you hear, you can feel it too  
Somethin' special I am runnin' to  
  
'Til then I go away, very far away  
To another universe where all people say  
It's a new, new place for the special to embrace  
Like a Martian you seein' it wandered out the place  
  
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful  
Even if you dry you'll be floatin' high above it  
You can say bye, bye, bye  
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high  
  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
Come on, come on  
The sky might fall, the sky might fall  
But I'm not worried at all  
  
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
Hey, I let 'em know some  
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some  
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up  
  
I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
Yeah, gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
And I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up  
Yeah, gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah  
  
'Cause I'm gone, yeah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
I'm up and away, na, na, na, na  
You know what I'm about? Hey, hey

And everybody say, say  
I know you, I know you  
  
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be  
I'm a raw flow 'cause it never get rusty  
I ain't gotta say it, man, dawg, trust me  
Bust somebody head, TLC, where was we?  
  
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter  
Niggas out in Georgetown, and Magic way harder  
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore 'em all up  
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, south  
  
Side of the broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars  
I'm like Jeff Fort, the way I get behind bars  
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars  
Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts  
  
Back in '94 they call me Chi-Town's Nas  
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-Town's gods  
We even yo, you still talking no cops  
A conscious nigga with mac like Steven Jobs  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside side of the Chi  
  
Your fly is open, McFly  
The crowd is open, I think I know why  
I'm back from the future, seen it with my own eyes  
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi  
  
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon  
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons  
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes  
People asking him, "Do you have any gray poupon?"  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside, side of the Chi  
  
You in the building but the building's falling  
You wouldn't be balling if your name is Spalding  
My mind get flooded, I think about New Orleans  
Back in school, y'all niggas, you should call him August  
  
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving  
Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling  
If rap was Harlem, I'd be James Baldwin  
With money in the bank like G Rap, we're calling  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera  
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas  
Can't wait 'til they say, "Yeah, he ran up at the Oscars"  
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie  
  
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta  
Mexicans don't love it like it was for La Raza  
But this is for the mobsters, holla  
We some true Chi-Town legends, accept no [Incomprehensible]  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
The un-American Idol, Tower like the Eiffel  
'Lean Wit it, Rock Wit It', black like the Disciples  
Know when to use a Bible and when to use a rifle  
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle  
  
Caught a case of robbery and 'Beat It' like Michael  
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku  
I write to 'Do the Right Things' like Spike do  
Through conflicts is crucial and trauma is psycho  
  
We coming from the  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside  
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi  
  
We're coming from the  
[Incomprehensible] spice it up  
You might have to spice it up  
Spice it up, spice it up, take your life and  
  
Yo, we're coming from the  
We're coming from the

Let me know  
Do I still got time to grow  
Things ain't always set in stone  
That be known let me know

Happen to be just like moments, passin  
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and

All the street lights, glowin'  
Happen to be just like moments, passin'  
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and

Life's just not fair

But I know that God put you in front of me  
So how the hell could you front on me?  
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me

Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night

Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon  
  
[Jay-Z]  
Gotta bop like this  
Can't wear skinny jeans  
Cuz my knots don't fit  
No one on the corner  
Gotta pocket like this  
So I rock Roc jeans  
Cuz my knots so thick  
You can learn how to dress  
Just by  
Jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Follow my steps  
It's the road to success  
Where the niggas think you thorough  
And the girls say yes  
But I can't teach you my swag  
You can pay for school  
But you can't buy class  
School of hard knocks  
I'm a grad  
All blue Yankee  
Is my graduation cap  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Dipping different rovas [?]  
Wipping with the soda [?]  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa

After doutbt it was ova.  
  
[Lil' Wayne]  
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch!  
But I'm too clean for these boys  
I require what I desire  
I got stripes Adidas  
Mami scream papi no mas  
Run up in yo shit just me no moss  
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs  
No one has swagger like these 4 guys  
When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking about?

And I'm gone.. Bye  
  
[T. I.]  
You go see weezy for the wordplay,  
Jeezy for the bird play,  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose,  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,  
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is
what another rapper do,  
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities,  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,  
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at,  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,  
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,  
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag!

I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
Up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
You love to hear the story again and again  
About these young brothers from the City of Wind  
Like juice and gin in the city we blend  
Amongst the hustle Titties and skin 50's and rims  
Y'all know the Sprewell's and trucks with detail  
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em  
Felt the southside venom with rawhides and denim  
Bent minds collide with 'em in a system that tries victims  
We livin' it my man in the fast lane pivotin'  
On the block yo they sellin' like Eminem  
On the block get jumped off like him and them  
On the block is hot you can feel it in your skinenen  
Shorties get the game with no instructions supersymbolin'  
Eyes right it seems like the fight is dimmin' 'em  
Come my man kuzzle like I'm kin' to him  
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him  
  
I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
I'm up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
It's all good in the hood like  
Rags and Timbs  
Throwbacks and Timbs  
Blacks and Rims  
Whether on ball courts and tires of all sorts  
We never fall short  
With us, it's all force  
Like And 1's someway some hand guns  
The days the fam one is all over for  
Cash is colder than fobolobo  
But self I go toe to toe  
Wonderin' if it's for the art of for the dough  
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go  
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto  
Arrows on tarot cards pointing to the grind  
More livin in more prisons  
Pointing to my mind  
Shine the light up  
Clench my fist tight holdin' the right up  
Freedom fightin dark year for the years to get brighter  
Situations that jaws get tighter  
My man tried to get his way...  
  
I walked in the crib  
Got two kids  
And my baby mamma late  
Uh oh uh oh uh oh  
And so I had to did what I had to did  
Cuz I had the kid  
Duh oh duh oh duh oh  
Up all night, gettin' my money right  
Until the blue and white's  
Po po po po po po  
Now the money comin' slow  
But at least a nigga know slow motion better then  
No No No  
  
Hey yo I, I know I could make it right  
If I could just swallow my pride  
But I can't run away  
You put my gun away  
You can't front on me  
I, no I can't let it ride  
No no not tonight  
No I can't run away  
You put my gun away  
You can't front on me

(Gonna take you to the glory, oh I can't study war)  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
Can I talk my shit again?  
Even if I don't hit again?  
Dog are you fucking kidding?  
My hat, my shoes, my coat  
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace  
That's Louis Vuitton's bitch  
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone  
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning  
Class back in session so I upped it a grade  
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade  
And, hey please don't start me  
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley  
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers  
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up  
I touched on everything  
Married to the game, roc-a-chain instead of a wedding ring  
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter  
On nights when 'Ye romance  
Cameras flash so much  
That I gotta do that Yayo dance  
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man  
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van it's easy  
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy  
And, oh yeah, Yeezy  
I did it for the glory  
  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
What am I supposed to do now?  
Man the game all messed up  
How I'm suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up?  
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta  
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido  
But with my ego  
I can stand there in a speedo  
And be looked at like a fucking hero  
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night  
The grind, the empty bottles of no-doze  
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo  
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos  
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss  
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss  
Why I gotta ask what that two-door cost  
House on the hill  
Two doors from Tracey Ross  
And I'm asking about her girlfriends  
Yeah, the dark skinny ones  
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em  
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?  
I know, I know I look better in real life  
O' hear people compare themselves to big a lot  
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot  
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG  
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious, fit in  
Get money and stunt and stay glorious  
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
  
Now where the south side, now where the west side  
  
Yeah I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit  
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
