"Foolish Games"  
  
you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,  
Somebody more like myself  
These foolish games are breaking my heart  
your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You took your coat off and stood in the rain  
you were always like that

Shall I go, shall I stay  
107 light years away  
Many times, so many doubts  
But no reason to talk about  
  
Mission is over, mission is done  
I will miss you, children of the sun  
But it's time to go away  
Goodbye milky way  
  
For a better world without hate  
Follow your heart, believe in fate  
Only visions and the mind  
Will guide you to the light  
  
Mission is over mission is done  
I will miss you children of the sun  
But it's time to go away  
Goodbye milky way  
  
Mission is over, mission is done  
I will miss you children of the sun  
I go home until someday  
I say goodbye, goodbye milky way  
  
In 5 bilions years the  
Andromeda galaxy will collide with our milky way  
A new gigantic Cosmic world will be born

Turn around and smell what you don't see  
Close your eyes it is so clear  
Here's the mirror, behind there is a screen  
On both ways you can get in  
  
Don't think twice before you listen to your heart  
Follow the trace for a new start  
  
What you need and everything you'll feel  
Is just a question of the deal  
In the eye of storm you'll see a lonely dove  
The experience of survival is the key  
To the gravity of love  
  
The path of excess leads to  
The tower of Wisdom  
The path of excess leads to  
The tower of Wisdom  
  
Try to think about it  
That's the chance to live your life and discover  
What it is, what's the gravity of love  
  
Look around just people, can you hear their voice  
Find the one who'll guide you to the limits of your choice  
  
But if you're in the eye of storm  
Just think of the lonely dove  
The experience of survival is the key  
To the gravity of love.

Hello and welcome, at your risk.  
You're always welcome, without guarantee  
If you're so brave to face this tide  
There is no mercy in this life  
Now it's time to feel that it's here  
What is fiction and what's reality  
  
Hello and welcome, just look at me  
Think about the future, its still traveling  
Too much confidence on what you have  
They ain't are dear to feel this safe  
Overload your destiny and you'll wake up behind it  
  
Hello and welcome (welcome, welcome)  
But its your risk  
Your always welcome (welcome)  
To win your reality (hello hello hello and welcome)  
Just look at me  
Think about the future  
It's still traveling (hello)  
Hello, Just look at me  
Just look at me  
Its your destiny  
(Hello and welcome,Hello and welcome) oh  
Just look at me (hello hello) [Repeats]

I see love, I can see passion  
I feel danger, I feel obsession  
Don't play games with the ones who love you  
Cause I hear a voice who says  
I love you, I'll kill you  
  
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room  
  
Look into the mirror of your soul  
Love and hate are one in all  
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me  
You'll see the face who'll say,  
I love you, I'll kill you,  
But I'll love you forever  
  
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

I promise you, for all my life  
I'll be always on your side  
In the shadow, in the light  
  
I'll follow you, wherever life goes  
But I'll always be aside  
In the shadow, in the light  
  
But if we don't understand  
Hell is happy, heaven is sad  
And that's the result of our brain  
Insane  
  
Caravan of life  
By day and by night  
Every tile's a part of life  
If it's shadow, or if it's light  
  
I promise you, even when the tide is high  
I'll be always on your side  
In the shadow, in the light

Come in and see the newest things  
Feel what just money can bring  
Don't you know, that's the load of today  
  
You have a problem, I can help  
Buy it and be yourself  
'Cause you know, that's the look of today  
  
So many trends just fade away  
Before you can wear it, it's a pass a blade  
But you know, that's the look of today  
  
You are so stylish, you are so vain  
Sometimes I think you have no brain  
But you know, that's the look of today

Earth. A biosphere.  
A complex,  
Subtly balanced life support system.  
  
Et turtur nidum,  
Ubi reponat pullos suos  
Altaria tua Domine virtutum,  
Rex meus, et Deus meus  
(and the turtledove a nest  
Where it might place its young  
Your altar of strengths, Lord,  
My king and my God,)  
  
We are floating over the line  
Let us follow our mind  
All of our life we'll wait for the answer  
And the question is why  
  
If we're following our mind  
We can glide into light  
No one knows if there'll be an answer  
While we're morphing through time  
  
We are floating over the line  
Let us follow our mind  
All of our life we'll wait for the answer  
And the question is why  
  
We're just travelers  
In endless space  
If we're following our mind  
We can glide into light  
  
No one knows if there'll be an answer  
While we're morphing through time

We came out from the deep  
We came out from the deep  
That's why we are here (the mistakes we made)  
That's why we are here.  
We came out from the deep  
We came out from the deep  
That's why we are here (the mistakes we made)  
That's why we are here.  
(the mistakes we made)  
...deep  
(the mistakes we made)  
That's why we are here (the mistakes we made)  
That's why we are here.  
(the mistakes we made)

I am hunted by the future  
Will the future be my past?  
Or is time a fade out picture  
Of my everlasting cast?  
  
Love is phasing  
Love is moving  
To the rhythm of your sight  
I get closer  
To the crossing point of light  
  
Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.  
Pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua.  
Hosanna in excelsis. Benedictus  
(Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts.  
Heaven and earth are filled with Thy glory.  
Hosanna in the highest.  
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  
Hosanna in the highest.)  
  
Let us try to live our lost illusions  
They're the sun at night  
If we don't we'll never taste  
The spice of life  
  
And when it seems that we're in a dead end street  
There's no reason to cry  
Cause we have a helping hand who's always aside  
  
Forever light

Love  
Devotion  
Feeling  
Emotion  
  
Don't be afraid to be weak  
Don't be too proud to be strong  
Just look into your heart my friend  
That will be the return to yourself  
The return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)  
  
If you want, then start to laugh  
If you must, then start to cry  
Be yourself don't hide  
Just believe in destiny.  
  
Don't care what people say  
Just follow your own way  
Don't give up and lose the chance  
To return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)  
  
That's not the beginning of the end  
That's the return to yourself  
The return to innocence.  
  
(Chanting)

Give me release  
Witness me  
I am outside  
Give me peace  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
And I wanted to believe  
That I'd get caught up  
When the rage in me subsides  
  
In this white wave  
I am sinking  
In this silence  
In this white wave  
In this silence  
I believe  
  
Passion chokes the flower  
'til she cries no more  
Possessing all the beauty  
Hungry still for more  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
  
I can't help this longing  
Comfort me  
I can't hold it all in  
If you won't let me  
  
Heaven holds a sense of wonder  
  
In this white wave  
I am sinking  
In this silence  
In this white wave  
In this silence  
I believe  
  
I have seen you  
In this white wave  
You are silent  
You are breathing  
In this white wave  
I am free

Long ago, for many years  
White men came in the name of God  
They took their land, they took their lives  
A new age has just begun  
  
They lost their Gods, they lost their smile  
They cried for help for the last time.  
Liberty was turning into chains  
But all the white men said  
That's the cross of changes  
  
In the name of God, the fight for gold  
These were the changes.  
Tell me, is it right, in the name of God  
These kind of changes ?  
  
They tried to fight for liberty  
Without a chance in hell, they gave up.  
White men won in the name of God  
With the cross as alibi  
  
There's no God who ever tried  
To change the world in this way.  
For the ones who abuse his name  
There'll be no chance to escape  
On judgment day  
  
In the name of God, the fight for gold  
These were the changes.  
Tell me, is it right, in the name of God  
These kind of changes ?  
  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell why  
The white men said:  
That's the cross of changes ?  
  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell why,  
In the name of God  
These kind of changes.

Only tell me that you still want me here  
When you wander off out there  
To those hills of dust and hard winds that blow  
In that dry white ocean alone  
  
Lost out in the desert  
you are lost out in the desert  
  
But to stand with you in a ring of fire  
I'll forget the days gone by  
I'll protect your body and guard your soul  
From mirages in your sight  
  
Lost out in the desert  
  
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track  
I'll be the moon that shines on your path  
The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts  
I'll hold you up and be your way out  
And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
Just a wish and i will cover your shoulders  
With veils of silk and gold  
When the shadows come and darken your heart  
Leaving you with regrets so cold  
  
Lost out in the desert  
  
If your hopes scatter like the dust across your track  
I'll be the moon that shines on your path  
The sun may blind our eyes, I'll pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara  
  
If that's the only place where you can leave your doubts  
I'll hold you up and be your way out  
And if we burn away, I'll pray the skies above  
For snow to fall on the sahara

Prasanna vadanaaM saubhaagyadaaM bhaagyadaaM  
HastaabhyaaM abhayapradaaM maNigaNair-  
Naanaavidhair-bhuushhitaaM  
(who is of smiling face, bestower of all fortunes,  
Whose hands are ready to rescue anyone from fear,  
Who is adorned by various ornaments with precious stones)  
  
Puer natus est nobis,  
Et filius datus est nobis  
Cujus emperium super humerum  
(For to us a child is born,  
To us a son is given:  
And the government will be upon his shoulder)  
  
Some day you came  
And I knew you were the one  
You were the rain, you were the sun  
But I needed both, cause I needed you  
  
You were the one  
I was dreaming of all my life  
When it is dark you are my light  
But don't forget  
Who's always our guide  
  
It is the child in us

Take me back to the rivers of belief  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
my friend  
  
I look inside my heart  
I look inside my soul  
I promise you  
I will return  
  
And when the Lamb opened the seventh seal  
silence covered the sky  
  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
Take me back to the rivers of belief  
my friend  
  
I look inside my heart  
I look inside my soul  
I'm reaching out for you  
Lets hope one day  
We'll rest in peace  
on my rivers of belief

[Chorus]  
We all had the same parents  
Many million years ago  
Why can't we live in freedom  
Without hunger, with no war?  
  
At the beginning we all had  
One mother and one father  
That's where we're descending from (attention)  
I don't, I don't understand why so much hate (attention)  
  
Between races, and religions  
It's mad, insane  
I don't understand (amazing)  
Why it has to be like that? (incredible experience)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Attention) I don't, I don't understand  
Why so much hate (amazing)  
Between races and religions (incredible experience)

Touch and kiss me  
Touch and kiss me  
Up and down  
Touch and feel me  
Up and down  
  
Touch and kiss me  
Touch and kiss me  
Up and down  
Touch and feel me  
Up and down  
  
I'll always love you  
  
Touch and kiss me  
Touch and kiss me  
Up and down  
Touch and feel me  
Up and down  
  
Touch and kiss me  
Touch and feel me  
Touch and kiss me  
Touch and kiss me  
Up and down  
  
Touch and kiss me  
Touch and feel me

I was childish and unfair  
To you, my only friend  
I regret, but now it's too late  
I can't show you any more  
The things I've learned from you  
'Cause life just took you away  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
But someday we'll meet again  
And I'll ask you  
I'll ask you why  
Why it has to be like this  
I'm asking you why  
Please give me an answer  
Many years and stupid fights  
Till we accept to see  
How it was and it'll always be  
Why it has to be like this  
Why we don't realize  
Why we're too blind to see the one  
Who's always on our side  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
Just tell me why Why it has to be like this  
That the good ones disappear  
I'm asking you why  
I'm asking why  
I'm asking why  
Nobody gives an answer  
I'm just asking why  
I'm asking why
