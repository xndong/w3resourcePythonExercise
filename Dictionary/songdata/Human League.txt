There's something in your soul that makes me feel so old  
In fact, I think I've died about six hundred times  
There's less of me now and more of me then  
I'm moving back to the age of men  
Jump off the tarmac, there's no stagecoach speed limit  
Outside the office hangs the man on the gibbet  
Soft lenses, grow to glasses  
Small world, dimly seen through cataracts  
Your program, newspaper  
So they say  
Rumor spread by word of mouth  
Jump onto the escalator  
Press the button on the lift  
Raise the dust on old stair carpets  
Endless treads like waves of regret  
Now it seems, I'm going madder  
Falling off this rotting ladder  
Soft lenses, grow to glasses  
Small world, dimly seen through cataracts  
Jump on to the escalator  
Press the button on the lift  
Raise the dust on old stair carpets  
Endless treads like waves of regret  
Now it seems, I'm going madder  
Falling off this rotting ladder  
Your program, newspaper  
So they say  
Rumor spread by word of mouth  
Jump onto the escalator  
Press the button on the lift  
Raise the dust on old stair carpets  
Endless treads like waves of regret  
Now it seems, I'm going madder  
Falling through this rotting ladder  
There's something in your soul that makes me feel so old  
In fact, I think I've died about six hundred times  
There's less of me now and more of me then  
I'm moving back to the age of men  
Jump off the tarmac, there's no stagecoach speed limit  
Outside the office, hangs the man on the gibbet  
Jump off the tarmac, there's no stagecoach speed limit  
Outside the office, swings the man on the gibbet  

The sun that's shining through the shattered window  
Is breaking into colors in the car  
Through the heat the dust blows round the pueblo  
The sounds of people drift in from afar  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride?  
Is this really the end of our love?  
How am I to decide?  
  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
  
Another village rises in the distance  
To mark the passage to the journey's end  
The droning of the engine is existence  
It's too far for the mind to comprehend  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride?  
Is this really the end of our love?  
How am I to decide?  
  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?  
Are you ever coming back?

A crow and a baby  
Had an affair  
The result was a landslide  
The result was a dare  
The result was a baby  
Who wanted it all  
Moved out of the doll's house  
Moved out of the hall  
  
With one wing on the town and a gleam in an eye of red  
Said my father was a crow, now I want all fathers dead  
Find the fathers of this world, treat them as a fatal foe  
Put them in the deepest hole, then cover the pit with snow  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
  
I'm just trying to tell you what you'll come up against  
If you venture from my side, if you think you're so mature  
You will end up in a field, you will be someone's manure  
Mushrooms growing from your back  
Feeding some damn carrion bird  
Do you want to contribute  
To the corruption of the world?  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
  
A crow and a baby  
Had an affair  
My dream was the baby  
The crow was your hair  
Parts of me love parts of you  
That at least is obvious  
Give my baby back to me  
You must see it's only just  
  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red  
With one wing on the town  
And a gleam in an eye of red

Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Just because you can  
You treat me like a fool  
But just because you can  
Don't make it right  
Can it be so hard  
To be a little kind  
And you could be here  
With me tonight  
I've got feelings  
Don't be unkind  
Feelings  
Don't be unkind  
Feelings  
Stay with me tonight  
You've been stealing  
That's so unkind  
Stealing  
A heart, a mind  
Stealing  
Stay with me tonight  
Cruel young lover  
Blow your mind out  
Time will come when  
You will find out  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Try to stand out  
Will it always pay  
To bland out?  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Once again you're gone  
Somewhere in the night  
Disappearing  
Leaving me alone  
The lure of city streets  
The pull of unknown souls  
The overpowering draw  
Of the unknown  
You've been stealing  
That's so unkind  
Stealing  
A heart, a mind  
I'm appealing  
Stay with me tonight  
Cruel young lover  
Hit the action  
Can you live on your attraction  
Time may take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Try to stand out  
Will it always pay  
To bland out?  
Time will take your cruel power away  
Cruel young lover  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Do you hear me?  
Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
Cruel young lover

Cruel young lover  
That's so unkind  
Do you hear me?

Cruel young lover  
Do you hear me?  
Thief

Do you hear me?  
That's so unkind  
That's so unkind

Those cocky little fires you started in the night  
The independent claims that just meant "Hold me tight"  
The bruises on your body that you swore were from a fight  
I'll pass at your insistence  
Alsatians fall unconscious at the shadow of your call  
One glance from your direction and the government will fall  
Whole continents of misery don't bother you at all  
But for me you have persistence  
  
[Chorus]  
Run all day, run all night  
Do or die, do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die, do or die  
  
I'd like to leave so would you kindly look the other way  
You tell me to be honest but I've nothing left to say  
Just like your feet my goddess, my brain has turned to clay  
An end to all resistance  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Run all day, run all night  
Do or die, do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die, do or die

Someone stopped the clock when we should have started early  
If we miss the morning meeting our lives will be in danger  
Someone's trying to stop us, there is someone in our party  
It is someone with a grudge and they won't let us reach the border  
  
Our lives are in his hands, we pay with Krugerrands  
The currency of pain to help us leaving  
While back in our homeland the ones who make a stand  
Are taken from their homes and no one hears of them again  
  
I felt I had to come here, I thought things would be better  
The situation's changed but I find I'm still resented  
Someone wants my job it is someone in this building  
Someone's spreading rumors and I don't feel I can stay here  
  
I think I'm going north and now's the time to leave  
The people there they say are good to strangers  
And if I do my best and try to settle in  
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor  
  
I'm sure I can be just like someone's neighbor

  
Egomaniac Egomaniac Egomaniac  
Feeling good inside  
Take a look around  
Suck air into your lungs  
And stride across the ground  
You know yourself you made yourself  
Drunken with the glory  
Sober with the force  
Carelessly once more to rule without remorse  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?  
Egomaniac yes you could confide  
But they'd never understand the comfort you provide  
The splendor you have planned  
Something strange is happening to you  
You're on your own, can you hear them talking?  
Trust is an unknown, are they breaking through  
When you're the best who needs the rest  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?  
Egomaniac  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun ego may  
Weary to your bones with ease you domineer  
No challenge left to rise to  
No foeman left to fear  
In your mind you feel them breaking through  
You hardly feel the silence, all the puppet chatter gone  
Who cares that no one follows  
So long as you lead on  
Could there be another point of view  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say 'thy will be done'?  
Egomaniac  
Dazzling like a diamond  
Dazzling like a diamond

Since I was very young I realized  
I never wanted to be human size  
So I avoid the crowds and traffic jams  
They just remind me of how small I am  
Because of this longing in my heart  
I'm going to start the growing up  
I'm going to grow now and never stop  
Think like a mountain, grow to the top  
  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
With concentration  
My size increased  
And now I'm fourteen stories high  
At least!!  
Empire state human  
Just a bored kid  
I'll go to Egypt to be  
A pyramid  
  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
Tall, tall, tall, I want to be tall, tall, tall  
As big as a wall, wall, wall, as big as a wall, wall, wall  
And if I'm not tall, tall, tall, then I will grow, grow, grow  
Because I'm not tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till he's fully grown  
Brick by brick  
Stone by stone  
Growing till he's fully grown  
  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land  
Fetch more water  
Fetch more sand  
Biggest person in the land

Once there was a vision  
Once there was a glow  
Once there was a certainty  
No chance could overthrow  
Hope was scorched by summer  
Crushed and beaten down  
Once there was a winner  
Now there was a clown  
Without you life had seemed so  
But now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Now I'm filling up with Heaven  
No baby no baby no baby no  
Filling up  
No baby no baby baby baby no  
Filling up  
No baby no baby no baby no  
No baby no baby baby baby no  
All the fortune that my  
Luck had brought  
It couldn't even make me smile  
Without you life had seemed so  
A lonely hideaway my last resort  
All achievement infantile  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Hey hey hey  
As the years had passed by  
I became more cynical  
All the magic had died  
My existence clinical  
Ow ow ow ow  
But now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Hey hey hey hey  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Woah woah woah woah  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up filling up  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Ow ow ow ow ow  
Woah woah woah  
Now I'm  
Filling up with Heaven  
Without you life had seemed so  
Hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up with Heaven  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile  
Hey hey hey hey  
Without you life had  
Seemed so hostile  
Down down  
Down down  
Filling up  
But maybe with you it's all worthwhile

There with you so high, girl. (I really love you baby).

Time, this time, this time. smacked on my chin but I'm back  
With a grin. this time, this time, this time. I know I was

Fear. this time, this time, this time. made my mistakes but  
No foot on the brakes. this time.

Time.

This time this time will be for sure, girl.  

Calling up the promised land  
Johnny Seven's coming over the sea  
He's taking your time  
When you want to be free  
  
Holding out a helping hand  
Are you ready for a real career?  
Will you be so cool  
When it's happening here?  
  
It don't say nothing that I haven't heard  
If what I hear is true  
You won't keep the law with a broken word  
So what are you going to do?  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Pass the message around the world  
The medium is in retreat  
The power is here  
And packing some heat  
  
Sell your soul to a holy war  
Set the captive free  
We make no promises anymore  
But it isn't fooling me  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
You can't keep the wheels turning anymore  
With anger, blood and fear  
Or make any friends with an M16  
When you blast your way through here  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Changing in time, beating colder steel  
  
Heart like a wheel  
Turning away from anything that's real  
Heart like a wheel  
Driving the world is going to be a steal

Talking to your lover  
On a non existent phone  
Houseful of nothing  
The joyous conversation  
Of a creature quite alone  
Houseful of nothing  
The whir of passing traffic  
The sighing of the breeze  
Houseful of nothing  
The awareness of a culture  
That is fading by degrees  
Houseful of nothing  
  
A hint of a shadow  
Or a picture by the door  
Houseful of nothing  
The creak of a staircase  
Or the flexing of the floor  
Houseful of nothing  
The light spreading even  
Neither glaring nor too dark  
Houseful of nothing  
All finished had blended  
Leaving surface with no mark  
Houseful of nothing  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Understand just what you own  
No-one  
Owns the sunshine  
And possession is a stone  
One time in a lifetime  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
All those ages  
Have you really come so far?  
  
The traces of a perfume  
Half-remembered from the past  
Houseful of nothing  
The ringing of a catchphrase  
From a cherished telecast  
Houseful of nothing  
Nothing in the corner  
Nothing on the wall  
Houseful of nothing  
It makes you laugh to think  
That there were ever things at all  
Houseful of nothing  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Will you use the things you know  
Will you passing  
Make a difference  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Will you foster, will you sow  
One time in a lifetime  
Make a list of all you own  
And when you are gone  
What will it do for you, baby?  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
You took my family  
Give it back give it back  
You took the heart of me  
Give it back give it back  
You took my dignity  
Give it back  
Remember society  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Sense of community  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Lost opportunity  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back  
Bring it bring it bring it bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Understand just what you own  
No-one owns the sunshine  
And possession is a stone  
  
One time  
Remember society  
In a lifetime  
Bring it back  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
Sense of community  
All those ages  
Bring it back  
Have you really come so far?  
  
Lost opportunity  
Bring it back  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
All those ages  
Have you really come so far?  
  
Bring it bring it bring it bring it back  
Bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back

Come on baby dry your eyes, wipe your tears.  
Never like to see you cry, please forgive me.  
I wouldn't ever try to hurt you, I just needed  
Someone to hold me, to fill the void while you were gone.  
To fill this space of emptiness.  
I'm only human, of flesh and blood I'm made.  
Ooh human, born to make mistakes.  
If five boys in the house say it loud  
If five boys in the house check it out.  
When I lay upon my bed I reminisce then I wish  
That I got you by my side with the cherry red kiss  
Hit me off make it soft hold me tight throughout the night  
You know I'm gonna fight cos the thing we had was right  
But if you go all I know I can't go a day without you  
Here in my arms hypnotized with your charms now  
I'm feeling for you baby ain't you hearing the alarms  
You can't stop all that love that I got  
Wanna rewind time to better days that were hot check it  
Bring back the better days for me baby  
You gotta bring 'em back cos I'm going crazy  
I go insane with your name up in my brain  
Things will never be the same you ain't up in my frame  
So what you gonna do what you gonna say  
Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way.  
I'm only human, of flesh and blood I'm made.  
Ooh human, born to make mistakes.  
If five boys in the house say it loud.  
If five boys in the house check it out.

My life - I'm a fool for you  
You who take no advice  
You who think evil doesn't exist  
Just because you deny it is true  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You're lucky I care  
For fools like you  
You're lucky I'm there  
To stop people doing the things  
That you know they're dying to do  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
A dog must bark  
So evil calls  
Both in the wild and  
Within these walls  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law  
  
You know I am no stranger  
I know rules are a bore  
But just to keep you from danger  
I am the law

The night  
So young  
You could lose  
You could gain  
Your temperature's rising  
Better pull into the outside lane  
You always say you're not the jealous kind  
Then you tell all your friends that I've got one thing on my mind  
  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
I don't depend on you, I've got my own friends too  
I'll never be your wife, don't try to use me  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
  
It's cruel but it's true, I don't depend on you  
It's cruel but it's true, go back to the end of the queue  
  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
I don't depend on you, I've got my own friends too  
I'll never be your wife, don't try to use me  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
  
The night, so young  
You could lose, you could gain  
Your temperature's rising  
Better pull into the outside lane  
You always say you're not the jealous kind  
Then you tell all your friends that I've got one thing on my mind  
  
I've played this scene before, you had one foot in the door  
But there's always plenty more, don't try to use me  
I don't depend on you, I've got my own friends too

It's cruel but it's true, go back to the end of the queue  
  
It's cruel but it's true, I don't depend on you  
It's cruel but it's true, go back to the end of the queue

We talked and talked and talked and talked for hours  
An ocean or two couldn't keep me away from you  
We spoke about the time and place of our first meeting  
Without a word I know you knew that I cared about you  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
Been one too many lonely nights without you  
On one too many trains and boats and 'planes  
I spent a thousand nights alone before I met you  
And I'll spend many more until we meet again  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much  
I love you too much

Funny sometimes how you let  
The little things  
Get in your way  
Funny how you just can't talk  
Although sometimes  
You've got so much to say  
Silly when you know you've got the thing  
That everybody  
Needs so bad  
Stupid if you let those jealous people  
Telling lies  
Make you sad  
  
I thought I heard a voice  
Telling me go home  
No need to run no more  
Needn't be alone  
  
I don't care what you do  
I'm coming back  
I can look forward too  
I'm coming back  
  
Crazy feelings that you get  
Sometimes they make you  
Want to run away  
The provocation that you let  
Overcome you  
When you ought to stay  
  
I thought I saw her face  
In every single crowd  
I heard her voice again  
Calling me aloud  
  
I don't care what you do  
I'm coming back  
I can look forward too  
I'm coming back  
  
I thought I never could  
Return where I belong  
But with her waiting there  
I knew I could be strong  
  
I don't care what you do  
I'm coming back  
I can look forward too  
I'm coming back  
I don't care what you do  
I'm coming back  
I can look forward too  
I'm coming back

Starting over  
To feel the way I do  
A sudden stranger  
To everything I knew  
All the years together  
Now the days we are apart  
New experiences  
New sensation for the heart  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
To be alone was frightening  
But I knew I had to stay  
'Til all the dreamers came  
To take my loneliness away  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
You've got to get some  
  
If all our life is dancing  
Then let's just let the music play  
What good is crying?  
I'm going to jam my life away  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
Jam  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
  
Starting over  
To feel the way I do  
A sudden stranger  
To everything I knew  
  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
But you know that you will go back  
Where you used to  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
Jam  
Got to get some jam  
Jam  
Got to get some  
  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam  
Jam

If it seems a little time is needed  
Decisions to be made  
The good advice of friends unheeded  
The best of plans mislaid  
Just looking for a new direction  
In an old familiar way  
The forming of a new connection  
To study or to play

Kiss The Future Lyrics:Forgiveness and mercy. in short supply. so lonely, so  
Faithful. no reason why. in my mind at this time. just clear  
Blue sky. your story just starting. now learn to fly.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
No time now for sorrow. meet life full-blast. let?s take on  
Tomorrow. forget the past.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
This is what you came here for. stop the engine slam the  
Door. leave that lonesome corridor.  
Take the plunge and wipe the slate. smile your smile -  
you're feeling great. soon you're going to celebrate.  
Time has gone to hesitate. nothing now can make you  
Wait. take control of your own fate.  
Take tomorrow in your hand. make the others understand.  
One break you must demand.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.

Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterdays.  
It's been a very long long time. Since I last remember  
Seeing you. I hope you write and say you're fine. Did you  
Ever sit and dream. Of the time when we would meet  
Again? It's very hard now you're not mine.  
The 'phone's right next to you. And you know just what to  
Do. Just pick it up. And call my name.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Tomorrow's just a step away. 'Til I come running back to  
You. I hope you stay right by my side. I thought I'd never  
See. My angel back here next to me. Promise me that you  
Won't hide.  
The 'phone's right next to you. And you know just what to  
Do. Just pick it up. And call my name.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
And you know there ain't much time. I'm so alone. Please  
Come home. I'm on my own.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.  
Let's get together again. All you need is here to stay. Let's  
Get together again. Forget about your yesterday.

When you fall into your seat  
You know you feel you might be dying  
As the breath rasps in and out  
Of your burning throat  
You can't control your lungs because you're so tired  
You're half awake with one arm in your coat  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldn't make it on your own  
He helps you through the door  
You sit down on the floor  
And you're asleep before you are alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Your life is like a schedule  
You run to meet the bills  
No one's awake to tell you  
Life kills  
  
For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided  
The day is over and the moon is high  
But your period of work is predecided  
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldn't make it on your own  
He helps you in the door  
You sit down as before  
Another shift to pay another loan  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Got this beautiful situation  
I've finally found out  
What life's about  
Want to talk about it  
In my conversation  
Going to tell the world  
Going to sing it  
From the highest mountain top  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Every person pledge allegiance  
All our efforts  
To one common cause  
Take a minute to improve a life  
Form a legion  
That's united for a love cause  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
March  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  
  
Love forgiving  
Love for good  
Love to keep us faithful  
  
After all is said and done  
Love is all that matters  

You know you're making me nervous  
I don't know if the world deserves us  
You're doing things I wouldn't mention  
You have a hunger for attention  
You know you're making me frantic  
Is this supposed to be romantic?  
You're like the woman out of Species  
I think I'm gonna go to pieces  
  
You never do right  
For doing wrong  
You'd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
You're doing wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Saty for life or leave me sadly  
Do you have to?  
  
you're really making me anxious  
You know that everybody blanks us  
You're like a cocktail set Atilla  
A kind of holycon geurilla  
You know I'm heading for a crackup  
You're getting everybody's back up  
I'm getting ready for a freak out  
What makes you think you're right to speak out?  
  
You never back down you'd rather fight  
You're ready for combat day or night  
You never back down  
You start the fight  
The run behind me  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please don't always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Do you have to?  
  
I feel I'm getting rather tense  
At the turn of these events  
I want to run away and hide  
But you keep dragging me inside  
I'm tethered to a trainee hellcat  
I'm feeling jealous of the doormat  
I'm nearly fainting with the tension  
One day we'll end up in detention  
  
You never do right  
You're doing wrong  
You'd better get back where you belong  
You never do right  
You're always wrong  
Then running to me  
  
Love me well or love be badly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Stay for life or leave me sadly  
Please don't always love me madly  
  
Love me well or love me badly  
Do you have to love me madly?  
Be my friend reject me gladly  
Only don't you love me madly  
  
Love, me madly

I take one look at you  
It leaves me breathless  
I see your dreams come true  
You're not so restless  
Or light, or bright  
Marianne  
One day I might not care  
What happened to me  
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me  
I've got a life of my own  
I remember the day I thought we couldn't lose  
Running round the garden in your mother's shoes  
Playing with your sisters  
I didn't see you were a grown up girl  
And bringing me tea  
But is it life in a grown up world  
On a cold autumn day  
Is it life, someone's wife  
When the car had broken down  
The best of my girls  
I didn't see you were a grown up girl  
Oh how I hate the celebration  
But you give it all away leaving me on my own  
But is it life in a grown up world  
I can't wait for the end of the celebration  
Is it life, someone's wife  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
One day I might not care  
What happens to me  
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me  
I've got a life of my own  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, All that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
At the end of the world  
Marianne

Time goes so fast today.  
Don't blink she'll go away.  
Don't close your eyes.  
Not for one moment. you feel so good right  
Now. you have to stay somehow.  
Don't let it slip. let time  
Stay frozen.  
She needs you.  
You need her.  
Just like the sun.  
Don't think  
That it's over.  
It's just begun.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our song has only just  
Begun. oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let these  
Minutes go too soon.  
If wishes were for free.  
My only hope would be.  
To stop the clock.  
Let's keep this moment.  
I guess that's just a dream.  
As hollow as your own moon beam.  
So let us revel in our time.  
She needs you. you need her.  
Just like the sun.  
It never is over.  
Once it's begun.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our life has only just  
Begun. oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let this  
Moment go too soon.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our life has only just begun.  
Oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let this moment go too soon.  
Oh mister moon and mister sun.  
Our song has only just begun.  
Oh mister sun and mister moon.  
Don't let these minutes go too soon.

Make your mind up  
Who's going to think for you?  
When the time comes  
You'll have to see it through  
Use your instinct  
And take a risk or two  
Don't you worry  
'Cause you'll know what to do  
  
You can give so  
Much to me  
But I don't want it  
I will be free  
  
For the last time  
I'm going out the door  
You don't need me  
To help you anymore  
Eyes wide open  
I see it's different now  
Keep your comfort  
I'll get along somehow  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Breakdown  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Nothing good comes easily  
Count the cost, I will be free  
You can scream and disagree  
I don't want it - I will be free  
  
You can have my money  
I don't need it anymore  
I don't need your invitation  
Down that lonesome corridor  
  
Nothing good comes easily  
Count the cost, I will be free  
You can scream and disagree  
I don't want it, I will be free

I'll miss your naked body  
I'll miss your mind  
Human beings learn to miss  
The things they leave behind  
Another romance broken  
It's time to go  
Too late to contradict  
What we already know  
Closed my eyes  
To the truth  
And the lies  
Never again  
Won't ask why  
Don't reply  
I'll just say  
Never again  
Time tells  
Your heart compels  
Never again  
Never take a chance  
Again  
Time tells  
Your heart compels  
Never again  
Never break a heart again  
Never again never again  
But until then  
Never again never again  
Never again  
Never again never again  
Never again never again  
I know I couldn't keep you  
I know the score  
I know I'm surplus  
To the life you're looking for  
'Though nothing lasts forever  
Still hope remains  
We never go back to  
The way we were before  
From now on  
To the end  
Won't pretend  
Say it again  
Won't commit  
Won't submit  
'Til I know  
Never again  
Chorus  
Woman  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Woman  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never again  
Never break a heart again  
Time tells  
Woman  
Your heart compels  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never take a chance  
Again  
Time tells  
Woman  
Your heart compels  
Runaway woman,  
Never again  
Woman  
Oh my woman,  
Never break a heart again  
Never again never again  
But until then  
Never again never again  
Never again  
Never again  
Never again never again  
Never again never again

Never give your heart:  
  
Baby baby don't you hurt me  
Don't you say you've got to go  
Don't you threaten to desert me  
Is it something I should know?  
First you tell me it's the real thing  
Then you say you just don't know  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that you'll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
All the heartache that we've been through  
That means nothing to you now?  
You can't come up with a reason  
Can't explain it anyhow  
Only leave me with a meaning  
I'm not asking for your vow  
So nice  
So fine  
One day going to make you mine  
Some day  
Could be  
You'll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
There's nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on, on another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
Save a little love  
For a rainy day  
Save a little love  
Ha ha  
  
So nice  
So fine  
One day maybe make you mine  
Some day  
We'll see  
You'll know what you mean to me  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Passing like a kiss on a holiday  
Save a little love for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
There's nothing you can do that will make them stay  
Stop them moving on, on another day  
  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never give your heart to a runaway  
Never tell yourself that you'll make them stay  
Put away your heart for another day  
Never give your heart to a runaway

When you ask me do I mean it?  
You have to know  
You are the only one  
You ask me if it is forever  
How can I show?  
There's no comparison  
Beyond your doubt  
Beyond devout  
Beyond the stars tonight  
One man in my heart  
One man in my head  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
One man in my house  
One man in my bed  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
My faith is stronger than existence  
Longer than time  
More fiery than the sun  
Within a universe exploding  
Though we are mist  
Among oblivion  
Or should I lie?  
So you can cry  
In your sleep tonight  
Chorus  
Your clumsy grace  
I love your face  
And when we meet  
Oh oh oh la la la  
Your kiss so sweet  
The things we choose  
The things we choose  
The life we use  
The life we use  
The things you say  
All the things you say  
The need to stay  
And the need to stay  
One man in my heart  
One man in my head  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
One man in my heart  
One man in my house  
One man in my bed  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
I've got one man one man  
One man in my

I feel my spirit fly  
Only after dark - ahh  
I kiss the world goodbye  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Fight with the city lights  
Only after dark - ahh  
Run, I'd like to run away  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Won't you disappear into midnight with me  
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with  
Sweet elusive fate ,will be our company  
  
Bring out the vamp in me  
Only after dark - ahh  
Moon, sinful as can be  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
It's wrong to feel so free (!)  
Only after dark - ahh  
Only you know it can be  
Only after dark - ahh  
  
Won't you disappear into midnight with me  
Why don't you come, why don't you come, why don't you fly, fly, fly with  
Sweet elusive in fade , will be our company

And when it hurts you know they love to tell you  
How they warned you  
They say "Don't be surprised at someone's lies"  
They think they taunt you  
But if you can stand the test  
You know your worst is better than their best  
And so you stand here with the years ahead  
Potentially calling  
With open heart or with a spirit dead  
You walk on  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
Dare to feel  
Take the chance  
Make the deal  
Being an island  
Shying from trying  
Seems the easy way  
Such an easy way  
But there's no future without tears  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
But if you can stand the test  
You know your worst is better than their best  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart  
  
Lies the reason  
Faith or treason  
Playing a part  
End concealing  
Try revealing  
Open your heart

All day  
Hiding from the sun  
Waiting for the golden one  
Waiting for your fame  
After the parade has gone  
  
Outside was a happy place  
Every face had a smile like the golden face  
For a second  
Your knuckles white as your fingers curl  
The shot that was heard around the world  
For a seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
Seconds  
Seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took secons  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
For a second  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
For a second  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
Seconds of your time to take his life  
For a second  
For a second  
For a second

The smell of trees. Can only be that way. On a sunny day.  
Floating through the open window. To the cool inside.  
Where we lay side by side. How can anything we feel. Ever  
mean so much. As a summer love? How can anything we  
need. Ever get in touch. With the meaning of.  
A whole life waiting? Wishing suddenly. That it's going to be  
the real thing. Or separating. Try your luck again. It's just  
part of the adventure.  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Oh, Wow. You're getting to me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Another tune. Before the light has gone. And we'll be on  
our way. The sounds and smells. Will always linger on.  
They're in my heart today.  
We feel so lucky then. The world's a massive place. But we  
run into each other. Just one small happening. An accident  
of fate. Or the work of co-conspirators? But if we knew.  
What could it do. To help us now?  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Anyhow. Just give it to me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation". Oh Wow. You really got me  
now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation". Holy Cow. You're  
getting to me now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Years have gone on in between. But all I knew at  
seventeen. Is all I know now now. Through times of joy and  
suffering. The music flavours everything. That's all I know  
now.  
Holy Cow. You do it to me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation". Oh Wow. You really got me now. "The  
Soundtrack to a Generation". Anyhow just give it to me  
now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Just give it. You're getting. You do it you really got me now.  
"The Soundtrack to a Generation". Oh Wow. Just give it.  
You're getting. You do it.  
You really got me now. "The Soundtrack to a Generation".  
Oh Wow. You really got me now. "The Soundtrack to a  
Generation".

She dreams of nineteen sixty-nine  
Before the soldiers came  
The life was cheap on bread and wine  
And sharing meant no shame  
She is awakened by the screams  
Of rockets flying from nearby  
And scared she clings onto her dreams  
To beat the fear that she might die  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
  
Before he leaves the camp he stops  
He scans the world outside  
And where there used to be some shops  
Is where the snipers sometimes hide  
He left his home the week before  
He thought he'd be like the police  
But now he finds he is at war  
Weren't we supposed to keep the peace  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
From the Lebanon  
  
I must be dreaming  
It can't be true  
I must be dreaming  
It can't be true  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone?  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
From the Lebanon

Faced with the choice  
What would you say?  
The path of least resistance  
It seems the only way  
But can we look a little further?  
Too little far I think  
Self-belief's the answer  
And not another drink  
The safe method, the only way  
You rationalise your course  
Stay part of the crowd  
And never find the source  
Feel wanted, feel numb  
Just stay as you are  
The truth is - comfort kills  
And you don't need that car  
So sad, the early grave  
When all the fun's for free  
Start digging the early grave  
And keep it warm for me  
Faced with the choice  
What would you say?  
The path of least resistance  
It seems the only way  
But let's look a little further  
Too little far, I think  
Self-belief's the answer  
And not another drink  
The safe method, the only way  
You rationalise your course  
Stay a part of the crowd  
And never find the source  
Feel wanted, feel numb  
Just stay as you are  
The truth is, comfort kills  
And you don't need that car  

La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
La love  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
She is waiting  
In the office  
For the bell to go  
She is thinking  
Of their meeting  
Just a month ago  
Now she's running  
Through the people  
Everyone so slow  
Now he holds her  
And he loves her  
He tells her so and  
  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
La love  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
By the nightfall  
They have driven  
From the world they know  
She's so happy  
They're together  
And their love will grow  
  
And when you feel your chance has come  
Who's going to throw it all away  
And if there's someone left behind  
You have to say that  
  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
La love

Love is the real thing

Home again, our day is over  
Now it's time to close the door  
Turning on all over england  
You and I and millions more  
All in all it's getting stranger  
Can you see an end in sight  
Calling all the other nations  
Bring alive the world tonight  
  
And if we never understand  
Then every feeling second hand  
Is new  
And everything we ever know  
Is just the background of a show  
For you  
  
Faraway a living legend  
Wears a crown in no man's land  
There's a war that's never over  
All deny their heavy hand  
Will it all be coming closer  
If and how we're still alright  
See it all before tomorrow  
Bring alive the world tonight  
  
And if we never understand  
Then every feeling second hand  
Is new  
And everything we ever know  
Is just the background of a show  
For you

Ah ah  
Here's a song  
About living in the past  
If it was so good then  
How come it didn't last?  
If it helps you  
I'll put it in a phrase  
Those were the times  
But these are the days  
  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
These are the days  
  
The times you're smiling back on  
Had that great sitcom  
It hardly compensated  
For the terror of the bomb  
Let me help  
'cause you're looking through a haze  
Those were the times  
These are the days  
  
These are the days  
Hey hey hey  
These are the days  
Can you hear me now?  
These are the days  
Look around look around look around  
These are the days  
  
These are the days  
Hey hey live today  
These are the days  
It's time to put the past away  
These are the days  
The more you do the more you say  
These are the days  
The more I need to get away  
  
You're longing for a time  
There never was  
Now tell me the truth  
You're looking for the reason  
It's because  
You're fighting for youth  
But if I have to listen any more  
To fantasy talk  
Or any other bug you have  
I'm leaving  
  
Now I'm not saying  
Everything is really great  
Hey hey hey  
After sixteen years  
Of legalized class hate  
Why waste time  
Looking back for things to praise?  
Those were the times huh  
But these are the days  
  
These are the days  
Looking back in history  
These are the days  
Time to get contemporary  
These are the days  
The past is not the place to be

I only knew you for a while  
I never saw your smile  
Till it was time to go  
Time to go away (time to go away)  
Sometimes it's hard to recognise  
Love comes as a surprise  
And it's too late  
It's just too late to stay  
Too late to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
We'll always be together  
However far it seems  
(Love never ends)  
We'll always be together  
Together in electric dreams  
  
Because the friendship that you gave  
Has taught me to be brave  
No matter where I go, I'll never find a better prize  
(Find a better prize)  
Though you're miles and miles away  
I see you every day  
I don't have to try  
I just close my eyes  
I close my eyes  
  
[Chorus]

The way it was in the past  
A long, long time ago  
Before staff levels dropped  
They used to listen to the radio  
And listen to the DJ's talk  
About the songs they didn't know  
As if it really mattered  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Once I couldn't care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
And 20 years ago  
No-one seemed to care  
The people must have known  
The DJ's role was only there  
To fill in space between the songs  
That talk of love and other things  
As if they didn't matter  
  
Automatic stations came  
And sent them all away  
And now I'm left alone  
I haven't got a word to say  
And you're the one who makes the choice  
To turn me on or turn me off  
But now it really matters  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Once I couldn't care at all  
But I can feel the ratings fall tonight  
  
Hit-pick or phone-in show  
I don't want you to go tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight  
Our music beats the best  
You just don't need the rest tonight  
Ten thousand watts of power  
News headlines on the hour tonight

Baby, when I think about you  
And that's when I think  
I think about gold  
You remind me of gold  
And when I see the sunrise in the sky  
And when I hear your brakes come squealing by  
I forget  
Everything I've been told  
Chorus:  
You remind me of gold  
You remind me of gold  
You remind me of gold  
Baby I always think about you  
I think of the life and glory you hold  
You remind me of gold  
And even though there was no sun today  
And though you are a thousand miles away  
You remind me of gold  
Chorus repeats to fade  

Take the lovebird, kiss the stranger  
Leave the trailer, take the car  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See my finger, the way it points you  
Follow blindly into the road  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See the stranger getting nearer  
Iron teardrop, collision course  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See the blood now overflowing  
No more compression, compression done  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
I saw it happen, you saw it happen  
We saw it happen, it can't be true  
The stranger crashing into you  
I saw it happen, you saw it happen  
We saw it happen, it can't be true  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
Into you  
Into you  
Into you  
...
