Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're a place where dreams can grow  
And there's history in your mansions  
Good fortune in your plantings  
You're well respected we all know  
Hey hey America  
Let's check your children  
And see what they might know  
  
Hey hey America  
With your salesmanship and your salaries  
And your strip malls a growing  
And your handguns and your heresies  
Don't hold no responsibility  
In this land of easy millions  
Hey hey America  
It's so thrilling to see you grow  
  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're some kind of crazy island  
  
Well I prefer a sunny day  
I just thought maybe I'd live a little bit longer that way  
I don't think we should look the same  
Or talk the same  
Yeah I think it's a shame  
And hey hey America  
Across the new horizon  
Are you sure that's the way we should go  
'Cause I don't know  
Maybe it's too late for all that  
  
And hey hey America  
You're wrapped up in your red, white and blue  
Hey hey America  
Wrapped up in yourself and your red, white and blue  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
  
You're some kind of crazy island  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're a place where dreams can grow  
And there's history in your mansions  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
Some kind of crazy island

Some people ain't no damn good  
You can't trust 'em, you can't love em  
No good deed goes unpunished  
And I don't mind being their whipping boy  
I've had that pleasure for years and years  
No, no I never was a sinner-tell me what else can I do  
Second best is what you get-till you learn to bend this rules  
Time respects no person-what you lift up must fall  
They're waiting outside-to claim my crumblin' walls  
  
Saw my picture in the paper  
Read the news around my face  
And now some people  
Don't want to treat me the same  
  
When the walls come tumblin' down  
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'  
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down  
  
Some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy  
That I'm uneducated and my opinion means nothin'  
But I know I'm a real good dancer  
Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after  
Everybody's got their problems-ain't no new news here  
I'm the same old trouble you've been having for years  
Don't confuse the problem with the issue, girl,  
'Cause it's perfectly clear  
  
Just a human desire to have you come near  
Want to put my arms around you  
Feel your breath in my ear  
You can bend me, you can break me  
But you better stand clear  
  
When the walls come tumblin' down  
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'  
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down

Hey Poppi yea ho  
Hey Poppi yea ho  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Lay low proud Poppi  
Lay low proud Poppi (shout it out)  
He's from the deep south (shout it out)  
Pass Christian Mississippi  
Where the cane breaks are burning every night  
Lay low proud Poppi (shout it out)  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
  
Poppi had a wife  
And she was black and Poppi was white (shout it out)  
Everything was rolling great (shout it out)  
Till some man called her race a disgrace  
Oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well Poppi went down to the river  
To defend the honor of his wife  
(somebody's killing somebody)  
Gonna drown the man in the water (shout it out)  
And the water was shiny like a new knife  
But Poppi stopped at the banks of the delta  
He said this sure ain't worth this man's life  
Someday the wind of change  
Is gonna blow on through  
And put all of these jokers right  
See man and sing now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[chuck d]  
Papa got a brand new bag  
Delta blues got 'em dazed and confused  
Came a long way crazy  
Seems the abuse  
Is racism's baby  
It's wild  
'Cause I connect the word with pain  
Now some smile when they scream the name?  
Funny how the times have changed  
And the rhymes have changed  
But some cat's frame remains the same  
Agitating adjective  
What gives? Die "n" word die  
But I want to live  
Known' all this  
Where the word came from  
I must be three times stupid  
And stuck on dumb  
If I use it and confuse it  
With a term of love  
Now popular culture  
Can't stop 'til it gets enough  
Underlined in marketing campaigns  
I feel undermined  
Heard the "n" word promotes the bottom line  
Down by the river there's a great divide  
Let's ride  
  
[repeat: x4]  
Don't call me nigga cause you know I don't like it like that  
  
Shout it out  
Yeah shout it out  
Tell the world  
Shout it out  
I said  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Tell the world  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Tell the world  
That it ain't right  
Tell the world  
Don't set us back oh Poppi  
Don't set us back now Poppi  
Tell the world

Daylight is leaving  
And the night is closing in  
In just a few hours  
The sleeplessness begins again  
  
My head feels thick  
And I'm unable to think  
I guess I'll wait 'til tomorrow  
And see what it brings  
  
I have a little hope left  
And I guess that's someplace to start  
But my memory's full  
Of a deep blue heart.  
  
My fun-loving sense of humor  
Is nowhere to be found  
I stare into my own eyes  
With tears flowing down  
  
I'd sing out a song  
But I've forgotten the tune  
And the words now escape me  
But I think it's about you  
  
My vision now is way out in the dark  
With just a little sight left  
Of a deep blue heart  
  
I see us both flying  
In the clear blue sky  
Floating out on the ocean  
With the sun in our eyes  
  
Caught in a moment  
Just me and you  
In complete honesty  
Where everything is true  
  
That's what I wanted to believe  
Right from the start  
Just a little place for myself  
In a deep blue heart  
  
Carve out a place for myself  
In your deep blue heart

Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin' home every day  
Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line  
'Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin' out of that old dust bowl  
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl, but here's what they find --  
Now, the police at the port of entry say  
"You're number fourteen thousand for today."  
Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks, you ain't got the do re mi  
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia,
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot  
If you ain't got the do re mi  
You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm  
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea  
Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are  
Better take this little tip from me  
'Cause I look through the want ads every day  
But the headlines on the papers always say  
If you ain't got the do re mi, boys, you ain't got the do re mi  
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia,
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot  
If you ain't got the do re mi

Well I see you've got a new boyfriend  
Got your mixed up husband too  
I got 25 dollars in my pocket  
Want me to spend it all on you  
But I know that you cheat on all of us  
That's just the way that you do  
Hey, girl, I don't care where you've been  
I know, I've been there too  
  
Chorus:  
Woo, woo baby, Do you think that's fair?  
Do we really have to be so lonely and so scared  
Woo, woo baby, Do you think that's fair?  
Well I know this is up to me and you  
We make this thing turn out like we want to  
Well, last time I thought about you  
Didn't really think that much  
And the last time we spoke you said  
You were afraid of my touch  
And then you went your way  
I stumbled down a highway, I went mine  
You know, I think it's funny the  
Way infatuation gets beat up by the time  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I see your life has evolved  
Into one big masquerade  
And all of those old fools you used to run to  
They shot you full of old age  
Well, don't go expecting too much no, no  
From this new love affair  
Probably fall flat on it's face  
No one to pick you up, no one who cares  
  
Chorus

I bring you renegade stories  
And you tell me I'm crazy and wild  
You say that I lack maturity  
Stop actin' like a child  
But you know I am a liar  
And my promises only get in my way  
You feel so good, when you're in my arms  
Ain't there one right thing I can say  
To make oyu want to stay  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, oh baby, baby  
Don't misunderstand me  
Oh, oh baby, baby  
  
You tell me that you love me but  
This ain't no way for you to live  
You hold so tight your fingers are broken  
I take more than I care to give  
But it's heartbeat to heartbeat  
It's push and shove and steal and prove  
It's hand to mouth sometimes  
If we run hard enough someday baby  
Gonna find some room to move  
  
Chorus  
  
All of this showin' and provin'  
Is nothing but fear  
Everybody can do what they want  
But they just can't do it here  
Girl hold on to my childishness  
I'm gonna break on through  
Out of this mess  
  
Chorus

Dear Mr. President  
I live in the suburbs  
It's a long way from Washington, D.C.  
Had me a job  
Working for wages  
And they forgot about me  
Can't draw unemployment  
For some unknown reason  
My kids are hungry  
I've got four mouths to feed  
I go out everyday lookin' for suitable  
Employment  
Do you think, there's something  
You could do for me  
'Cause I'm...  
  
Down and out, here in paradise  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me  
  
Dear Mr. President  
I used to be a dancer  
Got a little bit too old  
So I became a secretary  
Married as man  
In Las Vegas, Nevada  
And ten years later  
He run out on the kids and me  
Some said, I was pretty  
But those days are over  
Now, I've no place to live  
And I'm out on the streets  
Oh, Mr. President  
Can I tell you a secret  
I never ever thought, that this could  
Happen to me  
'Cause I'm...  
  
Down and out, here in paradise,  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me  
  
Dear Mr. President  
I'm just a young kid  
I'm in the fourth grade  
At riley elementary  
My Mom and Dad's been actin' funny  
I'm not sure  
If it ain't got something to do with me  
My Daddy's always drunk  
My Mom's a babysitter  
And I don't like the Russians  
.Cause I hear, they hate me  
Dear Mr. President  
Can I ask you one question?  
When the bombs fall down  
Will they hurt everyone in my family  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Down and out, here in paradise  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me

Diane and Jack went to the movies  
They went to see Richard Pryor  
Screamin' on his knees for his lover  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Eden is burning  
I can see it from my window  
Better take it to the water  
Eden is burning  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Eden is burning  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Thinking of Havana  
Eating cream and bananas  
You and me in the sunshine  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
With love on our side  
With love on our side  
  
Here's the masquerade of our living  
Well, I hope it makes you feel better  
It's for our own protection  
I thought we were forever, me and you  
But nothin's forever, I guess it's true  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

In the shadows of the smokestacks  
Through the black snow, that lay on the land  
Walked home one winter morning  
With my live savings in my hand  
Maryanne, she's fixin' up some breakfast  
Got the lights on, on the Christmas tree  
Sittin' there, lookin' up at an angel  
With something dyin' inside of me  
  
Grew up with great expectations  
Heard the promise and I knew the plan  
They say people get what they deserve  
But Lord, sometimes it's much worse than that  
Maryanne, she takin' in some laundry  
I got a part time job in a drive-in stand  
Oh Lord, what did I do  
To deserve these empty hands?  
  
Across the cities  
Across this land  
Through the valleys  
And across the sand  
Too many people standing in line  
Too many people with nothing planned  
There's too many people with  
Empty hands  
  
Now Maryanne's been cryin' Lord knows, I love her the best I can  
When my pride is bruised and broken  
She slips her hand into my empty hands  
Without hope, without love  
You've got nothing but pain  
Just makes a man not give a damn  
That's no way for us to live  
We've got to fill these empty hands  
  
Across the cities  
Across this land  
Through the valleys  
And across the sand  
Too many people standing in line  
Too many people with nothing planned  
There's too many people with  
Empty hands

Cain told Abel, "Brother, you'd better get busy  
We got watermelon burnin' up out there in the sun"  
Abel said, "Cain, brother, you're drivin' me silly  
Raisin' up this fruit trader bull, you know it ain't no fun"  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're just yellin' in the dark  
We're just pissin' in the wind  
From underneath the sheets that we pray from  
Better let a little bit of this goodness get in  
  
So Cain rose up and he slay his brother  
The human soul and violence sometimes can be the next of kin  
And feelings are real in moments of desperation  
When the lowest dimension of the animal is let in  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ain't got no purpose, ain't got no direction, I ain't got no morals  
Ain't got no politics, ain't got no particular point of view  
What I've got is plenty of time on my hands, Ol' Skinny's playground  
Hey, Lord, tell me again, what you want me to do?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Better let a little bit of this beauty  
Better let a little bit of this goodness get in

As the sound bounds in the street  
And you settle down to your back seat  
And the movement seems to be  
[Incomprehensible]  
And all the jokes that you use to poke  
At all the dopes you were once seen with  
And every word that you had  
I was looking up to you for a reason  
And you joke at all the words that you spoke  
And you say, ?Hey man, I was only teasing?  
And the rhyme is no longer in time  
And all the words are not the words you been needin'  
Well, you're not alone, you can feel right at home  
You've been fully wronged, into position  
It's the nature of the race in an old type of place  
It's 'cause they'll spit in your face in their conditioned  
And now you think to yourself, what is left for tomorrow  
And it seems kinda strange there's nothing left to gain  
And nothing left to borrow  
And the mistake your about to make  
Will be the final take of your sorrow  
Well, you're not alone, you can feel right at home  
You've been fully wronged, into position  
It's the nature of the race in an old type of place  
It's 'cause they'll spit in your face in their conditioned

Good girls don't stay for breakfast  
They know it's in poor taste  
Good girls won't blow your evening  
With small talkin' chit chat just a waste  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna walk with you  
And I don't wanna talk with you  
And I don't wanna be with you  
'till the night time  
  
Good girls have reputation  
Good girls have to keep it clean  
But you girl you're so damn reckless  
You're a boll weevil evilly obscene  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Hey girl you know I've heard those stories  
About you girl last of the pony-tail queens  
China chops are a dime a dozen  
So hey girl go on and shake that thing  
  
(repeat chorus)

Everything is slower here, everybody's got a union card  
They get up on Sunday, go to church of their choice  
Come back home, cook out in the backyard  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where the cornfields grow and flow  
They're all 5 years ahead of their time  
Or 25 behind, I just don't know  
  
And all the young men talk about their 4 wheel drives  
How much money they're gonna make on Friday night  
And they like to brag about how they mistreat their girlfriends  
Hey, let's get drunk, party it up, start a fight  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Sure make a hell of a car  
And the old hearts, they race their way through the night  
The upheaval of who they really are  
  
Growin' up under normal conditions, television and radio  
That's just about all of this whole world  
That any of us get to see, get to know  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where you sacrifice body and soul  
No one really wants to get even  
Most of us find it hard enough just lettin' go  
  
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining  
I ain't braggin', nor do I mean to place blame  
That's just the way things are around here  
And there's a future carryin' my name on it  
  
Sayin' hey man, you gonna stick around here you better get on it  
If you're gonna stick around here  
You better make yourself some real good friends  
  
Well, I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth  
So I can't talk about the big city hi-life  
You wanna talk about bein' bored and runnin'  
Away from yourself, hell, I can talk to you all night  
  
And they call this the Great Midwest  
Where livin' is just gettin' by  
And people, they trade in their happiness  
For a smokestack, a big money deal in the sky

You can laugh and joke and make fun of your friends,  
Spin in the middle when your troubles begin,  
Take it nice and easy and always pretend  
That you're cool...so cool...so cool.  
  
Say, "I'munna hold onto that a while and I will and I'll be tame",  
Talk like a jerk on an educated brain,  
Be an old girl drivin' the young boys insane,  
Be a joker, a preacher...it does not matter.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Don't need to be no strong hand  
Don't need to be no rich hand  
Everyone just needs a hand to hold on to  
  
Havin' good luck with your financial situation,  
Play the ponies, be the president of the United Nation,  
Go to work and be a Hollywood stand,  
Drive your four wheel drive right into the mud, but  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And in those hours when you're alone,  
And there's nobody there except yourself,  
I know it...you want to pick up the phone,  
And say, "Talk to me, talk to me, somebody please  
Talk to me!" Yeah!  
  
Ohh, yeah!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

This land today, shall draw its last breath  
And take into its ancient depths  
This frail reminder of its giant, dreaming self  
While I, with human-hindered eyes  
Unequal to the sweeping curve of life  
Stand on this single print of time  
  
Human wheels spin round and round  
While the clock keeps the pace  
Human wheels spin round and round  
Help the light to my face  
  
That time, today, no triumph gains  
At this short success of age  
This pale reflection of its brave and  
Blundering deed  
For I, descend from this vault  
Now dreams beyond my earthly fault  
Knowledge, sure, from the seed  
  
Human wheels spin round and round  
While the clock keeps the pace  
Human wheels spin round and round  
Help the light to my face  
  
This land, today, my tears shall taste  
And take into its dark embrace  
This love, who in my beating heart endures  
Assured, by every sun that burns  
The dust to which this flesh shall return  
It is the ancient, dreaming dust of God  
  
Human wheels spin round and round  
While the clock keeps the pace  
Human wheels spin round and round  
Help the light to my face  
Human wheels spin round and round  
While the clock keeps the pace  
Human wheels spin round and round  
Help the light to my face

I love the things that scare most folks to death  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I'll stay till the end or till I'm gasping my last breath  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
No, I am never satisfied  
  
I can pretty much come and go as I like  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
Hey, with no bottom-line it's hard to know wrong from right  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I'll try anything once but then do it to death  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I expect the worst, but I hope for the best  
Oh, I ain't ever satisfied  
No, I ain't ever satisfied  
No, no, no, no, I am never satisfied  
  
Can't get enough, no, of nothing  
I've got seven of everything and more in the till  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
You think this is dangerous stuff?  
It ain't even a thrill  
I ain't ever satisfied  
Oh, I am never...  
No, I am never...  
I don't know why I ain't ever satisfied

I saw momma kissin' ol'  
Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
And she did not hear me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
Why she thought that I was tucked up  
In my bedroom fast asleep  
  
Well let me tell you that  
  
I saw momma tickle ol' Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
And what a laugh it would have been  
If my daddy would have walked right in  
  
I saw momma kissin' Santa Claus last night  
  
I saw momma Kissin Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
And she did not see me creep  
Down the stairs to take a peek  
Sure she thought that I was tucked up  
In my bedroom fast asleep  
  
Well let me tell you that  
  
I saw momma tickle ol' Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
And what a laugh it would have been  
If ol' daddy have just walked in  
  
I saw momma kissin' Santa Claus last night

In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners  
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin black market shoes  
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon  
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues  
  
She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder  
Christ, what's she doing with him she could be dancing with me  
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger  
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah I just want to be  
  
I saw you first  
I'm the first one tonight  
I saw you first  
Don't that give me the right  
To move around in your heart  
Everyone was lookin  
But I saw you first  
  
On a moon spattered road in her parrot rebozo  
Gypsy Scotty is driving his big long yellow car  
She flies like a bird over his shoulder  
She whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star  
  
But I saw you first  
I'm the first one tonight  
Yes I saw you first  
Don't that give me the right  
To move around in your heart  
Everyone was lookin.....  
  
In the bone colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'  
The radio is playin, she left her shoes out in the back  
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky  
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that  
  
But I saw you first  
I'm the first one tonight  
Yes I saw you first  
Don't that give me the right  
To move around in your heart  
Everyone was lookin  
But I saw you first  
I saw you first

If I die sudden  
Please don't tell anyone  
There ain't nobody that needs to know  
That I'm gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Don't be calling no minister  
I don't need one around  
  
Well my grandma she told me  
She'd be waiting at the gate  
She said that the fix was in  
And that she's already prayed  
And the rest of my family  
Will be waiting there for me too  
They'd already taken care of my sins  
And there's was nothing for me to do  
  
[Chorus]  
So If I die sudden  
Please don't tell anyone  
There ain't nobody that needs to know  
That I'm gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Don't be calling no minister  
I don't need one around  
I don't need no preacher around  
  
I got a little bit of money  
Some papers you might want to see  
I got a house down in Georgia  
But let's keep this brief  
I'm not afraid of dying  
This life's been right to me  
I got a whole bunch more than I deserve  
And now I will be free  
Yeah now I will be free  
  
[Chorus]

Holly told me, "You better give me a child"  
I said, "Holly, there's no way  
We don't even like each other all that much  
We couldn't make it one more day"  
She said, "You better look out, buster  
The next time you see me you're gonna pay"  
I said, "Holly, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way"  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
But I'm not running anymore  
  
Well I got two circus clowns here who like to fight  
They got one black eye and a bloody nose  
They are the hoodlums of my third wife  
Whatever I say they will oppose  
I try to teach those clowns something  
Like how to make it day to day  
I say, "Hey, you kids, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way"  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
Well I look in the mirror - what the hell happened to me?  
Whatever I had has gone away  
I'm not the young kid that I used to be  
So I push the hair back out of my face  
That's O.K., I knew this would happen  
But I was hopin' not today  
Hey Baby, I'm not running anymore  
But I'm on my way  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
And I'm not running anymore  
  
For sure!

Well I'm a middle-aged teenager  
I'm a man of angst and leisure  
Doin' the best that I can do  
My problems are incorrect  
I've always got it around my neck  
Hey I'm just like you  
Yeah I've done some good and I've done some bad  
But the most fun that I ever had  
Was singing my songs for you  
And if I should go astray  
I'd get down on my knees and pray  
Say God forgive me for what I do  
  
Oh in our lives  
There's no right way for us to live it  
You know in our lives  
There's a time to cry and a time to forget it  
  
Well I'm a broke down humble man  
Baby that's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
Well I feel good here  
Got about a million more years  
To do what it is I gotta do  
And if some day you happen to be passin' my way  
Say hi, hello, how are you  
Well, I'll return the gesture in kind  
And hope that things are fine  
And you all just do what you gotta do  
  
Oh in our lives  
There's no right way for us to live it  
Oh in our lives  
There's a time to cry and a time to get with it  
You know in our lives there's no right way for us to live it.  
  
Well I'm a broke down humble man  
That's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
Yeah I'm a broke down humble man  
Yeah that's just who I am  
And that's from me to you  
  
Oh in our lives  
You know in our lives  
Yeah in our lives there's no right way for us to live it

I stand here a black man I have no history  
I was brought up in East Chicago And I grew up on the streets  
The chains around the playground were the chains around my heart  
The brand upon my shoulder Well it reminds you who you are  
  
And it all comes true Yes it all comes true  
Like a wheel inside a wheel It turns on you  
And you think, What have I done? What can I do?  
What you believe about yourself  
It all comes true  
  
I was just a young girl My mother called me "Hon"  
My father was unhappy 'Cause I should have been his son  
They said, "Learn to be a waitress and learn to be a wife  
And be thankful for a chance to live an ordinary life"  
  
And it all comes true Yes it all comes true  
Like a wheel inside a wheel It turns on you  
And you think, What have I done? What can I do?  
What you believe about yourself  
It all comes true  
  
My life is a contradiction of sorrow and desire  
I drag my heart across the ash to throw it on the fire  
Maybe there's a reason and could there be a plan  
Or are we all just fools to think we'll understand  
  
And it all comes true Yes it all comes true  
Like a wheel inside a wheel It turns on you  
And you think, What have I done? What can I do?  
What you believe about yourself  
It all comes true  
  
And it all comes true Yes it all comes true  
Like a wheel inside a wheel It turns on you  
And you think, What have I done? What can I do?  
What you believe about yourself  
It all comes true

Well, it don't scare me none,  
I've been there before,  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shootin' back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none  
I've been there before.  
  
Well I fell in love with a woman  
Who did not love me back,  
Bare-handled rattle snakes  
And threw 'em in a sack,  
Honkey tonked with strangers  
Who were eating broken glass,  
Well, it don't scare me none  
'Cause I'll be comin' back.  
  
I take from my loved ones  
To gamble on my friends,  
I take the long way home  
And the fun never ends,  
Woke up blurry-eyed  
Wonderin' where I've been,  
I've wrestled with my conscience,  
But my conscience never wins.  
  
No you don't scare me none,  
I've been there before  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none  
I've been there before.  
  
Well, the preacher man, he told me  
I'd better change my ways,  
Put a lid on the boilin' pot  
Or there'd be Hell to pay,  
Hell ain't no place  
For a guy to jump the track,  
But it don't scare me none  
'Cause man, I'm coming back.  
  
Well it don't scare me none,  
I've been there before,  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none,  
'Cause I've been there before.

Is this your life, Jackie Brown?  
Poorly educated and forced to live on the poor side of town.  
Is this your daughter, Jackie Brown?  
This pretty little girl  
In the worn out clothes  
That have been hand-me down.  
Is this your wife, Jackie Brown?  
With sad blue eyes, walking on eggshells so you don't see her frown.  
Is this your family, Jackie Brown?  
  
Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream  
And giving the world more than it gave you.  
What ugly truths freedom brings  
And it hasn't been very kind to you.  
Is this your life, Jackie Brown?  
  
Is this your meal, Jackie Brown?  
Barely enough, I've seen people throw more than this out.  
Is this your home, Jackie Brown?  
This three room shack  
With no running water  
And the bathroom out back.  
Is this your grave, Jackie Brown?  
This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took  
Himself out.  
Is this your dream, Jackie Brown?  
  
Going nowhere and nowhere fast  
We shame ourselves to watch people like this live.  
But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown?  
Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his.  
One helluva life Jackie Brown.  
Forevermore, Jackie Brown  
Amen and amen - Jackie Brown?

So you went to a party at Jacqualine Onassis  
If you're so smart why don't you wear glasses  
So you can see what you're doin' to me  
So you can see what you're doin' to me  
So you can see what tomorrow might bring  
  
Underneath your breath you know I heard you cussin'  
You were talkin' to my second cousin  
Were you talkin' about me  
Were you talkin' about me  
You better put on your glasses so you can see  
So you can see what tomorrow might bring  
  
Can your daddy get us backstage passes  
You know that we love to dance  
Can your daddy give us backstage passes  
With all his political power  
With all his political power  
It seems to me like you could dance better than you do  
  
So you went to a party at Jacqualine Onassis  
If you're so smart why don't you wear glasses  
So you can see what the future might bring  
So you can see what tomorrow might be

The warden threw a party in the county jail.  
The prison band was there and they began to wail.  
The band was jumpin' down they began to swing.  
You should've heard those jailbirds sing.  
  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well Spider Murphy played on the saxophone,  
  
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.  
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,  
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well number forty-seven said to number three:  
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.  
I sure could enjoy some of your company,  
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."  
  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone  
  
When over in the corner weepin' all alone.  
The warden said, "buddy, don't you be no square.  
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.  
Well Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,  
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."  
  
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix,  
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."  
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.  
Everybody in the whole cell block  
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

[Chorus]  
I don't accommodate nobody  
I just take care of myself  
Gotta house down on a dusty road  
I don't need nobody else  
I gotta wife and some kids  
I don't know where they're at  
I know many many people  
But I ain't got no friends  
  
Well I used to have some values  
Now they just make me laugh  
I used to think things would work out fine  
But they never did do that  
All these bosses and the rules  
It's hard for me to fit in  
Must be ten million people  
But I ain't got no friends  
  
Well I'm a little isolated  
I live most days in my head  
And when I go to sleep at night  
I got no sheets on my bed  
I'm a little hard headed  
I can't wait for this to end  
I see people coming and going  
But I ain't a got no friends  
  
Well I look out of my window  
Into the darkness of night  
My head gets to spinning  
So I shut out the light  
I don't care if I see tomorrow  
If I had a reason I'd pretend  
I know one thing for certain  
I ain't a got no friends  
  
Well one of these days my anger  
Get the best of my soul  
In one desperate moment  
I'm gonna dig me a hole  
I'm gonna lie down in it  
And let be what will be  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me  
  
When the morning sun rises  
There'll be no one to mourn for me  
  
[Chorus]

They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
I'd like to say  
"Hey, thanks a lot"  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
I sit here watchin'  
The people down below  
I try to imagine  
The places they may go  
I don't know  
I stay home a lot  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From golden rules to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
I'm caught up in this hell  
Sometimes I feel better  
But I never do feel well.  
Jesus must have one hell of a plan for me  
I know I'm missin' something  
But I don't know what it is  
That I don't got  
  
And if I have anything to say  
About judgement day  
There'll be a crown in heaven  
For those who live this way  
Anyway  
You know exactly who you are  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am  
  
They call me Junior  
I live here on the street  
I earn two hundred dollars a week  
I'd like to say  
"Hey man, thanks a lot"  
My name is Junior  
  
I see the world through the TV Guide  
What a safe place for me to run  
What a small little man I am  
I'm afraid of everything  
From the golden rule to airplanes  
What a small little man I am

Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato  
Call me up every single day  
They don't work and they don't want to  
Come on down to some damn cafe  
  
Bobby Doll tells me  
"Live in the moment"  
Don't get too far ahead-  
Don't live in the past  
I blink my eyes  
And the moment is over  
I guess another day  
Has passed  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato  
Always there with their free advice  
They've got pearl handled pistols  
Underneath their vests  
They want me to go out drinking  
With them tonight  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
You got to clean white sheets in the morning  
Conversation all afternoon  
Bobby Doll and Big Jim Picato, baby  
And me and you  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day  
  
But it's just another day  
It's just another day  
Watching girls on the street  
Well, that alright with me  
But it's just another day

As my time goes by  
On the mean, cruel earth  
Trying to find some peace  
A little something to believe in  
How can things go so wrong  
In such a beautiful world  
Why are so many people crying  
Where's humanity gone  
And every time it gets so dark  
There's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
Well, it happened the other day  
I'm just walking down the street  
I'm looking down at my shoes  
With only myself in my way  
I'm livin' in my head  
Too much life in my veins  
Forgetting all of the time  
We're always in motion with angels  
And every time it gets so dark  
And there's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
As my time goes by  
On this mean, cruel world  
Trying to find some peace  
A little happiness to believe in  
How can things go so wrong  
In such a beautiful world  
Why are so many millions crying  
Where's humanity gone  
And every time it gets so dark  
There's nothing for me to see  
  
Something comes along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you  
  
Yea come along (just like you)  
Yea, just like you (just like you)  
Something so unbelievably beautiful  
Just like you

He was born on the fourth day of July  
So his parents called him Independence Day  
He married a girl named Justice who gave birth  
To a son called Nation  
Then she walked away  
Independence he would daydream and he'd pretend  
That someday him and Justice and Nation would get together again  
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack  
And she wouldn't let nobody in  
So a Nation cried  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies  
Justice look into Independence's eyes  
Can you make everything alright  
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight  
  
Well Nation grew up and got himself a reputation  
Couldn't keep the boy at home no no  
He just kept running 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed  
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame  
Nation if you'll just come home we'll have this family again  
Oh Nation don't cry  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies  
Justice look into Independence's eyes  
Can you make everything alright  
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight  
  
Roll a rock across the country  
Everybody come along  
When you're feelin' down yeah yeah  
Just sing this song yeah yeah

Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?  
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'  
You thought they were all kidding you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody that was hanging out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging your next meal  
  
How does it feel, how does it feel?  
To be without a home  
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone  
  
Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely  
But you know you only used to get juiced in it  
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street  
And now you're gonna have to get used to it  
You say you never compromise  
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize  
He's not selling any alibis  
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes  
And say do you want to make a deal?  
  
How does it feel, how does it feel?  
To be on your own, with no direction home  
A complete unknown, like a rolling stone  
  
Ah you never turned around to see the frowns  
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you  
You never understood that it ain't no good  
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you  
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat  
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat  
Ain't it hard when you discovered that  
He really wasn't where it's at  
After he took from you everything he could steal  
  
How does it feel, how does it feel?  
To have on your own, with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone  
  
Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people  
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made  
Exchanging all precious gifts  
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe  
You used to be so amused  
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used  
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse  
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose  
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal  
  
How does it feel, ah how does it feel?  
To be on your own, with no direction home  
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Seems like once upon a time ago  
I was where I was supposed to be  
My vision was true and my heart was too  
There was no end to what I could dream  
I walked like a hero into the setting sun  
Everyone called out my name  
Death to me was just a mystery  
I was too busy raising up Cain  
  
But nothing lasts forever  
Your best efforts don't always pay  
Sometimes you get sick  
And don't get better  
That's when life is short  
Even in its longest days  
  
So you pretend not to notice  
That everything has changed  
The way that you look  
And the friends you once had  
So you keep on acting the same  
But deep down in your soul  
You know you, you got no flame  
And who knows then which way to go  
Life is short even in its longest days  
  
All I got here  
Is a rear view mirror  
Reflections of where I've been  
So you tell yourself I'll be back up on top some day  
But you know there's nothing waiting up there for you anyway  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
And your best efforts don't always pay  
Sometimes you get sick  
And you don't get better  
That's when life is short  
Even in its longest days  
  
Life is short  
Even in its longest days

Well we're dropping our bombs  
In the southern hemisphere  
And people are starving  
That live right here  
And they're tearing down walls  
In the name of peace  
And they're killing each other  
In the middle east  
  
But love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
They raise the price of oil  
And they censor our mouths  
If you are a young couple today  
Forget buying a house  
And we wage our wars  
In the neighborhoods  
We kill the young to feed the old  
And men that ain't no good  
  
Yeah, but love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
So if you sell arms  
Or if you run dope  
You got respect  
And you got hope  
But the rest of us die  
On your battle fields  
With wounds that fester and bleed  
But never heal  
  
Yeah love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness  
  
And love and happiness  
Yeah love and happiness  
Have forgotten our names  
And there's no value left  
In love and happiness

Guilty 'til proven innocent  
I'm thinking about the government  
Wondering where the money went  
Into outer space, I guess  
Lying CS's everywhere  
Pretty boys in their underwear.  
Statue of Liberty  
Who really cares  
About freedom.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv  
Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv  
  
Throw up, throw down  
Get yourself a better town  
All these towns look the same  
Self pity, number one recreation  
We're dying in the USA.  
Preacher man, he keeps  
Preachin'  
While he covets your wife  
I ain't sayin' what's good  
I ain't sayin' what's right.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wait a minute, let me check my tan  
Am I the same color as Superman?  
Helter skelter in a foreign land  
Monkeys versus dogs,  
Lying under a big palm tree  
With cream and bananas all over me  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
Here in the Garden of Eden.  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Written by John Mellencamp  
  
This ain't no make believe  
I ain't foolin around this time  
You can believe what you want to believe  
It's a sin the way we've wasted our time  
  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Baby tear this pain from my heart  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
Maybe it's a change of plan  
Now that your dreams have left me behind  
Or is it another man  
Who didn't care that you were mine  
  
Baby this could be our last chance  
Now you're actin like it's no big deal  
Make me feel like I wanna feel  
Make me feel like I did in the start  
  
I can hear, I can hear, I can hear  
The radio playin' your favorite song  
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care  
I know that something had to go wrong  
  
Baby don't you walk away  
Stay here and listen to my plans  
You can leave, make it another day  
Stay tonight and hold me in your hands

Martha say she don't need no stinking man making no decisions for her.  
She don't need his money, she don't need him between the sheets,  
She ain't gonna sleep on the edge of the bed for no stinking man.  
And that's the way she lives 'cause I saw her last night  
Pouring water on a drowning man in the moonlight, saying:  
  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother,  
Hi-de-hi-de-hey now, Martha.  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister.  
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha.  
  
Martha say she don't need no revolver to shoot some idiot down.  
She can do it with her eyes, she can do it with her smile,  
She can do it with a conversation just walking down the hall.  
Man, now ain't that the truth 'cause i saw her take a bite out of  
Some macho dude laying some corn ball line on her last night, saying:  
  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother,  
Hi-de-hi-de-hey now, Martha.  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister.  
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha.  
  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother. (Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother.)  
Hi-de-hi-de-ho, sister. (Hi-de-hi-de-hi, yeah.)  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi. (Hi-de-hi-de-ho, yeah.)  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, Martha.  
Say what, look out, shake it up Martha.  
  
Martha say say she ain't changin', no nothin' for nobody for no damn good
reason.  
It's the way that she wants it, it's the way that she gets it.  
Well, the girl loves playing hardball, it leaves me in a no win situation
saying:  
  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, brother,  
Hi-de-hi-de-hey now, Martha.  
Hi-de-hi-de-hi, sister.  
Say what, hey you, look out, Martha.  
  
Repeat  
Martha say she don't need no stinking man making no decisions for her.

[Chorus]  
I'm not following your frame of mind  
Complaining about this life all the time  
Surely something good here as the world spins by  
Could you please stop being so mean  
  
This will never work out that's what you say  
It's the end of the world again yesterday  
When I see you coming at me I'm gonna walk away  
You need to stop being so mean  
  
Your outlook is haunting us all  
Like the ghost of our love down at the dark end of the hall  
If you can't say nothing good then don't say nothing at all  
And you need to stop being so mean  
  
Your road seems so narrow to me  
You're a big boat up the river blowing off steam  
My head is spinning from your company  
Could you please stop being so mean  
  
[Chorus]

On a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown  
He saw the sun set on the Tennessee line  
He looked at the young man who was riding beside him  
He said I'm old kind of worn out inside  
I worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary  
And my father before me I helped build this land  
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness  
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands  
My family and friends are the best thing I've known  
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming  
He said "son it sounds like rattling old bones"  
This highway is long but I know some that are longer  
By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home  
Through the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river  
The old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times  
He fell asleep with his head against the window  
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind  
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings  
I don't take stock in those uncertain things  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can  
  
The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow  
I do things my way and I pay a high price  
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride  
Now that I'm older I can see he was right  
  
Another hot one out on highway eleven  
This is my life It's what I've chosen to do  
There are no free rides, no one said it'd be easy  
The old man told me this my son I'm telling it to you  
  
Days turn to minutes  
And minutes to memories  
Life sweeps away the dreams  
That we have planned  
You are young and you are the future  
So suck it up and tough it out  
And be the best you can

There's a band playing down the street we could see, yeah  
Movie showing down at the Von Lee  
A church supper with Grandma and Grandad  
Let's go out and have ourselves the best time we've ever had  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say goodnight, my Miss Missy  
Goodnight, it's time to go home  
Hey, I might call you later  
Oh Missy, girl, it's late, it's time to go home  
  
Weight of the world's now on your head  
I take back all those mean things I said  
Little baby kicking down in your gut  
I hope it doesn't grow up to be as crazy as us  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So let's dance slow just one more time  
Let me hold your face close to mine, yeah  
Let's pretend that Jesus has come  
To take us out just one more night for fun  
  
[Chorus:]

Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say that you need me  
You'll always believe me  
Oh my sweet love  
That our love is forever  
We'll always be together  
Oh my sweet love  
  
You say you'll always come through  
There's nothing that you won't do  
Oh my sweet love  
But I've heard it all before  
I can't beg you anymore  
Oh my sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the woman who knows exactly what she's doing  
You're the girl who ate the apple off the tree  
When you're good you're just crazy, when you're bad you're too much  
  
You say you'd never hurt me  
You'll never desert me  
Oh my sweet love  
That your words are always true  
I can depend on you  
Oh my sweet love  
  
When you get in the wind  
And all the storms begin  
Oh my sweet love  
When you're sad and dismantled  
And all your senses rattled  
Oh my sweet love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sweet love standing at my gate  
Oh my sweet love  
It sure would feel good to feel good again  
Oh my sweet love

We started out  
With a sin and a lie  
And moved on to 'what's in it for me,'  
And when trouble washed up, hell, we just let it flow by  
And our kindness just washed out to sea.  
  
They say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy, he slaved  
For an uncaring boss,  
'Cause nothin' worth nothin's for free  
  
Now saviors, they work  
Lots of overtime,  
And sinners just try to get by  
And the losers, they play  
'Til they've spent their last dime  
With the comfort of knowing they tried  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me  
And Daddy, he worked  
For an uncaring boss  
'Cause nothin' worth nothin's for free.  
  
Well, I've lived a good life  
And I've lived a bad,  
And they both felt like sweet liberty,  
And I felt the storm coming,  
My redemption at hand  
And everything good comes for free.  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
To save you from people like me.  
And Daddy, he slaved  
For an uncaring boss,  
Nothin' worth nothin's for free.  
  
Well, they say Jesus died  
On the old rugged cross  
And nothin' worth nothin's for free.

If you believe  
Won't you please raise your hands  
Let's hear your voices  
Let us know where you stand  
Don't shout from the shadows  
'Cause it won't mean a damn  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I can't stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
If I was to buy you  
A diamond ring  
Make you my princess  
Would it mean anything  
Would you take me for granted  
And just curse my name  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I can't stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
Who am I to say  
What needs to be done  
I am just nobody  
Another lost one  
Caught between what's left  
And what needs to be done  
Now more than ever  
The loss of love  
The loss of our dreams  
It's not too late  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I can't stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I can't stand alone  
Now more than ever

Pretty woman, walkin' down the street.  
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet,  
Pretty woman, I don't believe you.  
You're not the truth.  
No one could look as good as you.  
Mercy  
  
Pretty woman, won't you pardon me.  
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see,  
Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be.  
Are you lonely just like me?  
Kiss me  
  
Pretty woman stop a while.  
Pretty woman won't you talk a while.  
Pretty woman give your smile to me.  
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Pretty woman, won't you look my way.  
Pretty woman, won't you say you'll stay with me.  
  
'Cause I need you, hey I'll treat you right.  
Come with me baby, you can be mine tonight.  
Ahhhhh, ahhhh  
  
Pretty woman, hey don't walk on by.  
Pretty woman, don't make me cry.  
Pretty woman, don't you walk away, hey! Ok.  
If that's the way it must be, ok.  
I guess I'll go on home, cause it's si late.  
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait!  
What do I see?  
Is she walking back to me?  
Yeah, she's walking back to me!  
Wohoo pretty woman!

She had a dream  
And boy it was a good one  
So she chased after her dream  
With much desire  
But when she got too close  
To her expectations  
Well the dream burned up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
He wanted love  
With no involvement  
So he chased the wind  
That's all his silly life required  
And the days of vanity  
Went on forever  
And he saw his days burn up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
There's a good life  
Right across this green field  
And each generation  
Stares at it from afar  
But we keep no check  
On our appetites  
So the green fields turn to brown  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin' down the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin' down the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?

Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is as cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
People know this world is a wreck  
We're sick and tired of being politically correct  
If I see through it now but I didn't at first  
The hypocrites made it worse and worse  
Lookin' down their noses at what people say  
These are just words and words are okay  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Racism lives in the U.S. today  
Better get hip to what Martin Luther King had to say  
I don't want my kids being brought up this way  
Hatred to each other is not okay  
Well I'm not a preacher just a singer son  
But I can see more work to be done  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
The money's good and the work is okay  
Looks like everything is rollin our way  
"Til you gotta look the devil in the eye  
You know that bastard's one big lie  
So be careful with your heart and what you love  
Make sure that it was sent from above  
It's what you do and not what you say  
If you're not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Lay back the top and ride with me  
I'm up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah

You may drive around in your town  
Ina brand new shiny car  
Your face in the wind your haircut's in  
And your friends think you're bizarre  
You may find a cushy job and I hope that you go far  
But if you really want to taste some cool success  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]  
Play guitar--play guitar (3X)  
  
You got your eyes on the cheerleader queen  
And you're walkin' her home from school  
You know that she's only seventeen  
But you know that your a fool  
You know you can't touch this stuff  
Without money or a brand new car  
Let me give you some good advice young man  
You better learn to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All women around the world want a phony rock star  
Who plays guitar  
  
Well you can pump your iron and shine your shoes  
And wear your hair just right  
You go down out on cruisin' street  
'Cause you want to score tonight  
We all want to strut our stuff  
And you really want to show your scars  
Forget all about that macho shit  
And learn how to play guitar  
  
[Chorus:]

Never wanted to be no pop singer,  
Never wanted to write no pop songs.  
Never had no weird hair to get my songs over.  
Never wanted to hang out after the show.  
Pop singer writing of pop songs.  
  
Never wanted to have my picture taken.  
Now, who would want to look into these eyes?  
Just want to make it real - good, bad or indifferent.  
That's the way that I live and that's the way that I'll die  
As a pop singer of pop songs.  
  
Pop singer, writing of pop song.  
  
Never wanted to be no pop singer,  
Never want to write no pop songs.  
Never wanted to have a manager over for dinner.  
Never wanted to hang out after the show.  
  
Pop singer, writing pop songs.  
Never wanted to be no pop singer, of pop songs.  
A pop singer.  
Never wanted to write no pop songs.

We rode our horses in the city  
Didn't we love living there  
Now it's gone to those more beautiful  
'Cause younger is always so pretty  
The marmalade the bed we made  
Seemed to stretch out into forever  
And we tried to stay together  
Yeah we tried to stay together  
  
Yeah, hey we had some good times  
Reckless at heart but never, never unkind  
In a perfect world we'd have done just fine  
We're positively crazy now

Written by John Mellencamp  
  
God gave Moses a few little rules  
And he said I want you to pass them around  
Take a look at those old tools  
I can't believe the shit that's going down  
You're supposed to have a good time  
But I think you take it a little too far  
Watchin' your life in vista-vision  
A monkey on your back, a brand new car  
  
Well Shakespeare threw down his pencil,  
Said I think I'm gonna start layin' brick  
Too much of this Romeo stuff enough to make  
Anybody sick  
"To be or not to be," I mean what's that supposed to mean  
I'm changin' my image tomorrow  
Be a groupie, make the scene  
  
Chorus:  
Pray for me if you want to  
If you don't want to don't stay  
Somebody shot the Vicar and the minister's on his way  
Sellin' open legs on the corner  
Punchin' Judy workin' uptown  
Pray for me if you want to  
Before some fool shoots you down  
  
The man in the cage is always for freedom  
The way of the transgressor is hard  
Cain and Abel and their old man  
Playin' croquet in the back yard  
Two guys beat up the sole survivor  
Up beat on the back street  
I don't really want to get involved  
Won't someone help me to my feet.  
Chorus

They come from the cities  
And they come from the smaller towns  
Beat up cars with guitars and drummers  
Goin crack boom bam  
  
[Chorus]  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., Yeah, Yeah!  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Said goodbye to their families  
Said goodbye to their friends  
With pipe dreams in their heads  
And very little money in their hands  
Some are black and some are white  
Ain't to proud to sleep on the floor tonight  
With the blind faith of Jesus you know that they just might, be  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Hey!  
  
Voices from nowhere  
And voices from the larger towns  
Filled our head full of dreams  
Turned the world upside down  
  
There was Frankie Lyman-Bobby Fuller-Mitch Ryder  
(They were Rockin')  
Jackie Wilson-Shangra-las-Young Rascals  
(They were Rockin')  
Spotlight on Martha Reeves  
Let's don't forget James Brown  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus]

All the leaves are green  
All my friends are gone  
I'm livin' in my hometown  
I can barely get along  
I feel sorry for myself  
That's an easy thing to do  
I feel sorry for the world  
I feel sorry for you  
Yes I am a pitiful sight  
I can't even get one thing right  
  
I know just what it's like  
To be ridin' in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what it's like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
Well I could have a nervous breakdown  
But I don't believe in shrinks  
I should be drunker than a monkey  
But I don't like to drink  
Call up some girls  
But I'm afraid of the phone  
I'm always talkin' to myself  
I guess I'm never alone  
Am I the only one that feels this way  
I'd buy myself some stylish clothes  
But I sure hate to pay  
  
I know just what it's like  
To be ridin' in the rumbleseat  
Yes I know just what it's like  
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat  
  
The sun is coming up  
Just goin' to bed  
I combed my hair with my pillow  
Still got some dreams left  
Tomorrow is a new day  
Gonna make these dreams come true  
I'm gonna believe in myself  
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna stop puttin' myself down  
I'm gonna turn my life around  
  
I'll be ridin' high  
With my feet kicked up in the rumbleseat  
Yeah we'll go for a drive  
And we'll be singin' shotgun from that rumbleseat  
Yes I'll blow you a kiss  
And we'll be ridin' big time in my rumbleseat

Oh Sad Lady do you curse your name  
And how many times have you been ashamed  
Crazy Lady letting your emotions show  
It's hard being a woman knowing what you know  
  
Oh Sad Lady were you born in vain  
Nothing to live for and no one to blame  
Ain't no use in screaming or pulling on your hair  
Crazy Lady dancing with a chair  
  
(1st bridge)  
  
Oh oh if you should get to know  
Sad Lady  
Say maybe  
  
Oh Sad Lady won't you dry your eyes  
You go on living wishing you could die  
'cause dying's not bad when living's not so good  
Crazy Lady so misunderstood  
  
(repeat 1st bridge)  
  
(2nd bridge)  
Tell me what you're thinking  
As you lace up white shoes  
Tell me Sad Lady

You ain't goin' nowhere  
Gonna sit by this pool until you fall in  
Didn't know what you were getting into  
When you walked into this room  
Did you, kid?  
  
We got some girls over here  
We got some boys over there  
And they're here just for your fun  
  
So have some dinner, baby  
Play some records  
Just remember one thing, son  
  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll  
  
You know my head is sweating  
I can't dance and I can't relax  
Outside is too threatening now  
I've come this far and I can't go back  
  
Call up some old friends  
Call up some strangers  
Get me used to that French telephone  
Donna Donna, educate me  
But tell those girls that I'm not alone  
  
Take my life and take my soul  
Put me on the cross for all to see  
Put my name around my neck  
Let those people throw stones at me  
  
This is serious business  
Sex and violence and rock and roll

Everybody's talking 'bout the seventh son  
In the whole wide world, there's only one  
I'm the one, yeah baby, I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one they call seventh son  
I can tell your future, it will come to pass  
I can do things to you and make your heart feel glad  
Look at the sky, predict rain  
And tell when a woman's got another man  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one they call seventh son  
I can talk these words, make it sound so sweet  
And even make your little heart skip a beat  
Heal the sick and raise the dead  
Make the little girls talk out of their heads  
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one they call seventh son  
Yeah, I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, I'm the one, oh yeah, I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one they call seventh son  

[Chorus]  
Can you shelter me  
From this anxiety  
Hey baby don't look me in the eye  
'Cause I'm sexually shy shy shy  
Sexually shy shy shy  
  
I don't know why  
With other girls I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
I hate for you to see me like this  
'Cause nowhere else in my life  
Does this exist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time we talk  
I can't catch my breath  
I want a conversation  
But I scare myself  
I really can't hide behind this lie  
'Cause with you baby  
I'm shy shy shy  
  
Woman  
Well I'm ashamed to say  
Woman  
That I'm afraid this way  
Woman  
Yeah  
Woman  
I gotta stop acting so crazy  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
I don't know why  
With other girls I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
I don't know why  
With other women I'm fine  
But with you baby I'm shy shy shy  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why

Homicide on the edge of town, and no one said it be easy  
Sure has its ups and downs, and Garfield is laughing  
Sitting in a dark room, making love with Sylvannia  
No so called friends around, cigarettes and champagne  
Gonna make me a big star, oh haven't you heard yet  
Don't know how its going to go, too young to tell  
And if its just my name, well hell I can change it  
And if its for the fame, I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game, that you're playing, oow  
And you play it so well, so lets play it again  
  
Sidewalks and Streetlights, sure make a pretty picture  
Strangers in the night, are you going my way  
You can drop me off at the corner, I can walk the rest of the way  
Its not that far to the nearest star  
And if its for the money, hey why can't I have it  
And if its for the glory, I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game, that you're playing, oow  
And you play it so well, so lets play it again, oow  
Lets play it again

Well I was born in a small town  
And I live in a small town  
Probably die in a small town  
Oh, those small communities  
  
All my friends are so small town  
My parents live in the same small town  
My job is so small town  
Provides little opportunity  
  
Educated in a small town  
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town  
Used to daydream in that small town  
Another boring romantic that's me  
  
But I've seen it all in a small town  
Had myself a ball in a small town  
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town  
Now she's small town just like me  
  
No I cannot forget where it is that I come from  
I cannot forget the people who love me  
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town  
And people let me be just what I want to be  
  
Got nothing against a big town  
Still hayseed enough to say  
Look who's in the big town  
But my bed is in a small town  
Oh, and that's good enough for me  
  
Well I was born in a small town  
And I can breathe in a small town  
Gonna die in this small town  
And that's probably where they'll bury me

Never give an inch - that's what I say, son.  
When it's too tough for everybody else,  
Hell, it's just right for me.  
Now my lips are bleeding  
From the selfish things that I've done,  
And my heart: it lies at the bottom of the ocean.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
  
Wanted to make love to my girl  
In the backseat of my car.  
So, I took her to the drive-in picture show.  
So, I filled her up with  
Lies and a strong love potion,  
And I'm sittin' here, watching the movie alone.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
  
Sometimes the best plans  
Have been known to go astray.  
So, you better put your seatbelt on.  
Just like your worst headache,  
Well, a bad day don't go away.  
And, you hit the ground running against your emotions.  
Sometimes a great notion...  
Sometimes a great notion...

I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I got stones in my passway  
And my road seem dark as night  
I have pains in my hearts  
They have taken my appetite  
I have a bird to whistle  
  
And I have a bird to sing  
Have a bird to whistle  
And I have a bird to sing  
I got a woman that I'm lovin'  
Boy, she don't mean a thing  
My enemies have betrayed me  
  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
My enemies have betrayed me  
Have overtaken poor Bob at last  
An 'ere's one thing certainly  
They have stones all in my pass  
Now you tryin' to take my life  
  
And all my lovin' too  
You laid a passway for me  
Now what are you trying to do  
I'm cryin' please  
Plea-ease let us be friends  
And when you hear me howlin' in my passway, rider  
Plea-ease open your door and let me in  
I got three legs to truck home  
  
Boys, please don't block my road  
I got three legs to truck home  
Boys, please don't block my road  
I've been feelin' ashamed 'bout my rider  
Babe, I'm booked and I got to go

Well, I'm all gassed up  
The car is waitin' outside  
I got three more hours on this loser's job  
And then I'll be ready to ride  
  
I got this cowboy comin' with me  
This guy's name is Jeffrey Jack  
He can shoot the eyes out of a pool ball  
He'll get those young girls into the sack  
  
We'll drop down to the dance hall  
Locals will be kickin' up their heels  
They'll be drinkin' Tequila Sunrises  
Until the morning light fills up the window sills  
  
And then I'll be with Sugar Marie  
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Come on and dance with me, Sugar Marie  
She don't ask me any questions when it's time to leave  
  
She works down at the truck stop  
Where she polishes the spoons  
She gets colas and burgers for the boys  
On those hot summer afternoons  
  
She's got this girlfriend named Linda  
Linda's got a tattoo that says, Christ  
Well, she ain't half bad to talk to  
And I reckon she looks pretty nice  
  
We'll drive down to the dance hall  
Sittin' there, waitin' on me  
Jesus, you know it feels pretty good  
And sometimes I need some good old company  
  
And then I'll be with Sugar Marie  
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Come on, dance with me, Sugar Marie  
And she don't ask me any questions, she don't flirt with the other boys  
She belongs to me Sugar Marie, Sugar Marie  
  
I never thought I needed no one  
I can make a big enough mess myself  
Oh, but when I finally found someone  
And she made me forget myself  
  
Dance with me Sugar Marie  
She's the only girl I know that can make me forget about me  
Shake that thang for me, Sugar Marie  
But she don't ask me any questions when it's time to leave  
  
Sugar Marie, Sugar Marie  
  
Hey, girl I wish we could tear the heart  
Out of this old town tonight

Exotic cars scream down the sunset of dreams  
On a hot sunny afternoon  
I'm in a hot dog stand  
With a strange love holding my hand  
And we're both playin' it real cool  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's the summer of love  
It's the summer of love, baby  
It's the summer of love  
Leastways, I'm hopin' it is  
  
So we talk about her favorite movie star or something  
She says, "Ya know, I've never done this before" (Yeah, sure)  
"I know it sounds strange, but I can't remember your name  
But I remember last night on the floor"  
And we both laughed like she told a joke or something  
She takes her neckerchief off and wraps it around my head  
And says, "Hey, you"  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
So we both walk along alone  
She says, "Hey, Mister, you sure make a strange kind of lover"  
And I say "yeah"  
I say "yeah"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Leastways, I'm thinkin' it just might be

Go on and admit it  
You can't take it anymore  
So why don't you quit it  
Your scratching off again  
Can't you see it  
Well the whole thing was such a surprise  
I know you and your hear crazy notions  
Your pretty girls and no devotions  
Down by the ocean middle class  
Down by the gulf side, you let it all slide  
But now your saying that you don't  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl, aah  
But you don't want to turn twenty-five  
You never ever, you never ever lied,  
Where you been, aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive,  
Yeah-ah, yeah  
It ain't no big deal if your attitude is wrong  
And you don't know how you feel  
You just cop someone else's ideas  
And masturbate yourself, make them your own  
Well I, I don't mean to tell you what to do  
Cause I've scratched off myself a time or two  
Well it just leaves you blue, with nothing to do  
And they think I'm crazy when I stay up all weekend  
But now your saying that you don't  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl, oh yeah, aah  
But you don't want to turn twenty-five  
You never ever, you never ever lied  
Where you been, aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive  
Yeah-ah, my na na no, yeah  
So if I'm walking down the street and you see me  
Don't walk on by, say hey man  
You know your looking, your looking so fine  
You don't have to mean it, no no  
Its just one of the regular lies that we've lived with  
And this is a love song and  
I'm writing it just to survive  
  

Suzanne was the jewel keeper  
In a word she stole all the jewels  
And she took them to a foreign land  
Which was strictly against all the rules  
And she wore them all proudly  
Like a tiara crown on her head  
She slept with them at night  
Suzanne and the jewels in a bed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Suzanne and her jewels  
Livin' on the edge of a friend  
Suzanne, how will you sleep at night  
When they take that crown from your head?  
  
Suzanne lived down by the river  
The fountain of youth did flow  
And she played on a steel guitar  
And the drifters did come and they'd go  
And she'd put on her crown  
And she'd sing them a song  
And some drifters would stay here the night  
But they never did stay long  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
This girl flew on the wind  
She wrote her own name in the stars  
Just goes to show sometimes you win  
No matter how crazy you are  
But a thief can come knocking  
Even with blood on the door  
And drink up your fountain of youth  
And throw your jewels and your crown on the floor  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I was loud and a little sad  
She was visiting from Atlanta, Georgia  
She had come to spend the summer with her dad  
I thought she was very pretty  
We would kiss and hold hands  
Every night by the football field  
Her body was tan  
From the afternoons by the public swimming pool  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet evening breeze  
Blows around my thoughts and memories  
As I lie here today  
And drink my tea  
I can still see  
Sweet evening breeze  
  
I saw her in a coffee shop  
In a big hotel down in Austin, Texas  
She had cut her long hair off  
And replaced it with  
Blue eyes of sadness  
Still acted like we were kids  
And she told me that she had to marry  
And she asked me if I did  
Still remember  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet evening breeze  
Blows around my thoughts and memories  
As I lie here today  
And drink my tea  
I can still see  
Sweet evening breeze  
  
How redundant the future can be  
These days of old are very, very  
Ridiculous for me to see  
When I think about the real gone stories  
And how time holds the winning hand  
I can tell by the lines on our faces  
And the young can't understand  
That they look at me  
When they look at themselves  
  
[Chorus:]

Now, Right now,  
Look at the place I' m in,  
When I think about things that I could have done  
It's impossible for me tp pretend.  
But I see it now as the lights grow dim  
And the world starts to close it's eyes.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I hear the music playin'  
But I no longer understand,  
Around the corner, down the street  
I'ts got to be better than where I am.  
I see it all now, as the light grows dim  
And the world starts to close it's eyes.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Just wanted to see if everything was all right,  
Just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
Time goes by  
Oh, so quietly,  
Hazy days and memories  
And in the end there was only me.  
Wouldn't have been, I ask sometimes,  
But I see myself inside this rhyme.  
Enjoyed what I had back then,  
Would I do it again?  
Well, I see it now  
As the lights grow dim  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
I just wanted to see if everything's all right  
Just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
I just wanted to see if everything' s all right,  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.

Put your life on the table  
Stick your money on the line  
Create the situation there, one more time  
Your name it means nothing  
And the dreams that we live ??  
  
And now you don't care if she is, the girl from next door  
She's never been known for nothing, but a motor street whore  
You don't believe nothin' that you can't see  
And you see me as nothing, to me, yeah-ah yeah  
  
You can take what you want  
Take what you want  
Take what you want  
But just don't take it away  
You can stay if you want  
Stay if you want  
Stay if you want  
But just don't stay all day  
Cause you know it means nothing, to me  
  
Don't see much sense in lying here with you  
The sex is over now, what is there left to do  
Conversation, conversation baby, I don't talk that much  
And now I don't know when I'm gonna see you again  
I'm leaving tomorrow and this will all start again  
I hope you don't believe that you was a failure ??  
And you see it means nothin' to be a man  
  
(repeat chorus 2 times)  
But you know it means nothing  
Yeah you know it means nothing  
Yeah you know it means nothing, to me

I read your letter, darlin'  
Tears filled my eyes  
All of the promises you made were nothing but lies  
So I turned your photograph over face to the wall  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
I'm gonna pray tonight, baby  
Hopin' you will hear  
And maybe you'll write all those wrongs  
And dry each tear  
I sit alone tonight  
Hopin' you will call  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
When I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall

Let me say thank-you to those who love many  
Let me say thank-you to those who still play fair  
Hallelujah, the meek shall inherit  
Let me say thank-you to all you people out there, out there  
Let me say grace for those who don't feel they matter  
May God look down on all the soldiers of this Earth  
Trying to find peace in this world that house so many  
Let me say grace for those who feel lost from birth, lost from birth  
Let's give a smile for those who feel that they have nothing  
Let me shake the hand of Johnny Doe out on the street  
Let's give a wink for those girls who don't feel pretty  
Let's find some water for those who need a drink, need a drink  
And when I see so many broken and lonely  
Soon to be entering Heaven's door  
Let me count the ways  
Let me count the blessings  
That no man should feel lonely anymore  
Let me say good luck to the people raising families  
Let me say thank-you to the men who grow the bread  
And here's to dreams of a bigger, brighter future  
And that we all got someone to keep the stones from our bed  
Let me say thank-you to those who love many  
Let me say thank-you for those who still play fair  
Hallelujah, the meek shall inherit  
Let me say thank-you to all you folks out there  
All you people out there

Why do I think there's nobody out there  
No one who wants me and no one who knows  
I wait in this place and no one can see me  
After all this time could I be so alone  
I walk through this old town and still feel so lonely  
The winds play sad songs high in the trees  
The sun never shines this deep in the forest  
And I in the darkness or is the darkness in me  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I want to taste the tears of a lover  
Warm as my blood as wet as a kiss  
But it's only dark rain that falls in this old town  
Old as my memory and as cold as my lips  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I don't wanna fake it  
I want to break out  
And when I feel lonely  
And when I feel lonely  
You fly me to the sun  
Above this old town  
From the top of a tower  
I forget about living I forget about pain  
At the edge of the platform  
At the edge of a heartbeat  
Above this old town I flew away  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I don't wanna fake it  
I want to break out  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I want to break  
I want to break out

As I run through this life  
Sometimes it breaks my heart  
Seein' old people goin' downtown  
Stumblin' their way through the dark  
And the little babies cry  
For their mothers' warmth  
Sometimes I feel so helpless  
I don't know where to start  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin' and changin'  
The face of the nation  
I don't recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
So many lonely people  
Damn those broken dreams  
Oh yes it could be better  
You can say that about anything  
Some got it worse than me  
Some got it worse than you  
You see the people starvin' underneath the tree  
And you wonder what happened to the golden rule  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin' and changin'  
The face of the nation  
I don't recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
You know babe I'm gonna keep on tryin'  
To put things right  
If only for me and you  
'Cause the devil sleeps tonight  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin' and changin'  
The face of the nation  
I don't recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin' and changin'  
The face of the nation  
I don't recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation

I've ridden down the sunset  
Drank expensive wine  
I've been married two dozen times  
Raised ten children on a workman's pay  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've sat in courtrooms  
Had people call me names  
I've been to London town  
On a supersonic plane  
I was lovin' your wife  
While you were lovin' mine  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've opened my belt to trouble everyday  
Ain't looking for a fight  
But you know I won't run away  
From the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've seen the goodness  
I've known the baddest around  
I was tattooed when it first came out  
I shook the hand that showed Moses the way  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life

Well I don't like it when I see your eyes dartin'  
Back and forth across the room  
And I don't like it when I see you doin' dances  
Baby that I ain't used to  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
Well I don't like it when you try to impress me  
With your daddy's jewels and his car  
And I don't like it when I hear you talkin'  
'Bout your ex-boyfriend the movie star  
  
What I like is when you walk me home  
And you let me hold you tight  
But I don't like it when I hear that you learned  
All this from some other guy  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
So look out  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey

Written by David Bowie  
  
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when  
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend  
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes  
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago  
  
Oh no, not me  
I never lost control  
You're face to face  
With The Man Who Sold The World  
  
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home  
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed  
I gazed a gazely stare, at all the millions here  
We must have died along, a long long time ago  
  
Who knows? not me  
We never lost control  
You're face to face  
With the Man who Sold the World  
(repeat)

They're so tough  
They like to make us feel little  
They like to make us feel small  
And keep us down  
Till we feel no good at all  
  
Then they tell us that we're stupid  
That we got no sense at all  
They'll keep away the spark  
Keep us in the dark  
Make us feel we have no vision at all  
  
[Chorus]  
No, no, no, I don't believe it has to be this way  
No, I don't believe it has to be this way  
  
Then they tell us to be patient  
That our time will come  
But I've stood outside their doors  
And walked their floors  
And I ain't gonna do it again  
  
They'd like to make me their nigger  
I say to hell with them  
I'm not gettin' down on my knees  
And beggin', please  
Can you throw me a crumb now and then?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't really speak to you  
And I don't know about them  
They must be out of their minds  
Can't read between the lines  
They can stick it where the sun don't shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They're so tough  
They are so tough

Please be quiet, everyone's asleep  
Stella's locked her door and she's requested some peace  
She teaches the English at the American school  
She teaches imaginary numbers and the golden rule  
She says it's hard to worry about the future  
When your past is knocking at your door  
Sweet mistakes and information  
Have been her lovers before  
Hello, all you losers  
You've got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here  
She runs the motors and the music  
On the carousel ride  
She catches the children on the horses  
As they fall through the rye  
It's hard to see the future  
When your back is bending over your shoes  
It's hard holding on to nothing  
When you've got nothing to lose  
Hello, all you losers  
You've got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here  
I guess you heard about ol' Pee Wee  
We had to tear his playhouse down  
Then they put him in the electric chair  
We'll have some fun now  
When you see her, give her some compliments on her looks  
She'll be wearing a Mardi Gras dress  
Coming after you with words and books  
We've given you the best seats in the house  
So don't be late St. Peter is at the door  
And he ain't no man to wait  
Hello, all you losers  
You've got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here hello, all you losers  
You've got nothing to fear  
This may not be the end of the world  
But you can see it from here

I've had a lot of girls in my life  
They never meant that much to me  
A good time was always had by all  
But those good times: they were fleeting memories  
I used to lie to them, and then I'd kiss them  
But I kept them an arm's length away  
Well, hey man, now you know me  
And look how silly I been acting today  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I really think I'm in love. I'm in love  
This time I think I'm really in love  
This time I really think I'm in love  
This time I think I'm really in love  
  
I used to roll down the window  
And let that tape deck blow  
And look at the honey I was holding that night  
I'd say, "Hey, girl, you're the one"  
And then I'd laugh when I'd take her home  
You got your arms around my shoulders  
You got my soul confused with my heart  
You were too smart to believe all those tired lines  
And I was too dumb to know what had started  
  
I hope you don't lose that innocent laughter  
I hope time doesn't take that away  
  
[Chorus]

I was watching a movie, the other night on TV  
The actress reminded me of you  
Her attitude, the way that she smiled  
She was doin' a part girl, like you used to do  
  
I do believe you played it better  
If it wasn't better, it was just as strong  
I would've called you up on the telephone that night  
But somehow girl, it'd been all wrong  
  
I heard you married a stranger  
In a horse and carriage that was covered with gold  
Well, you wanted to be different and still fit in  
I wonder if you feel different at all now that you're older  
  
Hope you didn't lose that innocent laughter  
Oh, God I hope time didn't take that away  
All those junior high nights underneath the front porch light  
A good Catholic girl during the day  
  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
If I saw you today, girl, I wouldn't even know ya  
  
Well, I know it wasn't that big of a love affair  
But boy, it sure seemed like one back then  
When I parlay the memories into their proper places  
I can see now, we were no more than friends  
  
Ooh, your kisses sure tasted sweet  
But I guess any kiss tastes sweet at fifteen  
I just hope your touch is as warm to your ol' man  
As it seemed like it was to me  
  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
Old enough to know that these memories can't hurt a thing  
Oh oh oh, just watching the time grow  
If I saw you today, girl, if I could be with you today  
I wouldn't even know ya

They are master and slave  
We are sunlight and shadow  
All roads to the river  
I am lost. I am saved  
I'm beloved and betrayed  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
And the river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well, the deeper I drown  
Lord, the higher I'll go  
  
I am whispering dreams  
I am howling revolutions  
All roads to the river  
I am Valentine sweet  
And I live in this nightmare  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
The river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well, the deeper I drown  
Lord, the higher I'll go  
  
This is nothing like we planned  
That's the way it's always been  
All roads to the river  
I have hated and I have loved  
I have prayed and I have sinned  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
The river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well, the deeper I drown  
Lord, the higher I'll go

Eight years of peace and prosperity  
Scandal in the White House  
An election is what we need  
From coast-to-coast to Washington  
  
So America voted on a president  
No one kept count  
On how the election went  
From Florida to Washington  
  
Goddamn, said one side  
And the other said the same  
Both looked pretty guilty  
But no one took the blame  
From coast-to-coast to Washington  
  
So a new man in the White House  
With a familiar name  
Said he had some fresh ideas  
But it's worse now since he came  
From Texas to Washington  
  
And he wants to fight with many  
And he says it's not for oil  
He sent out the National Guard  
To police the world  
From Baghdad to Washington  
  
What is the thought process  
To take a humans life  
What would be the reason  
To think that this is right  
From Heaven to Washington  
From Jesus Christ to Washington

Written by John Mellencamp  
  
Well I get up in the morning  
Have a smoke, have a drink  
Then I get dressed  
I don't want to get to work too late  
'Cause that bossman he's a real mean son-of-a-bitch  
Everything is so fast and so crazy  
But the day still slowly slips on by  
And when that five o'clock whistle starts to blow  
I'll be gone in a wink of an eye  
  
Chorus  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
And that long haired girl will be smiling  
When she sees me walkin' in  
Well all right, she looks so good  
That she just hasta be a sin  
Tonight, I'm gonna see my baby again  
  
We'll walk over to the East Street Montgomery Pier  
She says she likes holding something dangerous  
She pulls me close and whispers in my ear  
She says, "Come here little boy  
I'll put my pussy right on your face  
Because my fever is runnin' hot and high  
And you're the boy that makes me feel like I'm alive"  
  
Chorus

Well there's a pain in my side  
But I keep traveling on  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
It's dark out here  
I can't read those signs  
Bring peace to the troubled land  
Hurricane on the horizon  
Judgment getting closer all the time  
I can't find tomorrow  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
  
Well there's two men a walking  
Down the same dirty road  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
They stand shoulder to shoulder  
Carrying the same heavy load  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
One man's eyes are full of sorrow  
The other man's belly full of unbearable pain  
They keep getting closer  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
  
I've got many screaming children  
Ten million rows to hoe  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
Deader than an hammer  
But I can't let go  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
The eyes of heaven are upon you  
But so is the soul from down below  
They'll cut off your fingers  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
  
Well you can stand up and holler  
You can lay down and die  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
We can turn up our collars  
And never even try  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
Beware of those who want to harm you  
And drag you down to a lower game  
Just know the truth is coming  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
  
I got a pain in my side  
But I keep traveling on

Oh the sun beats down and melts the tar up on the roof  
And your shoes get so hot you wish your tired feet were fire-proof  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
[Chorus:]  
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun  
Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun  
Under the boardwalk, people walking above  
Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love  
Under the board-walk, board-walk  
  
From a park you hear the happy sounds from a carousel  
You can almost taste the hotdogs and french fries they sell  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be  
  
On a blanket with my baby is where I'll be

The simple minded  
And the ill informed  
Can be easily led astray  
And those that cannot connect the dots  
Hey look the other way  
People believe what they want to believe  
When it makes no sense at all  
And I wish you all along the sideline  
The strength to  
  
Walk tall  
Yeah walk on  
Through this world  
Walk tall  
  
Somewhere out in the distance  
Is the death of you and me  
Even though we don't think of it much  
It's still out there for us to see  
If you treat life like a bar room fight  
You'll die stinking of gin  
No drunkards are allowed in heaven  
No sinners will get in  
  
Walk tall  
Yeah, walk on  
Walk tall  
Through this world  
Walk tall  
  
So be careful in what you believe in  
There's plenty to get you confused  
And in this land called paradise  
You must walk in many men's shoes  
Bigotry and hatred are enemies to us all  
Grace, mercy and forgiveness  
Will help a man walk tall  
  
So walk tall  
Yeah, walk on  
Walk tall  
Through this world  
Through this world  
  
Yeah, walk tall  
Then walk on  
Walk tall  
Then walk on  
Through this world  
Through this world  
Through this world  
Through this world  
  
Walk tall  
Walk tall  
Then walk on  
Walk tall

If you're feeling shut down  
May my thoughts be with you  
If you're a black man bein' beat down  
And shoved all around  
May my thoughts be with you  
If your world's getting' a little too tough  
You know, our thoughts bein' with you  
Hey, I know, that it's crazy out there  
And my thoughts are with you  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind  
  
If you are one of the homeless  
May my thoughts be with you  
If you are scared and alone  
You know, our thoughts are with you  
If you are one of the fortunate ones  
We all know, it's lonely up there  
We understand, that nobody's got it made  
So our thoughts are with you  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind  
  
You see yourself as a leader  
May my thoughts be with you.  
If you try to divide and conquer  
We'll rise up against you  
We know, only the strong will survive  
But the meek will inherit  
So if you got a coat of arms  
Oh friend  
I suggest, we wear it  
  
We are the people  
And we live forever  
We are the people  
And our future is written in the wind  
On the wind

Well, I hear you downstairs  
You're foolin' around with your father's brother  
And your mother's gown  
  
All the old heroes keep coming around  
To find you, if you're still at home  
  
So you lie in the sun, watch your body turn to tan  
Your skin is oiled with the sweat of a man  
  
He bought you a diamond ring, girl, to wear on your hand  
And, baby, he's leaving tomorrow  
  
Yeah, I'll be with you in your weakest moments, uh huh  
Yeah, I'll be with you in your weakest moments  
  
You say you remember when it was your world  
And you were Mister Ruby's girl  
He gave you dreams and schemes that swirl  
Around your head and your body  
  
And when you drink sometimes, you try to liberate  
And you stagger in the front yard till you find the gate  
That swing on that thin line of love and hate  
And baby, just let it go  
  
Yeah, I'll be with you in your weakest moments, uh huh  
Yeah, I'll be with you in your weakest moments

Written by John Mellencamp  
  
In the cool of the evening  
I don't know the reason  
But I long to touch  
Some young tender hearts sometimes  
So I go to this party  
With a bunch of me hardies  
They say don't get too cute  
Don't get too smart  
'Cause these people are crazy  
They toot coke and drink wang-too  
And they talk in some crazy tongue  
There's a slit-eyed lady  
Say'n don't you be so stupid  
I may be old but I'm still good fun  
Still good fun  
Yeah I'm still good fun  
  
Well I ain't that choosy  
I'll flip-flop with a floozy  
If I figure there's no strings attached  
But sometimes I loose my feet  
Underneath the back seat  
And I have to fly my heart at half mast  
Well this old bitty  
She was smart and she was witty  
She was really out of control you know  
It was stumble or fall  
I had my back to the wall  
I didn't know to bet on win, place or show  
  
Chorus:  
Welcome to Chinatown, she said  
I'm gonna lay your body down, she said  
I ain't no queen, but I'm wearin' this crown  
She said  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
  
Well she shimmered and she shook  
What she wanted she took  
She shook like some rickshaw ride  
She stuck her fingers down my throat  
'Till I almost choked  
I thought I'd gone heaven and died  
Well she took me by the ear  
And said what do you want to hear boy  
You want to hear those crazy old lies  
I said nothing you can say girl  
Can drive me away  
Just check my complexion  
Make sure I'm still alive  
  
Chorus:  
Welcome to Chinatown, she said  
I'm gonna lay your body down, she said  
I ain't no queen, but I'm wearin' this crown  
She said  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown  
Welcome to Chinatown

What if I came knocking  
On your front door some night?  
Would you open the window  
And drop me down the key?  
What if I came knocking  
On your bedpost that same night?  
Would you open up your heart  
Or try to get the best of me?  
  
What if I came knocking  
On your brain the next day  
And ask for your truth and your love and your honesty?  
Would you build up your big walls  
And try to hide behind that smile  
Or would you try to pull the wool right over me?  
  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came kicking  
And it scared you a little bit  
And I came on strong  
Would you think  
That there's something wrong with me?  
Or could it be your fears  
Of trying something real  
Or just afraid to touch  
A guy like me?  
  
What if I came knocking?  
What if I came knocking?  
What if I came knocking  
On your front door some night? Ahh  
  
So let's just say it worked out  
Like a storybook dream  
And we lived happily ever after  
Fa la la la  
But what if I came crying  
After just a few weeks  
And said I misread my heart  
This is not really meant to be? yeah  
  
So if you hear some knocking  
On your window tonight  
You can bet that it's probably me  
But let it be known  
That we're just a pair of tumbling dice  
And the outcome of these crap shoots  
Is hard to see  
  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking?  
So what if I came knocking  
On your front door tonight? Ahh  
So what if I came knocking?  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knocking  
Kick, kick, kick  
What if I came knocking  
On your front porch tonight, tonight?

I'm tired of being grateful for a chance to take a dive  
I'm sick of everything I do just to keep myself alive  
When you cut away the skin that bears the brand  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Saw the man in Jamaica, he had a shadow on his back  
I recalled the ring of fire, and he wore his suit of black  
When the legend and the ocean meet the sand  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began  
  
Everyone is so fabulous, hey, we all got our gun  
Old Snakey's not a sinner, no, he just shows us how it's done  
When you separate the wretched from the damned  
Standin' in the darkness, baby, there I am  
  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone call my name out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Someone put the flame out  
Standin' in the darkness  
Baby, there I am  
Where the world began

Pretty girls in beat up cars  
Throwing kisses to the soldiers  
Pale blue eyes and whisky bars  
The lines on her face say she's getting older  
Girl you better reach out to me  
  
Runnin' with your  
Weakness in the dark  
You hope it disappears by tomorrow  
On your knees and in the dark  
Don't wanna beg  
Lord knows, you're too old to borrow  
You better reach out to me  
Girl you better reach out to me  
  
Chorus  
'Cause you're a oh, oh, oh, oh wild angel  
Oh, oh, oh, oh a wild angel  
  
Cabin fever nearly drove us insane  
When the snow fell on us last December  
Look at me girl, I don't feel the same  
Now those days they've all gone together  
You better reach out to me  
Girl you better reach out to me

Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm?  
Or a lion through a busy street bazarre?  
There are many things I'd love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel they're safer where they are  
  
Yes, there's a man I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all  
Yes, there's a man that I know  
With no expression, darling  
He's got none at all  
  
Well, some people are inbound with infatuation  
And some others spill depression as the law  
From one's mother getting at no imagination  
So beware then, maybe sin is at your door  
  
Yes, there's a man that I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all  
Yes, there's a man I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all  
  
But you may never, never  
See this man laughing  
Come to think of it,  
I've never seen him cry  
But he might be sitting  
And you hear him singing  
And by and by he'll stop and sigh  
Before his voice would even begin to speak  
And he'd just cry  
  
Yes, there's a man I know  
With no expression, darling  
He's got none at all  
Yes, There's a man that I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all  
  
Have you ever, ever ridden horses through a rainstorm?  
Or a lion through a busy street bazarre?  
There are many things I'd love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel they're safer where they are  
  
Yes, There's a man that I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all  
There's a man that I know  
With no expression  
He's got none at all

Destiny shares the eyes of the young genocides  
Suicides that are still alive  
Their success has been so well disguised, yeah  
And on their face, is a razors blank stare  
As if to know their destiny is going no where??  
But no where is not so hard to bare  
Where their parents can decide  
Hand and hand they walk together  
With their broken pride  
Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers  
And the whole world to decide??  
Desperately searching and dangerously.....  
I deserve....  
Not much worse than they are, of the young genocides  
Facing the world with your back to the wall  
Its hard to feel important at all  
The Grand Illusion that'll never come  
Its disguised itself as tomorrow

Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all my friends  
Better take a look  
At the colors of the people  
  
[Chorus]  
Young without lovers  
Old without friends  
  
Better say a prayer  
For the poor and unhealthy  
Better sing a song  
For those who don't care  
Let the people have the right  
To be different  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is an abstraction  
And it tries to fool us all  
And it's working so far it seems  
Brother against brother  
This world is such a mess  
Behind the drawn curtains  
So our thoughts can not be seen  
  
Better shake the hand  
Of the hated  
Better hear the words  
That don't seem clear  
Better take a look around  
At what we're doing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all of my friends  
Let the people have the right  
To be different  
  
[Chorus: x3]

See the moon roll across the stars  
See the seasons turn like a heart  
Your father's days are lost to you  
This is your time here to do what you will do  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Would you teach your children to tell the truth  
Would you take the high road if you could choose  
Do you believe you're a victim of a great compromise  
'Cause I believe you could change your mind and change our lives  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Would you teach your children to tell the truth  
This is your time here to do what you will do  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now
