Abide with me, fast forth the eventide  
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me  
When other helpers fail and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me  
  
Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes  
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies  
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee  
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me  
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing  
  
I got your picture hanging on my wall  
But it can't seem to come to me  
When I call your name  
I realized it's just a picture in a frame  
  
I read your letters but you're not here  
They don't move me, they don't groove me  
Like when I hear  
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear  
  
I play my games of fantasy  
I pretend I don't see reality  
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me  
  
I got some memories to look back on  
Though they help me when you're gone  
I'm well aware  
Nothing can take the place of you being there  
  
No other sound is quite the same as your name  
No touch can do half as much  
To make me feel better  
Let's stay together  
  
I'm so  
So glad we got the real thing, baby  
So glad we got the real thing  
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby  
Ain't nothing like the real thing

All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw  
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war  
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth  
See the stems of Europe bend under force  
  
All quiet  
All quiet  
All quiet on the Western Front  
  
So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares  
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir  
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand  
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands  
  
It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh  
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies  
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys  
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

Raised to be a lady by the golden rule  
Alice was the spawn of a public school  
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain  
And a simple case of Mummy-doesn't-love-me blues  
  
Reality it seems was just a dream  
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene  
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen  
And hey, hey, hey, you know what I mean  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
Come over and see me  
Come over and please me  
Alice it's my turn today  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
If I give you my number  
Will you promise to call me  
Wait till my husband's away  
  
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart  
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part  
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed  
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead  
  
And who could you call your friends down in Soho  
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go  
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo  
And hey, hey, hey, oh don't you know  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
Come over and see me  
Come over and please me  
Alice it's my turn today  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
If I give you my number  
Will you promise to call me  
Wait till my husband's away

If it came to pass that they should ask  
What could I tell them  
Would they criticize behind my back  
Maybe I should let them  
Oh if only then and only then  
They would understand  
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy  
Into a full-blooded city man  
  
If they could face it  
I could take it in their eyes  
Oh I know I'd make it  
Their tiny minds  
And sacred cows just fake it  
If only then and only then  
They would understand  
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy  
Into a full-blooded city man  
  
But I know the way they want me  
In the way they publicize  
If they could turn their focus off  
To the image in their eyes  
Maybe it would help them, help them understand  
Maybe it would help them, help them understand  
Maybe it would help them, help them understand  
That a full-blooded city boy  
Is now a full-blooded city man  
  
Oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Oh my soul

You know it, it is only true  
That you could be the best of you  
How I wonder miles away  
Tying horshoes by the bay  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Many say and lucky do  
My own fire once said it too  
Leave the ocean live and play  
Door on sockets yesterday  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Is it fair or nestled sorrow  
You could be there tomorrow  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Whooo...  
  
Whooo...  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso

You're a cool little one  
My dark southern breeze  
Sweeps through my fingers  
And it amazes me  
  
Dixie shadowland  
Your envy shelters me  
Lay down your burden  
Mystery of ebony  
  
And it amazes me  
Oh it amazes me  
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune  
It amazes me  
It amazes me  
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon  
  
Look up that pale light  
Well she's waking the trees  
I'm drifting in your hoodoo  
And it amazes me  
  
That magnolia state  
Got a hold on me  
I got no blues to preach  
Just Mississippi company  
  
Ain't no magic potion  
No gri-gri on her side  
She's bound to my salvation  
Sweet little mama  
Take me down by the river tonight  
And it amazes me

Seen him playing in his backyard  
Young boy just starting out  
So much history in this landscape  
So much confusion, so much doubt  
  
Been there drinking on that front porch  
Angry kids, mean and dumb  
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline  
God hates fags where we come from  
  
'Western skies' don't make it right  
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense  
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire  
Left to die on a high ridge fence  
  
It's a cold, cold wind  
It's a cold, cold wind  
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming  
  
See two coyotes run down a deer  
Hate what we don't understand  
You pioneers give us your children  
But it's your blood that stains their hands  
  
Somewhere that road forks up ahead  
To ignorance and innocence  
Three lives drift on different winds  
Two lives ruined, one life spent

Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
And when it rains the rain falls down  
Washing out the cattle town  
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown  
And she dreams of crystal streams  
Of days gone by when we would lean  
Laughing fit to burst upon each other  
  
I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening  
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly  
Down the bronze of your body  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin  
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open  
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley  
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey  
  
Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

Tread on my face if you like little lady  
Turn me inside out if you have to baby  
But don't you cross me off your list  
I am young and I ain't never been kissed  
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy  
  
You're far out, you're fab and insane  
A woman of the world, it's quite plain  
My dad told me Amy's your name  
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game  
But he can bust my neck 'cause I love you all the same  
  
Amy I know you don't have to show your affection  
Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection  
So if you don't want me around  
I think I'll run along and drown  
You can't want this bum in town Amy  
  
I'm beaten on the streets 'cause I loves you  
I watch you go to work in the summer  
I don't whistle at you down the street  
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see  
  
Amy I may not be James Dean  
Amy I may not be nineteen  
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans  
But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart  
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart  
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice  
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise  
  
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart  
And if it's all the same maybe we should part  
And I'm singing do do do...  
I'm singing do do do...  
  
You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt  
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out  
  
Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly  
Driving me insane  
Oh oui baby  
  
I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart  
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart  
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice  
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise  
  
I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love  
So I'm gonna quit this game 'cause baby I've had enough

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album blue moves  
  
She slid down to the city limits  
Monkey time in fifteen minutes  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
Don't let me down  
Please stick around  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
  
Strobe light on the funky feet  
Soul children in the disco heat  
Top dog, top cat  
Move that muscle and shake that fat  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
  
Chicago, L. A.  
Every place, every way  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
  
Strobe light on the funky feet  
The soul children in the disco heat  
Top dog, top cat  
Move that muscle and shake that fat  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
  
Illinois, santa fe  
Do what I say  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance  
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance

I gotta quit this habit  
It's like some drug for you  
You've been my sweet sweet addict  
I've been your little white boy blue  
  
You've got the same obsession  
We ain't no cat and mouse  
You linger on my lips like confession  
You laid the traps in this house  
  
And it's no use each way we lose  
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue  
Hit and run hearts collide here  
True love passes through  
Looks like we've got a wreck babe  
Up on Blue Avenue  
Up on Blue Avenue  
Blue Avenue  
  
Two hearts get entangled  
Dirty minds they go to town  
Everyone's got an angle  
Little lies get spread around  
  
Let them say what they want  
You and me we already knew  
Takes more than hocus pocus babe  
To save you from Blue Avenue

Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
Like a deep blue sea  
On a blue blue day  
  
Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
When the morning comes  
I'll be far away  
And I say  
  
Blue eyes holding back the tears  
Holding back the pain  
Baby's got blue eyes  
And she's alone again  
  
Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
Like a clear blue sky  
Watching over me  
  
Blue eyes  
Ooh I love blue eyes  
When I'm by her side  
Where I long to be  
I will see  
  
Blue eyes laughing in the sun  
Laughing in the rain  
Baby's got blue eyes  
And I am home again  
  
Blue eyes laughing in the sun  
Laughing in the rain  
Baby's got blue eyes  
And I am home again

He wasn't famous but I sure did love him  
I've got his picture in a little frame  
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name  
But there's so many more and I've lost count  
The how's and whys aren't important now  
All that matters is they came around  
And brightened up our lives  
  
She was twenty one with her life ahead  
You don't need to know her name  
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade  
But fate's right hand isn't always just  
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust  
She was just a little girl ain't that enough  
To rage against the day  
  
[Chorus:]  
And how did we get so lucky?  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?  
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls  
But blues never fade away  
  
He shone so bright with a lust for life  
Like the Sun King that he was  
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth  
And for reasons I never understood  
About the choices made between the bad and good  
I've tried to figure out but  
The pain never goes away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And there's marble markers and little white crosses  
Along the beaten path  
And I've spread their ashes on the wind  
And I miss John Lennon's laugh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And how did we get so lucky?  
Targets on the rifle range  
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?  
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?  
  
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues  
And blues never fade away  
Hey hey hey all the colors run when the rain falls  
And blues never fade away

Crime in the streets  
I read about it everyday in the papers  
Justice needs and justice wants  
But just in times, yes, too late here  
Feels like I wasn't born there  
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim  
  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Hustled to get it  
To get it together  
Down on the jive talk  
Down on the weather  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Brother I never felt better  
No, I never felt better  
  
Low life's complete  
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk  
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)  
I got the speed if you got the need  
But the need in me needs nothing  
(But you know that I need nothing)  
But I know that you all want something  
Just like Boogie Pilgrim

You've been crying  
And there ain't no use denying  
It was me  
Who put you through this misery  
And I'd like to say I'm sorry  
But I can't, no I can't  
Nothing's gonna change me  
Baby, that's the way I am  
I was born bad  
Always been the same, yes I was born bad  
Never gonna change 'cause I was born bad  
Only me to blame 'cause I was born bad  
Yes I was born bad  
Always been my habit, I was born bad  
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad  
Always gonna happen, I was born bad  
Cause I was born bad  
I mistreat you  
And you know I always cheat you  
But that's me  
And that's the it's always been  
And I'd like to say I'm sorry  
But I can't, no I can't  
Nothing's gonna change me  
Baby, that's the way I am

Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
Oh it seems so hard to bear  
When I wake and find that you're not there  
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through  
I'm born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
Born to lose  
And now Elton I'm losing you

They're writing songs of love, but not for me  
A lucky star's above, but not for me  
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are gray  
Than any Russian play could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall and get that way  
High ho, alas, and also lack-a-day  
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss  
I guess she's not for me  
  
It all began so well, but what an end  
This is the time a feller needs a friend  
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot  
And there's no knot for me

I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day  
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay  
It's dirty work in Birmingham  
Better deal for a Sheffield man  
If he can rivet then his kids can buy  
Candy from the candy man  
  
And the van that comes around weekends  
Selling fancy city things  
Sold by the man with the trilby hat  
And the whiskers spread like wings  
You can hear him sing  
Oh you can hear him sing  
Can I put you on, people can I put you on  
Tell you that I love you people  
Sing a salesman's song and put you on  
  
And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne  
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind  
It's dirty work in Manchester  
But the crew gets paid its gelt  
Bang on the bell on Friday  
You buys a little something for yourself  
  
And the van that comes around weekends  
Selling fancy city things  
Sold by the man in the trilby hat  
And the whiskers spread like wings  
You can hear him sing  
Oh you can hear him sing  
Can I put you on, people can I put you on  
Tell you that I love you people  
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day  
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away  
An enchanted moment and it sees me through  
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you  
  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
How it's laid to rest  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
  
There's a time for everyone if they only learn  
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn  
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors  
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours  
  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
It is where we are  
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer  
That we got this far  
  
And can you feel the love tonight?  
How it's laid to rest  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best  
  
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds  
Believe the very best

Goodbye Norma Jean  
Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the twenty second row  
Who sees you as something more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did

Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town  
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found  
I have said goodbye to my fooling around  
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound  
You and me babe we got candy by the pound  
  
Well I never knew it could feel so good  
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood  
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound  
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound  
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound  
  
You can tell everybody that this girl of mine  
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine  
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown  
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound  
  
Oh no what's come over me  
If I am dreaming then let me sleep  
Oh wow I'm heaven bound  
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound  
  
Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense  
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend  
She's screaming murder beating my door down  
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound  
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound

You don't love him any more  
He threw your rag doll out the door  
I keep my distance, I held my breath  
Love always ends up hanging by a thread  
  
Love hurts so much  
Love leaves a scar  
'I don't love you' is like a stake  
Being driven through your heart  
  
But I don't care  
I came back for you  
Love is cruel, but I don't care  
I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold  
  
You said don't cry to me  
He said I'm a dead man if you leave  
I have no feelings, I have no heart  
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part  
  
Love hurts so much  
Love cuts so deep  
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake  
Like drowning in your sleep

Music by elton john  
Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album too low for zero  
  
We still sit at separate tables  
And we sleep at different times  
And the warm wind in the palm trees  
Hasn't helped to change our minds  
  
It was the lure of the tropics  
That I thought might heal the scars  
Of a love burned out by silence  
In a marriage minus heart  
  
And I call the kids on the telephone  
Say there's something wrong out here  
It's july but it's cold as christmas  
In the middle of the year  
  
The temperature's up to ninety five  
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes  
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here  
So how come it's cold as christmas in the middle of the year  
  
I dreamed of love in a better climate  
And for what it's really worth  
I put faith in the star we followed  
To this caribbean surf  
  
But there's an icy fringe on everything  
And I cannot find the lines  
Where's the beauty in the beast we made  
Why the frost in the summertime

If you want it, here it is, come and get it  
Make your mind up fast  
If you want it anytime, I can give it  
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last  
  
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch  
Will you walk away from a fool and his money  
If you want it here it is, come and get it  
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast  
  
If you want it, here it is, come and get it  
Make your mind up fast  
If you want it anytime, I can give it  
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last  
  
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch  
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny  
If you want it here it is, come and get it  
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast  
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast  
Fool and his money, sonny  
  
If you want it here it is, come and get it  
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast  
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast  
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast

Come back, baby, come back to me, yeah  
And you will see yeah, how I've changed  
'Cause you're the only love I ever had  
You're the only love I ever had, come back to me  
  
Come back, baby, I did you wrong, yeah  
And this is the song I sing, I hope will bring you back to me  
You're the only love I ever knew, you're the only love I ever knew  
Come back come back  
  
Come back, baby  
Come back and treat me right  
Come back, baby  
Come on back, I'll hold you tight  
  
Come back, baby  
Come back I'll treat you right  
Come back, baby, come on back  
Come back and hold me tight  
  
Come back, baby  
Every thing's gonna be fine right now, yeah  
It's gonna be fine right now, yeah it's gonna be fine right now  
You're the only love I ever had and you're coming back  
And I'm so glad you're coming back to me  
  
Come back, baby

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere  
Village children fight each other for a share  
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek  
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week  
  
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store  
Well she's really going fine for eighty four  
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn  
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm  
  
And it's good old country comfort in my bones  
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known  
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown  
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home  
  
Down at the well they've got a new machine  
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen  
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say  
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day  
  
Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks  
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks  
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch  
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

On a bench, on the beach  
Just before the sun had gone  
I tried to reach you  
Plain faced and falling fast  
You looked so vacant like an empty shell  
Whose life had passed upon the ocean  
  
Before light shook the sky  
Down by the docks I saw  
The masts unfolding  
Don't turn away, please understand  
It's a life and a living  
And a way to keep the wolves away  
From hungry hands, from hungry hands  
  
Crazy water  
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning  
Dangerous dreaming  
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing  
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water  
  
Tangled lives, lonely wives  
Shoreline widows pray  
For the souls of missing whalers  
Endless nights on an endless sea  
Where nothing lives between us  
Just the breakers on the ocean  
Separating you and me  
Separating you and me

I remember when rock was young  
Me and Suzie had so much fun  
Holding hands and skimming stones  
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own  
But the biggest kick I ever got  
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock  
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock  
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock  
  
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking  
When your feet just can't keep still  
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will  
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights  
When Suzie wore her dresses tight  
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  
  
La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la  
  
But the years went by and the rock just died  
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy  
Long nights crying by the record machine  
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans  
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got  
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock  
Learning fast as the weeks went past  
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last  
  
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking  
When your feet just can't keep still  
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will  
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights  
When Suzie wore her dresses tight  
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight  
  
La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la

La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la

I found a black beret on the street today  
It was lying in the gutter all torn  
There's a white flag flying on a tall building  
But the kids just watch the storm  
  
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows  
Shattered glass before their eyes  
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway  
Where the sniper sleeps at night  
  
No birthday songs to sing again  
Just bricks and stones to give them  
Wrap them up in your father's flags  
And let them cry to heaven  
  
There are many graves by a cold lake  
As the beds were when your babies are born  
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin  
But the kids just watch the storm  
  
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse  
Until he killed it with his claws  
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing  
Before they go to war

I used to know this old scarecrow  
He was my song  
My joy and sorrow,  
Cast alone between the furrows  
Of a field no longer sown by anyone.  
I held a dandelion  
That said the time had come  
To leave upon the wind  
Not to return  
When summer burned the earth again.  
  
Cultivate the freshest flower  
This garden ever grew,  
Beneath these branches  
I once wrote such childish words for you.  
But that's okay,  
There's treasure children always seek to find,  
And just like us  
You must have had  
A once a upon a time.

Though my heart won't believe that you have left me  
I keep telling myself that it's true  
I can get over anything  
You are my love  
But I can't get myself over you  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory  
To tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me, my love  
  
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl  
  
Though I tried to forget you somehow  
You're the mirror of my soul  
So take me out of my world  
Let me try to go on living  
Right now  
  
Don't forget to remember me  
And the love that used to be  
I still remember you  
I love you  
In my heart lies a memory  
To tell the stars above  
Don't forget to remember me, my love

I can't light no more of your darkness  
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
  
Too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when I met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
  
Don't let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see  
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
I can't find, oh the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way I feel  
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm  
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal

If you wake up and don't want to smile  
If it takes just a little while  
Open your eyes and look at the day  
You'll see things in a different way  
  
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here  
It'll be here, better than before  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone  
  
Why not think about the times to come  
And not about the things that you've done  
If your life was bad to you  
Just think what tomorrow will do  
  
All I want is to see you smile  
If it takes just a little while  
I know you don't believe that it's true  
I never meant any harm to you  
  
Don't you look back  
Don't you look back

Steamboat waiting by the waterside  
Sunlight shining on the morning tide  
Got my ticket in my hand  
Got some celebrating planned  
  
Can't remember when I felt so fine  
I've been waiting such a long long time  
Just to hear those engines hum  
Look out dreamboat here I come  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
All aboard, make it fast  
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last  
  
If you love me like you did before  
Be there waiting on the distant shore  
When my steamboat comes inside  
Then I know we'll be alright  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride  
Stem on steamboat to the other side  
Turn the crank, change the gear  
Raise the flag and let's get out of here  
  
Feels so good to know that soon I'll see  
You've been saving all your love for me  
For honey if there's any doubt  
Just be sure I don't find out  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Cast the line, check the fuse  
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise  
  
Tell the captain not to take too long  
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong  
Fires are burning down below  
Come on steamboat don't be slow  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Wind the springs, set the course  
Pull some strings before I turn to force  
  
Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Ring the bell, sound the horn  
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
All aboard and make it fast  
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last  
  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride  
Stem on steamboat to the other side  
Turn the crank, change the gear  
Raise the flag and let's get out of here  
  
Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Cast the line, check the fuse  
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise  
  
You're me dreamboat, yes you are  
And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride  
Steam on steamboat to the other side  
Ring the bell, sound the horn  
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born  
  
You're my dreamboat, yes you are

Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green  
A face that smiled at every passing scene  
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time  
When each emotion pinball in your mind  
  
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile  
I was the judge and jury at your trial  
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn  
Now I have the time to stand and learn  
  
But you and I have come so far  
With a shaken faith  
From the pain of a broken heart  
Toward feeling great  
Feel like life has just begun  
No more singing duets for one  
  
I hold your picture here beside the bed  
You had a party raging in your head  
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt  
And here today all I can do is learn  
  
Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile  
I was the judge and jury at your trial  
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn  
Now I have the time to stand and learn  
  
I have this picture of me looking at you  
Looking at me  
And I would like to say  
Goodbye, sweet memory

Every time you turn around  
You wear another face  
Every time i look away  
I find a hiding place  
  
If you knew me like you knew him  
You would know just how i feel  
Slipping through someone's fingers  
Falling under someone's wheels  
  
It's easier to walk away  
Better off to face the facts  
When love holds you up for ransom  
Walk away and don't look back  
  
Never seen you looking back through  
Smiling eyes and tears  
Never knew you holding on to  
Memories and fears  
  
Just release me i can't take it  
Can't you see a change has come  
Strangled by infatuation  
Buried under someone's thumb  
  
It's easier to walk away  
Cover and fade to black  
When love scars and leaves you branded  
Walk away and don't look back  
  
Every time you turn around  
You wear another face  
Every time i look away  
I find a hiding place

This is the moment  
When the Gods expect me  
To beg for help  
But I won't even try  
  
I want nothing in the world  
But myself to protect me  
But I won't lie down  
Roll over and die  
  
All I have to do is  
To forget how much I love him  
All I have to do is  
Put my longing to one side  
  
Tell myself that  
Love's an ever changing situation  
Passion would have cooled  
And all the magic would have died  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last saw him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Tender in his manner  
And my self-consolation  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, easy as life  
  
All I have to do is  
To pretend I never knew him  
On those very rare occasions  
When he steals into my heart  
  
Better to have lost him  
When the ties were barely binding  
Better the contempt  
Of the familiar cannot start  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
  
Until I think about him  
As he was when I last touched him  
And how he would have been  
Were I to be with him today  
  
Those very rare occasions don't let up  
They keep on coming  
All I ever wanted  
And I'm throwing it away  
  
It's easy, it's easy as life  
  
And then I see the faces  
Of a worn defeated people  
A father and a nation  
Who won't let a coward run  
  
Is this how the Gods reward  
The faithful through the ages?  
Forcing us to prove that  
All the hardest things we've done  
  
Are easy, so easy  
  
And though I'll think about him  
Until the earth draws in around me  
And though I choose to leave him  
For another kind of love  
  
This is no denial, no betrayal  
But redemption  
Redeemed in my own eyes  
And in the pantheon above  
  
It's easy, it's easy  
It's easy as life

Take a look at me now  
And take a taste of the money  
I'm not in it for the bread  
I'm in it for the gravy honey  
  
Step on the thin ice lightly  
And check out the show twice nightly  
Oh cause I'm, I'm on the stage tonight  
And if the price is right  
  
I'll, I will amaze before the light  
I crave the light mmm blinding white  
I need the light tonight  
  
Take a look at me now  
And take a look at my billing  
I'm not in it as an extra  
I'm in it for the killing  
  
Inflate my ego gently  
Tell them heaven sent me  
Oh 'cause I'm, I'm so expressive  
And I'm so obsessed  
  
With my ego, my ego  
And it's message oo inform the press  
Invite the guests I need the press tonight  
  
Do you remember acting out your youth  
A romeo resplendent on an orange case  
Do you remember how I would recite  
And how I'd blow my lines  
  
And hide my face  
Well maybe it was childish, foolish  
Before schoolish, immaturish, lose your coolish  
Well I had to grow and prove my ego  
  
Take a look at me now  
And take a taste of the money  
I'm not in it for the bread  
I'm in it for the gravy honey  
  
Inflate my ego gently  
Go tell them heaven sent me  
Oh cause I'm, I'm so expressive  
And I'm so obsessed  
  
With my ego, my ego  
And it's message oo inform the press  
invite the guests I need the press tonight  
  
Do you remember how I would recite  
And how I'd blow my lines  
And hide my face  
Well maybe it was childish, foolish  
Before schoolish, immaturish, lose your coolish  
Well I had to grow and prove my ego

You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate  
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late  
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives  
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge  
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing  
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing  
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs  
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air  
  
[Chorus]  
And yeah I've seen your movie  
And I read it in your book  
The truth just flew off every page  
Your songs have all the hooks  
You're seven wonders rolled in one  
You shifted gear to cruise  
Oh you came to town in headlines  
And eight hundred dollar shoes  
  
Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands  
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land  
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast  
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you came to town in headlines  
And eight hundred dollar shoes

A few more days, we'll be home in glory  
Already they'll be getting out the flags  
With Memphis high in mode adulatory  
Still I only see a lot of snags  
  
For just because I triumphed as a slaver  
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton  
Of this and every month, now I'm the flavor, ooh, yeah  
And scheduled to do things I've never done  
  
And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget?  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you  
  
My days out on the field are all but ended  
They'll put me out to grass which means the throne  
Bedecked with jewels alongside my intended  
I feel as if my heart is set in stone  
  
For just because I triumphed as a slaver  
Brought booty back to Egypt by the ton, oh, yeah  
Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor  
And scheduled to do things I've never done, hey, hey  
  
And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget?  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence is safe enough in you  
  
Why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met  
Someone who in hours from now I'll certainly forget?  
  
So anonymous and undemanding, yeas, you are  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence is safe enough with you  
  
And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met  
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget?  
  
Anonymous and undemanding  
Enchantment passing through  
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you  
Are safe enough with you

I read about how you're slow with the truth  
Like any old Aesop's Fable  
But when you're turtle-esque, I'm a hare's breath  
Into payment under the table  
But some journalist got his mug shot kit  
And his briefcase on his lap  
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.  
And all that political crap  
  
Cause I've seen your fascist faces  
On the cover of the national papers  
Staring out in black and white  
From the tall gray walls on the other side  
When I see your fascist faces  
Then I know I've had enough  
Trying to trace it or erase it  
Is it foolproof or a bluff?  
  
If the boy had been blessed, he'd have been arrested  
On a charge of wearing red shoes  
But if your pants are blue, you got nothing to lose  
It'll make you a patriot through and through

Please don't talk about the Flinstone boy  
He's alright with me

He got trouble but he ain't got joy

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah  
  
Well, Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover  
When someone told a lie  
Jo, Jo, his lover, he'd been cheating on him  
Shouldn't he know why

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah  
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Me and you we're not that pretty  
Me and you could use a lift  
I'm out here on the corner crying  
I got ribbons but I got no gift  
  
Me and you we're all we've got  
Me and you could be our curse  
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers  
You got strings but you got no purse  
  
We're just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
We're on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
There's a wonder in this weakness  
It's so beautiful sometimes  
Across the universe we're lightning  
In the race we're a step behind  
  
Me and you we're not for everyone  
Me and you we're damaged goods  
We're antique and unacceptable  
And just misunderstood  
  
We're just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
We're on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
We're just freaks in love  
Saints above  
Shine on our sweet life  
Happy is the union  
Of fools and freaks alike  
  
And fearless are the idiots  
Among the hawks and doves  
We're on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love  
  
We're on the outside looking in  
A couple of freaks in love

I hope the day will be a lighter highway  
For friends are found on every road  
Can you ever think of any better way  
For the lost and weary travelers to go?  
  
Making friends for the world to see  
Let the people know you got what you need  
With a friend at hand you will see the light  
If your friends are there, then everything's all right  
  
It seems to me a crime that we should age  
These fragile times should never slip us by  
A time you never can or shall erase  
As friends together watch their childhood fly

There isn't much I haven't shared  
With you along the road  
And through it all there'd always be  
Tomorrow's episode  
  
Suddenly that isn't true  
There's another avenue  
Beckoning the great divide  
Ask no questions, take no side  
  
Who's to say who's right or wrong  
Whose course is braver run  
Still we are, have always been  
Will ever be as one  
  
What is done has been done for the best  
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest  
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose  
But if I started over I know I would choose  
  
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way  
That fought me and tought me that friends never say  
  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
  
Suddenly that isn't true  
There's another avenue  
Beckoning, the great divide  
I would choose  
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way  
That fought me and taught me that friends never say  
  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye  
Never say goodbye

Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner  
But he knew it couldn't last  
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona  
For some California grass  
  
Get back, get back  
Get back to where you once belonged  
Get back, get back  
Get back to where you once belonged  
  
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman  
But she was another man  
All the girls around her said she's got it coming  
But she gets it while she can  
  
So get back, get back

It's so hard to say goodbye  
When there's nothing left to give  
When this house is just a hill of bones  
Where you and I once lived  
If we put it back together  
By the skin of our teeth  
You'd still pull it all apart  
Bit by bit, piece by piece  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
There's no passion alive  
When you count your phony schemes  
And the cars you drive to buy your friends  
They don't ever come back clean  
If the cards on the table  
Always turn up spades  
The cards that always cheat the hearts  
The spades you play just dug my grave  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
I'm gonna build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
Oh, I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
I'll build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
...  

On and on  
On and on  
  
She broke my heart, he hurt me too  
That's something that only unworthy souls do  
  
They said goodbye, we say hello  
An introduction for a perfect love to grow  
  
Let's stop thinking about the past  
And start thinking about the future  
So that love can go on and on  
Let's stop thinking about the past  
And start thinking about the future  
So that love can go on and on  
  
She said she'd stay, he said that too  
So sad when you find out your love has found a new  
  
She made me cry, he made me weep  
But life has love in store for us that's ooh so sweet  
  
On and on (love keeps going on)  
On and on (they've got the whole of life)  
On and on (love keeps going on)  
On and  
  
It's time to say goodbye to crying eyes and broken dreams  
And get back to the joy that to each other we will bring  
That starts from summer love to last through autumn, winter, spring  
Our hearts will sing forever, love

Say goodbye to loneliness, say goodbye to Marlon Brando  
Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you  
Say goodbye to misery, say goodbye to the morning news  
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view  
Say goodbye to Wendy, say goodbye to Rhonda  
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona  
  
Say goodbye to Glasnost, say goodbye to Malathion  
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion  
Say goodbye to the tabloids, say goodbye to diet soda  
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda  
Say goodbye to gridlock, goodbye to Dolly's chest  
Goodbye to the ozone layer if there's any of it left  
  
Don't it make you want to crawl back to the womb  
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room  
This overload is edging me further out to sea  
I need to put some distance between overkill and me, me  
  
Say goodbye to Jackie Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools  
Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools  
Goodbye to statuettes, say goodbye to lists  
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed  
Say goodbye to hair styles, goodbye to heaven's gate  
Goodbye to Rocky Five, Six, Seven and Eight

Why's it never light on my lawn  
Why does it rain  
And never say good-day to the new-born  
On the big screen they showed us the sun  
But not as bright in life as the real one  
It's never quite the same as the real one  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see what's real  
Tell me grey seal  
  
I never learned why meteors were formed  
I only farmed in schools  
That were so warn and torn  
If anyone can cry then so can I  
I read books and draw life from the eye  
All my life is drawings from the eye  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see what's real  
Tell me grey seal  
  
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men  
The roots were formed by twisted roots  
Your roots were twisted then  
I was re-born before all life could die  
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly  
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see what's real  
Tell me grey seal

Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master  
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter  
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim  
But the light in his eyes will see no more bright  
As the sheep that he locked in the pen  
  
There's four feet of ground in front of the barn  
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm  
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare  
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there  
  
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember  
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger  
For sentiment touched him as Cyclamen holds him  
And later men came from the town  
Who said clear the child this won't take a while  
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn

You win again, you gypsy heart  
I count the days that we're apart  
I sleep alone when you're away  
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay  
It's all the same, you never change  
You come and go just like the rain  
I pray each day that you are gone  
This time it won't be so long  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy, when we meet again  
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh, you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your back's against the wall  
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh, you gypsy heart  
I pray each day that you are gone  
This time, oh, it won't be so long  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy, when we meet again  
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh, you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your back's against the wall  
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh, you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart will never find  
Any arms as warm as mine  
And gypsy, when we meet again  
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms  
Oh, you gypsy heart  
Your gypsy heart can always call  
When your back's against the wall  
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start  
You never left me on my own  
Oh, you gypsy heart  

Hello, baby hello  
Haven't seen your face for a while  
Have you quit doing time for me  
Or are you still the same spoiled child  
  
Hello, I said hello  
Is this the only place you thought to go  
Am I the only man you ever had  
Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know  
  
[Chorus]  
Harmony and me  
We're pretty good company  
Looking for an island  
In our boat upon the sea  
Harmony, gee I really love you  
And I want to love you forever  
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony  
  
Hello, baby hello  
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow  
You're not unlucky knowing me  
Keeping the speed real slow  
In any case I set my own pace  
By stealing the show, say hello, hello  
  
[Chorus]

Have you heard the dogs at night  
Somewhere on the hill  
Chasing some poor criminal  
And I guess they're out to kill  
  
Oh there must be shackles on his feet  
And mother in his eyes  
Stumbling through the devil-dark  
With the hound pack in full cry  
  
Have mercy on the criminal  
Who is running from the law  
Are you blind to the winds of change  
Don't you hear him any more  
  
Praying Lord you got to help me  
I am never gonna sin again  
Just take these chains from around my legs  
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend  
  
Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam  
While you lie on a cold damp ground  
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt  
While the wardens hold you down  
  
And you've never seen a friend in years  
Oh it turns your heart to stone  
You jump the walls and the dogs run free  
And the grave's gonna be your home

I never dreamed I could cry so hard  
That ain't like a man  
I could fly like a bird somedays  
Had a place where I could land  
  
I could have sworn we were all locked in  
Ain't that what you said  
I never knew it could hurt so bad  
When the power of love is dead  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Ain't no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
Chorus  
  
And reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
There's a light, where the darkness ends,  
Touch me now and let me see again,  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
I never knew love like poison  
That burned like a fire  
All I ever wanted was a reason  
To drown in your eyes  
  
I never knew sleep so restless  
Empty arms so cold  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
It ain't the spell that I was sold  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Ain't no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
And reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
There's a light, where the darkness ends,  
Touch me now and let me see again,  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
But giving into the nightime  
Ain't no cure for the pain  
You gotta wade into the water  
You gotta learn to live again  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
There's a light, where the darkness ends,  
Touch me now and let me see again,  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
There's a light, where the darkness ends,  
Touch me now and let me see again,  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands  
  
Reach out for her healing hands  
Reach out for her healing hands  
There's a light, where the darkness ends,  
Touch me now and let me see again,  
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting  
Like an out of tune guitar  
Ooh she got Hercules on her side  
And Diana in her eyes  
  
Some men like the Chinese life  
Some men kneel and pray  
Ooh well I like women and I like wine  
And I've always liked it that way  
Always liked it that way  
  
I can't dig it, the way she tease  
That old tough man routine up her sleeve  
Living and loving, kissing and hugging  
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules  
A cat named Hercules  
  
Oh and it hurts like hell to see my gal  
Messing with a muscle boy  
No superman gonna ruin my plans  
Playing with my toys  
  
Rich man sweating in a sauna bath  
Poor boy scrubbing in a tub  
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears  
Washing in a bucket of mud  
Washing in a bucket of mud

Like I said baby  
If you go astray  
Well then go on  
Go your own sweet way  
I thought you knew by now  
You do just what you please  
And here's to the next time  
Here's to the next time  
  
How many times  
Have you gone before  
And how many times  
Have I forgiven you once more  
Never had to wait  
Like I waited for you  
And here's to the next time  
Here's to the next time  
  
When you're gone  
The time drags by  
I wish you'd learn  
Not to make me cry  
To make me cry  
  
So if you're gonna leave me  
Never to come back  
Break it to me gently  
Or my world will crack  
So be sure to let me know  
That I'll never say  
Here's to the next time  
Here's to the next time  
Here's to the next time

It's a constant struggle getting up that hill  
There's a change of guard every day  
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat  
You pray a great white whale might come your way  
  
No freeway traffic in the frozen North  
Just a chain link fence full of birds  
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay  
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
In a crumbling city we were trapped for days  
With a broken sun above the clouds  
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down  
And a sign on the wall says, "Hope Allowed"  
  
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone  
A far cry from a tattooed rose  
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind  
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale

You wore a little cross of gold around your neck  
I saw it as you flew between my reason  
Like a raven in the night time when you left  
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name  
You touched it and you wore it  
And you kept it in your pillow all the same  
  
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms  
I thought myself her keeper  
She thought I meant her harm  
She thought I was the archer  
A weather man of words  
But I could never shoot down  
My high-flying bird  
  
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red  
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man  
In the foreign field of death  
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say  
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight  
Instead you moved away

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Released as a uk b-side in november, 1973  
  
Sitting here on christmas eve with a brandy in my hand  
Oh i've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand  
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace  
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race  
  
And i keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise  
The bearded weirdy's just arrived  
  
  
Ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise  
The bearded wierdy's just arrived  
  
  
On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head  
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red  
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue  
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room

I'm counting on a memory to get me out of here  
I'm waiting for the fog around this spooky little town to clear  
All this time I spent being someone else's friend  
Just one more time, for old time's sake I'd like to go back home again  
The world had seven wonders once upon a time  
  
It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline  
And all around me I've seen times like it was back when  
But like back then, I'd say a men if I could get back home again  
  
If I could go back home, if I could go back home  
If I'd never left, I'd never have known  
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end  
Spending all our time trying to get back home again  
  
Could have been a jailbreak and a spotlight hitting me  
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in nineteen sixty three  
In the old part of Valencia, on the coast of Spain  
Never tiring once of hearing songs about going home again  
  
If I could go back home, if I could go back home  
If I'd never left, I'd never have known  
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end  
Spending all our time trying to get back home again  
  
If I could go back home,  
If I'd never left, I'd never have known  
We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end  
Spending all our time trying to get back home again

This is my house  
This is where I live  
That is the winter  
Those are the trees  
I can hear them breathe  
This is my bed  
This is where I sleep  
That was the dark  
Those are my dreams  
They belong to me  
  
This is my floor  
This is where I lie  
This is a square room  
That was a bright light  
These are not my eyes  
What is my soul  
Where is my tired heart  
That is the question  
Where is the answer  
Inside my house  
  
And I sit by the window  
And I wish I was rain  
I want to fall from the sky  
I want to get wet all over again  
  
'Cause this my house  
It belongs to me  
Inside my head  
It's all that's left  
This is my house  
This is my bed  
This is where I sleep  
That was the dark  
Those are my dreams  
They belong to me  
  
This is my house

I hear that some playboy has kidnapped your heart  
With his plane and his plans for games after dark  
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room  
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume  
  
If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep  
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet  
It could be all right that I act like a child  
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild  
  
You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high  
What will you do when the chips start to fly  
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard?  
Oh, it's four walls of madness in this house of cards  
  
Common you call me, but I know there's time  
In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find  
And your house of cards starts weighing you down  
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to pound

She chose the soft center  
And took it to bed with her mother  
And the ideal confusion  
Was just an illusion  
To gain further news of her brother  
  
And the comfort of mother  
Was just an appeal for protection  
For the cat from next door  
Was found later at four  
In surgical dissection  
  
And I don't want to be  
The son of any freak  
Who for a chocolate center  
Can take you off the street  
  
For soon they'll plough the desert  
And God knows where I'll be  
Collecting submarine numbers  
On the main street of the sea  
  
The Vicar is thicker  
And I just can't see through to him  
For his cardinal sings  
A collection of hymns  
And a collection of coins is made after  
  
And who wrote the Bible  
Was it Judas or Pilate  
Well one cleans his hands  
While the other one hangs  
But still I continue to stand

I've been beaming aboard her for a light year  
From a strange craft  
She's got a subtle touch on the silver key  
To a clockwork heart  
  
I am your robot, I am your robot  
I am your robot, man  
I am your robot, I am your robot  
I am your robot, man  
  
You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive  
When I was negative  
I've been stumbling around like a metal man  
On the graveyard shift  
  
I am your robot, and I'm programmed to love you  
My serial number is 44357

I can't keep this from you  
I've held it in so long  
It's time to tell the truth  
Keeping it from you is wrong  
  
I can't keep this from you  
It's so simple I'm afraid  
When I tell you how I feel  
You'll just laugh and call me crazy  
  
And I can't keep  
This love a secret  
And I don't want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I can't keep this from you  
  
I can't keep this from you  
It's hard to breathe in here  
I just seem to act the fool  
Every time I feel you near  
  
I can't keep this from you  
No matter what you say  
Anything is better now  
Than going through my life this way  
  
And I can't keep  
This love a secret  
And I don't want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I can't keep this from you  
  
And I love every move you make  
Can't you hear every heart you break?  
And don't you know when I hear your name?  
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames  
  
And I can't keep  
This love a secret  
And I don't want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I can't keep this from you  
  
I can't keep  
This love a secret  
And I don't want  
To go on longing  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I can't keep this from you  
  
I just want a chance for me to prove  
My love and I can't keep this from you  
Oh no  
I just can't keep this from you

Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it  
After all these rough seas  
Left me reckless and abandoned  
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning  
Break down the cold front  
Give me peace and understanding  
  
And you wait, and you wonder  
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder  
Will she still be the star to see me through  
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
No I can't steer my heart clear of you  
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed  
Out of a storm and into view  
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue  
You control the weather  
And I can't steer my heart clear of you  
  
Make me your penance, show me your innocence  
Everything is history  
From the aching to the pleasure  
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us  
Everything gets twisted  
Let me burn or bring me water

And every time I get to thinking  
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud  
Then I think about the love I have inside me  
How you brought what's inside out  
Now love's made it to the outside  
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found  
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me  
You turned my living upside down  
And I can't tell the bottom from the top  
Am I standing on my head or on my heels  
Is it cloudy, is it bright  
Is it day or is it night  
Am I wrong or am I right  
And is it real  
Tell me where you learned the magic  
The spell you used the day you made me fall  
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion  
I'm upside down but ten feet tall  
On and on I've drifted with the tide  
I didn't know that love could move me so  
You fed my life with love and much more besides  
And you showed me which way to go  

This house that I live in has no reason  
This house that I sleep in has no purpose  
It has a bed and a few old chairs  
Three flights up, two flights of stairs  
But it has no reason  
  
Then someone shot through the tire swing  
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring  
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings  
To a dying season  
  
And I cry at night when the lights go out  
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts  
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies  
And when the lights go out it's thought to survive  
  
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble  
This man that I live in bears his faults  
He has a heart and a well worn soul  
Ten years a slave to rock and roll  
But he has to tremble  
  
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn  
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn  
And just like your love that's come and gone  
It goes on breathing

I've always said that one's enough to love  
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough  
Something tells me you're not satisfied  
You got plans to make me one of four or five  
  
I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood  
But you won't catch me carving up my love  
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit  
If it takes more than me let's call it quits  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I don't want to go on with you like that  
Don't want to be a feather in your cap  
I just want to tell you honey I ain't mad  
But I don't want to go on with you like that  
  
It gets so hard sometimes to understand  
This vicious circle's getting out of hand  
Don't need an extra eye to see  
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No I don't want to go on with you like that  
One more set of boots on your welcome mat  
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back  
cause I don't want to go on with you like that  
  
Oh if you want to spread it around sister that's just fine  
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines  
If you want to hold someone in the middle of the night  
Call out the guards, turn out the light

Without you I no longer swim upstream  
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between  
The red letter days and all the pain  
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed  
And I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me  
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see  
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day  
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away  
And I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
I've no care to count the stares that pity me  
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see  
For every rose you give her, I'll give you three  
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me  
Oh, I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
I fall apart, oh, I fall apart  
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
Oh, I fall apart  
Oh, I get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark  
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart  
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart  
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album rock of the westies  
  
Like a corn in a field I cut you down  
I threw the last punch too hard  
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time  
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards  
  
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend  
I figured we'd painted too much of this town  
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon  
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
I knew then I had lost what should have been found  
  
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of robert ford  
I'm low as a paid assassin is  
You know I'm cold as a hired sword  
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up  
You know I can't think straight no more  
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of robert ford  
  
Like a child when his toy's been stepped on  
That's how it all seemed to me  
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in  
And I'm damned if i'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel  
  
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man  
Your friends and mine don't call no more  
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded  
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law  
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law

Don't wish it away  
Don't look at it like it's forever  
Between you and me I could honestly say  
That things can only get better  
  
And while I'm away  
Dust out the demons inside  
And it won't be long before you and me run  
To the place in our hearts where we hide  
  
And I guess that's why they call it the blues  
Time on my hands could be time spent with you  
Laughing like children, living like lovers  
Rolling like thunder under the covers  
And I guess that's why they call it the blues  
  
Just stare into space  
Picture my face in your hands  
Live for each second without hesitation  
And never forget I'm your man  
  
Wait on me girl  
Cry in the night if it helps  
But more than ever I simply love you  
More than I love life itself

Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew  
About you're plans to make me blue  
With some other guy that you knew before  
Between the two of us guys  
You know I love you more  
It took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out yesterday  
  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah  
  
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears I can't hold inside  
Losing you would end my life you see  
'Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you love somebody else  
  
Instead I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah  
  
People say believe half of what you see  
Son, and none of what you hear  
I can't help being confused  
If it's true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
for the other guy you loved before  
  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah

Lyrics by tim rice  
Available on the soundtrack the lion king  
  
Way behind the water hole  
A little down the line  
The jungle and the plains and peaks  
Are scheduled to be mine  
  
Im gonna be the ruler  
Of most everything around  
From the grandest of the mountains  
To the humble common ground  
My reign will be a super awesome thing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
Im gonna be a noble king  
Unscrupulously fair  
I only need a little time  
Perhaps a little hair  
  
Im gonna be the mane event  
Like no king was before  
Im brushing up on looking down  
Im working on my roar  
The fauna and the flora gonna swing  
Oh, I just can't wait to be king  
  
No one saying do this  
No one saying be there  
No one saying stop that  
No one saying see here  
Free to run around all day  
Ill be free to do it my way  
  
The time has come as someone said  
To talk of many things  
This may be true  
But I would rather stick to talking kings  
  
Its easy to be royal if you're already leonine  
It isn't just my right even my left will be divine  
The monarchy is waiting to go zing  
Oh I just can't wait to be king

How have I come to this?  
How did I slip and fall?  
How did I throw half a lifetime away  
Without any thought at all?  
  
This should've been my time  
It's over, it never began  
Facing a world, for once not on my side  
I simply turned and ran  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of twist in my fate  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
I learned it a little too late  
  
I know the truth and it mocks me  
I know the truth and it shocks me  
I learned it a little too late  
  
People have faith in me  
I think I once did too  
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives  
I'll see the bad times through  
  
This should have been my time  
It's over, it never began  
Facing a world, for once not on my side  
I simply turned and ran  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of shift in the stars  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
It's flown just a little too far  
  
I know the truth and it mocks me  
I know the truth and it shocks me  
It's flown just a little too far  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of twist in my fate  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
I learned it a little too late

I wake up and I look at the clock  
In the middle of the night my heart stops  
When I see you in the moonlight  
I know why I'm in love  
  
Peace will come I promise you  
I wish you success in all you do  
And when I think about the rest  
I know why I'm in love  
  
It's hard to find the kind of thing  
You've searched for all your life  
Someone bright and crazy  
With a little soul inside  
And looking at you fast asleep  
I thank the stars above  
  
And what more can I say  
I've said it all in different ways  
The bottom line, the simple facts are true  
I know why I'm in love with you  
I only hope you know I love you too  
  
I kiss you and I melt inside  
What you mean to me I can't describe  
And if seeing is believing  
You'd know why I'm in love

I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score  
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore  
But some are always in my heart  
And some I'm not so sure  
Either way they all left their mark  
And for some I found a cure  
  
[Chorus:]  
From one you learn something  
Another you learn, nothing  
And there's one who might teach you everything  
But before I learned to listen  
And if indeed someone said it  
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
  
Back when I was younger each one was a prize  
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes  
And one was just a trophy catch  
And one was like a curse  
Some would want to bleed you dry  
Some might quench your thirst  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line  
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time  
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind

You're not a ship to carry my life  
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights  
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here  
For I need your love your love protects my fears  
  
And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind  
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind  
And I need you to turn to when I lose control  
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold  
  
Did you paint your smile on, well I said I knew  
That my reason for living was for loving you  
We're related in feeling but you're high above  
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove

Well she swept through the church  
Like a sweet Sunday prayer  
While the choir sang Son of Heaven  
And the groom just walked on air  
  
I was killing time with Jesus  
When the wedding bells began  
And I saw the most beautiful woman  
Getting married to a handsome man  
  
And she walked like a mystery  
And she passed like summer rain  
And she said I do like an angel  
But I never knew her name  
  
Oh the congregation gathered  
But in darkness I remained  
In love with the bride of a handsome man  
But I never knew her name  
  
In the shadow of the holy  
Oh I heard my tell-tale heart  
Whisper words that never reached her  
As her vows were made at last  
  
Oh the preacher with his blessing  
Pronounced them man and wife  
And I saw the most beautiful woman  
Make a promise to be kept for life

She was just seventeen  
And you know what I mean  
And the way she looked was way beyond compare  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw her standing there  
Well she looked at me  
And I could see  
That before too long I fell in love with her  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw here standing there  
Well my heart went boom  
As I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
Oh we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long I feel in love with her  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw here standing there  

Are you standing outside?  
Looking up at the sky  
Cursing a wandering star  
Well if I were you  
I'd throw rocks at the moon  
And I'd say, "Damn you wherever you are"  
  
I don't know where to start  
This cage round my heart  
Locked up what I meant to say  
What I felt all along the way  
Just wondering how come  
I couldn't take your breath away  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I never sent roses  
I never did enough  
I didn't know how to love you  
Though I loved you so much  
And I should have sent roses  
When you crossed my mind  
For no other reason  
Than the fact you were mine  
I should have sent roses  
  
Looking back on my life  
If fate should decide  
I could do it all over again  
I'd build no more walls  
I'd stay true and recall  
The fragrance of you on the wind  
  
You'll get better than me  
Someone who can see  
Right from the start give it all that you need  
And I'll slip away  
Knowing I'm half the man I should be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Should have sent roses

I'm getting bored  
Being part of mankind  
There's not a lot to do no more  
This race is a waste of time  
  
People rushing everywhere  
Swarming around like flies  
Think I'll buy a forty four  
Give them all a surprise  
  
Think I'm gonna kill myself  
Cause a little suicide  
Stick around for a couple of days  
What a scandal if I died  
  
Yeah I'm gonna kill myself  
Get a little headline news  
I'd like to see what the papers say  
On the state of teenage blues  
  
A rift in my family  
I can't use the car  
I gotta be in by ten o'clock  
Who do they think they are  
  
I'd make an exception  
If you want to save my life  
Brigitte Bardot gotta come  
And see me every night

I want love, but it's impossible  
A man like me, so irresponsible  
A man like me is dead in places  
Other men feel liberated  
  
I can't love, shot full of holes  
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold  
Don't feel nothing, just old scars  
Toughening up around my heart  
  
But I want love, just a different kind  
I want love, won't break me down  
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in  
I want a love, that don't mean a thing  
That's the love I want, I want love  
  
I want love on my own terms  
After everything I've ever learned  
Me, I carry too much baggage  
Oh man I've seen so much traffic  
  
But I want love, just a different kind  
I want love, won't break me down  
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in  
I want a love, that don't mean a thing  
That's the love I want, I want love  
  
So bring it on, I've been bruised  
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth  
I'm ready for the rougher stuff  
No sweet romance, I've had enough  
  
A man like me is dead in places  
Other men feel liberated  
  
But I want love, just a different kind  
I want love, won't break me down  
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in  
I want a love, that don't mean a thing  
That's the love I want, I want love  
  
I want love, just a different kind  
I want love, won't break me down  
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in  
I want a love, that don't mean a thing  
That's the love I want, I want love

He was a light star  
Tripping on a high wire  
Bulldog stubborn, born uneven  
A classless creature, a man for all seasons  
But don't bet them  
They can't take him  
To the very bottom  
Because they made him and they'll waste him  
And I don't believe that I want to watch them  
  
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear  
He was an idol then, now he's an idol here  
But his face has changed, he's not the same no more  
And I have to say that I like the way his music sounded before  
  
He was tight-assed  
Walking on broken glass  
Highly prized in the wallet size  
The number one crush in a schoolgirl's eyes  
But don't pretend that it won't end  
In the depth of your despair  
You went from lame suits right down to tennis shoes  
To peanuts from the lion's share

I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasn't quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But somethin' was just out of sight  
  
How could I know that you abused me  
Fill out some plan of your own  
I couldn't know you'd abuse me  
Leave me here hurt and alone  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know that you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
  
I only saw what I wanted to see  
You were a dream in my mind  
I'll never know how you really could be  
It didn't take long for me to find  
  
I guess that it's my fault for seeing  
Only what I wanted to see  
I couldn't know you were being  
A player just acting for me  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
  
I knew from the first night I met you  
Something just wasn't quite right  
Loving like an innocent stranger  
But something was just out of sight  
  
If it wasn't for you I'd be happy  
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true  
I know you could be just like you should  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good  
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I don't know what to say  
I don't know where the light shines  
It's a grey dawn rising on a green hill  
And there's so much behind us  
  
I don't know where we go  
I sure feel there's something out there  
There's a great awakening and a new morning  
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear  
  
If the river can bend  
I'll find you waiting  
Home at last from the wild sea  
All the twists and turns  
We've made together  
All the boats you rocked  
With your harmony  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
  
Come and embrace the struggle  
But win or lose we live here  
Build a new beginning on an old rock  
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album blue moves  
  
  
Torn from their families  
Mothers go hungry  
To feed their children  
But children go hungry  
There's so many big men  
They're out making millions  
When poverty's profits  
Just blame the children  
  
If there's a god in heaven  
What's he waiting for  
If he can't hear the children  
Then he must see the war  
But it seems to me  
That he leads his lambs  
To the slaughter house  
And not the promised land  
  
  
Dying for causes  
They don't understand  
We've been taking their futures  
Right out of their hands  
They need the handouts  
To hold back the tears  
There's so many crying  
But so few that hear  
  
  
If there's a god in heaven  
Well, what's he waiting for  
  
  
If there's a god in heaven  
What's he waiting for  

You could never know what it's like  
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice  
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you  
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use  
  
And did you think this fool could never win  
Well look at me, i'm coming back again  
I got a taste of love in a simple way  
And if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade away  
  
Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did  
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid  
I'm still standing after all this time  
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind  
  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah  
  
Once i never could hope to win  
You starting down the road leaving me again  
The threats you made were meant to cut me down  
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

If you want a lover  
I'll do anything you ask me to  
And if you want another kind of love  
I'll wear a mask for you  
If you want a partner, hold my hand  
If you want to strike me down in anger  
Here I stand  
Baby I'm your man  
  
If you want a boxer  
I will step into the ring for you  
And if you want a doctor  
I'll examine every inch of you  
If you want a driver, climb inside  
Or if you want to take me for a ride  
You know you can  
Baby I'm your man  
  
The moon's too bright  
The chain's too tight  
The beast won't go to sleep  
I've been running through these promises to you  
That I made and I could not keep  
  
But a man never got a woman back  
Not by begging on his knees  
Or I'd crawl to you baby  
I'd fall at your feet  
And I'd howl at your beauty  
Like a dog in heat  
And I'd claw at your heart  
And I'd tear at your sheet  
I'd say please  
I'm your man  
  
And if you gotta sleep a moment on the road  
I will steer for you  
And if yo want to work the street alone  
I'll disappear for you  
If you want a father for your child  
Or only want to walk with me a while  
Across the sand  
Baby I'm your man  
I'm your man  
  
If you want a lover, I'm your man  
If you want a boxer, I'm your man  
If you want a doctor, I'm your man

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet  
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet  
  
I'll be yours to have and to hold  
Darling you've got full control of your puppet  
  
Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet  
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet  
  
Your every wish is my command  
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand  
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet  
  
I'm just a toy, just a funny boy  
That makes you laugh when you're blue  
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told  
I'll do anything for you  
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet  
  
Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet  
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet  
  
Treat me good and I'll do anything  
I'm just a puppet and you hold my string, I'm your puppet  
Yeah, I'm your puppet  
  
Walking, talking, living, loving puppet  
I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now  
  
I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you  
I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to  
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue

Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom  
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon  
Behind a counter she stares out the window  
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon  
  
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror  
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody  
She'd smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up -  
  
[Chorus]  
In neon the dreams in the light of a promise that dies  
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie  
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore  
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door  
  
In neon, in neon...  
  
Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour  
Cut into fashion that flashs above 'em in neon  
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers  
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon  
  
She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror  
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon  
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something  
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up -  
  
In neon...  
  
[Chorus]

As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging  
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee  
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman  
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving  
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead  
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns  
  
Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young  
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums  
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild  
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine  
  
And now you ask that I should watch  
The red man's race be slowly crushed  
What kind of words are these to hear  
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears  
  
I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child  
I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride  
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons  
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run  
  
Trampling down the prairie rose leaving hoof tracks in the sand  
Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands  
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead  
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead  
  
Now there seems no reason why I should carry on  
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home  
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming  
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running  
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones  
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns  
  
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold  
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole

I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah with the sun behind my back  
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack  
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away  
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say  
  
And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be  
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family  
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you  
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes  
  
Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed  
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains  
Oh it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do Lord, Lord  
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes
