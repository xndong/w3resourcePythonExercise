The sacred heart is bleeding  
Go tell the Holy Ghost  
That the junkie is still cheating  
To get the thing he needs the most  
  
Lady Luck has me covered  
Keeping her watchful eyes over me  
The lovers are discovered  
The charge is first degree  
  
Angel, she's a killer  
Just flown in from the coast  
Makes the hit, it's a winner  
Leaves you dead as the post  
  
Sally took to playing poker  
The joker is her favorite card  
The drunk he can't stay sober  
He says it's much too hard  
  
Meantime something seedy  
Was happening across the hall  
Somebody seemed to be groaning  
You could hear it through the wall  
  
The cops they came like lightning  
The bullets flew astray  
The noise it was frightening  
The crook he got away

Oh my God  
There's millions of them  
  
I've seen a fire start in Frisco  
The day that the earth quaked  
I've seen buildings a-blazing  
Throwing up in flames  
  
I heard men, women and children  
Crying out to their God for mercy  
But their God didn't listen  
So they were burned alive  
  
They went down, down, deep underground  
In the great disaster  
  
I was hanging out in Berlin  
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine  
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers  
March right across the Maginot line  
  
I've seen two world wars  
I've seen men send rockets out into space  
I foresee a holocaust  
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race  
  
Down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher  
By the name of Nostradamus  
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century  
An angel of death shall waste this land  
  
A holocaust the likes of which  
This planet had never seen  
Now, I ask you  
Do you believe this to be true  
  
I was standing by the bedside  
The night that my father died  
He was crying out in pain  
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy  
  
His body was riddled with a disease  
Unknown to man so he expected no cure  
But before he died that night  
He was lost, insane  
  
He went down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
You'll go down, down, deep underground  
A great disaster  
  
I think they've got now

I've been mixed up cut up so sit down and shut up  
'cause I'm a hard man  
I was hung up strung out but I can't take no more junk  
Even if you can  
  
It will beat ya cheat ya  
Deceit ya defeat ya  
  
No rocker bopper show stealin' teeny bopper  
Gonna get a thing from me  
No fat black back scratchin' pussy cat  
Gonna get her claws on me  
  
Well they got a scheme to sell you kids  
The silver screens and glossy magazines  
  
Better hold back good times strung out hung up  
Strong out picked on ripped off kicked out  
Spit onset up ripped off locked up sent down  
Maybe you're as hard as I am  
  
Just blow me away

I was your lover  
You were my queen  
You broke my heart  
I gave up everything  
  
I was your friend  
But you were my foe  
I told you that  
I could not let you go  
  
At night I hear the wind calling  
"Oh come back my darling"  
Oh banshee! oh banshee!  
It keeps on calling me, keeps on calling me  
  
We dance the night away  
Oh we dance the night away  
  
I won your heart  
You took my soul  
I love you then  
But you left me cold  
  
I was your lover  
You were my queen  
You broke my heart  
I gave up everything  
  
At night I can hear you calling  
"Oh come back my darling"  
Oh banshee! Oh banshee!  
I hear you calling me, I hear you calling me

One of the black boys said  
"I need none of your pity"  
It's your mama that don't  
Like you loose in the city  
  
But stick about, take note  
Take a tip, take no back lip  
Come come a little closer  
Let me see you snap your fingertip  
  
Because standing on the corner  
Just might suit you or maybe baby  
There's something else you wanna do  
  
Like rolling dice, nice  
Like shooting pool, hey that's cool  
  
I'm a little black boy and I don't know my place  
I'm just a little black boy, I just threw my ace  
I'm a little black boy, recognize my face  
  
One of the black boys said  
"I'm a giving a warning"  
"People been putting me down"  
"I'm so tired I'm yawning"  
  
A new suit, pretty boots to boot  
And I'm feeling slick  
Gonna go to town, look around  
And pull a chick  
  
Of course standing on the corner  
Might suit you or maybe baby  
There's something else that you wanna do  
  
Like playing poker, joker  
Like to back a race, ace  
  
I'm a little black boy and I don't know my proper place  
I'm a little black boy, get my head in its space  
I'm a little black boy, I just play my bass  
I'm a little black boy, it's no disgrace

In France, they've got a dance  
A feel real crazy dance  
A touch of class and a dash of romance  
Feel that crazy dance  
  
Boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
In Spain, they give it a name  
A real chic cheeky name  
One you know it you're not the same  
But you really take a chance  
  
Boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
In Brazil, they got a pill  
A real hard power packed pill  
Take one too many you'll feel quite ill  
But you really take a change  
  
Do the boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
Oh dance, get out and dance

Midnight in the big city  
At the bar drinking all on my own  
Just thinking about that girl and me  
How something's going wrong  
  
Mister, tell me, what's my saving grace?  
The back room boys  
Were all telling me  
I'm a borderline case  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
Seven beers and still sober  
It's time to change to something stronger  
I cannot take this scene no longer  
She could have told me it's all over  
  
Back in my home town  
The old place is still the same  
But time can cast a spell over something  
You can't go back again  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
Mister, fill me another  
Till I go crazy and it turn my mind around  
Just pass that bottle one more time  
And slowly drink it down  
  
Jeanie can I tell you?  
The shame of my disgrace  
It's just love or rejection  
For this borderline case  
  
Back on the borderline one more time  
  
I'm on my bended knees crawling  
I'm begging you darling

Have you ever had your dreams broken?  
It really messes up your heart  
You want to stop right there  
And go right back to the start  
  
You got to leave the town you're living in  
Oh I'm leaving, I'm leaving on the next train  
My dreams have been broken  
I don't think I'll ever be the same  
  
It's a bad, bad feeling when all the things  
That you've worked for just don't seem to turn out right  
Well this happened to me last night  
I woke up this morning and said I must be going  
  
You see my dreams have been broken  
I don't think I have  
The strength to carry on  
So I'll catch the next train southbound  
  
I don't want no pity  
Not from you or anyone  
It's just my dreams been broken  
And I got to tell someone before I go crazy  
  
I'll be leaving  
I'll be leaving  
On that next train going southbound  
Yes, I'll be leaving on that next train  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I just can't  
Take the pain  
I've got to move on  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I don't have  
The strength  
To carry on

I was seldom sober in nineteen hundred and fifthy-four  
Hey baby, maybe 'cause my baby had a baby by me  
And I was still drinking dry gin  
While you cried "no, no more"  
And you were lyin' and a-cryin',  
And your tears fell dying on the floor  
  
And I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
Brought down,  
My heart is hurt again  
  
You were the fine lady in the early mornings  
That always painted her toes  
And lookin' towards the east  
You'd say hello to the early dawn before they rose  
And you were the love lady  
That always hung up her finely pressed clothes  
And sayin' so long to the western sundown,  
You taught me how it grows  
  
And I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
Brought down,  
And you just hurt my heart again  
Brought down  
Brought down  
I'm brought down  
  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Down  
  
I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
I'm brought down,  
I'm hurt, it's bad  
Brought down  
God, it's a shame there's no more Dr. Strangely strange  
Brought down  
And I'm brou-  
Brought down  
-ught down  
Brought down  
And there must be more to life than this

Betty was worried about the lover that she has married  
And she didn't know what to do  
He'd been hit by a hammer on the head and he lay dead  
An' all her worst fears had come true  
  
[Chorus]  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
  
Johnny was a joker and a very heavy smoker  
And he never ever broke the law  
Thin miss lizzy was a-kept very busy  
And sometimes very dizzy, we knew what for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And take 'em all away  
Lock 'em up  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Louie was a loner and a big time Al Capone-er  
Doin' all his dipping from the door  
He knew a shady dealer who had done a dirty DJ,  
The sooner he could even the score  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And lock 'em up  
Help ya have a birthday, say  
Take 'em all away

Living and dying  
In Chinatown  
Yes they're living and dying down in old Chinatown  
In Chinatown  
You better look around  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
  
Laughing and crying you know it's a fact  
They're not laughing they are crying  
'Cause they won't be back  
Oh no you don't come back  
Not from Chinatown  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
  
Chinatown, it's a different scene  
There are people there, they are so obscene  
If you see what I mean  
Then they've sold you the dream  
Down in Chinatown  
What goes up it must come down  
  
Living and dying  
There is no release  
Living and dying  
There is no relief  
There is no beliefs  
Not in Chinatown  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown  
Man, you don't stand a chance if you go down in Chinatown

Pack up your bags  
Leave family society  
Oh come with me  
Where they treat you well  
At the door  
Old Lou the Jew  
Will welcome you  
In the corner lies the hotel  
At this refuge of mercy  
Head of the table  
King of laughter  
Percy  
And if you speak too much  
In company  
You'll soon be heard  
By that Mynah bird and whiskey  
At the top  
You'll find another brother  
Go ask my Mother  
She knows them all very well, hotel  

I put my money in the suitcase  
And headed for the big race  
I felt a chill on my backbone  
As I hung up the telephone  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
To lose means trouble, to win pays double  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold, cold sweat  
  
They say chances on the outside  
Are looking pretty slim  
I've been so lucky on the inside  
I feel I'm going to win  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold, cold sweat  
  
I've got me a whole month's wages  
I haven't seen that much in ages  
I might spend it in stages  
And move out to Las Vegas  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Running down the back of my neck  
To lose means trouble, to win pays double  
And I got me a heavy bet  
  
Cold, cold sweat  
  
I put my money in a suitcase  
They say chances on the outside  
I got a whole months wages  
  
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat  
Stone cold crazy  
Place another bet

I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.  
The starry night, the campfire light.  
The coyote call, and the howlin' winds wail.  
So I ride out to the old sundown  
  
I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.  
Lord I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female.  
The nights we spent together, riding on the range.  
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around.  
Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.  
  
I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.  
Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.  
Down below the border, in a town in Mexico,  
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.  
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.  
  
Roll me over, and I'll turn around  
And I'll move my fingers up and down  
Up and down  
  
It's okay amigo, just let me go  
Riding in the rodeo  
  
Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground  
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo  
Roll me over and set me free, the cowboy's life is the life for me

When I passed you in the doorway  
You took me with a glance  
I should have took that last bus home  
But I asked you for a dance  
  
Now we go steady to the pictures  
I always get chocolate stains on my pants  
My father he's going crazy  
Say's I'm living in a trance  
  
But I'm dancing in the moonlight  
It's caught me in its spotlight  
It's alright, alright  
Dancing in the moonlight  
On the long hot summer night  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning  
And I'm on the streets again  
I disobeyed another warning  
I should have been in by ten  
  
Now I won't get out until Sunday  
I'll have to say I stayed with friends  
But it's a habit worth forming  
If it means to justify the end  
  
  

Dear heart  
I wish you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me  
  
Man with the broken heart filled with lead  
Suffered and he fought for what he believed  
The fighting is over now, the man is dead  
A martyr for the cause  
  
Man with the golden arm, his face gone pale  
Taken too much junk, he's gone over the rail  
Breathes out a sigh and his body wails  
He's gonna land in trouble, land in jail  
  
He'd give his life, give his everything  
To reach that goal and take that last and final fling  
But I guess it's just another story  
In the greatest story ever told  
  
Dear heart  
I wish that you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me

In the later forties  
When Diddy Levine lived with Eunice King  
He gave her the ring that she wore  
Janice the smiling daughter  
Who came from a marriage way before  
But Eunice was the father that she always saw  
Though they never, never, never, never, never, never told her  
She always knew the score  
You see kids were so much wiser after the wars  
But Diddy hadn't had enough, she had to get some more  
On a ration piece of paper  
She wrote 'Eunice, I'm not sure'  
And with her child in her arms  
She went looking for a fling  
Besides, she didn't like the name 'Mrs. King'  
The first time that she heard Damper Dan  
Was on the radio  
Crooning at a volume that was way, way down low  
Diddy was surprised to hear that Damper's name was Dan  
Soon after he was a calling  
And he asked, begged and pleaded for her hand  
Damper's heart was dampened  
When Diddy answered "No, no, no, no, no"  
But if she changed her mind she said "Dan, I'll let you know"  
With her child in her arms  
She went looking for a man  
Besides she didn't like the name Damper Dan  
Janice the smiling daughter grew up to be a teenage queen  
Through all of her mother's lovers  
She kept the name 'Levine'  
Behind the picture house she first made her scene  
Liked a boy called Allister  
Who was dating a friend called Celine  
And Celine wasn't mad when Janet came in between  
But Allister got scared when he heard  
And he joined the U.S.A. Marines  
Inheritance you see runs through every family  
Who is to say what is to be, is any better  
Over and over it goes goodness and badness wind blow  
Over and over, over and over  
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over  
The good wind and the bad wind blow  

Well I thought I could make you cry  
Oh didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
Ah did you, did you true?  
And I told you before  
When you walked out that door  
That I wouldn't love you any more  
I cannot cope any more  
  
Well I thought you'd never lie  
Why didn't I?  
I didn't think that you'd be untrue  
Well did you, did you too?  
And I've told you before  
When you'd walk out that door  
That I would no cope any more  
I do not have you any more  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried now didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
But it wasn't true, I do  
And I told you before  
A million times or more  
That when you'd walk out that door  
I would no love you any more  
I do not love you any more  
  
I lied now didn't I?  
Oh didn't I?  
  
There are people in this town  
That say I don't give a damn  
But the people in this town  
They never could understand  
Oh they never could understand  
  
I thought I could make you cry  
And I tried, now didn't I? Didn't I try, didn't I?  
I didn't think that I would miss you  
But it wasn't true, I do, I do  
And I told you before  
That you'd open up my sores  
And you'd leave me here with scars  
I cannot take it any more  
Oh don't hurt me no more  
  
I cried and I cried, now didn't I?  
Why didn't I try? why didn't I?

Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
That I wrote this song for you  
There might be some other silly pretty girl  
I'm singing it to  
  
Don't believe a word  
For words are only spoken  
Your heart is like a promise  
Made to be broken  
  
Don't believe a word  
Words can tell lies  
And lies are no comfort  
When there's tear in your eyes  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe a word

He stuck that knife right into her gut  
I want to tell you she was lucky with what she got  
But what she got was not enough  
She played around  
  
Don't play around  
I tried to tell her he was not so dumb  
I tried to warn her there was something wrong  
She wouldn't listen, she continued on  
She played around  
  
If you give your love to someone and someone treats you bad  
If you give your love to someone and someone makes you mad  
If you give your love to someone it can be so sad  
  
Don't play around  
Don't play around  
  
He left her dying in the pool of blood  
And she was crying oh my god oh my god  
But she was no good, she was no good  
She played around  
  
Don't play around  
She'd be laughing and dancing the night away  
She'd be laughing and dancing with every man that came away  
But as her life's blood slipped away  
I thought i heard her say  
Don't play around  
Don't play around

Down from the glen came the marching men  
With their shields and their swords  
To fight the fight they believed to be right  
Overthrow the overlords  
  
To the town where there was plenty  
They brought plunder, swords and flame  
When they left the town was empty  
Children would never play again  
  
From their graves I heard the fallen  
Above the battle cry  
By that bridge near the border  
There were many more to die  
  
Then onward over the mountain  
And outward towards the sea  
They had come to claim the emerald  
Without it they could not leave

Brothers here I stand  
Spread my wings and take command  
The sky he justly planned  
The boy become a man  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brothers if you hear  
Raise your flags and make it clear  
There is more to fear  
If we wait for another year  
  
After all this time  
I tell-a tell-a myself that I'm  
Just passing through time  
  
Oh  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brothers fight or fall  
It's man for man and one for all  
No more can we crawl  
Brothers, brothers hear the call  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that I'm  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
Brother fight or fall  
It's man for man and one for all  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
What you want?  
We gotta fight for one another!

I'm tough, rough, ready and able  
To pick myself up from under this table  
Don't stick no sign on me, I got no label  
I'm a little sick, unsure, unsound and unstable  
  
But I'm fighting my way back  
  
I'm busting out and I'm going in  
I'm kicking up about the state I'm in  
Looking to my future, not my past  
I want to be a good boy but how long can it last  
  
Fighting my way back  
  
This kid is going to wreck and ruin  
I'm not quite sure of what I'm doing  
You see it happened all a little too soon  
But it's all there in this here tune  
  
Fighting my way back

Let me tell you the hard luck story  
About a man named jack mcduff  
He believed in God and glory  
But he just wasn't tough enough  
  
I believe in the freedom song  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
I'll choose my own destiny  
  
Well they took him and they beat him  
Underneath the old hanging tree  
Saying, jack, you must die  
What will your last words be?  
  
Jack, he hung his head back  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
Doesn't matter what you do to me  
  
With a rope around his neck they left him hanging  
High on that old hanging tree  
On her knees his wife was screaming  
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy  
  
I believe in the freedom song  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
Doesn't matter what you do to me

Pack up, I've had enough, that's it, I quit  
Give up, you win, I lose, you win  
You choose, you stay  
I'll go, you stay, I lose  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realize that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Get out  
Do I make myself clear  
  
No way, I must go, can't stay, must run  
No chance, I can't give a second chance  
No hope, there's no hope for you now  
No romance, no more romance  
  
No how, no how could we stay together  
No need, I have no need for you now  
No fear, no fear of you no more  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Do I make myself clear  
  
Pack up, give in, go home, get out  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realized that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
And I've become bitter  
For I believe that this is better  
No matter, whatever, whenever  
We can never ever stay together  
  
Get out of here  
Go  
  
Do I make myself plain  
I don't want to ever see you again  
Get out of here  
  
Pack up, give in, get out of here  
Rev up, go away, get out of here  
Give in, go home, right away, get to  
Pack up, give in, give up, rev up  
Go away, out

[Chorus]  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna creep up on you  
I'm gonna gonna  
  
The writing on the wall showed the scandal  
Pointed out the victim of the vandal  
The lady was upset by the angle  
Scratch your back and hot to handle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're sly, you're slick, you're sleek, you're outstanding  
My legs are week, my heart, it beats, it's pounding  
Soon you're gonna weep in your sleepless surrounding  
'Cause I'm the one taking you down for grounding  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Little lady let me take a little bit of your love

[Chorus]  
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up  
That stuff  
I've got to give it up I've got to give it up  
That stuff  
  
Tell my mama and tell my pa  
That their fine young son didn't get far  
He made it to the end of a bottle  
Sitting in a sleazy bar  
  
He tried hard but his spirit broke  
He tried until he nearly choked  
In the end he lost his  
Bottle drinking alcohol  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell my brother I tried to write and  
Put pen to paper but I was frightened  
I couldn't seem to get the words out right  
Right quite right  
  
Tell my sister I'm sinking slow  
Now and again I powder my nose  
In the end I lost my bottle  
It smashed in a casaba  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I've been messing with the heavy stuff  
For a time I couldn't get enough  
But I'm waking up and its wearing off  
Junk don't take you far  
  
Tell my mama I'm coming home  
In my youth I'm getting older  
And I think its lost control  
Mama I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]

Halfcaste (from Man and His music Volume II)  
  
I got a girl in Brixham town  
Her daddy don't like me hangin' 'round  
The boy ain't black, the boy is brown  
Don't he know it's a halfcaste town  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
The boy is halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
I got a girl up near Richmond way  
Her daddy don't like me to lead the girl astray  
The brown boy is born to serve he say  
Don't he know it's a different day  
In the big smoke  
No joke  
Big smoke  
I like it  
Big smoke  
Big smoke  
Mister, I'm halfcaste  
You see, I'm halfcaste  
I got no class  
You see, I'm halfcaste  
Halfcaste  
  
  
  
  

Me and my buddies, we're going to get drunk  
We're going to go out on the town  
We'll be checking it out, slipping it in  
And stepping out of line  
You know everybody likes to get a little crazy  
In their own particular way  
But my buddies and I, we go over the top  
And we're going over again today  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
You know it's a rock and roll pastime  
  
It might be typical, topical or maybe tropical  
That doesn't mean anything  
If you're political, practical  
Then it's improbable that you do anything  
But me and my buddies, we like to go crazy  
We like to go over the hill  
Hey, woman, will you be there? Because my buddies and I will  
  
Having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
We'll be having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
"Hey, snowy, play a bit for me  
That was snowy white  
And he likes err it in the night  
The next to play  
I must say, is Scott Gorham  
And away"  
  
We'll be having a good time  
Passing the by-line  
Having a good time  
It's a rock and roll pastime  
  
Let's play that one more time  
Hit me with that drum, Brian  
Hit me as hard as you can  
Oh yes, that's they way I like it  
Do it again, do it again, let's do it again  
  
Having a good time  
Oh yes, I like this  
Having a good time  
Typical, topical, who cares?  
Having a good time  
Political, practical, impossible  
Having a good time  
  
Don't ask me why, Jack  
Having a good time  
Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!  
Having a good time  
Having a wild time  
Having a good time  
I'm slipping on the inside  
Having a good time  
That's fine, having a good time  
Having a good time  
Drinking Beaujolais  
No, that doesn't rhyme  
Having a good time  
I'm talking from the top of my head  
Having a good time  
To the bottom of your soul

Mama, I'm dying of a heart attack, heart attack, heart attack  
I love that girl, but she don't love me back  
My girl, she tells me that we're breaking up, breaking up, breaking up  
My heart can't handle the strain that's shaking it  
  
She tried to tell me not so long ago  
I would not listen but now I know  
  
Papa, I'm drinking for an overload, overload, overload  
The gun in my pocket is all ready to explode  
Papa, I'm dying of an overdose, overdose, overdose  
I tried to warn you, don't come too close  
  
I tried to tell you way back when we were young  
I tried to warn you there was something wrong  
Mama, I'm dying  
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying  
  
Heart attack

So we packed our bags and headed for the north sea  
There was eric, brian, freaky pete, charlie, frankie lee and me  
I was feeling homesick but I was in good company  
We went sailing  
We came ashore long before the fighting broke  
Saw the sign and headed for the big smoke  
We met an old woman of the roads, she said "this life is but a joke"  
But we kept on trucking  
I'm always thinking, I'm thinking  
I'm thinking how much I think about it all  
While you're just dreaming, just dreaming, just dreaming  
Had you dreamt it all  
But I'm the one who's fallen  
The one you hear  
Here calling across your floor  
Here I go again feeling low down  
I'll never know, but then I came from the wrong side of town  
We were like the lonesome outlaws  
We would go which way the wind did blow  
Down the open trail that nobody knows  
Sometimes it gets lonesome  
But there you go feeling low down  

You're living in a small town  
The people there are cold  
Just living in a small town  
Just doing as you're told  
You move up to the jungle  
You find that it's a hell  
When you slip, you fall, you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, all your friends told you in your small town  
Hey you, you've got it made  
  
Just living in your home town  
Sometimes it's kinda cruel  
Living in your home town  
Where they treat you like a fool  
You move up to the city  
You find that it's tough  
And it doesn't seem very pretty  
Now you're sleeping in the rough  
  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you, you've got it made  
Hey you  
You've got it made  
Hey you  
You're heading for the big time  
Hey you, you've got it made  
You're headed for a life of crime  
  
Living in this jungle  
It's like living in a hell  
When you slip, you fall, you stumble  
They lock you in a cell  
You move out to the country  
For something you have done  
You're living in the country  
Why don't you go back to where you come from?  
  
Hey you, you've got it made [Repeat: x5]  
  
Forget all these backslappers  
You don't stand a chance  
Why don't you go home?  
Go right back to where you come from  
Don't get involved in this masquerade  
This big city is going to eat you up  
All the backslapping  
Hey you, you've got it made

They say people out in Hollywood  
Live their life out in black and white  
They're livin' out a Technicolor dream  
Next day, they're a star overnight  
  
Not like in New York  
Man, it's tougher  
Not like in London town  
Boy, you suffer  
  
Nobody give a break  
When you're down on your luck  
Everybody's on the take  
When you're down on your luck  
You can't make a mistake  
When you're down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They got a lot of class  
You see the boys struttin' down the boulevard  
Tryin' to make a pass'  
  
Not like in New York  
It's high rise, it's concrete and complex  
Not like in ol' London town  
It reigns down on its subjects  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When you're down on your luck  
Lady Chance, she won't dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
People out in Hollywood  
They can make it to the stars  
They can reach the screen  
Drive around in big expensive convertible cars  
  
Not like in New York  
All you've got is Broadway  
Not like in the West end of London  
You can't make it no way  
  
Nobody give a damn  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands  
When you're down on your luck  
Lady Chance, she won't dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
You've got to strut your stuff  
When you're down on your luck  
You can't take it easy, it ain't good enough  
When you're down on your luck  
Everybody's on the make  
When you're down on your luck  
  
Nobody give a fair deal  
When you're down on your luck  
Nobody understands my Uncle Sam  
When you're down on your luck  
I'm ready for the dance  
When you're down on your luck  
  
I gotta make a dollar holler  
When you're down on your luck  
When you're down on your luck

Up till now I used to pass my time  
Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine  
No God, air, water or sunshine  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
Up till now my youthful stage  
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge  
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
I never, I never, I never  
Up till now my love life  
Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife  
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
"I need your, I need your romance"  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and I'd abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair, all was right  
And now I know, I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse  

The man finds himself alone for the first time in his life  
He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right  
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night  
He's got to work it all alone  
  
Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve  
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go  
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?  
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain  
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain  
Now who in the world would have know  
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown  
  
Through the rain, the sleet and snow  
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul  
So the let the cold winds blow  
What he doesn't see he doesn't know  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
He said, watch out for the danger  
He said, watch out  
  
The man is a winner for the first time in his life  
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter  
But if you look closely  
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind  
  
And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done  
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul  
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips  
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
But now we're all grown up and we're strangers  
You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped  
Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers

You don't believe in love  
You don't believe in hatred  
Put your money in the bank  
It's the only way to save it  
  
You try to make a buck  
But you haven't made a penny  
You need a little luck  
But you know you won't get any  
  
You don't believe in God  
You don't believe in glory  
You've got a brother in the clinic  
Tells the same kind of story  
  
If he had another life  
He'd know what would be waiting  
If he had another soul  
He could sell it all to Satan  
  
You don't believe in war  
You don't believe in Jesus  
Got a sister in New York  
She knows how she pleases  
  
Walking the streets  
On the south side of the city  
Trying to make ends meet  
Isn't that a pity, for money

Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in this town  
See me and the boys we don't like it  
So were getting up and going down  
  
Hiding low looking right to left  
If you see us coming I think it's best  
To move away do you hear what I say  
From under my breath  
  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
So don't you be around  
  
Don't you be around  
  
Tonight there's gonna be trouble  
Some of us won't survive  
See the boys and me mean business  
Bustin' out dead or alive  
  
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail  
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail  
Like the game if you lose  
Go to jail  
  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
So don't you be around  
  
Tonight there's gonna trouble  
I'm gonna find myself in  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
So woman stay with a friend  
  
You know it's safer  
  
Breakout!  
  
Tonight there's gonna be a breakout  
Into the city zones  
Don't you dare to try and stop us  
No one could for long  
  
Searchlight on my trail  
Tonight's the night all systems fail  
Hey you good lookin' female  
Come here!  
  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
Somewhere in the town  
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak  
So don't you be around  
  
Tonight there's gonna be trouble  
I'm gonna find myself in  
Tonight there's gonna be trouble  
So woman stay with a friend

Johnny the Fox he called to Jimmy the Weed  
He said "Hey man, I know your name"  
I seen you cruising with the low riders  
Hanging out down on First street and Main  
  
Tuned into and listen to the voodoo Rhythm Devils  
Around the Bay  
They've got some crazy DJs  
Send you right out to heaven  
  
Jimmy the Weed for greed was taken aback  
Johnny the Fox you old sly cat  
Cleverly the Fox concealed his stash  
Crisp dollar bills leave no tracks  
  
In the back of a black cadillac  
The voodoo music travels  
Down Skid Row only black men can go  
The shady deal unravels  
  
Johnny the Fox, hot to hustle  
Jimmy the Weed won't use no muscle  
that cat's so sly, slick and subtle  
Johnny the Fox breaks out the bottle  
  
Tuned into and listening to  
The voodoo music travels  
The beating drum for the lonely one  
Sends you out to heaven

Some people they call me Jack  
Some people they call me insane  
I'm looking for somebody  
And I don't even know her name  
I might be looking for you  
Wherever you may be  
For there is something I've got to do to you honey  
And it's between you and me  
Now you might think it's fun  
Or maybe it's a joke  
But you've got plenty of reason to worry honey  
'Cause you wouldn't stand a hope  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A lady killer on the loose  
  
Now I'm not trying to be nasty  
Or I'm not trying to make you scared  
But there's a killer on the loose  
Or haven't you heard  
He'll be walking around this town  
Just about midnight  
Yes, that's Chinatown  
That's right  
That's right  
  
Now you might think I'm messing  
Or he don't exist  
But honey I'm confessing  
I'm a mad sexual rapist  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A ladykiller on the loose  
  
"I'll be standing in the shadows of love  
Waiting for you  
Don't unzip your zipper  
'Cause you know I'm Jack the Ripper  
Now don't wail, don't"  
  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadows  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Coming to get you  
A lady killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadows of love  
  
A killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A lady killer on the loose  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Standing in the shadow  
A killer on the loose, of love  
There's a killer on the loose again  
Oh  
A lady killer on the loose  
You better watch out  
There's a killer on the loose again  
A killer on the loose  
Play that back  
Check it back  
There's a killer on the loose

He made a big impression  
When he walked across the room  
And I must make my confession  
I might have spoke too soon  
  
He's a killer  
Without a cause  
The time is right  
To settle scores  
  
On the streets he lives again  
Down the alley and round the bend  
On the beat beneath the light  
An angel comes to claim the light  
  
From the streets  
This rebel shall rise  
His soul shall soar  
Through the skies  
  
The same old confrontation  
At the bar in the saloon  
But it's just another tricky situation  
The underworld operation lies in ruins  
  
He's a killer  
Without a cause  
The time is right  
To settle scores

I better keep myself from being busted  
I better keep myself out of jail  
'Cause I ain't got a friend to get me trusted  
That's why my mama sends my money through the mail  
  
I've been down on my luck  
I've been down on my wealth  
I'm gonna start taking care of business  
Start taking care of my health  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight  
  
Well, I set off down the main street  
With such a long, long way to go  
But before I started I was cornered on the corner  
Still waiting for my sugar to show  
  
I've been down on my luck  
I've been down on my wealth  
I've gotta stop taking care of somebody's else's business  
Start taking care of myself  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight  
  
I was fooling around with the sheriff's daughter  
She was a real fine fox  
But the sheriff - he came after  
And threatened to lock me in a cell box  
  
He showed me his magnum  
He showed me his shotgun  
He stuck it in my face  
And said, "Boy, I think you best be gone."  
  
I've gotta leave this town  
I've gotta leave this town behind  
I've gotta leave this town tonight

Little darling, gonna be a rock and roll star  
Little darling, gonna play electric guitar  
Little darling, I'd like to get to know you  
Pleased to meet you, how do you do?  
  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, little darling  
  
Little darling, gonna love you tonight  
Little darling, gonna shake, shake, boogaloo  
Little darling, can I rattle my bones and dance with you?  
And later on there'll be some lovie dovin'  
  
A little kissing, a little hugging  
A little holding you  
  
Little darling, what's your mama mama going to do?  
Little darling, when she finds out  
I stayed out all night with you?  
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you  
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you  
  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, little darling  
Little darling, gonna love you tonight

Little girl in bloom  
With happy heart you wipe aside  
Any sadness, sorrow or gloom  
Tomorrow you'll be a blushing bride  
That loves her blushing groom  
  
Little girl in bloom  
You watch the men play cricket  
From the window in your room  
See the ball go from bat to wicket  
Pass away the afternoon  
  
Little girl in bloom  
Carries a secret  
The child she carries in her womb  
She feels something sacred  
She's gonna be a mammy soon  
  
When your daddy comes home  
Don't tell him till alone  
When your daddy comes back  
Go tell him the facts  
Just relax and see how he's gonna react  
  
Little girl in bloom  
All the clouds will go drifting by  
So sing your lullabying tune  
Every word is in your eyes  
As you sit and softly croon  
  
Little girl in bloom  
Your love it fills the air  
With the scent of the sweetest, sweet perfume  
You feel so good you just don't care  
You're gonna be a mammy soon  
  
When your daddy comes home  
Don't tell him till alone  
When your daddy comes back  
Go tell him the facts  
Just relax and see how he's gonna react

In the dismal darkness  
I have sat and gazed, amazed  
At the blazing factories  
Like a lonely man  
Who stands on the seashore  
And I am afraid  
As weary as I be  
I try, I seem  
I see to looks, okay  
Run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Many lovely ladies  
I have felt, touched  
And I was not afraid  
I took them out dancing  
Fool out romancing  
And I was not afraid  
Then somewhere from the North  
This gale I knew just flew in  
And I am afraid  
Run, run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Run, you got to run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look, you got to look what the wind just blew in  

Mama Nature said  
"It's murder what you've done"  
I sent you forth my brightest world  
Now it's nearly gone  
  
Birds and bees  
Been telling me  
You can't see  
The forest for the trees  
  
You cover up your lies  
With sympathies  
And I got no solutions  
To your persecution  
  
Mama Nature said  
"I can't believe it's true"  
I gave you life and food for thought  
Look what did you do  
  
You're killing my rivers  
Drowning my baby streams  
Day by day by day by day  
I hear them scream  
  
I'm so disillusioned  
I'm so disillusioned  
  
Mama Nature said  
"You're guilty of this crime"  
Now it's not just a matter of fact  
But just a matter of time  
  
Cruel will be the vengeance  
So savage is the deed that's done  
And I've got no solutions  
To your own pollutions

They say that the night life  
They say it ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
I've been a gambler  
I've been a thief  
And most of my good friends  
They don't hold with my belief  
  
They say that the night life  
They say it ain't no good life  
Oh but buy you know that it's my life  
  
And if you've had troubles  
If you've felt them woes  
I don't have to tell you  
How this whole world is so low  
  
Hey now baby  
It can drive you crazy  
Oh but baby  
Baby, the night life's for me  
  
Just one more time  
I'll hit the road  
And I want to thank you  
I want to thank the Lord  
  
For that old night life  
Some say it ain't no good life  
But baby, baby  
There ain't nothing like this night life

Hey, listen closely  
Listen while I tell you  
Why he loves you  
And what he misses mostly  
  
It's pointless his pretending  
He's got a broken heart  
A broken heart  
That needs mending  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
He's going crazy  
He's reckless  
Without you, baby  
He's helpless  
  
It's deadly how you broke him  
He's a fool  
Without you, baby  
I'm not joking  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
Now when I'm down  
My friends, they come around  
And when I'm upset  
My friends, they help me forget  
  
But how can he forget?  
He hasn't got a friend  
'Cause no one told him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
He's all washed up and washed out  
Without you, baby  
Every place he goes  
He's thrown out  
  
He's turned vicious  
He's malicious  
Just goes to show how much he misses  
You know what  
  
He wouldn't tell me  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
You didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
I couldn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again  
  
I didn't tell him  
You didn't want to see him again

There's a girl I'll remember  
Oh for such a long, long time  
This girl I'll remember  
She was an old flame of mine  
  
Beneath the stars just sipping wine  
Young lovers then in summertime  
I'll always remember  
That old flame of mine  
  
Love, she comes and goes  
True love, she hides then shows  
My love, may I propose  
That love she comes and goes  
  
Two hearts together two hearts alight  
To keep us warm on winter nights  
With each dying ember  
I remember that old flame of mine  
  
Once this flame it did brightly blaze  
Among the ashes there still remains  
A glowing spark in my heart  
For that old flame of mine

Late, sometime before midnight  
He comes creeping up  
And before you get him sussed  
He's gone before dusk  
  
And when you arise  
Red ruby rings circle your eyes  
If it's later than you realized  
Check with the stars and the skies  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
A howl in the dark light  
A flash of teeth bright white  
A scream and a bite  
Old moon madness has struck again tonight  
  
But there's no need to worry  
For the crimes that you've done  
Worse has been committed  
With no moon madness to blame it on  
  
Old moon madness has struck again  
  
In fact you could say you're lucky  
You and me  
Mother Earth has only one moon  
And not three

I took a line that leads you to the opium trail  
Oriental eyes reveal the lies, deceit, betrayal  
On this journey behold one who travels far  
You called him fool but now you are  
  
The wizard wanders through the world made from dreams  
The splashing whirlpool drowns the frightened streams  
Exotic dancers, flashing lancers, this mysterious space  
The fanfare advances, the warlord falls from grace  
  
It clears your pain  
But it's got you claimed again, my love  
You feel the need but it lets you bleed  
You must concede, my love  
  
No one to blame, no shame  
You crave again and again, my love  
No used to plead from you  
It feeds on your greed, my love  
  
I took a line that comes from the golden states of shan  
The smugglers trail that leads to the opium den  
The Chinese connection refines to heroin  
Depart the heart you crave again  
  
It clears your pain  
You soul is claimed again, my love  
You feel the need, it lets you bleed  
You must concede, my love  
  
No one to blame, no shame  
You crave again and again, my love  
No use to plead  
From you it feeds, my love

The senorita took off her bobby socks  
She said she's gonna wear a skirt that shocks  
She's pulling out all the stops  
To get her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph, he's back at the ranch  
He's getting ready for tonight's song and dance  
He's doesn't know he doesn't stand a chance  
His last affair will be his last romance  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Underneath the Latin moonlight  
The danced and seen a falling star in flight  
To the strum of guitars she held him tight  
She wants her Randolph back again  
  
Meanwhile it's worthwhile for Randolph to wait  
'Till he gets the nerve then he won't hesitate  
He doesn't know but he's just bit the bait  
He just asked if he could make a date  
  
The senorita will be there waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
The senorita's heart is in love  
She wearing white tonight, looks as pure as a dove  
She's thanking God and all the heavenly stars above  
Randolph's romance is back again  
  
Meanwhile Randolph smiles and says he'll give her ten  
She doesn't come so he just counts again  
And he's been there since he does not know when  
He's thinks she's stood him up but in the end  
  
The senorita won't keep him waiting  
Don't go my Randolph slow tango with me  
  
Senorita dance cheek to cheek  
We will dance off into the sky

She's quite a mediator  
A smoother operator you will never see  
Said see you later  
You know one day I disobeyed her openly  
  
She knows music  
I know music too, you see  
She's got the power  
The teen queen, Rosalie  
  
She's got the pleasure  
Comes from all the cornerstones of the world  
She's so fantastic  
She's everybody's favorite little record girl  
  
She knows music  
I know music too, you see  
She's got the power  
I got the power, Rosalie  
  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
  
Down on me, Rosalie  
Shine on me will you please  
  
Well chattanooga, lacooda, baooga loosa  
You can hear her fine  
She makes the choices  
Then you'd best be smiling when it's losing time  
  
She knows music  
I know music too, you see  
She's got the power  
She is a tower, Rosalie  
  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie  
Rosalie

I'm a fool now that it's over  
Can you guess my name?  
I make my money singing songs about you  
It's my claim to fame  
  
When they say it's over  
It's not all over, there's still the pain  
  
I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Oh I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
  
If I said I was sorry  
Would you still leave me?  
I never thought you'd go 'till you did  
Believe me  
  
When they say it's over  
It's not all over completely  
  
'Cause I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Yes I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
  
I miss that girl  
  
The show is over  
And we must all go home  
Just leave me by myself  
I'll be alright here on my own  
  
If it's all over, it's all over  
And I'm all alone  
  
And I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again  
Don't you know I'd come running  
I'd come running back to you again

When we were kids he used to go over the back wall into old Dan's scrapyard  
Into the snooker hall where most us kids were barred  
An' into the roxy and the stella where film stars starred  
That's where me and Hopalong an' Roy Rogers got drunk and jarred  
And we might have been the saviour of the men,  
The captured captain in the devil's demon den  
And we might have been the magic politician in some kind of tricky position  
Like an old, old, old master musician we kept on wishin'  
We was headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
There's an old photograph of Dan that I wish you could-a seen  
Of him and the boys posed, standing in St. Stephen's green  
Ya see, they were a part of the great freedom dream  
But they were caught and detained and are locked inside the frame  
Of the photograph  
An' he might have been the clever con, the good samaritan, the rassclaut man  
An' he might have been the loaded gun, the charlatan of the tap dancin' fan  
But like an old pioneer from outer Afghanistan,  
Headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
Old Dan in a raincoat hums the very, very, very special notes  
Of a long lost favorite melody  
It reminds him of a love affair when he was young and did not care  
And how he parted so soft, so sadden  
And he might have been the laughing cavaliero, the wise old commanchero  
Ow, the desperate desparado, the good looking Randolph Valentino,  
The gigolo from glasgow  
But like an old, old hunter of the female buffalo,  
He's headed for the number one hit country again  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
True blue  
And sometimes it reminds me of you  
  
And it's true  
True blue  
Irish blue  
True blue  
Irish blue  
And it's true  
It's so true  
Ummm, it's true  
I swear I've said it  
Swear I've said it  
I swear I said it  
I swear it's true  
And it's true  
True blue  
Oh, its irish blue  
And it's true...

Johnny cool was the king  
The leader of the boot boys  
He'd never cause no trouble  
In a rumble make some noise  
  
He heard about some chick  
And they she like to rock  
He said "come here honey"  
"let me see you lift up your frock"  
  
There's gonna be a showdown  
  
Miss Lucy was a chick  
He knew she like to ball  
He said "come on Lucy"  
"it doesn't matter to me at all"  
  
But miss lucy got a fella  
With a flick knife in his hand  
Johnny cool pulls a shotgun  
The man is in command  
  
There's gonna be a showdown  
  
King cool  
King Kong  
King king  
With all the kings  
  
King of hearts he's a lover  
King of spades he's a brother  
King of clubs makes a dollar  
King of diamonds the wedding ring  
  
There's gonna be a showdown

I should've known you couldn't take it  
You had to make it with another man  
You know that's true, baby  
And I can play that game if you can  
It's been a long time since I've come here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
And you know that silver dollar, it would make me rich  
Girl like you, easy pitch  
But I miss you now you're gone  
I'm coming home, girl, just to show you  
What this man's been living for  
A tip for you, don't be surprised, baby  
When I come busting through that door  
It's been a long time since I've been here  
To give you what you need  
My roots are in Chicago  
But I know where I wanna plant my seed  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
And even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know you're gone  
And all I got left is my old guitar  
I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another  
Even though that silver dollar would make me rich  
I wanna tell you that there is a hitch  
Miss you know you're gone

Woman don't like it, hurting her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman don't like me in her own way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, treating her like this  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she don't love the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Woman don't like it, begging on her knees  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Oh please, please, don't desert me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, treating her this way  
Someday she is going to hit back  
There is tenderness in the heart of the lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back  
  
Someday she is going to hit back (4 times)  
Woman don't like it (4 times)  
Someday she is going to hit back (4 times)  
  
She feels so lonely  
Woman don't like it  
She feels so blue  
Woman don't like it  
He has lost her now  
Woman don't like it  
Oh, woman, you knew what she could do  
Woman don't like it  
  
Woman don't like it, says it has to stop  
Someday she is going to hit back  
The woman she says she doesn't love me  
Someday she is going to hit back  
Woman don't like it, the woman don't say a lot  
Someday she is going to hit back  
With one last kiss she leaves him lonely  
Someday she is going to hit back

The boom time it is over  
A ghost town is all that's left here  
The gold rush it is over  
And depression days draw near  
  
Tonight after sundown  
I'm going to pack my case  
I leave without a sound  
Disappear without a trace  
  
I'm going southbound  
  
Drifting like a drover  
Chasing my career  
From the ships docked in the harbour  
New horizons will appear  
  
Tumbling with the tumbleweed.  
Down the open road.  
Taking only what I need.  
Before my head explodes.  
  
I'm going southbound  
  
Hey, you're not getting any younger.  
The wild west has already been won.  
Northern lights are growing colder.  
And the old eastern ways are gone.  
  
So tonight after sundown.  
You must go from this place.  
Without a tear, without a frown.  
Disappear without a trace.

Guess who just got back today  
Them wild-eyed boys that had been away  
Haven't changed that much to say  
But man, I still think them cats are crazy  
  
They were askin' if you were around  
How you was, where you could be found  
Told 'em you were livin' downtown  
Drivin' all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
You know that chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got  
When I say she was cool she was red hot  
I mean, she was steamin'  
  
And that time over at Johnny's place,  
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face  
Man, we just fell about the place  
If that chick don't want to know, forget her  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
Spread the word around  
Guess who's back in town  
  
Just spread the word around  
  
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dino's Bar 'n' Grill  
The drink will flow and the blood will spill  
And if the boys want to fight, you better let 'em  
  
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song  
The nights are getting longer, it won't be long  
Won't be long till the summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town)  
Spread the word around  
The boys are back in town  
(The boys are back in town again)  
  
The boys are back in town again  
Been hangin' down at Dino's  
The boys are back in town again

The friendly ranger paused  
And scooping a bowl of beans  
Spreading them like stars  
Falling like justice on different scenes  
  
"I'm damned"  
"indeed, comrade"  
"I'm being bombed"  
And all the people's faces turned strawberry blonde  
  
By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits  
For the sun making sure it's not late  
"just in time" "no need to fear" "well, just in case"  
And all the people are happy for another year  
  
And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun  
Getting it's glow  
He goes on  
Singing this song  
  
To feel the goodness glowing inside  
To walk down a street with my arms about your hips, side by side  
To play with a sad eyed child till he smiles  
To look at a starry sky at night, realize the miles  
  
To see the sun set behind the steeple  
Clontarf castle, no king, queen or knightly people  
A coal fire and it's pouring rain  
To wave goodbye to a very good friend, never meet again  
Little thoughts bring little memories of you to me

The hero he rode a white horse  
Across the desert to where his woman was  
He'd been riding for four days  
When he saw the tower where she was locked  
  
In the moonlight he left his old steed  
Near the drawbridge that he crossed  
And by way of a rope ladder  
He tip-toed to where his woman was  
  
If I recall you're the actor  
Who followed the stars  
Searching for  
The lost city of Mars  
  
Hoping time would heal the scars  
Knowing fate held no bars  
Are you the one  
That I think you are?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?  
  
The madman climbed  
The steeple spire  
"Go higher" said the crowd  
From down below  
  
"But, the world's on fire" cried the madman  
From the steeple spire  
"You're a liar" cried the crown  
From down below  
  
The madman climbed the steeple spire  
And let a crystal ball tear  
Fall on the crown  
From down below  
  
If I recall you're the actor  
Who took to the stage  
Set the world ablaze  
With your anger and your rage  
  
With every new leaf  
You turned and wrote a new page  
Cleverly concealing  
Your real age  
  
Those that knew you  
Were always quite amazed  
Are you the one  
Who can take this praise?  
  
Are you the hero or are you the madman?  
  
"You're the only one"  
"who can save us"  
Said the wizard  
"Or all is lost"

If you will adore me  
Bow before me and praise my name  
If you place no god before me  
Then all I have is yours to claim  
  
And if God is in the heavens  
Why did God let children die  
If you don't ask these questions  
There is no reasons why  
  
[Chorus]  
We are chosen  
We are one  
We are frightened of no one  
And no one will win this war  
This is the way  
This is the law  
  
All the visions shown before you  
All the kingdoms and the thrones  
All are yours if you bow before me and adore me  
All this you can own  
  
There are those that will go to Heaven  
There are those that will never win  
No one knows what will happen  
There are those that turn to sin  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We are chosen  
  
The devil is in hell with the demons  
This is the Holy War  
  
They lead us to our temptation  
Lead us, take our souls  
There is no evil in salvation  
There is evil in us all  
  
Just as Satan tempted Jesus  
And Jesus slips and falls  
He is a station on The Cross now  
He is dying to save us all  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We are chosen  
We are one  
We are frightened of no one  
And no one will win this war  
This is the way

Set me on my destination  
Point me the way to my position  
What's the meaning of my mission  
I have made my decision clear  
  
I don't need another reason  
I don't want anymore prime time  
I have made my decision  
Not for the first but for the last time  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
I don't want another story  
You can place it with your nursery rhymes  
I don't want to take the glory  
Why don't you and him take it this time  
  
I don't need another reason  
I can't make another plan  
I know you're both in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
So I'll keep pushing my position  
Till the pressure builds it well  
But I keep pressing your decision  
Till you've made your mind up as well  
  
I can't take another season  
I can't make another play  
I know you're in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time

I am your main man if you're looking for trouble  
I take no lip no ones tougher than me  
I'd kick your face you'd soon be seeing double  
Hey little girl, keep your hands off me  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a roller too baby  
I'm a rocker  
  
Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin'  
Bippin' an a boppin', telling a dirty joke or two  
In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something  
and I kissed her right there out of the blue  
  
I said "Hey baby, meet me I'm a tough guy"  
Got my cycle outside, you want to try?  
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes  
And said "Ooh I'd do anything for you 'cause you're a rocker"  
  
That's right I'm a rocker  
I'm a roller too honey  
I'm a rocker  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
rock and roll  
Teddy boy, he's got them all  
  
I love to rock and roll  
I get my records and I Rock On stall  
sweet rock and roll  
Teddy boy, he's got them all  
  
I'm a rocker!

Locked up in the classroom waiting for the fight  
Down to the schoolyard knocking the gate  
Into the alley meet up with the boys  
Waiting for the weekend to make a little noise  
  
Thunder is strong, lightning is death  
Kicking the girls and it's starting to blast  
Sweeter than the heavens and the fate means stumble  
But it's Saturday night when heavy rock was born  
  
[Chorus]  
Like thunder and lightning  
God damn, it's so exciting  
It hits you like a hammer  
God damn  
  
It was Saturday night I was ready for the dance  
My girl walked in holding another guys hand  
He stood six foot six he looked two miles wide  
I was taking it easy till he took her outside  
  
I was madder than hell fit to burn  
This guy would break a leg before but now he's got to run  
Standing in the corner giving him a thrill  
You can keep your lover honey, but he's got to pay the bill  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well the place started rocking it was Saturday night  
I was dressed to kill I was feeling alright  
Alright in the middle of the night  
I wasn't ready for a rumble but the mood was right  
  
When he got up to leave  
I stood in his way  
I said love that's the price you have to pay  
In the doorway up against the wall  
When they play a heavy record then I'm gonna have a ball  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We started to rumble and stumble  
It is we were rocking and rolling and rolling and tumbling  
I fumbled and started to win  
When the greater than wicked then I hit him again  
  
I hit him again and I couldn't hit him anymore  
My head was all black and blue and my jaw was sore  
Sweeter than the heavens and like a frightening stumble  
It was Saturday night when heavy rock was born

Outside the window the neon flashes  
In the morning light  
Down on the sidewalk there's a woman with a problem  
But she don't know how to fight  
  
She's destitute and broken down  
She softly whispers is there no one around  
And no one hears the sound  
Her knees give way and hit the ground  
  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest  
  
Like a rat in a pack it attacks  
From the back  
Through a crack in a track  
And you're taking smack  
  
And jack has had a hard day  
No one told him it would be like this  
He's had to score the hard way  
And there's that trick he'll always miss.  
  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest  
It's tough stuff  
This is the toughest street around  
This is the toughest  
Don't you do down  
  
No how  
  
It's just another black spot  
Where far too many people have died  
It's just another grave yard  
And there's not too many people left alive  
  
This is the toughest  
Are you tough enough  
This is the toughest  
Are you rough enough  
This is the toughest  
Can you bluff enough  
  
Just a minor misery did me no harm  
But it's there as a constant reminder and its there to warn  
The neon is still flashing in the morning light  
Down on the sidewalk that woman was blown away  
Out of sight  
  
All across the city no one gives a damn  
All across the city no one seems to understand  
  
This is the toughest  
This is the toughest street in town  
This is the toughest street around  
This is the toughest  
  
Are you rough enough  
This is the toughest  
If I were you I wouldn't come around here  
This is the toughest  
This is the toughest  
Are you tough enough

I could tell you the story of a vagabond  
A playboy of the western world  
One day by chance he came upon  
A fair young maid, a country girl  
  
He told her that he loved her  
And he took all of her silver  
He told her that he needed her too  
He said "Hey baby, you got eyes of blue"  
But he was a vagabond  
  
Blue eyes, oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
The kind of eyes that say "I do" eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
  
He roamed around the cities  
Searching for his fortune and fame  
No lady ever got to know his name  
Shame, but that was his game  
  
Gave a girl a baby boy  
He said "This child is my pride and joy"  
"I'm busy running wild and free"  
"Make sure he grows up like me"  
And I'm a vagabond  
  
Blue eyes, oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
The kind of eyes that say "I do" eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
Oh baby blue, oh blue eyes  
  
Oh I could tell you a story of a vagabond  
He was a playboy of the western world  
He wore an earring in his left ear  
You see his father he was a gypsy  
  
You just might meet him upon the highway  
Pretty fine dancer too  
But he's leave you blue, he'd leave  
He'd leave you woman

Valentino's got a bookie shop and what he takes  
He gives for what he's got  
And what he's got he says he has not  
Stole from anyone  
  
It's not that he don't tell the truth  
Or even that he misspent his youth  
It's just he holds the proof  
But you know something's wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Valentino's in a cold sweat, but he lost all his money on that last bet  
Against all the odds he smokes another cigarette  
Says it helps him to forget  
He's a nervous wreck  
  
It's not that he misses much  
Or even that he lost his lucky touch  
It's just he gambles so much  
And you know that it's wrong  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to catch your eye  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Try to say I told you I told you  
  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting just to get you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
Just to say I told you  
Waiting for an alibi  
Waiting for an alibi  
  
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

I am the warrior  
I serve the death machine  
Losers or conquerors  
All flash past on my silver screen  
  
Death is no easy answer  
For those who wish to know  
Ask those who have been before you  
What fate the future holds  
  
It ain't pretty  
  
I am a messenger  
The message here, you must know  
I am the warrior  
I deliver the fatal blow  
  
So fate will have to wait  
Till time can heal the scar  
My heart is ruled by Venus  
And my head by Mars

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains.  
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'.  
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier.  
I said stand o'er and deliver or the devil he may take ya.  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da.  
Whack for my daddy-o,  
Whack for my daddy-o.  
There's whiskey in the jar-o.  
  
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny.  
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly.  
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me.  
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy.  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da.  
Whack for my daddy-o,  
Whack for my daddy-o.  
There's whiskey in the jar-o.  
  
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber.  
Takin' my money with me and I never knew the danger.  
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell.  
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels.  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da.  
Whack for my daddy-o,  
Whack for my daddy-o.  
There's whiskey in the jar-o.  
  
Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin',  
And some men like ta hear a cannon ball a roarin'.  
Me? I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber.  
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah.  
  
Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da.  
Whack for my daddy-o,  
Whack for my daddy-o.  
There's whiskey in the jar-o.  
  
And I got drunk on whiskey-o  
And I love, I love, I love, I love, I love, I love my Molly-o.

Wild one won't you please come home  
You've been away too long, will you  
We need you home, we need you near  
Come back wild one will you  
  
How can we live without your love  
You know that could kill you  
How can we carry on  
When you are gone my wild one  
  
So you go your way wild one  
I'll try and follow  
And if you change your mind  
I will be waiting here for you tomorrow  
  
For I would beg for you  
I would steal and I would borrow  
I'd do anything, anything at all  
To end this sorrow  
  
Wild one  
The gypsies warned of the danger  
You can laugh and joke with friends  
But don't you ever talk to strangers  
  
Although their offers may be sweet  
And I'd bet and I would wager  
Away you'll stray and never come back  
To those who love and made you

We all must beware of the yellow pearl  
The Yellow Pearl control, attack, attack, attack, attack  
Yellow Pearl  
It is foolish to venture into strange enchanted places  
If they aren't the places you want to be  
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack  
Is what we lack  
We will arise  
We will control  
We will command  
We will patrol  
It is foolish under the guise of love and liberty  
That we should capitalize and rob and fell  
The poor for the socialistic tree  
We will arise  
We will control  
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack  
Is what we lack  
That's what you lack  
We shall arise  
They will arise  
We shall control  
They will control  
We shall command  
They will command  
We shall patrol  
They will patrol  
We must fight back  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
We are now living in a situation  
Where that self same situation depends on the Yellow Pearl  
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack  
Is what we lack  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
They will control  
We will command  
They shall command  
We will patrol  
They will patrol  
Arise  
Yellow Pearl's upon us now  
We must fight back  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack  
Is what we lack  
Is what we lack  
Don't trust in Liberty  
To save your soul  
It is genocide to let liberty lose control  
Control  
We must decide  
Control  
We the Yellow Pearl we will control
