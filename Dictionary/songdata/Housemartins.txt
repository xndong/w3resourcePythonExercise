It doesn't seem so long ago  
That I was sitting at the edge of the desk  
And now I'm looking back with a smile  
As I turn my back to success  
And I laugh and I cry and ask myself why  
Everyday they do the same  
And I stop and I think for a minute each week  
Do they always catch the train  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
It seems like only yesterday  
That I was sitting at the edge of the desk  
And now I'm looking back with a smile  
As I turn my back to success  
And I laugh and I cry and ask myself why  
Everyday they do the same  
And I stop and I think for a minute each week  
Do they always catch the train  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everyday, everyday, everyday seems to end this way  
Everday just seems the same

James Dean posters on their wall  
(Five killed in the car-crash)  
What a sad little end to it all  
(Five killed in the car-crash)  
Last seen having lots of fun  
(Five dumped in a river)  
Barefoot and on the run  
(Five dumped in a river)  
I am mad from Scandinavia  
I want a guy in the London area  
He must be crazy and Sagittarius  
'Cause I'm Leo and I'm hilarious  
Fun, fun, fun

Feigning concern, a conservative pastime  
Makes you feel doubtful right from the start  
The expression she pulls is exactly like last time  
You've got to conclude she just hasn't a heart  

Famines will be famines, banquets will be banquets  
Some spend winter in a palace, some spend it in blankets  
Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away  
Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today  
  
Time to end the praying  
Listen what they're saying  
  
Get up off your knees  
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore  
Shake your head till it shakes no more  
  
Paupers will be paupers, bankers will be bankers  
Some own pennies in a jar, some own oil tankers  
What may sound like tomorrow could be ours today  
There's no more need for sorrow if we get off our knees to pray  
  
Time to end the praying  
Listen what they're saying  
  
Get up off your knees  
You can wag your finger till your finger's sore  
Shake your head till it shakes no more  
  
Countries will be countries, borders will be borders  
Some have lost their folks at war, some have give orders  
Don't wag your fingers at them and turn to walk away  
Don't shoot someone tomorrow that you can shoot today  
  
Time to end the praying  
Listen what they're saying

The road is long  
With many winding turns,  
That leads us to  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But I'm strong  
Strong enough to care  
Ah, He ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
So on we go  
His welfare is my concern  
No burden is he,  
To where, we'll get there  
But I know  
He will not uncomfort me  
Ah, He ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
The road is long  
With many winding turns  
That leads us to,  
Who knows where  
Who knows where  
But I'm strong,  
Strong enough to care  
Ah, he ain't heavy  
Cause, he's my brother  
When the going gets rough,  
I've got a brother  
When the going gets tough,  
I've got a friend  
Ah, you must call me  
Yeah, yeah  
All you must call me  
He, he's my brother  
He's my brother

As martin said to xanthe  
As they played with wooden toys  
"you may have wendy's playhouse  
But where the heel's your boys? "  
As paul said to fifi  
As they eyed each other up  
"you may have better plimsoles  
But you can't pee standing up"  
And I'd like to take the time to bite  
Their neck and make it bleed  
Or maybe I could cut holes in their  
Daddy's harris tweed  
And I can't put my finger on it  
Maybe it's something in their food  
And I cna't put my finger on it  
All I know is christ would've sued  
As sharon said to jamie  
As they sat down for a chat  
"if you think I'm cooking dinner  
Well, prepare to eat dead rat"  
As debbie said to alex  
As they held hands in the park  
"how come you wear rupert check  
When you think you're so hard"  
I should've done his land rover  
To let him know I'd been  
Instead I wrote "f' off"  
On the dirt across his screen  
And I can't put my finger on it  
Maybe it's something in their food  
And I cna't put my finger on it  
All I know is christ would've sued  
I wish I'd let them know that I was here  
A drop of arsenic in the wine  
Sulphuric acid in the beer  

In times when you're troubled  
Seems more than you can affoard  
And you feel, you feel you need a friend  
Someone to share the load  
  
And when your skies grow cloudy  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
When your dreams are scattered  
Just like the wind blown sand  
And you feel, you feel you need a friend  
I'll be there, reach out your hand  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
I'll see you through your bad times  
I'll see you through your fears  
I'll see you through your hang ups  
Honey I'll dry all your tears  
  
And when the tempest is raging  
I want you to know got a friend that's true  
Just like a shelter, in a time of storm  
I'll see you through, that's what I'll do  
  
I will see you through, I will see you through  
I will see you through, I will see you through  
  
When my load got heavy, did you see me through  
When my load got to hard to bear, did you see me through  
What would you do, what would you do  
What would you do, what would you do  
  
If you're living on the dole and there's no sugar in your bowl  
All you need to do is give a little knock  
Don't despair he'll be there with his loving and his care  
Marx will work for us right around the clock  
  
He's alright, he's alright  
He's alright, he's alright

Please don't show your soul to me  
I think I'd see the light shine through  
And please don't greet me on the street  
I'd like to see a world without you  
Please don't change your uniform  
And start to mourn the thousands dead  
And please wear what you've always worn  
And don't be drawn by what I've said  
'cause I've found there's nothing more  
That I could say to you  
Nothing I could do to change your mind  
Change your ways and your tune  
So please don't feel you have to sway  
Or move away from how you feel  
And please say what you mean to say  
And always stay with a heart of steel  

Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Everyday just a little bit harder  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
I'm right here, I'll help you cope  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
  
Grab a rope and pull me in  
But lean on me  
Everyday, you'll have a friend  
But lean on me  
  
Grab a rope, pull me in  
Everyday you'll have a friend  
Grab a rope  
  
In the world, ??  
And if you're looking for a rainy day friend  
Well grab a rope, pull me in  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden cloudy skies  
Lean on me  
I'll be the ?? of weeping eyes  
But lean on me  
  
If you always feels like rain  
All you've got in life is pain  
Heavy burden, go away  
Oh...goodbye  
Heavy burden, on you shoulder  
Lean on me

Sometimes I get so angry with the simple life they lead  
The shepherds smile seems to confirm my fears  
They've never questioned anything, They've never disagreed  
Sometimes I think they must have wool in their ears  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against  
  
When I was young they used to get me counting sheep  
But the counting I did was all in vain  
No when I'm tired and I'm trying to get to sleep  
I count humans jumping onto trains  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against  
  
And when you see a cane I see a crook  
And when you see a crowd I see a flock  
It's sheep we're up against  
Sheep we're up against

Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense in fighting  
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees no sense at all  
Sitting on a fence is a man who strokes his twenty beards  
Sitting on a fence is a man who drink real ale  
  
But the real problem with this man  
Is he says he can't when he can  
He'd rather not get his hands dirty  
He'll still be there when he's thirty  
  
I told myself to keep my mouth shut  
But I still end up saying if and but  
I lied to myself right from the start  
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart  
Sitting on a fence  
  
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks up to his guardian  
Sitting on a fence is a man who swings from poll to poll  
Sitting on a fence is a man who sees both sides of both sides  
Sitting on a fence is a man who looks down on opinion  
  
But the real problem with this man  
Is he says he can't when he can  
He's rather not get his hands dirty  
He'll still be there when he is thirty  
  
I told myself to keep my mouth shut  
But I still end up saying if and but  
I lied to myself right from the start  
And I've just worked out that I'm falling apart  
Sitting on a fence

Well the wall's to wet to sit on  
And there's a curtain right over my head  
Stamp my feet waiting for a bus  
But decide to walk instead  
  
And the American saxophoner follows me  
All the way from the tele to the public house  
My fingers are always in my ears  
But the reeds always in their mouth  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital D  
  
Just step outside  
Well we could stop for a conversasion  
If we could think of anything to say  
But you know you've got nothing to talk about  
When nothing happened yesterday  
  
And if I ever committed a murder  
I think I'd go about it this way  
Never mine a rope or a dagger and a cloak  
I could spend a week on this estate  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital A  
  
Just step outside  
What are you doing tomorrow  
And the day after and the day after that  
Got some money I can borrow?  
I've become the person I've admired  
  
And if you've ever crossed  
your heart and hoped to die  
The voices in your head saying you must cry  
Then there's more to you than meets the eye  
But if you go about your business with capital be  
They're sure to cut you up with a capital see  
And then you will be dead with a capital be  

We dig our models with the brains the size of models  
And cars that we can trust with out wives  
And we dig converstations with girls from every nation  
But not the ones that whisper or tell lies  
Wherever there's a will there's a motorway  
Wherever there is greed there is speed  
And they've always got to be there for yesterday  
Welcome to the new scalextric's breed  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean  
We're only flying past so we dig our sevice fast  
From the waiters to the women to the wine  
Never mind the match, I've an urgent date to catch  
Get me to the concert hall on time  
Pretending to be pilots in a war  
Pretending to weave between the flak  
No-one knows what the mission's for  
Blinkered horses on the track  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean  

They smiled so much and waved their flags  
As she saluted to the military band  
Most of the people failed to see  
She had a broken bottle in the other hand  
And she took them by surprise  
When she took them by the throat  
And said "My friend you're not allowed to vote"  
But they shook it all off  
With a nervous laugh and cough  
"Next time," she said "I'll let those people choke"  
  
The people who grinned themselves to death  
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath  
And even when their kids were starving  
They all thought the queen was charming  
  
She polished all upon the wall  
And ran her hands right through her hair  
So if the lady took the time to call  
All the houses on the street would not compare  
  
And she thought it really funny  
That she hadn't any money  
But those she looked up to, they had  
But they shook it all off  
With a nervous laugh and cough  
And when they took her riches it was sad  
  
The people who grinned themselves to death  
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath  
And even when their kids were starving  
They all thought the queen was charming

The teacher's name was Charles  
He made me feel like Jack  
Thought Martin was late  
'Cause he sat right at the back  
Thought my name was Peter  
The time that I was there  
I told him it was Paul  
But he didn't seem to care  
Drawing mustaches and glasses  
While on the ruling classes  
Drawing willies on soldiers  
From Berlin to Damascus  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
Making bombs in chemistry  
And catapults in craft  
He thought I must be far too  
Down for this class  
He even told the caretaker  
I didn't want to pass  
And he agreed he'd seen me  
Cutting cross his grass  
Would he keep all the marbles  
He'd taken in that year?  
Would we storm-troop the staffroom  
And pinch his cans of beer?  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
There is always something there to remind me  
Something that I should've left behind me  
It taps you on the shoulder in a queue  
It shouts across the street, I've more than you  
And there is always something there to remind me of you  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
It shouts out loud  
I'm more than you, I'm more than you  
It shouts out loud  

We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh, we shall not be moved  
  
Well I said we shall not be moved  
Well I said we shall not be moved  
  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh, we shall not be moved  
  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh, we shall not be moved  
  
Goodnight

You can put it down to lack of patience  
You can put it down to lack of sleep  
But it's in my head to stay in bed  
Tucked under the sheets  
They said if you try to get on I'd get on  
They said there were chances  
But now my chance has gone  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep  
Now it may be a sad reflection  
On the way young people feel  
But early Monday morning  
Is losing its appeal  
I open my curtains at 7a.m.  
Just so you think I'm up with the rest of the men  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep  
You'd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a break  
But that's one risk you'd never take  
The evenings yours, the mornings mine  
But don't knock me, I'm doing fine  
You'd do yourself a favor if you gave yourself a rest  
But just for now you know what's best  
And I know what you think  
What you think about me  
Thoughts like that sink home  
To you we're not deep  

Tinker, you better place another bet  
The rich up in the castle haven't finished eating yet  
They'll throw you a bone or a spat-out stone  
But knowing them that's all you'll get  
Tailor, you better close another shop  
No-one wants your quality, make do with what you've got  
They'll let you survive  
The'll let you get by  
But knowing them, they'll let you rot  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
Tinker, you better buy another boot  
Those "Pocock Continental" are finally showing through  
We'll get you a pair  
From a second-hand fair  
They'll only have 'a two'  
  
Sailor, you better sink a few more ships  
Admiral loony Nelson cannot find his game of risk  
We'll lose a few lives  
A couple of tribes  
But knowing him he'll like his lips  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
From Queen Wilkinds to Queen Victoria  
We've had a promising side  
From King Callaghan to Bonny Prince Francis  
We've paid up and we've cried  
Princess Gower and Princess Ferguson  
We've looked a hard nut to crack  
But we're weak at the.........Back!
