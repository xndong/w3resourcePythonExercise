Fate took a freeway to my room  
Said to much while he stayed  
And left too soon.  
Bright on an evening sea,  
He washed in with the tide  
Deep in each other's dreams  
Where all but dreams had died.  
  
Wretched in your thoughts  
Gentle hate within the love you bought.  
  
Words fade like flowers shadowed  
There beneath your wall  
Wind cries from every angle  
Dead leaves left to wait for fall.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anyone.  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night.  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anything  
I can be anyone  
I can be anyone.

You say it's time to leave now babe I can't believe  
That you have the strength to go now  
I won't stand in your way I'd be standing there all day  
Ain't that something we both know now  
You play your games but the fact remains  
I'm the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didn't I bring your love down  
Didn't I bring your love down all night  
  
If you think you need a change well I'm sure we can arrange  
For you to get on your own for a while  
But I don't need to worry 'cause you'll get back in a hurry  
I know that you like my style  
You play your games but the fact remains  
I'm the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didn't I bring your love down  
Didn't I bring your love down all night

Came in from the city  
Walked into the door  
I turned around when I heard the sound of footsteps on the floor.  
Love just like addiction now I'm hooked on you  
I need some time to get it right  
Your love gonna see me through.  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!  
  
Baby  
make your mind up  
give me what you got  
Fix me with your loving shut the door and turn the lock.  
Hey  
go get the doctor  
doctor came too late  
Another night I feel alright my love for you can't wait.  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
  
I ain't never gonna let you go, don't go!  
Came in from the city  
walked into the door  
I turned around when I heard  
The sound of footsteps on the floor.  
Said he was a killer  
now I know it's true  
I'm dead when you walk out the door  
hey babe  
I'm hooked  
  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
Can't stop now  
don't you know  
Can't stop now.  
don't you know

Sometimes I feel,  
I'll never belong  
I want to get there so bad  
But it's taking so long  
Sometimes I feel  
Like letting go  
But when it comes right down to it, baby  
Who wants to know? (no-one)  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I find (for a good time)  
I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)  
Now I find (for a good time)  
I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)  
  
Standing on the outside  
I'm looking in  
Trying to be heard  
I don't know where to begin  
Help me baby show me how  
To be a part of it all and all  
Right here, and now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hands are full of silver  
My pockets full of gold  
It's time I'm trying to spend  
And I can't get myself sold  
I'm a bargain honey  
I'm a giveaway  
And you can have it all  
If you'd use up my day.  
  
[Chorus]

To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your headache to the shape of the 1980's  
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more  
I'm tired of playing in your fashion war  
  
To the lights to the trend setting in your head  
Sunday nights tear from the youth cults already dead  
I'm glad that we don't hear you and more  
I'm tired of fighting in your fashion war  
  
[Chorus:]  
Goodbye seventies  
  
To your credit to the thirty faces you created  
To your subscription for the million copies of 1980  
I'm glad that we don't hear you any more  
I'm tired of losing in your fashion war  
  
[Chorus]

Take no notice 'Cause I'm just the same  
There's a thousand other faces with the very same name  
And we look like each other, and we all live together.  
We talk about the same things  
And we never try and change things.  
  
[Chorus]  
We're the happy, happy people  
  
We never give opinions and we never state views  
After all, you can't be sure that what we say is true  
And if you want to join us, you can follow on behind us.  
You can talk about your visions  
You can make some big decisions.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We believe in having fun and smiling all the time  
And sometimes we're on tv if we're over 69  
And when we have a raffle, then it's just a big reshuffle.  
It's a democratic poll  
But we're the ones who are in control.  
  
[Chorus]

I stand alone and watch the clock  
I only wait for it to stop  
And in the room locked up inside me  
The cutout magazines remind me  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
And in my room against the wall  
There is picture very small  
A photograph I took some years ago  
It shows a picture of the room I know  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
[Chorus:]  
The walls are white and in the night  
The room is lit by electric light  
  
I stand and watch the clock  
I only wait for it to stop  
The doors are shut and all the windows lock  
The only sound is from the clock  
I sit and wait alone in my room  
  
[Chorus]

Midnight it's raining outside he must soaking wet  
Everyone is sleeping tight  
God knows I tried my best  
Darling you know it looks bad  
Just lost the best thing that I ever had  
Still I don't know why I did him wrong  
It's too late now he's gone to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby oh no, can't leave me now  
Said think about it please  
'cause I love you and I need you  
And I should have thought of that before I did you wrong  
  
Heartache, heartache, yeah  
When I saw his face I could see how bad I'd let him down  
Cheating when he was working hard, I just had to mess around  
I knew from the start he ain't got much money  
I should have stayed content with all that good sweet honey  
He's a good strong man and I love him so so how on earth can I let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And now it's midnight it's raining outside  
And I'm soaking wet, still looking for that man of mine  
And I ain't found him yet  
Well all of this rain can wash away my tears  
But nothing can replace all of those wasted years  
In all of this I tell you I have learnt  
Playing with fire gets you burnt  
And I'm still burning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you'll lose your pride  
Well don't you know dear, don't you know  
I'll lose so much more if you go now  
Oh no

Winter sounds the crying  
Like an old man slowly dying  
And the only sound, the wind that fills the trees  
Even colder comes the moon  
And though it never seems too soon  
A sudden stillness as the rainfall starts to freeze  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm Mr. Blue  
I'm here to stay with you  
And no matter what you do  
When you're lonely  
I'll be lonely too  
  
A young girl, she is shaded  
Bears the scars that never faded  
Of the baby that was born on Christmas Day  
While the heavens sing their song  
A child's life is never long  
'Cos the food supplies will only last a day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Patriot emotion, is the cause of the commotion  
After all there's really no-one here to blame  
Soldiers taking orders, 'cos we must defend the borders  
Of our nation (and the other side's the same)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll come to you at night  
When all the world is sleeping tight  
And lie beside you, 'til the early morning dew  
You can't hear me, you can't see  
But you can feel me when you read  
The folded letter she left addressed to you  
  
[Chorus]

If I wait for just a second more,  
I know I'll forget what I came here for,  
My head was so full of things to say,  
But as I open my lips all my words slip away  
And anyway,  
I can't believe you want to turn the page,  
And move your life onto another stage,  
You can change the chapter you can change the book,  
But the story remains the same if you'd take a look.  
  
[Chorus:]  
For the times we've had I don't want to be, a page in your diary babe,  
For the good, the bad I don't want to see, a page in your diary babe,  
For the happy, the sad, I don't want to be another page in your diary.  
  
Perhaps if I held you I could win again,  
I could take your hands we'd talk and maybe then,  
That look in your eyes I always recognize,  
Would tell me everything is gonna be fine,  
You're gonna be mine  
For a long time  
  
[Chorus]

When he moves I watch him from behind  
He turns and laughter flickers in his eyes  
Intent and direct when he speaks, I watch his lips  
And when he drives I love to watch his hand  
White and smooth almost feminine, almost American, I have to watch him.  
  
[Chorus:]  
In his face age descends on youth, exaggeration on the truth  
He caught me looking then but soon his eyes forgot  
And everything he seems to do reflects just another shade of blue  
I saw him searching into you and ached a while  
  
I watch his lips caress the glass,  
His fingers stroke its stem and pass  
To lift a cigarette at last, he dries his eyes  
From a shadow by the stair  
I watch as he weeps unaware  
That I'm in awe of his despair, but I am there  
  
[Chorus]

Looking from a window above, it's like a story of love  
Can you hear me  
Came back only yesterday  
I'm moving further away  
Want you near me  
  
[Chorus]  
All I needed was the love you gave  
All I needed for another day  
And all I ever knew  
Only you  
  
Sometimes when I think of her name when it's only a game  
And I need you  
Listen to the words that you say it's getting harder to stay  
When I see you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is going to take a long time and I wonder what's mine  
Can't take no more  
Wonder if you'll understand it's just the touch of your hand  
Behind a closed door  
  
[Chorus]

Blue eyed dressed for every situation  
Moving through the doorway of a nation  
Pick me up and shake the doubt  
Baby I can't do without  
  
[Chorus:]  
Move out, don't mess around  
Move out, you bring me down  
Move out, how you get about  
Don't make a sound just move out  
  
I remember only for an hour  
Move right through me can you feel the power  
I don't know what's going on  
It scares me but it won't take long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now he's in control he is my lover  
Nations stand against him he's your brother  
Been a long time, been a long time now  
I'll get to you somehow  
  
[Chorus]

It's over, there's nothing more to say  
Silent comes the night time, end another summers day  
I can just remember, or is this the dream that never goes away.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Understand me, I'm calling,  
Understand me, can you hear me call.  
  
Night time, surely it's a lie,  
No-one ever told me, I just let the chance go by  
Wishing there was time enough, you tell me there's no time, but I can try.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Speak now, without the summer light  
All the words I should have spoken, when you held me tight  
Still I'll keep in calling, till the morning ends another lonely night.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be waiting for you hoping, that someday you'll hear me calling  
But there's never any answer, just the echo of the call

Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing  
I give in  
Sweet thing  
I give in (submission)  
(don't you want to right it, fight it)  
Oh, no, if you don't think it's right  
Can't change your mind if I talk all night  
(don't you want to right it, fight it)  
Oh, no, 'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing.  
  
Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing

Just go.  
'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing.  
  
Hey, hey, hey how could you be so unkind  
When you were lying to me all the time  
You don't need me now your life is fine  
It's your day now, but it's gonna be mine  
Oh and what a sweet day.  
Hey, hey, hey,

Oh, no, 'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing.  
  
Hey, hey, hey how could you be so unkind  
When you were lying to me all the time  
You don't need me now your life is fine  
It's your day now, but it's gonna be mine  
Oh and what a sweet day.  
  
Sweet thing, I give in  
Sweet thing, I give in  
Sweet thing, submission (i give in)  
Sweet thing, submission (i give in)  
Sweet thing, submission (i give in)

I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can do it by day, you can do it by night  
It can be so fine and you'll agree  
If you just do what comes naturally now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby it's the other side of love  
Baby, baby  
  
There's plenty of ways we can do that thing  
We can fool around til we get that swing  
Come on do what you want honey we don't mind  
If you just make sure that you stay in time now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know a good dance when the mood is right  
You can take is sow cause we've got all night  
It can be so fine and you'll agree  
If you just do what come naturally now

Write me a letter a face in the hall  
Hiding from someone afraid of the fall  
And she's waiting for someone to take her back to where she came from  
And she'll wait alone for hours she won't mind because there's someone  
In the story she remembers she remembers in the letter  
And the tears locked up inside her make her heart break open wider  
Shuts her eyes and takes the picture from the wall

Woman of thirty seeing the sun  
Packed up her suitcase started to run  
Looking for someone looking for none  
Pack up and drive away  
  
It was her birthday Tuesday morning  
Realization gradually dawning  
A man in a gray suit whispered 'I'm calling'  
Pack up and drive away  
  
Woman of thirty, husband and kids chained like a dog she had to rid  
No point in coping off came the lid  
Pack up and drive away  
  
Three thousand miles of honesty dreaming  
Perfect imagery is a gleaming  
No more shattered clouds were deeming  
Pack up and drive away  
  
In her heart it wasn't easy  
Mumbled words and feeling dizzy  
Reasons fight against excuses driving slower she was losing  
Dream was stirring only dozing  
Eyelids awaken to the daydream  
Just an illusion broken sunshine  
Woman of thirty there's no choice  
I can't help our helpless voice

Go and join the army  
Said the father to the son  
See the world around you boy  
And learn to use a gun  
Think you're something special  
Well, we'll make you just the same  
There's nothing wrong in dying  
After all, it's just a game  
Just a game.  
  
Read the morning paper  
There's a picture of a cross  
"we were proud in them days"  
By the way, I think you lost  
Trust me when I tell you boy  
That god is on our side  
Even Jesus cheers us on  
Against the other side  
Against the other side.  
  
He who shouts the loudest  
Is the one who's in control  
We who never listen  
Are the ones who pay the toll  
Tell us that it's time at last  
To make a final stand  
I'm glad 'cause all I wanted  
Was to kill another man  
Just to kill another man.

Move along you're in my way.  
I've made my mind up not to stay  
And it don't matter what you do  
'cause me, I've had enough of you.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there's no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey baby, don't walk away from love  
Tell me baby, ain't my love enough,  
Listen to the things I say  
And tell me why do you walk away from love?  
  
Leave you standing on your own  
It's time I spent some time alone  
Need a while to think this out  
Not sure what it's all about.  
And it's no use to sit there crying  
'cause I can see you're only lying.  
Now I'll put the past behind me  
Run some place where you can't find me.  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bags are packed, I just can't wait.  
Gotta get out before it gets too late,  
I don't need you any more  
And I don't need your love for sure.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember when I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't walk away from love

Green in your love on bright days  
You grew sun blind you thought me unkind  
To remind you how winter kills  
  
Lost in daydreams you drove too fast and got nowhere  
You rode on half fare when you got too scared  
How winter kills  
  
Tear at me searching for weaker seams  
Pain in your eyes make me cruel  
Make me spiteful tears are delightful welcome your nightfall  
How winter kills  
  
I'll tear at you searching for weaker seams  
How winter kills
