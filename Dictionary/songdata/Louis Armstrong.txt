Give me a kiss to build a dream on  
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss  
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this  
A kiss to build a dream on  
  
Give me a kiss before you leave me  
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart  
Leave me one thing before we part  
A kiss to build a dream on  
  
And when I'm alone with my fantasies, I'll be with you  
Weaving romances, making believe they're true  
  
Oh, give me your lips for just a moment  
And my imagination will make that moment live  
Give me what you alone can give  
A kiss to build a dream on  
  
When I'm alone with my fantasies, I'll be with you  
Weaving romances, making believe they're true  
  
Oh, give me lips for just a moment  
And my imagination will make that moment live  
Oh, give me what you alone can give  
A kiss to build a dream on

No one to talk to  
All by myself  
No one to walk with  
I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
I know for certain  
The one I love  
I'm through with flirtin'  
It's just you that I've been thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner  
In that old corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late  
Nowhere to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner  
In that old corner  
Don't go nowhere  
What do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late  
Nowhere to go  
I'm home about eight  
Just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin'  
Savin' all my love for you  
Ain't misbehavin'  
I'm savin' all my love for you

Come on and hear, come on and hear  
Alexander's Ragtime Band  
Come on and hear, come on and hear  
It's the best band in the land  
  
They can play a bugle call  
Like you never heard before  
So natural that you want to go to war  
  
That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb  
  
Come on along, come on along  
Let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, up to the man  
Who's the leader of the band  
  
And if you want to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime  
  
Come on and hear, come on and hear  
Alexander's Ragtime Band

You took my kisses and all my love  
You taught me how to care  
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair  
  
All you took  
I gladly gave  
There is nothing left for me to save  
  
All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I want to loose them  
Take my arms  
I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me

I really can't stay  
Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
And my father will be pacing the floor  
Just listen to that fireplace roar  
Now really I'd better scurry  
Sweetheart, what's your hurry?  
Well maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some records on while I pour  
All the neighbors might think  
But baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there  
Oh, I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move in closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense in hurting my pride?  
I really can't stay  
Baby don't hold out  
Oh, but it's cold outside  
I simply must go  
Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
But baby, it's cold out there  
Oh, this welcome has been  
So lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out that window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious  
And my brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
Oh, my maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Ooo, baby you're so delicious  
Well maybe just one little kiss more  
Never such a blizzard before  
Oh, I've got to go home  
You'll freeze to the bone out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me?  
Oh, there's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my lifelong sorrow  
Well at least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
But I really can't stay  
Get over that old out  
Baby it's cold outside  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Hey, I gotta get out of here  
Come on, baby  
Come on what?  
Just give me five minutes more  
You sure know how to wear a girl down, don't you?  
Okay, okay, okay, okay  

I had a woman  
Livin' way back o' town  
Yeah she treated me right  
Never let me down  
But I wasn't satisfied  
I had to run around  
  
Now she's gone and left me  
I'm worried as can be  
Oh I've searched this world all over  
Wonderin' where she could be  
I would ask that she forgive me  
And maybe she'll come back to me  
  
(But I doubt it)  
I'm lonesome an blue  
And I've learned a thing or two  
Oh fellas here's a tip  
I'm gonna pass on down to you  
Never mistreat your woman  
Cause it's gonna bounce right back on you

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns  
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs  
You'll meet honest men and pick-pockets skilled  
You'll find that business never closes  
Till somebody gets killed  
  
If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk  
Married men would have to take their beds and walk  
Except one or two, who never drink booze  
And the blind man on the corner  
Who sings the Beale Street Blues  
  
He said, "I'd rather be there than anyplace I know  
Yes, I'd rather be here, than anyplace I know  
It's gonna take the Sergeant, for to make me go"  
  
I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by  
Yes, I'm goin' to the river and there's a reason why  
Because the river's wet and Beale Street's done gone dry

Bessie couldn't help it  
Bessie couldn't help it  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Bessie couldn't help it though she tried to be good  
Oh, so good  
She was pretty as the heaven's above  
Oh, boy but how she could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful, terrible  
But Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
When she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all  
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night  
Why, oh, why did she yell with delight?  
?Cause Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Aww, dumb pe dumb, now people listen  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
No, Bessie couldn't help it though she tried to be good  
Oh, so good  
She was pretty as the heavens above  
And oh, boy how that girl could love  
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful  
Bop, bop be de oww  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  
Now when she smiled you were bound to fall, that's all boy  
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night  
My oh, my, how she yelled with delight  
Bessie couldn't help it any more  
Than you could or I could  

Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead  
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
  
No joys for me, no company  
Even the mouse ran from my house  
All my life through I've been so black and blue  
  
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case  
Cause I can't hide what is on my face  
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn  
My heart is torn. Why was I born?  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
  
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case  
Cause I can't hide what is on my face  
How will it end? Ain't got a friend  
My only sin is in my skin  
What did I do to be so black and blue?  
Tell me, what did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? What did I do?  
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?  
What did I do to be so black and blue?

Blue again  
Blue again  
And you know darn well  
It's you again  
You said last night  
We were through again  
And now, I'm blue again  
  
I'm alone again  
Alone again  
I'm out around on my own again  
There's a mockingbird that's flown again  
And I'm alone again  
  
Now baby, though I said I hate you  
I love you more every day, babe  
Though I aggravate you  
All that I'm dying to say  
Is that it's new again  
You again  
And we'll meet today at half past two again  
And tonight, we'll fight  
Again  
And I'll be blue again

I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
On Blueberry Hill when I found you  
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill  
And lingered until my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Though we're apart, you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill  
  
(I found my thrill) Come climb the hill with me, baby  
(On Blueberry Hill) We'll see what we shall see  
(On Blueberry Hill) I'll bring my horn with me  
(When I found you) I'll be wit' you where berries are blue  
(The moon stood still) Each afternoon we'll go  
(On Blueberry Hill) Higher than the moon we'll go  
(And lingered until) Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go  
(My dreams came true) Ba-ba-da-de-buzz-buzz va-de-n-da-day  
  
The wind in the willow played (do you really love me)  
Love's sweet melody (as I love you?)  
But all of those vows we made (will you still remember)  
Were never to be (when the night is through?)  
  
Though we're apart, you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

'Bout time, 'bout time we had little taste of wasted time  
Like love a deux, I wasted time alone with you  
'Bout time we two we're livin' out a lovely dream come true  
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love, yes  
  
'Bout time, 'bout time we spent good time with no one near  
To watch me while I say a little somethin' in your ear  
'Bout how I care, 'bout how I wanna make my feelin's clear  
About you, 'bout me, 'bout love  
  
We're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head  
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said  
  
'Bout time, 'bout time we didn't have to always steal a kiss  
'Bout time, 'bout time I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through I wanna make you feel the way I do  
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love  
  
Yes, we're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head  
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said  
  
'Bout time, yes time, we didn't have to always steal a kiss  
'Bout time, time, I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through, I wanna make you feel the way I do  
'Bout you, about me, 'bout us, ooo-eee  
About your love and mine, budd-lee-ooo, 'bout time

What good is sitting, alone in your room?  
But come, hear the music play!  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
Come to the cabaret!  
Put down your knitting, your book and your broom  
It is time for a holiday  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
  
Come to the cabaret!  
Come taste the wine  
Come hear the band  
Come blow that horn  
Start celebrating  
Right this way your table's waiting  
What good's permitting some prophet of doom?  
To wipe every smile away  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
So come to the cabaret!  
  
I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie  
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea  
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower  
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours  
The day she died the neighbours  
Came to snicker her  
Well, that is what comes from  
Too much pills and liquor  
  
But when I saw her laid down like a queen  
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen  
I think of Elsie till this very day  
I remember how she'd turned to me and say  
What good is sitting all alone in your room?  
Come hear the music play  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
Come to the cabaret!  
  
And as for me  
And as for me  
I made my mind up back in Chelsea  
When I go I am going like Elsie  
Start by admitting  
From cradle to doom  
It isn't that long a stay  
Life is a cabaret, old chum!  
It's only a cabaret, old chum!  
And I love a cabaret!

Now have you read of the fable of Cain and Abel?  
Once they were in a scandal that shook the town.  
Cain became mighty jealous of brother Abel,  
So he rose up and smote Abel down.  
  
Now the Lord sure was hopping mad,  
And yet he was plenty sad,  
to think that he had a man like Cain.  
  
The Lord spoke and showed his wrath,  
And Cain walked the path  
That led to a life full of pain.  
  
You can't run from the shadow of retribution.  
If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs.  
Let yourself take a lesson from Cain and Able:  
  
Don't lament, be content,  
Don't resent what the Lord has sent,  
And you'll find that you're bound to get along.

Oh listen, sister  
I love my mister man and I can't tell you why  
Dere ain't no reason why I should love dat man  
It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan  
De chimbley's smokin'  
De roof is leakin' in  
But he don't seem to care  
He can be happy  
With jes' a sip of gin  
I even loves him when his kisses got gin  
  
Fish got to swim and birds got to fly  
I got to love one man till I die  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
  
Tell me he's lazy  
Tell me he's slow  
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe, I know  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
  
When he goes away  
Dat's a rainy day  
And when he comes back dat day is fine  
The sun will shine  
  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him ain't no home to me  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him ain't no home to me  
Can't help lovin' that man the way I do,  
Oh Can't help lovin' that man of mine

De  
Com  
  
C'est si bon  
Lovers say that in France  
When they thrill to romance  
It means that it's so good  
  
C'est Si Bon  
So I say to you  
Like the French people do  
Because it's oh so good.  
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,  
Leads to only one thought  
And the thought is this, dear!  
  
C'est Si Bon  
Nothing else can replace  
Just your slyest embrace  
And if you only would  
Be my own for the rest of my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling, my darling  
C'est si bon!

Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to climb a mountain  
And reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Oh I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
Now Mamma Dance with me  
I want my arm(s) about you  
That (Those) charm(s) about you  
Will carry me through...  
  
(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)  
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip  
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip  
Tonight, while the moon is bright  
  
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys  
To give the Groanies of the boys and girls  
So dig, Santa comes on big  
  
He'll come a-callin' when the snow's the most  
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast  
And you gonna flip when old Saint Nick  
Takes a lick on the peppermint stick

And fill the stocking by the fire place  
So you'll have a yule that's cool

When your money's gone  
Friends have turned you down  
And you wander 'round  
Just like a hound  
(A lonesome houn')  
Then you stop to say  
"Let me go away from this old town  
(This awful town)  
There's a place I know  
Folks won't pass me by  
Dallas, Texas, that's the town  
I cry  
(Oh, hear me cry)  
And I'm going back  
Going back to stay there 'til I die  
(Until I die)  
I've got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
(It's buzzin' 'round)  
I've got the Dallas blues  
And the Main Street heart disease  
(It's buzzin' 'round)  
Buzzin' 'round my head  
Like a swarm of little honey bees  
(Of honey bees)  
When I got up north  
Clothes I had to spare  
Sold 'em all to pay my railroad fare  
(My railroad fare)  
Just to come back there  
Ridin' in a Pullman parlor chair  
(A parlor chair)  
Sent a telegram, this is what I said  
"Baby, bring a cold towel for my head

Rambled all around... in and out of town

His feet was in the market place... his head was in the street

Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words of everyone you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal  
How I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other's arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream  
Mama, it's over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words of others you've heard  
Mama, I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart, yes, the words in my heart reveal  
How I feel about  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other's arms may hold a thrill  
Please do nothing till you hear it from me  
Mama, you never will

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
And miss it each night and day  
I know I'm not wrong this feeling's gettin' stronger  
The longer, I stay away  
Miss them moss covered vines the tall sugar pines  
Where mockin' birds used to sing  
And I'd like to see that lazy Mississippi hurryin' into spring  
  
The moonlight on the bayou a creole tune that fills the air  
I dream about magnolias in bloom and I'm wishin' I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When that's where you left your heart  
And there's one thing more I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans  
  
The moonlight on the bayou a creole tune that fills the air  
I dream about magnolias in bloom and I'm wishin' I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When that's where you left your heart  
And there's one thing more I miss the one I care for  
More more than I miss New Orleans

Wildcat Kelley, looking mighty pale  
Was standing by the Sheriff's side  
And when the Sheriff said, "I'm sending you to jail  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but I ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the Western skies  
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till I see the mountains rise  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences  
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses  
Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
  
Wildcat Kelley, back again in town  
Was sitting by his sweetheart's side  
And when his sweetheart said, "Come on, let's settle down"  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
Don't fence me in  
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love  
Don't fence me in  
  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze

Don't fence me in

Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Though I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for?  
Awf'lly diff'rent without you  
Don't get around much anymore

Stars shining bright above you.  
Night breezes seem to whisper, 'I love you,'  
Birds singing in the sycamore tree.  
Dream a little dream of me.  
  
Say nighty-night and kiss me.  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.  
While I'm alone and blue as can be,  
Dream a little dream of me.  
  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear,  
Still craving your kiss.  
I'm longing to linger 'till dawn, dear,  
Just saying this:  
  
Sweet dreams 'till sunbeams find you,  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.  
But in your dreams, whatever they be.  
Dream a little dream of me.

I'll take the legs from some old table  
I'll take the arms from some old chair  
I'll take the neck from some old bottle  
  
And from a horse I'll take the hair  
I'll take the hands and face from some old clock  
And baby when I'm through  
I'll get more loving from the dumb-dumb-dummy  
Than I ever got from you  
Get me some legs get me a chair  
And a bottle, too  
Give a horse give me some time  
And baby when I'm through  
  
I'll take the legs from some old table  
I'll take the arms from some old chair  
I'll take the neck from some old bottle  
  
And from a horse I'll take the hair  
I'll take the hands and face from some old clock  
And baby when I'm through  
I'll get more loving from the dumb-dumb-dummy  
Than I ever got from you  
I get more loving from the dumb-dumb-dummy  
Than I ever got from you  
Yeah Mama get more loving  
From a dummy than I get from you

I used to have a perfect sweetheart  
Not a real one, just a dream  
A wonderful vision of us as a team  
Can you imagine how I feel now  
Love is real now, it's ideal  
You're just what I wanted  
And now it's nice to live  
Paradise to live  
  
I know why I've waited  
Know why I've been blue  
Prayed each night for someone  
Exactly like you  
  
Why should we spend money  
On a show or two  
No one does those love scenes  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I want to hand the world to you  
I hope you'll understand  
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'  
And dream I'm dreamin'  
  
Now I know why mother  
Taught me to be true  
She meant me for someone  
Exactly like you

Georgia  
Georgia  
The whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
I said now, Georgia  
Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear  
As moonlight through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
I said, Georgia  
Georgia  
No peace I find  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Now ya know it's, Georgia  
Georgia, no peace, no peace I find  
Just this old, sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Just this old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind

He's lazy, but he's lovable, we know him like a book  
Anytime he can't be found, we know just where to look:  
  
Gone fishin', there's a sign upon his door  
Gone fishin', he ain't workin' anymore  
There's his hoe out in the sun where he left a row half done  
He said "hoein' ain't no fun", he ain't got no ambition  
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool  
I'm wishin' I could be that kinda fool  
I'd say no more work for mine on my door I'd hang a sign  
Gone fishin' Instead of just a wishin'  
  
Gone fishin'. . .see him snoozin' by a brook  
Gone fishin'. . .didn't even bait his hook  
There's his hound dog by his side fleas are bitin' at his hide  
He won't scratch 'em he's to tired he ain't got no ambition  
Gone fishin'. . .learnin' fishin' worms to swim  
I'm wishin. . .he wuz me and I wuz him  
Wish I had a plane to fly here's what I'd write in the sky  
Gone' fishin'. . .instead of jest awishin'  
  
Gone fishin'. . . he don't worry 'bout no wars  
Gone fishin'. . .left his wife to do the chores  
Cows need milkin' in the barn but he jest don't give a darn  
See his fishin' pole is gone he's on a secret mission  
Gone fishin'. . .out where peace has never died  
I'm wishin'. . .all the world was by his side  
Then our guns we'd throw away grab a fishin' pole and say  

Got a bran' new suit  
Got a bran' new tie  
Got a bran' new twinkle in my eye  
Do you know the reason why?  
  
Got a bran' new girl  
An' I won't dispute  
She's the reason why I got a bran' new tie  
An' a bran' new suit  
  
When I'm with her  
Gotta look my best  
Put on my tan shoes  
Gray spats, double breasted vest  
  
Gonna wear my stickpin, a Tecla Pearl  
With a bran' new tie  
An' a bran' new suit  
A bran' new girl

A man wants to work for his pay  
A man wants a place in the sun  
A man wants a gal proud to say  
That she'll become his lovin' wife  
He wants a chance to give his kids a better life, yes  
Well hello, hello, hello brother  
  
You can travel all around the world and back  
You can fly or sail or ride a railroad track  
But no matter where you go you're gonna find  
That people have the same things on their minds

So take her wrap, fellas  
Find her an empty lap, fellas  
Dolly'll never go away again

Here is my heart for Christmas  
Take it with love and a kiss  
I can't give you anymore than this  
  
Here is my heart for Christmas  
Sent with devotion to you  
All wrapped up in mistletoe for two  
  
(?) in the season for giving  
And send you all my reason for living  
  
Here is my heart, yes, for Christmas  
And may I ask in return  
Won't you fill my holiday with (?)  
And let me love you each and every day, each year?

Hello central, what's the matter with this line?  
I wanna talk to that high brown of mine  
Tell me how long will I have to wait  
Please give me two ninety eight, why do you hesitate?  
  
Oh, what you say, can't talk to my brown?  
A storm last night blowed the wires all down  
Now, tell me how long will I have to wait  
Oh, won't you tell me now, why do you hesitate?  
  
Say, Sunday night, my beau proposed to me  
Said, he'd be happy if his wife I'd be  
Said he, "How long, baby, will I have to wait?"  
Come be my wife, my Kate, why do you hesitate?  
  
Say, I declined him, it was just for a stall  
He left that night on the cannonball  
Honey, oh honey, how long, will I have to wait?  
Oh, won't you tell me now, baby, why do you hesitate?

Hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But don't pass the plate folks  
Don't pass the cup  
I figure whenever you're down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And I'll be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Don't thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out world  
Here I come  
  
Yes, hey look me over  
Lend me an ear  
Fresh out of clover  
Mortgage up to here  
But don't pass the plate folks  
Don't pass the cup  
I figure whenever you're down and out  
The only way is up  
  
And I'll be up like a rose bud  
High on the vine  
Don't thumb your nose  
But take a tip from mine  
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room  
But let me get me some  
And look out, world  
Here, I, come...

Just dig that scenery floating by,  
We're now approaching Newport, Rhode I.  
We've been, for years, In Variety,  
But, Cholly Knickerbocker, now we're going to be  
  
In High, High So-  
High So-ci-,  
High So-ci-ety.  
  
I want to play for my former pal-  
He runs the local jazz festival.  
His name is Dexter and he's good news,  
But sumping kind of tells me that he's nursing the blues  
  
In High, High So-,  
High So-ci-,  
High So-ci-ety.  
  
He's got the blues 'cause his wife, alas,  
Thought writing songs was beneath his class,  
But writing songs he'd not stop, of course,  
And so she flew to Vegas for a quickie divorce  
  
In High, High So-,  
High So-ci-,  
High So-ci-ety.  
  
To make him sadder, his former wife  
begins tomorrow a brand-new life.  
She started lately a new affair  
And now the silly chick is gonna marry a square  
  
In High So-,  
High So-ci-,  
High So-ci-ety.  
  
But, Brother Dexter, just trust your Satch,  
To stop that wedding and kill that match.  
I'll toot my trumpet to start the fun,  
And play in such a way that she'll come back to you, son,  
  
In High, High So-  
High So-ci-,  
High So-ci-ety.

Oh, your eyes of blue  
Your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
  
Yes, you're telling everyone I know  
I'm on your mind each time you go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me, oh yeah  
  
Oh baby, I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe you're in love with me

Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.  
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.  
My luck is changing, it's gotten from  
simply rotten to something worse  
Who knows, some day I will win too.  
I'll begin to reach my prime.  
  
Now though I see what our end is,  
All I can spend is just my time.  
  
I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.  
  
Dream awhile, scheme awhile  
We're sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.  
  
Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.  
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.  
But I am willing to wait, dear,  
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.  
  
You have a lifetime before you.  
I'll adore you, come what may.  
  
Please don't be blue for the present,  
When it's so pleasant to hear you say  
  
I can't give you anything but love, baby.  
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.  
  
Dream awhile, scheme awhile  
We're sure to find  
  
Happiness and I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
  
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.  
  
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.

When we are dancing  
And you're dangerously near me  
I get ideas, I get ideas  
I want to hold you  
So much closer than I dare do  
I want to scold you  
'Cause I care more than I care to  
  
And when you touch me  
And there's fire in every finger  
I get ideas, yes, I get ideas  
And after we have kissed goodnight  
And still you linger  
I kinda think you get ideas too  
  
Your eyes are always saying  
The things you're never saying  
I only hope they're saying  
That you could love me too  
For that's the whole idea, it's true  
The lovely idea  
That I'm falling in love with you

Never treat me sweet and gentle  
The way she should  
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
And it's not made of wood  
Now, I got it bad and that ain't good  
  
When the weekend's over  
And Monday rolls around  
I end up like start out  
Just crying my heart out  
  
She don't love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
  
Now when the weekend's over  
Monday rolls around  
I end up like I start out  
Just crying  
  
Oh, she don't love me like I love her  
Nobody could  
I got it bad and it sure is good

Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home  
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart  
I get some consolation when I read  
Of someone elses lonely heart, yes  
I wonder if you get the papers too  
And if you feel as melancholy as I do  
Until you're in my arms again, never more to roam  
I guess I'll get the papers and go home, yes  
  
I guess I'll get the papers and go home  
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart  
Yes, I get some consolation when I read  
Of someone elses lonely heart  
Mm, I wonder if you get the papers too  
And if you feel as melancholy as I do  
Baby, till you're in my arms again, never more to roam  
I guess I'll get the papers and go home  
Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home

The loveliness of Paris  
Seems somehow sadly gay  
The glory that was Rome  
Is just another day  
I've been terribly alone  
And forgotten in Manhattan  
I'm going home  
To my city by the bay  
  
[Chorus:]  
I left my heart in San Francisco  
High on a hill it calls to me  
To be where little cable cars  
Climb halfway to the stars  
The morning fog may  
Chill the air, I don't care  
  
My love waits there in San Francisco  
Above the blue and windy sea  
When I come home to you, San Francisco  
Your golden sun will shine for me

Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
The moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
  
Maybe millions of people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
And I only have eyes for you  
  
Yeah, are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
Babe, the moon may be high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
'Cause I only have eyes for you  
  
Oh, baby, I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here, so am I  
  
Maybe a million people go by  
But they all disappear from view  
Yes, mama, I only have eyes for you

I still get jealous  
When they look at you  
I may not show it  
But I do  
  
It's more than I can bear  
When they start to stare  
'Cause they think you're  
Too good to be true  
  
I still get jealous  
When we kiss goodnight  
Unless you hold me  
Extra tight  
  
And, dear, I know a secret  
You didn't know I knew  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you  
  
And, dear, I know a secret  
You didn't know I knew  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you  
  
Maamaa  
Dear dolly, I know a secret  
You didn't know, I knew  
I still get jealous, honey  
Very jealous, ja ja ja  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you.

Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love  
Kept my lips from saying  
Things I was thinking of.  
But now my pride you've humbled,  
I've cast it to the winds,  
Broken, beaten, sick at heart  
My confession begins.  
  
We've played the game of stay away  
But it cost more that I can pay.  
Without you I can't make my way,  
I surrender, dear.  
  
I may seem proud, I may act gay,  
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,  
'Cause deep down in my heart I say  
I surrender, dear.  
  
Little mean things we were doing  
Must have been part of the game,  
Lending a spice to the wooing,  
But I don't care who's to blame.  
When stars appear and shadows fall,  
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,  
To you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender, dear.

To you my love, my life, my all

All by myself alone at home a feeling blue  
Thoughts keep roaming through my mind, they're all of you  
I wonder if you're dancing, with somebody new  
I wonder, I wonder can't help it if I wonder  
No matter which side of the pillow that I'm sleeping on  
My dreams of you continue through until the dawn  
And after that I find the day dream crew comes on  
I wonder, I wonder, can't help it if I wonder  
You care for someone else, I see  
Well, then it's quite alright with me  
I'm gonna get me dressed up in my Sunday suit  
And find myself somebody who is twice as cute  
And when you realize that you and I are through  
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what you'll do  
  
All by myself alone at home a feeling blue  
Thoughts keep roaming through my mind, they're all of you

And find myself somebody who is twice as cute  
And when you realize that you and I are through  
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what you'll do  

I'll never be the same  
Stars have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king  
But king can be wrong, yes  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
'Cause there's such a lot a smile can hide  
I know down deep inside  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again  
  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king  
But kings can be wrong, oh yes  
  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
Never be the same  
Since we're apart  
  
Though there's such a lot a smile can hide  
I know down deep inside, yes  
I'll never be the same  
Never be the same again

I'll string along, string along  
String along with you, dear  
I'll string along, string along  
String along with you, dear  
  
You may not be an angel  
'Cause angels are so few  
But until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you  
  
I'm looking for an angel  
To sing my love song to  
And until the day that one comes along  
I'll sing my song to you  
  
For every little fault that you have  
Say I've got three or four  
The human little faults you do have  
Just make me love you more  
  
You may not be an angel  
But still I'm sure you'll do  
So until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you  
  
You may not be an angel  
'Cause angels are so few  
But until the day that one comes along  
I'll string along with you, say  
  
I'm looking for an angel  
To sing my love song to  
And until the day that one comes along  
Yes, I'll string along with you  
  
For every little fault that she has  
Say I've got three or four, maybe more  
The little human faults she does have  
Just make me love you more  
  
You may not be an angel  
But still I'm sure you'll do, oh yeah, yes  
So until the day that one comes along  
Yes, I'll string along with you  
  
Until he finds an angel  
I'll string, string along with you  
String along

I reckon you all don't know me at all  
I just got here today  
My home is way down in a little town  
It's not so far away  
Everybody for miles around  
Calls me by my name  
Now that I am in your fair town  
You must do the same  
For I'm a  
  
Ding dong daddy from Dumas  
You ought to see me do my stuff

What good is melody, what good is music  
If it ain't possessin' something sweet?  
Nah, it ain't the melody and it ain't the music  
There's something else that makes this tune complete  
  
Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing  
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing  
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot

Kiss me once...and kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
It's been a long, long time  
Haven't felt like this, my dear  
Since i can't remember when  
It's been a long, long time  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I've dreamed about you  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you  
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again  
It's been a long, long time

And realize you care a little bit  
It's wonderful to know that you love me, babe  
  
It's glorious to feel that  
I'm a part of you, sweetheart  
To share your happiness  
It's marvelous how lovely love can be  
  
Who dreamed that I'd be allowed  
Through the doorway of Heaven  
I'm drifting high on a cloud  
You're an angel and this is Heaven, mama  
  
It's wonderful to have  
Your lips divine combined with mine  
And dream forever more  
It's wonderful to know that you love me  
Oh, babe, you love me too

Treat me sweet and gentle when you say, 'Goodnight'  
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me  
I get sentimental when you hold me tight  
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me  
  
Missing you since you went away  
Singin' the blues away each day  
Counting the nights and waiting for you  
  
I'm in the mood to let you know  
I never knew I loved you so  
Please say, you love me too  
  
When I get this feeling I'm in ecstasy  
So squeeze me but please, don't tease me  
Yes, squeeze me, mama, don't tease me, no, no  
Oh, squeeze me, mama, please don't tease me  
  
When I get this feeling I'm in ecstasy  
So squeeze me, mama, please don't tease me

Hold me close and hold me fast  
This magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose.  
  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be la vie en rose.

Up a lazy river by the old mill stream  
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream  
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree  
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along  
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now  
Up a lazy river with me  
  
(instrumental break)  
  
Up a lazy river by the old mill run  
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun  
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree  
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robin's song  
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along  
There are blue skies up above...and as long as we're in love  
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be  
If you go up a lazy river with me  
Ah said with me now.....goin'up that... lazy river..... with me

Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun....how you spect to get your day's work done?  
You can't get your day's work done......sleepin' in the noon day sun  
Lazybones, layin' in the shade....how you gonna get your cornmeal made?  
  
You can't get no cornmeal made....sleepin' in that evening shade  
When taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin'  
The bugs'll fall off of the vine  
  
And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin'  
Them fish don't grab your line  
Lazybones, loafin' all the day.....how you spect to make a dime that way?  
You won't make no dime that way.....loafin' in the shade all day

Sometimes I feel so weary  
Traveling through life all alone

Traveling through life all alone  
  
It's a long, long journey  
And I can't make it on my own  
  
There's seven million people  
Living right here in this town  
There's seven million people  
Living right here in this town

And the moon shines bright all day  
When the sun turns blue

When I hear the radio playin' "I Love You So"  
That's the time, you know, I start to feel like ten below.  
I'm lyin' to myself,  
  
Tryin' to chase the blues away.  
Just because of foolish pride I tried to hide  
All feeling's for Cupid's art.  
And though I've cried out loud that two's a crowd  
  
That don't convince my heart.  
When I think of my sweet pet and the places we met  
I tell myself I'm not a doggone bit upset  
But I'm lyin' to myself,  
Tryin' to chase the blues away.

Another bride, another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, another reason  
For makin' whoopie  
  
A lot of shoes, lot of rice  
The groom is nervous, he answers twice  
It's really killin' that he's so willin'  
To makin' whoopie  
  
Now picture a little love nest  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture the same sweet love nest  
Think what a year can bring  
  
Yes, he's washing dishes and baby clothes  
He's so ambitious, he even sews

Another year, maybe less  
What's this I hear, well, can you guess?  
She feels neglected and he's suspected  
Of makin' whoopie  
  
Yes, she sits alone most every night  
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write  
He says he's busy but she says, "Is he?"  
He's makin' whoopie  
  
Now he doesn't make much money  
Only five thousand per  
Some judge who thinks he's funny  
Says you'll pay six to her  
  
He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"  
The judge says, "Budge right into jail"  
You'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper  
Than makin' whoopie  
  
Yes, yeah, you'd better keep her, I think it's cheaper  
Than makin' whoopie

And you appear in all your splendor  
My one and only love  
  
The shadow's fall and spreads their mystique charms  
In the hush of night while you're in my arms  
I feel your lips, so warm and tender, yes  
My one and only love  
  
The touch of your hand is like heaven  
A heaven that I've never known  
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak  
Tell me that you in are my own, baby  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender, baby  
My one and only love  
  
Baby, you fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender, baby  
My one and only love, yes  
My one and, my only love

Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
And sometimes I'm down  
Yes, Lord, you know sometimes I'm almost to the ground  
Oh, yes, Lord, still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
If you get there before I do  
Oh, yes, Lord, don't forget to  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too  
Oh, yes, Lord, still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
Although you see me  
Goin' on so, oh, yes  
I have my trials here below  
Oh, yes, Lord

Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worries on the doorstep  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
Can't you hear the pitter-pat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be complete  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid... This rover's crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade  
Now I'm not afraid... This rover has crossed over  
  
Now if I never made one cent  
I'll still be rich as Rockefeller  
There will be gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny  
On the sunny, sunny side of the street

Only you  
Can make this world seem right  
Only you  
Can make the darkness bright  
Only you and you alone  
Can thrill me like you do  
And fill my heart with love for only you  
Baby, only you  
Can make this change in me  
For it's true  
You're my destiny  
And when you hold my hand, I understand  
The magic that you do  
You're my dream come true  
My one and only you  
  
Oh, only you  
Can make this change in me  
Baby, it's so true  
You are my destiny  
When you hold my hand, I understand  
The magic that you do  
Baby, you're my dream come true and my one and only you

Cause ma baby, he done lef' this town.  
Feelin' tomorrow lak ah feel today,  
Feel tomorrow lak ah feel today,

Saint Louis woman wid her diamon' rings  
Pulls dat man 'roun' by her apron strings.  
'Twant for powder an' for store-bought hair,  
De man ah love would not gone nowhere, nowhere.  
Got de Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be.

Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. Doggone it!  
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie,  
Lak a Kentucky Col'nel loves his mint an' rye.  
I'll love ma baby till the day ah die.  
  
Been to de gypsy to get ma fortune tole,  
To de gypsy, done got ma fortune tole,  
Cause I'm most wile 'bout ma Jelly Roll.  
Gypsy done tole me,

It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square  
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there  
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red  
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said  
  
I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there  
She was stretched out on a long white table,  
So cool, so sweet and so fair  
  
Let her go, let her go, God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this whole wide world over  
Never find a sweeter man as me  
  
When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat  
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain  
The gang'll know I died standing pat  
  
Let her go, let her go God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this wide world over  
Never find a sweeter man as me  
  
I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers  
Three pretty women to sing a song  
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon  
Raise hell as I stroll along  
  
Let her go Let her go  
God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this whole wide  
World over  
She'll never find a sweeter  
Man as me

Sometimes, I wonder why I spend  
Such lonely nights  
Oh baby, lonely nights  
  
Dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new, oh baby  
And each kiss an inspiration  
Now that, baby, you know was long ago  
  
Oh, beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
  
In my heart it will remain, baby  
My stardust melody  
Oh memory, oh memory, oh memory

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white  
And stars fell on Alabama that night  
I can't forget the glamour, your eyes held a tender light  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center, just you and me, dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center, just you and me, dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight  
Ah, stars fell on Alabama last night

Summertime....and the livin' is easy  
Fish are jumpin'...and the cotton is high  
Yo' daddy's rich...and yo' mama's good-lookin'  
So hush little baby......don't you cry  
  
One of these mornin's..you gonna rise up singin'  
You gonna spread your little wings...and you'll take to the sky  
But 'till that mornin'...there ain't nothin' gonna harm you  
With yo mama and daddy...standin' bye  
  
Now it's summertime....and the livin' is easy  
Them fish are jumpin'...and the cotton's 'bout waist high  
Yo' daddy's rich...and, ya know yo' mama's good-lookin'  
Now hush little baby......don't....you cry  
  
Summertime....  
Ah said it's summertime

Last night I started out happy  
Last night my heart was so gay  
Last night I found myself dancing  
In my favorite cabaret  
You were completely forgotten  
Just an affair of the past  
Then suddenly something happened to me  
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast  
  
I saw you last night and got that old feeling  
When you came in sight I got that old feeling  
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill  
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still  
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning  
And I knew the spark of love was still burning  
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start  
For that old feeling, is still in my heart  
  
I saw you last night and got that old feeling

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning  
And I knew the spark of love was still burning  
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start  
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

To spend one night with you  
In our old rendezvous  
And reminisce with you  
That's my desire  
  
To be where gypsies play  
Down in that ole cafe  
We'll dance till break of day  
That's my desire  
  
We'll sip a little glass of wine  
I'll gaze into your eyes divine  
I'll feel the touch of your lips  
Pressing on mine  
  
To hear you whisper low  
Just when it's time to go  
Darling, I love you, so  
That's my desire  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
To hear you whisper low  
Doggone you know it's time to go  
Darling, I love you so  
You're my desire  
  
Though you found someone new  
I'll always love you  
That's my desire

Where there is sunshine, oh that's where you are  
Where there is laughter, then you can't be far  
You're in my dreams every night  
Oh how I long to hold you tight, I need you  
I'll follow you dear from here to a star  
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far  
From now till forever I'll keep dreamin' of  
You and the sunshine of love (the sunshine of love)  
Where there is sunshine, oh that's where you are  
Where there is laughter, then you can't be far  
Yes, you're in my dreams every night  
Mmm, how I long to a-hold a-you tight  
I'll follow you dear from here to a star  
Your lips are honey but sweeter by far  
Yes now until forever I'll keep dreamin' of  
You and the sunshine of love

There must be a way to help me forget that we're through  
There must be a way to stop me from dreamin' of you  
There must be a star in the skies that isn't reflecting your eyes  
I just don't know how to disguise how much I miss you  
  
There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you  
There must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do  
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new  
Oh, there must be a way, but I can't find a way without you  
  
There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you  
Yes, there must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do  
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new  
Oh, there must be a way, but I can't find a way without you

Yes, I've got someone new,  
I've had enough of you,  
I'm tired of your lying,  
So throw it out your mind,  
You toss me around,  
Lately I've found,  
That someone else's love,  
Can be so fine.  
So bye bye my friend!  
Too bad it had to end!  
My brand new love is waiting so I'll see you now and then,  
But as,  
Of now,  
We're through,  
And how,  
So throw,  
It,  
Out,  
Your,  
Miiiiiiind  
(TRUMPET SOLO WITH CLARINET)  
So bye bye my friend!  
Too bad it had to end!  
My brand new love is waiting so I'll see you now and then.  
But as,  
Of now,  
We're through,  
And how,  
So throw,  
It,  
Out,  
Your,  
Miiiiiiiiiiiind!

Yes, a New Orleans woman  
She's alright with me  
I said New Orleans woman  
She's alright with me  
That's my hometown I'm talking about  
'Cause when she cooks  
That good old Gumbo fillet  
I'm happy as can be  
I love my baby  
I'm gonna tell you the reason why  
Let you know the secret out  
Yes I love my baby  
Well, I'm gonna tell you the reason why  
Never told you this before  
'Cause there ain't a chance for a cutout  
You've got to stay with me till the day I die  

After night, you've gone away  
There's nothing I can do  
Baby, after the night, I can't make you stay  
After you telling me you're through  
  
Now after the night, there'll be somebody new  
Loving these gone red  
Tomorrow'll be another idle day for me  
After you've gone away  
  
Now you hold your life  
Having your fun  
Oh, baby, I'll be the lonely one  
I'll be  
  
After night, you'll go your way  
Thinking you've done right  
Oh, baby, I'll be here left all alone  
Mama, after the night

Way down yonder in New Orleans  
In the land of the dreamy scenes  
There's a Garden of Eden  
You know what I mean  
  
Creole babies with flashin' eyes  
Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop  
Won't you give your lady fair a little smile?  
Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while  
  
We've got heaven right here on earth  
With those beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
  
You're gonna find heaven right here on earth  
With all them beautiful queens  
Way down yonder in New Orleans  
I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans  
It's way down yonder in New Orleans

I see trees of green, red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  
  
I see skies of blue and clouds of white  
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  
  
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people going by  
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do  
But they're really saying I love you.  
  
I hear baby's cry, and I watched them grow  
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  
And I think to myself what a wonderful world.  
Yes, I think to myself what a wonderful world.

What's new?  
How is the world treating you?  
You haven't changed a bit  
Lovely as ever I must admit  
  
Oh, what's new?  
How did that romance come through?  
We haven't met since then  
Gee, but it's nice to see you again  
  
What's new? Probably I'm boring you  
But seeing you is grand  
And you were sweet to offer your hand  
I understand, adieu  
  
Pardon my asking what's new  
Of course you couldn't know  
I haven't changed: I still love you so  
  
Oh, what's new? Probably I'm boring you  
But seeing you is grand  
And you were sweet to offer your hand  
Mama, I understand, adieu  
  
Pardon my asking what's new  
Of course you couldn't know  
I haven't changed: I still love you so

When did you leave Heaven, Heaven?  
  
When did you leave Heaven?  
How could they let you go?  
How's everything in Heaven?  
I'd like to know  
  
Why did you trade Heaven  
For all these earthly things?  
Where did you hide your halo  
And where did you lose your wings?  
  
Have they missed you?  
Can you get back in?  
If I kissed you, would it be a sin?  
  
You know he's only human  
Yes, baby you're so divine, yes  
When did you leave Heaven?  
  
Angels  
Angels

We are traveling in the footsteps  
Of those who've gone before  
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)  
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)  
  
Oh when the Saints go marching in  
When the Saints go marching in  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
And when the sun refuses to shine  
And when the sun refuses to shine  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the moon turns red with blood  
When the moon turns red with blood  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
On that hallelujah day  
On that hallelujah day  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
O when the trumpet sounds the call  
O when the trumpet sounds the call  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
Some say this world of trouble  
Is the only one we need  
But I'm waiting for that morning  
When the new world is revealed  
  
When the revelation comes  
When the revelation comes  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the rich go out and work  
When the rich go out and work  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the air is pure and clean  
When the air is pure and clean  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When we all have food to eat  
When we all have food to eat  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When our leaders learn to cry  
When our leaders learn to cry  
O Lord, I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in

When You Wish Upon A Star  
Louis Armstrong  
  
When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires  
Will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dreams  
No request is to extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
As sweet fullfillment of their secret drowns  
Like a boat out of the blue  
Fate steps in and see's you through  
  
Moma when you wished upon a star  
Your dreams come true  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Fate is kind

Your dreams come true  
When you wished upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Your dreams come true

Whispering while you cuddle near me  
Whispering so no one can hear me  
Each little whisper seems to cheer me  
I know it's true dear... There's no one but you  
I'm a singin?  
Whispering why you'll never leave me  
Whispering why you'll never grieve me  
Whisper and say that you believe me  
Whispering that I love you  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
Whispering while you cuddle near me  
Whispering so no one can hear me  
Each little whisper seems to cheer me  
Just whispering that I love you

I saw you strolling by your solitary  
Am I nosy? Very, very  
I'd like to be a juicy huckleberry  
What you're after is a gal  
We're both in luck, for introductions  
Are not necessary  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?  
Gee, the moon is yeller  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
Mmm, have you heard the latest song?  
Mmm, it's a very pretty strain  
Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?  
Gee, it's getting chilly  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
When you're strolling though the wheresies  
You need a whosies to lean upon  
But when you have no whosies  
To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?  
I prefer the walkies  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
My little heart is full of palpitation  
What I need is consolation  
I'd like to stage a little celebration  
In the moonlight, right away  
I'll feel all pepped if you'll accept  
My friendly invitation  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?  
Gee, the moon is yeller  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
Mmm, have you heard the latest song?  
Mmm, it's a very pretty strain  
Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?  
Gee, it's getting chilly  
Sump'n good'll come from that  
  
When you're strolling though the wheresies  
You need a whosies to lean upon  
But when you have no whosies  
To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn  
  
Mmm, would you like to take walk?  
Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?  
Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?  
I prefer the walkies  
Sump'n good'll come from that

Don't lose your head  
Then lose your guy  
You can't lose a broken heart  
  
If you ever break up  
Then try to make up  
It's tough to make a brand new start  
  
Take a walk  
Think it over  
While strolling neath the moon  
Don't say things in December  
You'll regret in June  
  
Ware your remark  
Before you speak  
Or you may be sorry soon,  
Don't be erratic  
Be diplomatic  
To keep your heart's in tune  
  
Cruel harsh words  
Often spoken  
Will upset your applecart  
So don't lose your head  
Then lose your guy  
Cause, you can't lose a broken heart  
No, you can't lose a broken heart!

You go to my head  
You linger like a haunting refrain  
And I find you spinning round  
In my brain  
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  
You go to my head  
  
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew  
And I find the very mention of you  
Like the kicker in a julep or two  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might give a thought  
To my plea, casts a spell over me  
  
Still I say to myself  
Get ahold of yourself  
Can't you see that it never can be  
You go to my head with a smile  
That makes my temperature rise  
Like a summer with a thousand Julys  
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost of a chance  
In this crazy romance  
You go to my head, you go to my head  
  
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost of a chance  
In this crazy romance  
You go to my head, you go to my head

Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses  
But all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'  
My poor heart is saggin'  
  
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart  
Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
No, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start  
I tried to shower you with love and kisses, baby  
All I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'  
My poor heart is saggin'  
  
The way you toss my heart around's, is a cryin' shame  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart  
Babe, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart  
  
The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame  
(Oh, yes)  
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same  
You only tearing all my little dreams apart  
Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart

Your cheating heart will make you weep  
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep  
But sleep won't come the whole night through  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You'll walk the floor, yes, the way I do  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
  
When tears come down like falling rain  
You'll toss around and call my name  
You'll walk the floor, yes, the way I do  
Your cheating heart will tell on you  
Yes, your cheating heart will tell on you

At words poetic, I'm so pathetic  
That I always found it best  
Instead of getting 'em off my chest  
To let 'em rest unexpressed  
  
I hate parading, serenading  
As I'll probably miss the bar  
But if this ditty is not so pretty  
At least it'll tell you how great you are  
  
You're the tops  
You're the Colosseum  
You're the top  
You're the Louvre Museum  
  
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss  
You're a Bendel bonnet  
A Shakespeare's sonnet  
You're Mickey Mouse  
  
You're the Nile  
You're the Tower of Pisa  
Mama, you're the smile  
On the Mona Lisa  
  
I'm a worthless check  
A total wreck, a flop  
But if, baby, I'm the bottom  
You're the top  
  
You're the top  
You're Mahatma Gandhi  
You're the top  
You're Napoleon Brandy  
  
You're the purple light  
Of a summer night in Spain  
You're the National Gallery  
You're Crosby's salary  
You're cellophane  
  
Mama you're sublime  
You're a turkey dinner  
Oh, you're the time of a Derby winner  
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop  
  
But if, baby, I'm the bottom  
You're the top
