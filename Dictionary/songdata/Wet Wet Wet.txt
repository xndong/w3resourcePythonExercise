Its been a year since I last saw Mary  
When she said goodbye  
She casts a spell on my intention  
That's the reason why  
I'm taking my thought from a bottle lately  
And breaking them up in my mind  
All my problems they don't look pretty  
Oh but its no surprise  
  
Well its so hard  
To take what you're given  
Well its so hard  
To give what you've got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
There's no easy way  
  
Bright lights of Memphis  
Sounds like a real good time  
But I lost my heart and my money  
Honed like cherry wine  
But I don't remember the church bells ring  
Through the day or the night  
But I kept my soul on my own  
Not without a fight  
  
Well its so hard  
To take what you're given  
Well its so hard  
To give what you've got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
There's no easy way  
  
Its been a while since I last saw Mary  
Wipe a tearful eye  
Well I remember I first saw Mary  
Saying her last goodbye  
Breaking it up from a bottle lately  
And making it up in my mind  
But all my problems, they don't look pretty  
Oh that's the bottom line  
  
Its so hard  
To take what you're given  
Well its so hard  
To give what you've got  
  
After the love goes  
Here I go  
There's no easy road

And if you open up and let me in  
Let me in  
I feel my world is changing  
It seems so far away  
It's my last chance to make it turn out right  
And if our worlds still lie together  
love will be our satellite  
That takes us round like shooting stars  
I know I'll make you mine  
By giving all my love to you  
I hope you'll understand  
What I have to give  
(What I have to give)  
What I have to give  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is open up to you  
I feel my worlds on fire  
I can see the sun come up  
I want to spread my wings and fly  
I know I'll make you mine  
By giving all my love to you  
I hope you'll understand  
What I have to give  
(What I have to give)  
What I have to give  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is spend a little time with you  
Underneath the starry sky  
I sit alone and wonder why  
Where did it all go wrong  
I know I should move on  
Is it just a dream (Is it just a dream)  
Or am I just a dreamer  
Is it just a dream  
(Is it just a dream)  
(Is it just a dream)  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah  
All I want is someone to rely on  
All I want is a love that's true  
All I want to do is spend some time with you yeah  
And if you open up and let me in  
I will begin to live again  
Just like the old moon in the sky

One, two, one, two, three, four  
Sick of leaving in the morning  
With the night you gave away, yeah  
So now I'm gonna take that all that I can get  
With those angel eyes  
You make saints do sins all the time  
Say I'm gonna stay, home and away, well well,  
When I said I?d catch you when you're falling  
Have my heart open wide  
And you who's not naive I thought  
Say I?d thought I?d mend my heart  
Oh people say I'm so automatic  
People say I'm not so systematic  
When I'm down I'm in manual, Lord  
And time on time again I walk on by  
With the look of love  
And with those angel eyes, woh woh  
You set me on fire baby  
And with those angel eyes, woh woh  
See'mon now lady  
The saddest thing I've ever seen on my TV screen  
Was a dying man who died for his dream  
The toughest thing I've ever heard  
Was that new-born scream in this naked world, yeah  
And people say that I'm so automatic  
People say I'm not so systematic  
When I'm down I'm in manual, Lord  
Been all around those edges  
But ain't never been in love  
Ain't never been in love with ya lady  
And with ya lady  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
Gonna tell the world  
I love her, baby

Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sands  
And watches the ships that go sailing  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
She's there watching for me  
And if I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her arms  
I'd go sailing  
  
It's far beyond the stars  
It's near beyond the moon  
I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea and  
Never again I'll go sailing  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
It's far beyond the stars  
It's near beyond the moon  
I know, yes I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore  
And we'll kiss just as before  
And happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And never again I'll go sailing  
  
And never again I'll go sailing  
And never again I'll go sailing, yeah

I was born by the river  
So I know where the river runs dry  
I couldn't last forever  
  
Accused just for living  
But I know that the living was right  
I couldn't last forever  
Look at me making movies  
Making living like I've never lived before  
  
And the people wanting out of the river  
Like a poor boy really should  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me I'll do for you, Yeah  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me, is blue for you  
  
There's a man who I know  
You know he's got a fist full of dirty dollars  
And I know they won't last forever  
Does he really know what people are saying  
Always feeling sure what he is there saying  
But the other's disappear he was alone  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me I'll do for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me, is blue for you  
  
I go back to the river  
Cause I know where the river runs dry  
I couldn't last forever  
Take the night making movies  
Like a villain never ever seen the night of day  
Don't you know that I can't last forever  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What you do for me I'll do for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me, is blue for you  
  
Now I can sit and stand it  
Like other people do  
What is blue for me, is kind of blue for you, Yeah  
  
Hello I'm going down  
You know I don't want to wear no pretty crown  
Help people I'm going down

City wins another fight  
To take the day into the night  
My shadows been around for too long  
Daylight understands me, the part that's not alone  
  
Hide 'n' seek they try to be discreet  
Moonlight walks with me, Sunset talks to me  
But all I want from you is a brand new sunrise  
Silently keeping what they are keeping  
  
Moon clouds are flocking, streetlamps mockin'  
Time to work it out somehow  
But the day whispers someone  
The night moves so slowly  
  
He won't take it out on his head  
night walks away with the summer  
Day gives into the fall  
  
Moonlight walks with me  
Sunset talks to me  
But all I want from you is a brand new sunrise

Here I am  
I want you to know that I understand  
What it is you're giving me  
  
I've got it all brand new  
  
Here we are  
Put up a show of hands  
But I've got the feeling that  
They don't know what they're gonna do  
  
We don't live there no more  
We've got the room on the second floor  
Oh, we don't live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I can't stand the night  
  
Think about the people in the foreign lands  
Think about the dirty money in my hands  
Think I know the reason why it doesn't work out right  
Think of all the needy with a helping hand  
Think of all the greedy people in our land  
Think they know the reason why it doesn't work out right  
  
I don't live there no more  
I've got the suite on the penthouse floor  
Oh, I don't live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I can't stand the night  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I can't stand the night  
  
I don't live there no more  
I've got the suite on the penthouse floor  
Oh, I don't live there no more  
  
See my pride  
Been looking for it once or twice  
Lost my pride  
I'm really gonna make it right  
  
I don't live there no more  
I've got no room on the penthouse floor  
Oh, I don't live there no more  
  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I can't stand the night  
Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right  
Another day with the heartache  
You know I can't stand the night

She's gonna leave me on my own again  
I guess it happens every now and then  
She closes her eyes and says goodnight  
God only knows the reason why  
We get together and we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
She spends her time so easy  
She casts the spell then leaves me  
She's on the make, she's out of touch  
My heart she breaks, much, too much  
When we're together we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
In the warmth of a winter morning  
The thorn and the kiss  
The rose in a withered garden  
Then true love lies like this  
  
She makes it look so easy  
Her sugar smile deceives me  
She closes her eyes and says goodnight  
God only knows the reason why  
We get together and we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
I hope that you're happy now  
You can forgive me  
I know I'll be happy in your heart

Let love shine  
  
Gotta gotta know  
I see the sun in your eyes  
Let me take your hand  
And we'll go to wonderland  
I bet you've asked silly questions  
Like do I still love you  
Better believe it, honey  
  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
  
They all went mad  
On the way out west, hells bells baby  
But you can bet your bottom dollar  
That my arch full flame  
May win you over, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back c'mon now baby  
I'm the lie that tells the truth  
  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
'Cause you're the girl from the east of the river  
  
Where the grass is always greener  
And the pavements  
Are all paved with gold  
Please please don't be told  
C'mon I said east of the river  
  
I don't want to work for nobody but you  
  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river  
You're the girl from the east of the river

And I heard a story all about you  
That you never started  
And maybe I can learn to give my cheek another turn  
And so I'll drink your point of view  
Blur my vision my feelings too  
Sometimes I don't see, what your giving means to me  
  
She's acting strangely,  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
She's got a broken heart,  
She's good at playing the part  
I've been tricked again,  
I've been a fool for your love  
  
And every time I've got it made,  
You come and burn it all down, down  
It's always something that I said, hey hey hey  
And don't say a word, don't say anything  
Don't even make a sound  
And hear the rumors scream and shout, yeah  
  
She's acting strangely,  
And says her whole world is starting to turn  
She's got a broken heart, she's good at playing the part  
I've been tricked again, I've been a fool for your love  
  
I remember the time when I first met her  
Since that night I've been trying to hold it together, together  
  
And I heard a story all about you,  
You come and burn it all down, down  
Don't say anything  
And hear the rumors scream and shout, yeah  
  
And I'm acting crazy, 'cause my whole world has started to turn  
I got a broken heart,  
And I stand at playing the part  
I've been tricked again, I'm still a fool for your love

You can hear me so clearly  
And see how I try  
You feel me, so heal me  
And tear me apart  
  
I won't tell a soul  
I won't tell at all  
Do they have to know  
About my goodnight girl  
  
Caught up in your wishin' well  
You hopes inside it  
Take your love and promises  
And make them last  
  
You keep me so near you  
And see me so far  
And hold me and send me  
And deep in your heart  
  
It doesn't matter how sad  
I made you  
Doesn't matter how hard  
I try  
  
Just remember the same  
Old reason  
Reflected in your eyes  
You said you wanted me  
  
Caught up in your wishin' well  
Your hopes inside it  
Take your love and promises  
And make them last

Ten years before my time  
I sang a song to a friend of mine  
Bout a girl working for a dime  
  
Although I didn't know that gypsy girl  
But knew about her kind of thrill  
Her loves not cheap but always up for sale  
  
Picture this, I was alone  
But when I sing this song  
I'm not alone  
With my gypsy girl  
  
Gypsy lady lost her soul  
Shes so scared of growing old  
But words don't age for me to turn to gold  
  
Gypsy girl with raven hair  
Eyes like saucers, with a stare  
That says shes the one that never seems to care  
  
Picture this, I was alone  
But when I sing this song  
I'm not alone  
With my gypsy girl  
  
Gypsy girl plays it fair  
Throws her hand in the air  
Saying that she didn't really care

Stop your pretending  
Listen to what I've got to say  
How your head's went away  
Only here for a day  
And that grave I just made  
Is for me when I get paid  
  
Won't you wait a while  
Move to the blue  
Sometimes people don't want to say  
Old time dancers don't die that way  
See that grave I've just made  
It's for me when I get paid  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
Do you love and surrender  
Sometimes I don't feel I can remember  
I think it's fair to mention  
About the days when I get paid  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
I want a little loving  
I told you all to listen  
But you never liked what you heard  
I take what I am given  
This may sound absurd  
I share a double vision  
That started the transition  
  
Hey where's Jimmy Jazz  
Steady on the scale  
  
I told you to listen  
I told you all to listen  
  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
Somebody's gotta hold back the river  
Somebody like you  
  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
You know that somebody  
But it ain't you

If this is paradise  
Then I don't recognize  
That subtle look that's in your eyes  
And in the distance now  
I hear your whispers, love  
And see my dreams go fading by, by  
  
Take me away  
From this moment  
  
I wanna shut the door  
I'm not taking anymore  
It's me they want to give away  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
  
A love so precious now,  
Lights me up inside  
My darkest night could never hide  
Elegant and divine  
She wears a diamond smile  
The girl's perfection guaranteed  
  
Don't take away  
This moment from me  
  
I wanna hold her close  
It's her I want the most  
Don't want to let her slip away.  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home  
Tonight  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
And I don't want to know

Hey there Mr. Taxi Driver  
Take me to the station  
I've been around for too long  
  
You said I lack understanding  
That I don't know right from wrong  
But oh no  
  
There's a road that a man has to take  
There's a road and it's filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby! Don't misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of love's imagination  
  
Senorita plays for the people who bother  
Outside those old department stores  
She's singing out loud for no reason  
About a traveling man she's been hanging around  
But oh no  
  
There's a road that a man has to take  
There's a road and it's filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby, Don't you misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of loves imagination  
  
So I should beg for some forgiveness  
Borrowed time  
'Cause someone else can wait that long again  
If only you'll be leavin'  
Tell me just  
How long

I should've known better, c'mon  
I should've known better, c'mon  
How l long for those warm summer nights  
Of playing the fool and getting uptight  
Crush my precious wish to the ground  
You are the sunshine taste of forgive and forget  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind, my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Looking back at what we had  
Say I still want you so much  
Say I was loving you for just one reason  
Loving you for just one season  
You're required for desire  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind, my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember  
Oh I remember  
  
Say I was, say I was, loving you, loving you, loving you  
Loving you, loving you, loving you  
Please, oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
Please, oh please help me  
Please, oh please help me  
Please, oh please help me  
  
And I try to act naturally

Close your eyes, free your mind  
Stay with me tonight  
Lay me down, hold me tight  
Say your mine tonight  
With all my heart  
  
Girl I want you  
Don't keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart (in my heart)  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
  
Broken hearts, distant love  
They don't go too far  
You know you gotta hold my hand  
Show me all the wonders of our love  
Way deep inside  
With all my heart  
  
Girl I want you  
Don't keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart (in my heart)  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
Whoa  
  
Girl I want you  
Don't keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart (in my heart)  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
  
Girl I want you  
Don't keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart, well  
Loves just enough to make it evermore

Come on up, hey little darling  
  
That was the way when I first met you baby  
You weren't right for me  
I didn't really care  
Act quite naturally  
  
She said  
Went on a boat going down by the river  
Plenty more supplies  
Seen a lot of planes going up in the air  
  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That you want to fly like a bird in the sky  
  
Hey Lucille, you'll be the talk of the town  
Lucille hey, you'll be the talk of the town  
She met a young man called Johnnie  
He played a little mean guitar  
  
No matter how hard I try  
I want to fly like a bird in the sky  
I want to fly like a bird in the sky  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Living the night, doing it wrong  
  
It's a little lonely without you  
The feeling was strong  
The world was holding on  
I want to be on my own  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Won't you stay with me  
  
Take from me what I take form you  
You can take from me what I find in you  
  
Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
Hey, I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Say I can't get by without your love  
Say I can't get by without your love  
  
Say I can't get by without your love  
Say I can't get by without your love  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard

The morning light comes stealing  
To start a new day  
Out there the world is waiting  
To take us far away  
And it's time to make  
The final break  
But the memory will linger forever  
  
If I never see you again  
And think of me now and then  
Though it hurts so sweetly  
They say all good things come to an end  
You've changed my life completely  
I'm touched by your love  
Even if I never see you again  
  
The night is so unforgiving, yeah  
And I'm on my own  
I realize what I'm missing  
And now that you've gone  
So I say a prayer  
Are you out there  
Are you feeling what I'm feeling now, yeah  
  
If I never see you again  
And think of me now and then  
Though it hurts so deeply  
They say all good things come to an end  
You've changed my life completely  
I'm touched by your love  
Even if I never see you  
If I never see you again  
  
And if I never see you again  
  
No one can tell you how the story ends  
Where the road will lead  
When love begins, yeah  
  
You've changed my life completely  
I'm touched by your love  
Even if I never see you  
If I never see you  
Even if I never see you again  
And If I never see you

And outside the wind is blowing  
Through the thoughts in my mind  
Thinking a feeling is growing  
But inside my heart I'm alone  
I have a heart, a heart for a woman  
I have a promise, of this I will swear  
And I have a love that wont be forgotten  
I have a life that's going nowhere  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And only if you wanted to  
If only I could be with you  
  
I hear the wind whisper your name  
Taking my thoughts again far away  
Im dreaming of living a life full of love  
And you out there, calling my name, saying  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And hoping that you feel it too  
If only I could be with you  
  
I walk the streets so all alone,  
Holding hands with a distant past  
And how longs it gonna last, could it be forever  
She cant hear me, she cant hear me  
If only (only)  
If only I could be with you  
  
Just a little time with you, yeah  
  
I just wanna be with you  
Hold you like I used to do, time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and give my soul to you  
And only if you wanted to  
If only I could be with you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Time after time, yeah  
Give my heart and soul to you  
And hoping that you feel it too  
If only I could be with you

Take your time  
Take it easy  
Keep my little promise  
In your mind  
Making out  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before  
  
Lonely nights  
Soft soap story  
Playing in the bedroom  
Of your mind  
Acting up  
I tried to make it happen  
Just another extra  
In your life  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before  
  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
It hurts to say it's over  
It's sad to say it's gone  
It doesn't really matter  
Who's right or wrong  
When all is said and done  
  
A love like this I wasn't looking for  
I've never known a girl like you before, well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Making eyes  
Make it easy  
For all the broken pieces  
Of my heart  
Trying hard  
I nearly made it happen  
Playing out the bedroom of your life  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It hurts, yes it does, to say it's over  
It is over  
It's sad, it's so sad, to say it's gone, gone, gone  
It hurts, oh it hurts, to say it's over  
Yes it hurts  
It's sad to say it's gone, gone, gone  
It hurts, yes it hurts, to say it's over  
Baby it's over  
It's sad, so sad, to say it's gone, gone, gone

And here I go again, through the back streets of my mind,  
It seems my life was standing still,  
Who's sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how I didn't notice  
  
Here we go again, fighting things we never win,  
It seems our love was standing still  
Oh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love,  
I just hear the words,  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see  
Love hurts  
  
I won't be fooled again,  
Looking for the dream I couldn't find  
The dream for me was left behind  
Woh I'm sorry now (sorry now)  
It's funny how (funny how)  
I don't feel the love  
I just hear the words  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know what it's all about,  
She doesn't seem to care at all,  
Open your eyes and see, love hurts,  
Julia please, open your eyes and see  
  
Julia wants to be on her own,  
Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone,  
Dreaming of the things she wants to be,  
Where Julia don't belong  
  
Julia says  
She doesn't know, what it's all about  
She doesn't know,  
Julia please open your eyes see  
C'mon Julie open your eyes and see  
She don't know what it's all about  
Julia please, Julia please  
Julia, you don't care at all  
Cause I want you  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Julie, Julie, Julie

You might say  
You don't love me  
That might be right  
Say that you wanted me  
Say that you needed me  
Say that you wanted me  
  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Make this seem right  
All through the night  
I said hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
For you to make it right  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
  
So let me take a little while  
To tell you about heaven, heaven in my life  
It could be a secret  
It could be a lie  
It's a case of holding on til I die  
  
Now I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Make this seem right  
All through the night  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
For you to make it right  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
Please try just a little  
Please try and you will see  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
You gotta give a little  
To get the keys to your heart  
Gets me the keys to your heart

Ain't got enough, so I go out and get some more  
It got so bad it nearly left me lying on the floor  
I started thinking that it's wearing on my soul  
But I got to get it getting tonight  
  
Raindrops keep fallin' on my window, pain!  
They make my company  
I can hear them knocking on my door  
Now, should I let them in?  
  
When I look at the faces baby  
You see how the other side dies  
I've got to, got to, got to  
Let them come on in  
  
Your lip service getting  
Right out of order  
Better keep looking  
Or I'll blow my cover  
  
She'll get caught by big sister midnight  
I've been only telling stories  
You will only tell me lies  
  
I get the picture cause you never got my soul!  
I get it, handed back, it turns into a tray of gold  
That's just a victim of the promises you told  
I sit and count the cost of living tonight  
  
Bottle the past and number the label  
Drink to the future, girl be ready and able  
Get a grip with a new fixation  
And take them all and let them all in  
  
When I look at their faces baby  
I see how the other side dies  
I got to, got to, got to  
Let them all come in  
  
Should I let them (all come in)  
Lies

Fly, to fly like a bird,  
To heavens above,  
On the wings of love.  
Shine, to shine like the sun,  
And warm up my life,  
And make it all worthwhile, yeah  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't wanna be on my own  
I said baby maybe I'm in love  
  
Life, to have and to hold  
To cherish the love  
That we could share together  
High, as high as the moon  
The stars in the sky  
Beyond them I'd take you and i  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't wanna be on my own  
I said baby just maybe I'm in love  
  
Yeah, blow blow blow blow  
  
Yeah, all the way  
  
Fly, to fly like a bird  
To heavens above  
On the wings of love  
  
Hand in my heart, it tears me apart  
When I'm away  
When I come home  
Don't want to be all alone  
I said baby oh baby I'm in love  
With you  
  
I'm in love with you

It's the same old situation  
Same old faces, but a different town  
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide  
I'm dancing with the shadows,  
In a cold moonlight.  
  
And I can't wait until the morning  
I can't wait another minute, hour day or night,  
I can't wait until the morning,  
You know it won't feel so cold.  
  
It's 5 am, and I just got into bed  
And the heart of the city is almost gone,  
And I know what is right  
And I know what is wrong  
I'm dancing with the shadows,  
In a cold moonlight.  
  
And I can't wait until the morning  
I can't wait another minute, hour day or night,  
I can't wait until the morning,  
You know it feels so cold.  
  
Sometimes in between my dreams at night,  
I walk alone I'm going underground.  
And in the distance I can hear a crowd.  
It makes me wonder what it's all about.  
All about  
All about  
  
It's the same old consolation,  
Different faces in the same old town,  
Nowhere to run to  
Nowhere to hide,  
They're dancing with the shadows,  
In a cold moonlight  
  
And I can't wait until the morning  
I can't wait another minute, hour day or night,  
I can't wait until the morning,  
You know it feels so cold

He sits alone in a crowded station  
And lights his cigarette  
The light flickers slightly  
And tells him politely  
His life's not at it's best  
  
She weighs him up 'cause his love's taken lightly  
And love's her only regret  
But love's not a sin in her eyes  
And she's asking him why -  
"Why are you leaving"  
"I just can't say"  
"Why are you leaving"  
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it  
  
He walks home with his pride in his pocket  
And pulls it out with his change  
And his love is something and it just turned into nothing  
Now isn't that strange  
  
She holds her head high close to the bright sky  
He's got his head in the clouds  
But love's not a sin in her eyes  
And he's telling her why -  
"Why are you leaving"  
"I just can't say"  
"Why are you leaving"  
"He don't know daddy's gonna stay"  
  
Put a little light in her darkest day  
So she can see it  
Put a little love in her heart on the way  
So she can feel it

I was sitting lonely in my car  
Watching her come and go  
I could feel the strings pulling my heart  
From the old house,  
That I used to know  
Like the river that was flowing  
She was coming without knowing  
Our love's the river that somehow lost it's flow,  
Lost it's flow  
  
From my car I can see her there  
As the curtain slowly moves  
As he runs his fingers through her hair  
And the fire slowly grooves  
  
What's the answer to this pain  
I want to get back to her love again  
And there she's sitting in that room  
When she walked 'cross the street  
Could she feel there's a heat  
From my heart as it beats with her love  
In her eyes other guys  
See the fair that is there  
But she might never know  
But she might never know  
  
I was sitting lonely in my house,  
Wanting to tell her, wanting to call  
And say I know I let you down,  
Without thinking, his love might fall  
No more hurting, no more clowning,  
This emotion, isn't drowning,  
If the river's gonna save our true love after all,  
After all  
  
I'm chewing on my nails again,  
With my home across the street  
I ain't got no place to turn to now  
While you're cooking for that creep  
  
What's the answer to this pain  
I want to get back to her love again  
There she's sitting in that room  
  
When she walked 'cross the street  
Could she feel there's a heat  
From my heart as it beats with her love  
In her eyes other guys, see the fair that is there  
But she might never know  
But she might never know  
  
As I turned so she waved, this was all that she gave  
So what was there to trade in love  
Just the past that was cast, in the groove of the move  
That she might never know  
She might never know

You've been talking in your sleep again.  
About the way you've been pulling my heart strings  
When I think I'm on my feet again,  
I fall down,  
Oh I fall down  
  
At forty seven Park Avenue  
Loud is the singing down in the bar room  
So lonely  
I wish I was in paradise  
  
The broken lover in me, girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love, lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love, love I gave away  
I gave away  
  
You've been making those eyes again  
Down in the city and up in your ivory tower  
One day soon you're gonna reach out and call my name  
  
Yeah, the broken lover in me girl  
Has been fixed in my memory  
Lay your love, lay your love on me  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love, love I gave away  
Oh, I gave away  
Oh, I gave away  
  
Love's got me down on my knees again  
There's no easy, no easy way out  
There's no easy way out  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, yeah  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away,  
  
I lost a little love this way  
I find it in my heart to say, oh baby  
I'm gonna shed a tear for you today  
For love I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away  
I gave away

Give your broken heart to me  
Let me give you my soul  
For you to keep  
Just give me some words,  
To speak  
  
I'm gonna leave it down  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
I just can't wait long enough  
For someone else to take your love  
  
Let me open my heart,  
For you to see  
Let me give you my soul,  
For you to keep  
Let your love go  
Just let it go with me  
  
Have I ever let you down?  
Cause all I wanna do it be around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I can learn to live again  
And wash away the hurt inside  
  
I'm gonna leave it down,  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
Someone like you no fool can suffer

If you're there and you care  
And you listen very careful, darling  
You'll hear my prayer  
  
And if you hear, loud and clear  
You would get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere, somehow  
I'll be there  
  
Went out walkin' in the morning  
Standing in the pouring rain  
Let it run all over me  
  
Stayed up late last night  
Tryin' to put all the things right  
Then your tears roll over me  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere somehow  
I'll be there  
  
If you're there, and you care  
You'll get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if you feel like I feel  
Love cuts the deepest part of me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere, somehow  
I'll be there

Start making sense  
Of everything I've seen before, well, um  
Somewhere in my life  
Been paying the price  
But that ain't enough anymore, well  
Don't get me wrong now baby  
Don't get me wrong baby  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me  
I don't know if I'm coming or going, baby, well  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things you keep on doing  
Something's getting outta control  
  
Can't help myself  
To everything I'm looking for  
No, no, no  
Sometimes I can't explain  
Why I go insane  
It just isn't fun anymore, well  
Don't get me wrong now baby  
Don't get me wrong baby  
  
Strange, strange, strange  
Things that happen to me

Oh, but I'm still standing  
You're such a natural, sing,

To your life

Hey little fella, get your show together  
I was listening in before  
But now I don't care no more  
  
Look around now  
It's always that it's gonna get you down  
It's only begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
I recall, do you  
That sweet surrender  
  
My determination  
Came creeping across the nation  
A sure mistake for anyone  
'cause you can't take home everyone  
'cause it's only just begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
I recall, do you  
That sweet surrender  
  
I don't know, I don't care  
'cause I'm living without you baby  
Even when I know what's going on  
It only took, one look, one glance  
To set my heart for romance  
Do you believe my sweet surrender  
  
My sweet surrender  
  
Hey little fella, now your show's together  
I never wanted you to listen before  
So why should I walk out that door  
Stick around now  
And so the story goes on through the night  
It's only begun  
  
One look is all it took  
I remember that sweet surrender  
Do you recall, 'cause I do  
That sweet surrender  
  
I don't know, I don't care  
'cause I'm living without you baby  
Even when I know what's going on  
It only takes, one look, one glance  
To set my heart for romance  
One look is all it took  
My sweet surrender  
  
My sweet surrender  
One look is all it took to remember  
(I don't know and I don't care)

When the big gun starts to shooting  
With their bullets of deception

Say I find it far too tall

Weight of the world's on my shoulders  
Like I've never known before  
And the winter winds blowing colder  
And I just can't take anymore  
Feel I'm running down a dead end street  
Trying to change my direction  
All my troubles weighing hard on me  
It brings me down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
Noise in my head, getting louder  
and it's spinning me around  
something's tugging at my sleeve now,  
trying to tell me  
That I'm to high off the ground  
I can't explain it to myself  
I fear I'm gonna drown (fear I'm gonna drown)  
Standing out here in the pouring rain  
I'm going down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
So whisper words, so soft and low  
The words of love that heal  
And ease my soul  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
Only us drift away  
  
So far away  
Drifting away  
So far away  
Drifting away  
Drift away, away, away, away, away, away

He would swear by his mouth almighty  
  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
And you never told me  
  
He would dream about another scheme  
About another sordid hall of dreams  
About a man who's king of industry  
He would swear by his mouth almighty  
He would buy the best  
But never something new  
And he never told me  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
Oh, I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
It's the only life I know  
  
Lie, lie , lie is all you ever do  
To make me want to push on through  
Cry, cry, cry is all I ever do  
Say you want to make me push on through  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
Oh, I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, I was wishing I was lucky  
Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
It's the only life I know  
  
My best friend wrote and told me so  
He said, that there may be a job in the city, yeah, yeah yeah, oh baby  
I like kicking in the gutter and wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
I like kicking in the gutter, wishing I was lucky  
I was wishing I was lucky,  
Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky  
  
Hey son go, hey son go, to the city [Repeat: x4]

What would you think if I sang out of tune  
Would you stand up and walk out on me  
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song  
And I'll try not to sing out of key  
  
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh, I'll get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends, my friends  
  
What do you do when our love is away  
Does it worry you to be alone  
And how does it feel by the end of the day  
Are you sad because you're on your own  
  
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh, I'll get high with a little help from my friends

I need somebody to love  
Could it be anybody  
I need somebody to love, to love, to love  
  
Would you believe in this love at first sight  
Yes I'm certain that it happens al the time  
What do you see when you turn out the light  
I can't tell you but I know that it's mine  
  
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends  
Oh, I'll get high with a little help from my friends  
Oh I'll get by with a little help from my friends  
Do you need any body  
I need somebody to love  
Could it be anybody  
  
I need somebody to love  
Oh, I'll get by with a little help from my friends

Yesterday  
All my troubles seem so far away  
Now it looks as though they're here to stay  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
  
Suddenly  
I'm not half the man I used to be  
There's a shadow hanging over me  
Oh yesterday came suddenly  
  
Why she had to go  
I don't know she wouldn't say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
[Chorus]  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
  
Why she had to go  
I don't know she wouldn't say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
[Chorus]
