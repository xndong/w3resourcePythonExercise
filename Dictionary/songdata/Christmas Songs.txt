(John Denver, J. Henry, 1975)  
  
The season is upon us now  
A time for gifts and giving  
And as the year draws to its close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmas time when I was young,  
The magic and the wonder,  
But colors dull and candles dim,  
And dark my standing under  
  
O little Zachary, shining light  
You've set my soul to dreaming  
You've given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A Savior King was born that day,  
A baby just like you,  
And as the Magi came with gifts,  
I come with my gift too  
  
That peace on Earth fills up your time,  
That brotherhood surrounds you.  
That you may know the warmth of love,  
And wrap it all around you  
  
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told  
From days when I was young  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone  
Merry Christmas, little Zachary  
Merry Christmas, everyone

A Boy is Born in Bethlehem!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
And joy is in Jerusalem,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
And there He lay in manger poor,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Whose rein shall last for ever-more,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
The cats and dogs and all the heard,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Knew well that Boy to be the Lord!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
And kings from out the East there were,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
With gold and frankincense and myrrh  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
He lived like us in form and dress,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
Without our taint of wickedness.  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
He came our souls to purify,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
And bring us safe to bliss on high  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
  
Therefore let us with one accord,  
Allelujah! Allelujah!  
On this His Birthday praise the Lord!  
Allelujah! Allelujah!

One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol.  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time.  
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends - of whom  
I have none, that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here  
Goes.  
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas,  
With it's spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in - I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street,  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial  
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.  
  
Christmas time is here, by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and don't say when  
  
Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother, here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you can't get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
There's time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixty-four  
  
Relations, sparing no expense, 'll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
("Just the thing I need, how nice!")  
  
It doesn't matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
What's important is the price  
  
Hark, the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and - buy!  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Don't stand underneath when they fly by  
  
(Spoken)  
Actually I did rather well myself, this last Christmas.  
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
"Good at any hospital for a lobotomy"... rather thoughtful.

A day, a day of glory!  
A day that ends our woe!  
A day that tells of triumph  
Against our vanquish'd foe!  
Yield, summer's brightest sunrise,  
To this December morn:  
Life up your gates, ye Princes  
And let the Child be born!  
  
With Gloria in excelsis  
Archangels tell their mirth:  
With Kyrie eleyson  
Men answer upon the earth:  
And angels swell the triumph,  
And mortals raise the horn,  
Life up you gates, ye Princes,  
And let the Child be born.  
  
He comes, His throne the manger

The lights around the Christmas tree don't burn as bright  
And all around the world it isn't a silent night  
Outside I hear the voices sing the sweetest sounds of caroling  
But somehow there's a sadness in the song  
In our hearts we know that something's wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
In a different kind of world  
Even though it looks the same  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
  
Children opening gifts with wonder and surprise  
I wish that I could still see through such innocent eyes  
I used to feel so safe inside I had a place to run and hide  
In my daddy's arms I felt secure  
No one can protect us anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas  
  
Sending cards that talk of peace and love and cheer  
Oh that's what we need if we'd only believe  
It would be!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everything has changed  
It's a different kind of Christmas

It's a marshmallow world in the winter,  
When the snow comes to cover the ground,  
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,  
I wait for it all year round.  
  
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,  
In the arms of the evergreen trees,  
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,  
It's shining so your nose won't freeze.  
  
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,  
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,  
The world is your snowball just for a song,  
Get out and roll it along.  
  
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,  
Take a walk with your favourite girl,  
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,  
In winter, it's a marshmallow world.  
  
The world is your snowball, see how it grows,  
That's how it goes, whenever it snows,  
The world is your snowball just for a song,  
Get out and roll it along.  
  
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,  
Take a walk with your favourite girl,  
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late,  
In winter, it's a marshmallow world,  
In winter, it's a marshmallow world,  
In winter, it's a marshmallow world

All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth!  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeth,  
Then I could wish you  
"Merry Christmas."  
  
It seems so long since I could say,  
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"  
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,  
If I could only whistle  
(Thhhh, thhhh, thhhh, thhhhhh)  
  
(Repeat 2X)  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth,  
My two front teeth,  
See my two front teeth.  
  
Gee, if I could only  
Have my two front teeeeth,  
Then I could wish you,  
Yes I could wish you, oh I could  
Wish you "Merry Christmas!"

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There's just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you.  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
Oh I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You  
  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby

Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee  
All through the night  
Guardian angels God will send thee  
All through the night  
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping  
Hill and dale in slumber sleeping  
I my loving vigil keeping  
All through the night  
  
While the moon her watch is keeping  
All through the night  
While the weary world is sleeping  
All through the night  
O'er thy spirit gently stealing  
Visions of delight revealing  
Breathes a pure and holy feeling  
All through the night  
  
Though I roam a minstrel lonely  
All through the night  
My true harp shall praise sing only  
All through the night  
Love's young dream, alas, is over  
Yet my strains of love shall hover  
Near the presence of my lover  
All through the night  
  
Hark, a solemn bell is ringing  
Clear through the night  
Thou, my love, art heavenward winging  
Home through the night  
Earthly dust from off thee shaken  
Soul immortal shalt thou awaken  
With thy last dim journey taken  
Home through the night

How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!  
Carols being sung by the tree,  
Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see  
Children's eyes of sweet expectations  
  
Wondering what each present will hold  
Lying in their beds and impatient  
On long Christmas Eves of old  
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night  
It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here
one night a year  
  
How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!  
Memories that last the years  
Call me sentimental

Hark all ye shepherds, come join in our song.  
Hark all ye shepherds, for Jesus is born.  
Lo he is lying, born in a manger,  
Jesus, annointed to be our Savior. Alleluia!  
  
Hark all ye shepherds, arise from your sheep.  
Hark all ye shepherds, the Christ child asleep.  
Mary, the mother, quietly singing,  
From God to man salvation is bringing. Alleluia!  
  
Angels adore him, men bow before him, heaven and earth proclaim!  
Prophets of old his coming foretold and men ever praise his name.  
Come and adore him, Jesus our Savior,  
He dwells among us, now and forever. Alleluia!

As lately we watch'd o'er our fields thro' the night,  
A star there was seen of such glorious light.  
All thro' the night, angels did sing  
Carols so sweet of the birth of a King.  
  
A King of such beauty was ne'er before seen,  
And Mary His mother so like a queen.  
Blessed be the hour, welcome the morn,  
For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born.  
  
His throne is a manger, His court is a loft,  
But troops of bright angels, in lays sweet and soft,  
Him they proclaim, our Christ by name,  
And earth, sky and air straight are filled with his fame.  
  
Then shepherds, be joyful

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And auld lang syne?  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,  
And surely I'll be mine!  
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
We twa hae run about the braes,  
And pu'd the gowans fine

Ave Maria Gratia plena  
Maria Gratia plena  
Maria Gratia plena  
Ave, ave dominus  
Dominus tecum  
  
Benedicta tu in mulieribus  
Et benedictus

Ave Maria Mater dei  
Ora pro nobis pecatoribus

Away in a manger,  
No crib for His bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down His sweet head  
  
The stars in the bright Sky,  
Looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus  
Asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
The Baby Awakes  
But little Lord Jesus  
No crying He makes  
  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my side,  
'Til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus,  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to heaven[Hook]  
To live with Thee there

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay - Get over that old out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr it's cold...  
It's cold out there  
Can't you stay awhile longer baby  
Well... I really shouldn't... Alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ahh, do that again...

It's baby's first Christmas,  
It's somethin' to see,  
Mommy and Daddy,  
Trimmin' baby's Christmas tree.  
Baby's big brother,  
Is busy with his toys,  
He's shinin' up the chimney,  
For Santa Claus!  
  
It's baby's first Christmas,  
And oh, what a joy,  
Shopping all around,  
For every pretty toy.  
It's a very special Christmas,  
A blessing from above,  
It's baby's first Christmas,  
A Christmas full of love!  
  
It's baby's first Christmas,

Shopping all around,  
For every pretty toy.  
It's a very special Christmas,  
A blessing from above,  
It's baby's first Christmas,  
A Christmas full of love!

Children sleeping  
Snow is softly falling.  
Dreams are calling  
Like bells in the distance.  
  
We were dreamers not so long ago.  
But one by one we all had to grow up.  
  
When it seems the magic slipped away,  
We find it all again on Christmas day...  
  
Believe in what your heart is saying,  
Hear the melody that's playing.  
There's no time to waste,  
There's so much to celebrate.  
  
Believe in what you feel inside,  
And give your dreams the wings to fly.  
You have everything you need,  
If you just believe,  
  
Trains move quickly to their journey's end.  
Destinations are where we begin again.  
Ships go sailing far across the sea.  
Trusting starlight, to get where they need to be.  
  
When it seems that we have lost our way,  
We find ourselves again on Christmas day...  
  
Believe in what your heart is saying,  
Hear the melody that's playing.  
There's no time to waste,  
There's so much to celebrate.  
  
Believe in what you feel inside,  
And give your dreams the wings to fly.  
You have everything you need,  
If you just believe.  
  
If you just believe.  
If you just believe.  
If you just believe.  
Just believe.  
Ohh ohhh believe

[Verse 1]In the little village of Bethlehem  
There lay a child one day  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
O'er the place where Jesus lay.  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King.  
  
Twas a Humble birthplace  
But O  
How much God gave to us that day!  
From the manger bed what a path has led  
What a perfect holy way.  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a Holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King

The middle of December ain't the time to be alone  
It's just too close to Christmas  
And too far to go home  
I ran in to a friend of a friend  
Standing in checkout line  
She said, I've spent too much already  
And there's gifts I just can't find  
I walked her home and when she opened up her door  
I'm not sure what happened then  
Guess magic took it's course  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
'Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin' on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
  
I woke up, she was wrappin' gifts beneath the tree  
She said, I know it's early, so I thought I'd let you sleep  
Then she insisted I get up and take a look outside  
Hey sleepyhead, it must have snowed at least a foot last night  
That's when I saw it hangin' up above my head  
She threw her arms around my neck  
Laughin' as she said  
  
Blame it on the mistletoe  
'Cause what happened here nobody knows  
How could something simple as a kiss  
Change my holiday like this  
And we held each other all night long  
And we fell asleep to a Christmas song  
Playin' on the radio  
Blame it on the mistletoe

I'll have a blue christmas without you  
I'll be so blue just thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green christmas tree  
Wont be the same dear, if you're not here with me  
  
And when those blue snowflakes start falling  
That's when those blue memories start calling  
You'll be doin all right, with your christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue christmas  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
You'll be doin all right, with your christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue christmas

It was a cold  
And dark December night  
But a star  
Still lit the sky  
Away in a manger  
You heard a baby cry  
It was the cry  
Of the Son of God  
A little baby boy  
Born in that manger  
To bring the world joy  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what you'll do  
You'll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing  
To fear because you know  
God is with you all the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
  
Many people soon gathered  
Round that tiny run down barn  
They knew not of what they saw  
Then came three all dressed  
In fancy robes  
Silks and furs  
This was the first indication  
Of the importance of his birth  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what you'll do  
You'll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing  
To fear because you know  
That God will lead the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
  
We expected a soldier  
Tto save us from our plight  
All dressed in shiny armor  
Ready for a fight  
But instead he sent  
A little baby boy  
All filled  
With love happiness  
To bring the world joy  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what you'll do  
You'll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing to fear  
Because you know  
That God will lead the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day

I have traveled many moonless nights,  
Cold and weary with a babe inside,  
And I wonder what I've done.  
Holy father you have come,  
And chosen me now to carry your son.  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer.  
I am frightened by the load I bear.  
In a world as cold as stone,  
Must I walk this path alone?  
Be with me now.  
Be with me now.  
  
Breath of heaven,  
Hold me together,  
Be forever near me,  
Breath of heaven.  
Breath of heaven,  
Lighten my darkness,  
Pour over me your holiness,  
For you are holy.  
Breath of heaven.  
  
Do you wonder as you watch my face,  
If a wiser one should have had my place,  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan.  
Help me be strong.  
Help me be.  
Help me.  
  
Breath of heaven,  
Hold me together,  
Be forever near me,  
Breath of heaven.  
Breath of heaven,  
Lighten my darkness,  
Pour over me your holiness,  
For you are holy.  
  
Breath of heaven,  
Hold me together,  
Be forever near me,  
Breath of heaven.  
Breath of heaven,  
Lighten my darkness,  
Pour over me your holiness,  
For you are holy.  
Breath of heaven.  
Breath of heaven.  
Breath of heaven

(French carol, ca. 1553)  
  
Bring a torch, Jeanette, Isabella  
Bring a torch, come swiftly and run  
Christ is born,  
Tell the folk of the village  
Jesus is sleeping in His cradle  
Ah, ah, beautiful is the Mother  
Ah, ah, beautiful is her Son  
  
Hasten now, good folk of the village  
Hasten now, the Christ Child to see  
You will find Him asleep in the manger  
Quietly come and whisper softly  
Hush, hush, peacefully now He slumbers  
Hush, hush, peacefully now He sleeps

When I was but a youngster,  
Christmas meant one thing,  
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day.  
I learned a whole lot different,  
When my Mother sat me down,  
And taught me to spell Christmas this way:  
  
"C" is for the Christ child, born upon this day,  
"H" for herald angels in the night,  
"R" means our Redeemer,  
"I" means Israel,  
"S" is for the star that shone so bright,  
"T" is for three wise men, they who traveled far,  
"M" is for the manger where he lay,  
"A"'s for all He stands for,  
"S" means shepherds came,  
  
And that's why there's a Christmas day,  
And that's why there's a Christmas day

Hark! how the bells  
Sweet silver bells  
All seem to say,  
"Throw cares away."  
Christmas is here  
Bringing good cheer  
To young and old  
Meek and the bold  
  
Ding, dong, ding, dong  
That is their song  
With joyful ring  
All caroling  
One seems to hear  
Words of good cheer  
From ev'rywhere  
Filling the air  
  
Oh how they pound,  
Raising the sound,  
O'er hill and dale,  
Telling their tale,  
Gaily they ring  
While people sing  
Songs of good cheer  
Christmas is here  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
  
On, on they send  
On without end  
Their joyful tone  
To ev'ry home  
  
[Repeat from the beginning]  
  
Ding, dong, ding, dong

Child in the manger, Infant of Mary  
Outcast and stranger, Lord of all  
Child who inherits  
All our transgressions  
All our demerits on Him fall  
  
Once the most holy  
Child of salvation  
Gently and lowly, lived below  
Now as our glorious Mighty Redeemer  
See Him victorious  
O'er each foe  
  
Prophets foretold Him  
Infant of wonder  
Angels behold Him On His throne  
Worthy our Savior  
Of all our praises  
Happy forever  
Are His own

Children, go where I send thee,  
How will I send thee?  
I'm gonna send thee one by one  
One was the little bitty - baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem.  
  
Children, go where I send thee,  
How will I send thee?  
I'm gonna send thee two by two  
Two for Paul and - Silas  
One for the little bitty - baby  
Born, born, born in Bethlehem.  
  
[Repeat in decending order:]  
Three for the Hebrew children  
Four for the four that stood at the door...  
Five for the gospel preachers...  
Six for the six that never got fixed...  
Seven for the seven that never went to heaven...  
Eight for the eight that stood at the gate...  
Nine for the nine who saw the sign  
Ten for the ten commandments...

Christians, awake, salute the happy morn  
Whereon the Saviour of the world was born  
Rise to adore the mystery of love  
Which hosts of angels chanted from above  
With them the joyful tidings first begun  
Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son  
  
Then to the watchful shepherds it was told  
Who heard the angelic herald's voice: "Behold,  
I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth  
To you and all the nations upon earth  
This day hath God fulfilled His promised word

Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just ain't New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I saw a face all aglow  
Last year this time  
Now I'm staying home alone  
And my house is not a home  
Without that girl of mine  
  
Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas  
Without the one you love  
And New Years  
Just ain't New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Twelve o'clock  
And all is well  
And I was doing  
Oh, so swell  
Last year, this time  
Goin' shopping  
With friends together  
Making vows  
To leave each other  
Never  
It was a waste of time  
  
Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just ain't New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just ain't New Years  
Without the one you love  
  
Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas  
Without the one you love  
New Years  
Just ain't New Years  
Without the one you love

Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts, exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Merry Christmas meant lots of whispering  
Special feelings to bridge the difference  
All the years we came together  
For Christmas at home  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night, O Holy Night  
  
Memories of old Jack Frost  
Frozen pictures upon the glass  
Changing right before your eyes  
With a warm breath from the happy child  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts, exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night, O Holy Night

Snow covered rooftops  
Lights on the trees  
The sound of singing  
I hear down  
Every street  
  
Families  
Have gathered  
From miles away  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
You see that old tree  
Down Cotton Lane  
Those lights  
Keep shining  
It's always the same  
  
We hear  
The church bells  
Ring out to say  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
Swing the lights  
And hang  
The stockings  
Decorate  
With green and red  
Made the cookies  
For old Santa  
Made a runway  
For his sled  
  
Singing carols  
On a sleigh ride  
Gather 'round  
The manger scene  
Open presents  
Read the letter  
And together  
We will sing  
  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
Joy to the world  
For every nation  
For every boy  
And girl  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh  
Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day

Snow falling gently on the ground  
'Tis is the night before  
And in my heart there is no doubt  
That this is gonna be  
'Cause here you are with me  
Baby, baby, I can't wait  
  
To spend this special time of year with someone who  
Makes me feel the special way that you do  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
We'll stay up late tonight  
Decorate the tree  
Just look into my eyes  
And I will tell you truthfully  
That I don't need no Santa Claus  
To hear my Christmas wish  
I got you in my arms  
And what could be a better gift  
Than to spend my very favorite time of year  
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeeeaahhh  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
And the bells are ringing when I hear you say  
We'll do it all again on Christmas Day  
I can't wait  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go

Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

By now in New York City.  
There's snow on the ground.  
And out in California.  
The sunshine's falling down.  
And maybe down in Memphis,  
Graceland's all in lights.  
And in Atlanta, Georgia,  
There's peace on earth tonight.  
  
Christmas in Dixie.  
It's snowing in the pines.  
Merry Christmas from Dixie  
To everyone tonight.  
  
It's windy in Chicago.  
The kids are out of school.  
There's magic in Motown.  
The city's on the move.  
In Jackson, Mississippi  
To Charlotte, Caroline.  
And all across the Nation,  
It's a peaceful Christmas time.  
  
Christmas in Dixie.  
It's snowing in the pines.  
Merry Christmas from Dixie,  
To everyone tonight.  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama...  
Merry Christmas tonight

It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark  
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park  
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear  
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an illin' reindeer  
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard  
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared  
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone  
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn  
  
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause  
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"  
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's  
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease  
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right  
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night  
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree  
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me  
  
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens  
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens  
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese  
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees  
Decorate the house with lights at night  
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright  
In the fireplace is the yule log  
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog  
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's  
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carols  
  
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it  
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit  
Jack Frost chillin, the orchids out  
And that's what Christmas is all about  
The time is now, the place is here  
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer  
  
My name's D. M. C. With the mic in my hand  
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman  
So open your eyes, lend us an ear  
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

The holly green, the ivy green  
The prettiest picture you've ever seen  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home  
  
It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau  
While cuddling under the mistletoe  
And Santa Claus you know, of course  
Is one of the boys from home  
  
The door is always open  
The neighbors pay a call  
And Father John before he's gone  
Will bless the house and all  
  
How grand it feels to click your heels  
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels  
I'm handing you no blarney  
The likes you've never known  
Is Christmas in Killarney  
With all of the folks at home

Let's get away from sleigh bells  
Let's get away from snow  
Let's make a break some Christmas  
Dear  
I know the place to go  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to spend the holiday  
Away across the sea?  
How'd ya like to spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island?  
How'd ya like to hang a stocking  
On a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late  
Like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail  
In with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island  
You will never stray for everyday  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
  
How'd ya like to stay up late  
Like the islanders do?  
Wait for Santa to sail  
In with your presents  
In a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas  
On Christmas Island  
You will never stray  
For everyday  
Your Christmas dreams  
Come true  
On Christmas Island  
Your dreams come true

Don't you know  
It always happens  
Same time every year.  
Snow flakes and heartaches  
And that lonesome Christmas chill  
  
I keep going through emotions  
Hiding from the truth  
Don't you know that Chritmas  
Just ain't christmas  
Without you  
  
You know Christmas  
Hasn't been the same  
Since the day you left.  
I still send you  
Real tight greetings  
Hoping someday  
You might forget  
  
I try to hold up tradition  
Do all the things we used to do  
But you know that Christmas  
Just ain't Chritmas without you.  
  
Cause all are having Silent night  
Memories of how we used to be  
And all would come back to my world  
If you just let Santa bring  
Your sweet love home to me.  
  
There's a season  
To be happy  
But Lord I feel so blue  
Cause girl Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas without you

Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all that children call  
Their favorite time of the year  
  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times and ancient rhymes  
Of love and dreams to share  
  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
  
Christmas time is here  
We'll be drawing near  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Oh, that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year...

You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no  
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow  
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go  
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes  
  
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way  
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet  
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood  
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave  
Christmas to remember, too good to believe  
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  
  
And you've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
We loved and laughed and played and joked  
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks  
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes  
Then to the lodge for dinner  
But now it's time for us to go  
As our hearts melt like chimney snow  
There's just one thing I want to know  
Can we do this next winter  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember  
  
You've made this a Christmas to remember  
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December  
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers  
Oh! What a Christmas to remember

White Christmas and I'm blue  
Like fireworks with no fuse  
Christmas without you  
  
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning  
The pages of memories of time spent with you  
Old christmas songs we knew and used to make love to  
Make it hard to get used to  
Christmas without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Christmas without you  
White christmas and I'm blue  
I love you I miss you  
So sad but so true  
Christmas without you  
  
Like a mystery with no clues  
Like fireworks with no fuse  
Christmas without you  
  
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow  
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas eve  
The most joyous christmas if luck could be with us  
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me  
  
[Chorus 2x]

"Merry Christmas everybody!  
Yeah, Merry Christmas everybody, big deal...  
Hey man, what's wrong with you Jermaine?  
Yeah, that's not kind of attitude...  
This only happens once a year!  
Hey, fellas, don't bug him!  
He and his girl just broke up, so get off his back!  
Can't you see there's tears in his eyes?  
Yeah, he's cryin'... "  
  
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry  
  
Christmas won't be the same this year  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
Christmas won't be the same this year  
(No, it won't, now, darlin', no, no)  
Without her loving arms holding you so near  
  
I see the lights  
But they don't shine for me  
I see the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
Our house is decorated  
My friends are celebrating  
  
No, no, it won't be the same this year  
The things we used to do  
Now Darling, it's all over  
  
The neighborhood kids  
Are having so much fun  
Counting off the days  
'Til Santa Claus comes  
And I see the mistletoe  
Hanging from my door  
I wish I could kiss you again  
Like I did before  
  
So go on, girl  
And have your fun  
Don't spoil your time  
Thinking about me  
This time next year, my darling dear  
Hopefully, you'll be having dinner with me  
  
No, no, it won't be the same without you, my darling

Seeking the Savior from all earthly woe

Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite

Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song, high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace wall, mighty king,  
Do you know what I know  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring Him silver and gold  
Let us bring Him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere,  
Listen to what I say  
Pray for peace, people everywhere!  
Listen to what I say

He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light

(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
Santa's got a little friend,  
His name is Dominick.  
The cutest little donkey,  
You never see him kick.  
When Santa visits his paisans,  
With Dominick he'll be.  
Because the reindeer cannot,  
Climb the hills of Italy.  
  
Hey! Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
It's Dominick the donkey.  
Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
  
Jingle bells around his feet,  
And presents on the sled.  
Hey! Look at the mayor's derby,  
On top of Dominick's head.  
A pair of shoes for Louie,  
And a dress for Josephine.  
The labels on the inside says,  
They're made in Brooklyn.  
  
Hey! Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
It's Dominick the donkey.  
Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
  
Children sing, and clap their hands,  
And Dominick starts to dance.  
They talk Italian to him,  
And he even understands.  
  
Cumpare sing,  
Cumpare su,  
And dance 'sta tarantella.  
When Santa Nicola comes to town,  
And brings lu ciucciariello  
  
Hey! Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
It's Dominick the donkey.  
Chingedy ching,  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
The Italian Christmas donkey.  
(La la la-la la-la la la la la)  
(La la la-la la-la la-ee-oh-da)  
  
Hey! Dominick! Buon Natale!  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)

(Hee-haw, hee-haw)  
(Hee-haw, hee-haw)

Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?  
Donde esta Santa Claus?  
And the toys that he will leave.  
Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus?  
I look for him because it's a Christmas Eve.  
  
I know that I should be sleeping,  
But maybe he's not far away,  
Out of the window I'm peeping,  
Hoping to see him in his sleigh.  
  
I hope he won't forget to clack his castinet,  
And to his reindeer, say,  
Oh! Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,  
Ole! Ole! Ole! Cha cha cha.  
  
Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?  
Oh! Where is Santa Claus?  
It's Christmas Eve.  
Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?  
I look for him because it's Christmas Eve.  
  
I know that I should be sleeping,  
But maybe he's not far away,  
Out of the window I'm peeping,  
Hoping to see him in sleigh.  
  
I hope he won't forget to crack his castinet,  
And to his reindeer, say,  
Oh! Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,  
Ole! Ole! Ole! Cha cha cha.  
  
Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?  
Oh! Where is Santa Claus?  
It's Christmas Eve.

Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen, aus einer Wurzel zart,  
Wie uns die Alten sungen, von Jesse kam die Art,  
Und hat ein Blumlein bracht mitten I'm kalten Winter  
Wohl zu der halben Nacht.  
  
Das Roslein, das ich meine, davon Jesaias sagt,  
Ist Maria die Reine uns das Blumlein bracht.  
Aus Gottes ew'gen Rat hat sie ein Kind geboren  
Und blieb ein' reine Magd.  
  
Das Blumelein, so kleine, das duftet uns so su?,  
Mit seinem hellen Scheine vertreibt's die Finsternis.  
Wahr' Mensch und wahrer Gott, hilft uns aus allen Leiden,  
Rettet von Sund' und Tod.  
  
O Jesu, bis zum Scheiden aus diesem Jammertal  
Lass Dein hilf uns geleiten hin in den Freudensaal,  
In Deines Vaters Reich, da wir Dich ewig loben.  
O Gott, uns das verleih

[Verse 1]  
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,  
He was made of snow but the children  
Know how he came to life one day.  
There must have been some magic in that  
Old silk hat they found.  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.  
O, Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be,  
And the children say he could laugh  
And play just the same as you and me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Over the hills of snow.  
  
[Verse2]  
Ooh Frosty the snowman knew  
The sun was hot that day,  
So he said, "Let's run and  
We'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away."  
Down to the village,  
With a broomstick in his hand,  
Running here and there all  
Around the square saying,  
Catch me if you can.  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop.  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler "Stop!"  
Mmm Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way,  
But he waved goodbye saying,  
"Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day."  
  
[Chorus]  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump  
  
Over the hills of snow

People making lists  
Buying special gifts  
Taking time to be kind  
To one and all  
It's that time of year  
When good friends  
Are dear  
And you wish you  
Could give more  
Than just presents  
From a store  
  
Why don't you give love  
On Christmas day  
(On Christmas day)  
Oh, even the man  
Who has everything  
Would be so happy  
If you would bring  
Him love  
On Christmas day  
(On Christmas day)  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
  
People you don't know  
Smiling out hello  
Everywhere there's an air  
Of Christmas joy  
It's that once a year  
When the world's sincere  
And you'd like  
To find a way  
To show the things  
That words can't say  
  
Why don't you give love  
On Christmas day  
(On Christmas day)  
Oh the man on the street  
And the couple upstairs  
All need to know  
That someone who cares  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
(Christmas day)  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
What the world  
Needs is love  
Yes, the world  
Needs your love  
  
Why don't you give love  
On Christmas day  
(On Christmas Day)  
Oh, every little child  
On Santa's knee  
Has room for your love  
Underneath his tree  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
(Christmas day)  
No greater gift  
Is there than love  
What the world  
Needs is love  
Yes, the world  
Needs your love  
  
Give love  
On Christmas day  
(Christmas day)

Come, let us all unite to sing:  
God is love!  
Let Heav'n and earth their praises bring,  
God is love!  
Let every soul from sin awake,  
Let every heart sweet music make,  
And sing with us for Jesus' sake:  
God is love!  
  
[Refrain:]  
God is love! God is love!  
Come let us all unite to sing that God is love.  
  
O tell to earth's remotest bound,  
God is love!  
In Christ we have redemption found,  
God is love!  
His blood has washed our sins away,  
His Spirit turned our night to day,  
And now we can rejoice to say:  
God is love!  
  
[Refrain]  
  
How happy is our portion here,  
God is love!  
His promises our spirits cheer,  
God is love!  
He is our sun and shield by day,  
Our help, our hope, our strength and stay

Good King Wenceslas looked out  
On the feast of Stephen,  
When the snow lay round about,  
Deep and crisp and even.  
Brightly shown the moon that night,  
Though the frost was cruel,  
When a poor man came in sight,  
Gathering winter fuel.  
  
Hither, page, and stand by me.  
If thou know it telling:  
Yonder peasant, who is he?  
Where and what his dwelling?  
Sire, he lives a good league hence,  
Underneath the mountain,  
Right against the forest fence  
By Saint Agnes fountain.  
  
Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.  
Bring me pine logs hither.  
Thou and I will see him dine  
When we bear the thither.  
Page and monarch, forth they went,  
Forth they went together  
Through the rude wind's wild lament  
And the bitter weather.  
  
Sire, the night is darker now,  
And the wind blows stronger.  
Fails my heart, I know not how.  
I can go no longer.  
Ark my footsteps my good page,  
Tread thou in them boldly:  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage  
Freeze thy blood less coldly.  
  
In his master's step he trod,  
Where the snow lay dented.  
Heat was in the very sod  
Which the saint had printed.  
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,  
Wealth or rank possessing,  
Ye who now will bless the poor  
Shall yourselves find blessing

(Dr. Elmo, 1979, Dr. Elmo's Twisted Christmas)  
  
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.  
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,  
But as for me and grandpa we believe.  
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,  
And we begged her not to go.  
But she forgot her medication, and she  
Staggered out the door into the snow.  
When we found her Christmas morning,  
At the scene of the attack,  
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,  
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.  
  
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,  
He's been taking this so well.  
See him in there watching football,  
Drinking root beer and  
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.  
It's not Christmas without Grandma,  
All the family's dressed in black  
And we just can't help but wonder:  
Should we open up her gifts,  
Or send them back?  
Send them back!!  
  
Now the goose is on the table  
And the pudding made of fig  
And the blue and silver candles  
That would just have matched  
The hair on grandma's wig.  
I've warned all my  
Friends and neighbors  
Better watch out for yourselves,  
They should never give a license  
To a man who drives a sleigh  
And plays with elves

Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you  
With childhood fantasies  
  
Well, I'm all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
I'm not a child  
But my heart still can dream  
  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown up christmas list  
Not for myself  
But for a world in need  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely  
Wrapped beneath our tree  
  
Well heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal  
A hurting human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
(there'd be)  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end, oh  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
This is my grown up christmas list

Now kids hang on just a second before we start  
You know there's a reason we are all here in front of Grandma and  
Grandpa's  
Christmas tree  
And if Trevor and E. P. Would quit fighting long enough and be real  
Quiet  
This little song might help ya understand  
  
Long ago in a stable there was a baby being born  
His parents were Joseph and Mary  
And Joseph's big ole heart was torn  
Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child  
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her  
Smile  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I  
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year  
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  
  
Now kids the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas  
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents  
Think about that baby and say  
Happy birthday Jesus  
I'll open this one for you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ok all together now  
Happy Birthday Jesus  
I'll open this one just for you

Happy Holiday  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
While the merry bells keep ringing  
May your ev'ry wish come true  
  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
May the calendar keep bringing  
Happy holidays to you  
  
Come To Holiday Inn  
If you're burdened down with trouble  
If your nerves are wearing thin  
Park your load down the road  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If the traffic noise affects you  
Like a squeaky violin  
Kick your cares down the stairs  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If you can't find someone who  
Would set your heart a-whirl  
Take your car and motor to  
The home of boy meets girl  
  
If you're laid-up with a breakdown  
Throw away your vitamin  
Don't get worse, grab your nurse  
And come to Holiday Inn

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair  
Maybe I'll move somewhere  
Maybe I'll get a car  
Maybe I'll drive so far  
They'll all lose track  
Me, I'll bounce right back  
Maybe I'll sleep real late  
Maybe I'll lose some weight  
Maybe I'll clear my junk  
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and Dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow get me way down  
  
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew  
Maybe I'll just lie low  
Maybe I'll hit the bars  
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn  
Me, I will go on  
  
Maybe I'll settle down  
Maybe I'll just leave town  
Maybe I'll have some fun  
Maybe I'll meet someone  
And make him mine  
Me, I'll be just  
  
Fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
I'll be fine and dandy  
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas  
I'm barely getting through tomorrow  
But still I won't let  
Sorrow bring me way down  
  
'Cause I'll be fine  
(I'll be fine)  
Oh, I'll be fine

(From the film Meet Me In St. Louis - Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane 1943)  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,  
Let your heart be light

Make the Yule-tide gay,  
From now on,  
Our troubles will be miles away.

Happy golden days of yore.  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more.  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the Fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

And God bless you, and send you  
A Happy New Year,  
And God send you a Happy New Year.  
  
We have a little purse  
Made of ratching leather skin

If everyday was Christmas  
If we could make believe  
If everyone would give a little more  
There'd be harmony  
  
The city is covered in snow tonight  
The children are fast asleep  
I'm waiting for him  
But he's no where in sight  
And I wonder if he can hear me.  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
Bring my baby home tonight  
  
Why does it feel like it's colder than winter  
Even by the fire side  
My baby said that he'd be home for Christmas  
And now it's almost midnight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They don't mean a thing 'til he's with me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
I know your sleigh is full inside  
But wont you stop and give my baby a ride  
I'll be waiting by candle light this Christmas  
Ohhh  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Are such a sight to see  
But all the presents by the tree  
They don't mean a thing, Santa, please here me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I wish with all my might  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
If you hear me wont you hurry bring my baby tonight  
  
Christmas lights up and down the street  
Presents by the tree  
I hear a knock  
Oh, can it be  
My wish is staring back at me  
  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I guess you heard me tonight, yeah  
Hey Santa  
Hey Santa (Santa)  
I'm underneath the mistletoe with my baby tonight  
  
(Sleigh ride, sleigh ride (repeat))  
It's Christmas Time  
Hey Santa

Have a holly jolly Christmas  
It's the best time of the year  
Well  
I don't know if there'll be snow  
But have a cup of cheer  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Ho ho the mistletoe  
Hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, by golly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
This year

This year

Silver bells are ringing  
Carolers are singing  
Snowflakes drifting  
Through the air  
Everybody's shopping  
Got no time for stopping  
It looks like Christmas is here.  
  
So tell me  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your lovin' ares will have to do.  
  
At first, I though of giving you  
A pretty diamond ring  
Wore myself out shopping  
For a million other things  
Finally decided  
On something you can't buy  
But how will I disguise it  
So you will be surprised.  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your lovin' ares will have to do.  
  
A gift of love was given to  
The world so long ago  
Laying in a manger  
He was wrapped in swadlin' clothes  
And every year we celebrate  
And thank the Lord above  
And give to one another  
Our little gifts of love.  
  
How do I wrap my heart up for Christmas  
I wanna give it to you  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your lovin' ares will have to do.  
  
Pretty bows and ribbons  
Don't fit the gift I'm givin'  
Your lovin' ares will have to do...

Walking through a winter dreamland  
Sleighbells ringing and my friends by my side  
I know we're having fun together

Will be reality

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play,  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
I thought how, as the day had come,  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head:  
"There is no peace on earth," I said,  
"For hate is strong and mocks the song  
Of peace on earth, good will to men. "  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:  
"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
In peace on earth, good will to men.

I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
I saw three ships come sailing by  
On Christmas Day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?  
  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.

When the snowman brings us snow  
Well he just might like to know  
He's put a great big smile, on someone elses face  
If you jump into your bed  
Quickly cover up your head  
Don't you lock the doors  
You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When we're skating in the park  
If the snow cloud makes it dark  
Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way  
Now the frosty paws appear  
And they've frozen up my beard  
So we'll lie by the fire  
'Til the heat simply melts 'em all away  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When the snowman brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)  
Well he just might like to know (well he just might like to know)  
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face  
So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)  
All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)  
I'll sign my name on the rroftop in the snow  
Then he may decide to stay  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oo-oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Okay you lot - take it!  
  
Well, I wish it could be Christmas, every day (Christmas day)  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play (Oh-oh)  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Why don't you give your love for Christmas?

In notte placida, per muto sentier,  
Dai campi del ciel? Discese l'Amor,  
All'alme fedeli il Redentor!  
Nell'aura? Il palpito d'un grande mister:  
Del nuovo Israel? Nato il Signor,  
Il fiore pi? Bello dei nostri fior!  
  
Are.  
Cantate, o popoli, gloria all'Altissimo  
L'animo aprite a speranza ed amor!  
  
Se l'aura? Gelida, se fosco? Il ciel,  
Oh, vieni al mio cuore, vieni a posar,  
Ti v? Col mio amore riscaldar.  
Se il fieno? Rigido, se il vento? Crudel,  
Un cuore che t'ama voglio a Te dar,  
Un cuor che Te brama, Ges? Cullar.

In the bleak midwinter  
Frost wind made moan  
Earth stood  
Hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen  
Snow on snow  
Snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long ago  
  
Our god  
Heaven cannot hold him  
Nor earth sustain  
Heaven and Earth  
Shall flee away  
When he comes to reign  
In the bleak midwinter  
A stable place sufficed  
The lord God almighty  
Jesus Christ  
  
Angels and archangels  
May have gathered there  
Cherubim and seraphim  
Thronged the air  
But his mother only  
In her maiden bliss  
Worshiped the beloved  
With a kiss  
  
What can I give him  
Poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet  
What I can I give him  
Give my heart

It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That feeling everywhere  
  
It must have been the pretty lights  
That glistened in the silent night  
It may be just the stars so bright  
That shined above you  
  
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Ah, Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed  
That we would fall in love!  
  
It could have been the holiday,  
The midnight ride upon sleigh  
The countryside all dressed in white  
The crazy snowball fight!  
  
It could have been the steeplebell  
That wrapped us up in its spell  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe!  
  
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of  
Ah, St. Nicholas must have know that kiss  
Would lead to all of this!!  
It must have been the mistletoe  
  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That made me love you!  
On Christmas eve our wish came true  
That I would fall in love with you  
It only took one kiss to know  
  
It must have been the mistletoe!  
It must have been the mistletoe!  
It must have been the mistletoe!

(Lyrics by Harry Connick, Jr.)  
  
I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling "Ho! Ho! Ho!" because  
He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends he's Santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...  
No way!  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
It must've been ol' Santa Claus  
Santa Claus, Santa Claus  
Happy "Ho! Ho! Ho!" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' Santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said  
"Little boys like you should be in bed"  
  
So I hollered "Ho! Ho! Ho!"  
And I put on Santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat  
  
[Chorus:]

The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
For I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember a worse December  
Just watch those icicles form!  
Oh, what do I care if icicles form?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember a worse December  
Just watch those icicles form!  
What do I care if icicles form?  
Oh-ho-ho, I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove  
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!  
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm!  
What do I care how much it may storm?  
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm

Jesu, joy of man's desiring,  
Holy wisdom, love most bright.  
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring,  
Soar to uncreated light.  
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned  
With the fire of life impassioned,  
Striving still to Truth unknown,  
Soaring, dying 'round Thy throne.  
  
[Original German Text:]  
  
Jesus, bleibet meine Freude,  
Meines Herzens Trost und Saft,  
Jesus wehret allem Leide,  
Er ist meines Lebens Kraft,  
Meiner Augen Lust und Sonne,  
Meiner Seele Schatz und Wonne,  
Darum la? Ich Jesum nicht  
Aus dem Herzen und Gesicht.

Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
New life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory, glory, glory  
To the new born King  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
New life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory, glory, glory  
To the new born King  
  
He was herald  
By the angels  
Born  
In a lowly manger  
The virgin Mary  
Was His mother  
And Joseph  
Was his earthly father  
Three wise men  
Came from afar  
They were guided  
By a shining star  
To see King Jesus  
Where He lay  
In a manger  
Filled with hay  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Oh  
What a wonderful child  
Jesus, Jesus  
So lowly meek and mild  
Oh new life, new hope  
New joy He brings  
Won't you listen  
To the angels sing  
Glory  
To the new born King  
  
Oh, Jesus  
Jesus  
Mary's baby  
Lamb of God  
Heavenly Child  
Jesus  
Jesus  
I Love Him  
  
Oh, Jesus  
All Mighty God  
King of kings  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Oh, oh, oh, Jesus  
Wonderful  
Wonderful one  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, Jesus  
Oh, Jesus  
Son of God  
Oh, Jesus  
Glory  
To the new born King  
Yeah

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square  
In the frosty air.  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock.

Jolly old St. Nicholas  
Lean your ear this way  
Don't you tell a single soul  
What I'm going to say  
  
Christmas Eve is coming soon  
Now, you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me  
Tell me if you can  
  
When the clock is striking twelve  
When I'm fast asleep  
Down the chimney broad and black  
With your pack you'll creep  
  
All the stockings you will find  
Hanging in a row  
Mine will be the shortest one  
You'll be sure to know  
  
Johnny wants a pair of skates  
Suzie wants a sled  
Nellie wants a picture book  
Yellow, Blue, and Red  
  
As for me, my little brain  
Isn't very bright  
Choose for me, old Santa Claus  
What you think is right

Oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh  
Ah-ah  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?  
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me  
  
Happy Christmas  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been  
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh baby  
  
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes  
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice  
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A man under cover, but you tore me apart  
Ooh ooh, now I've found a real love  
You'll never fool me again  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart  
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave meaway)  
This year, to save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special (Special)  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)  
A man under cover, but you tore him apart  
Maybe next year, I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special  
  
Special  
So long

Let There Be Peace on Earth and let it begin with me.  
Let There Be Peace on Earth, the peace that was meant to be!  
With God as our Father, brothers all are we.  
Let me walk with my brother in perfect harmony.  
  
Let peace begin with me. Let this be the moment now.  
With ev'ry breath I take, let this be my solemn vow  
To take each moment, and live each moment, in peace eternally.  
Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me.

Come they told me

His name is Sandy Sleighfoot,  
And oh so sad was he,  
For though he stood just 4 feet tall  
His feet were 3 feet 3.  
He tried to help make Santa's toys  
But with his feet so long,  
He'd trip and fall and break them all  
Just every thing went wrong.  
  
Now little Sandy Sleighfoot  
Don't you feel so blue:  
Even with your feet so long  
God has a place for you.  
The other kids made fun of him,  
They laughed at him with glee,  
  
But Sandy Sleighfoot learned one day  
Without skis he could ski

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".  
  
Oh my Lord...

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say,  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day,  
That's the island greeting that we send to you  
From the land where palm trees sway,  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright,  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night,  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way  
To say "Merry Christmas to you."

Greeting cards have all been sent  
The Christmas rush is through  
But I still have one more wish to make  
A special one for you  
  
Merry Christmas Darling  
We're apart that's true  
But I can dream and in my dreams,  
I'm Christmas-ing with you.  
  
Holidays are joyful  
There's always something new  
But every day's a holiday  
When I'm near to you  
  
The lights on my tree  
I wish you could see  
I wish it every day  
The logs on the fire  
Fill me with desire  
To see you and to say  
  
That I wish you a merry Christmas  
Happy New Year, too  
I've just one wish  
On this Christmas Eve  
I wish I were with you  
I wish I were with you

The fire is burning  
The room's all aglow  
Outside the December wind blows  
Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow  
Everybody's laughing  
The world is celebrating  
And everyone's so happy  
Except for me tonight  
  
Because I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I can't get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And I'm all right  
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time  
  
I gaze out the window  
This cold winter's night  
At all of the twinkling lights  
Alone in the darkness  
Remembering when you were mine  
Everybody's smiling  
The whole world is rejoicing  
And everyone's embracing  
Except for you and I  
  
Baby I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I can't get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And I'm all right  
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time  
  
In the springtime those memories start to fade  
With the April rain  
Through the summer days  
Till autumn's leaves are gone  
I get by without you  
Till the snow begins to fall  
  
And then I miss you  
Most at Christmas time  
And I can't get you  
Get you off my mind  
Every other season comes along  
And I'm all right...  
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time

'Twas the night before Christmas when all through the castle  
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle  
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things  
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
But they were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monsters should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
They were making a list and checking it twice  
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike  
A new chain for Yarnush  
A brace for Igor's back  
A speed shaver for Wolfman  
A new cape for Drac  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They were up to no good  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Didn't act like good monster's should  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They found themselves a new play  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh  
  
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof  
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof  
As Santa slid down the chimney wall  
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all  
  
From beyond the moat there arose such a clatter  
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter  
Like a bolt of lightning it happened so quick  
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick  
  
He began to dig down deep in his sack  
And came up with the traction for Igor's back  
Drac got his cape  
Franky's trike made him behave  
Even Wolfman was happy now he can shave  
  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And all ended well  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
And Santa was really swell  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
No need to rob Santa's sleigh  
(It was a monster's holiday)  
Maybe next year he'll come back  
  
So the children everywhere were spared the grief  
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief  
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave  
And never again rob sleighs or graves  
  
[Repeat "it was a monster's holiday" in background with the following:]  
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?  
"Arrrrrr... Santa good!"  
And Santa said as he drove out of sight  
  
[Dracula accent:]  
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho  
Merry Christmas to all  
And to all a good night - blaaaa! "  
  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Dashing through the snow  
Where is that reindeer with the red nose, blaaaa  
On Donner, on Blitzen, on Dancer...

Who's got a beard that's long and white  
Santa's got a beard that's long and white  
  
Who comes around on a special night  
Santa comes around on a special night  
  
Special Night, beard that's white  
  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa, Santa Clause  
  
Who wears boots and a suit of red  
Santa wears boots and a suit of red  
  
Who wears a long cap on his head  
Santa wears a long cap on his head  
  
Cap on head, suit that's red  
Special night, beard that's white  
  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa, Santa Clause  
  
Who's got a big red cherry nose  
Santa's got a big red cherry nose  
  
Who laughs this way HO HO HO  
Santa laughs this way HO HO HO  
  
HO HO HO, cherry nose  
Cap on head, suit that's red  
Special night, beard that's white  
  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa, Santa Clause  
  
Who very soon will come our way  
Santa very soon will come our way  
  
Eight little reindeer pull his sleigh  
Santa's little reindeer pull his sleigh  
  
Reindeer sleigh, come our way  
HO HO HO, cherry nose  
Cap on head, suit that's red  
Special night, beard that's white  
  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa, Santa Clause  
  
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,  
Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen  
  
Reindeer sleigh, come our way  
HO HO HO, cherry nose  
Cap on head, suit that's red  
Special night, beard that's white  
  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa  
Must be Santa, Santa Clause

(Rita Macneil)  
  
Weary the travellers that carry the Babe  
Long is the journey the wise men will make  
While out through the darkness there shines a bright light  
And into the morning the world will rejoice  
  
Listen to the drummer boy, beating on the drum  
Shepherds gather closer to wait for the dawn  
And off in the distance the Child that is born  
Is sleeping softly in the peace of the morn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now the bells ring, now the bells ring  
The goods news has come  
The message is clear now  
The world is reborn  
  
Now hear the children singing His praise  
All of the world will remember this day  
While all through the ages,  
This story has been told  
And down through the pages the miracle unfolds  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now hear the children, singing His praise  
(Praise to the Child that is born)  
All of the world will remember this day  
(On this Christmas Day morn)  
While all through the ages, this story has been told  
And down through the pages the miracle unfolds  
  
[Chorus 2x]

O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
How steadfast are  
Your branches!  
Your boughs are green  
In summer's clime  
And through the snows  
Of wintertime.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
How steadfast are  
Your branches!  
  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
What happiness befalls me  
When oft at  
Joyous Christmas-time  
Your form inspires  
My song and rhyme.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
What happiness befalls me  
  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
Your boughs can  
Teach a lesson  
That constant faith  
And hope sublime  
Lend strength and  
Comfort through all time.  
O Christmas Tree,  
O Christmas Tree,  
Your boughs can  
Teach a lesson

O come, little children, O come one and all,  
To Bethlehem haste, to the manger so small,  
God's son for a gift has been sent you this night  
To be your redeemer, your joy and delight.  
  
He's born in a stable for you and for me,  
Draw near by the bright gleaming starlight to see,  
In swaddling clothes lying so meek and so mild,  
And purer than angels the heavenly Child.  
  
See Mary and Joseph, with love beaming eyes,  
Are gazing upon the rude bed where He lies,  
The shepherds are kneeling, with hearts full of love  
While angels sing loud hallelujahs above.  
  
Kneel down and adore Him with shepherds today,  
Lift up little hands now and praise Him as they  
Rejoice that a Saviour from sin you can boast,  
And join in the song of the heavenly host.

O come, O come, Emmanuel  
And ransom captive Israel  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appear  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.  
  
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free  
Thine own from Satan's tyranny  
From depths of Hell Thy people save  
And give them victory o'er the grave  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.  
  
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer  
Our spirits by Thine advent here  
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night  
And death's dark shadows put to flight.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.  
  
O come, Thou Key of David, come,  
And open wide our heavenly home

(Lorrie Morgan)  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt its worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine  
  
O Holy Night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error-pining  
Till he appeared  
And the soul felt it's worth  
The thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine

Old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin' old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?  
  
Close your eyes  
Listen to the skies  
All is calm, all is well  
Soon you'll hear Kris Kringle and the jingle bells  
  
Bringin' old toy trains, little toy tracks  
Little boy toys coming from a sack  
Carried by a man dressed in white and red  
Little boy, don't you think it's time you were in bed?

Old december's  
Here at last  
Time  
For celebration  
Christmas present  
Christmas past  
Tumble down  
Together  
Like the snow  
What a show  
  
Now the snowman  
Someone made  
Is melting  
By the road side  
On the wind  
A serenade  
Children's voices  
Singing I believe  
I believe in us  
I believe  
  
Chorus:  
On Christmas morning  
You awaken  
Wwith a smile  
You hold me  
In your arms  
We watch  
The snowflakes fly  
And then you love me  
And I realize  
How sweet love can be  
All the memories  
Coming back again  
Each year  
On Christmas morning  
  
Sentimental melodies  
Surround me  
Like an old friend  
She spent the winter  
Here with me  
Silently we watched  
The season change  
And they change  
So fast  
And fade away

Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem  
Mary being great with child had no place to lie down  
So Joseph found a stable in which Mary had her child  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas in a manger far away  
A King was born His palace was a manger filled with hay  
His royal robe was swaddling cloth a halo was His crown  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem  
  
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas from the Far East wise men came  
With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn King  
And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship Him  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem  
  
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem

Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
He'd be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now he's alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Holiday shoppers would stop by the counter  
And pick up a plant to take home  
Until one by one all his friends were adopted  
And Percy was left all alone  
  
Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is hanging his bloom in dismay  
If they had just kept him wetta  
He'd be a houseplant today  
Folks liked the other plants betta  
Now he's alone on the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself  
  
Then into the store on the night before Christmas  
Came a poor little girl who was cryin'  
But when she saw Percy her eyes opened wide  
And she said "Can I please make him mine?"  
  
Now Percy the puny poinsettia  
Is standing beside Mr. Tree  
His leaves have never been redda,  
He's as proud as a flower can be  
  
Somebody made him feel betta,  
Rescued him off of the shelf  
Even a plant with no uncle or aunt  
Shouldn't spend Christmas Day by himself

C'est la belle nuit de Noel  
La neige etend son manteau blanc  
Et les yeux leves vers le ciel  
A genoux, les petits enfants  
Avant de fermer les paupieres  
Font une derniere priere.  
  
[Refrain:]  
Petit papa Noel  
Quand tu descendras du ciel  
Avec des jouets par milliers  
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.  
Mais avant de partir  
Il faudra bien te couvrir  
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid  
C'est un peu a cause de moi.  
  
Il me tarde que le jour se leve  
Pour voir si tu m'as apporte  
Tous les beaux joujoux que je vois en reve  
Et que je t'ai commandes.  
  
[Refrain:]  
Petit papa Noel  
Quand tu descendras du ciel  
Avec des jouets par milliers  
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.  
Mais avant de partir  
Il faudra bien te couvrir  
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid  
C'est un peu a cause de moi.  
  
Le marchand de sable est passe  
Les enfants vont faire dodo  
Et tu vas pouvoir commencer  
Avec ta hotte sur le dos  
Au son des cloches des eglises  
Ta distribution de surprises.  
  
Et quand tu seras sur ton beau nuage  
Viens d'abord sur notre maison  
Je n'ai pas ete tous les jours tres sage  
Mais j'en demande pardon.  
  
[Refrain]:  
Petit papa Noel  
Quand tu descendras du ciel  
Avec des jouets par milliers  
N'oublie pas mon petit soulier.  
Mais avant de partir  
Il faudra bien te couvrir  
Dehors tu vas avoir si froid  
C'est un peu a cause de moi.

Pine cones and Holly Berries  
Popcorn for you, apples for me  
Red striped candy, nut cracker handy  
Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.  
Snow clouds hang low and threatening  
Maybe in won't, praying it may  
The brightest fireplace glows in every face  
Waiting for Christmas day.  
  
There'll be walk-a-round songs and  
Talk-a-round songs  
Songs of the inn and stable.  
There'll be morning time songs and  
Evening time songs  
And grace at every table.  
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go
