One eye on the shadows, protecting his fellows  
From sun up to the moon on his back  
Sent the villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies  
A stallion in the sack  
  
You can't get your life back  
When right follows left Jack  
The more you see the less you know  
When others would leak it, his service is secret  
Plays God when it's your time to go  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
From the House of Lords, saving Norfolk broads  
Commoners and landed gentry  
His word his bond, whether brunette or blonde  
Baby, it's so elementary  
  
For the man never messed up your life with one stare  
See the film, you'll know how it goes  
But this ain't no fiction  
Just check the diction quid pro quo, a pro's pro  
  
Hey fellas, don't be jealous  
When they made him they broke the mold  
So charismatic, with an automatic  
Never prematurely shooting his load  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
Queen and country, safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows 'cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who?  
Up a creek with no canoe

I'm on a mission  
To abuse my position  
Abuse it with you  
  
Love, I'm a cynical bitch  
I'm gonna scratch that itch  
With a bitch like you  
  
Harder thinkers make me miserable  
Everything is unforgivable  
If not for you  
I wouldn't come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
Move your phoney ass  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Love me like I'm cash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
You can feel the clash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
[Guitar]  
  
If there's a freak in here  
Looking for someone like me  
I fit their description  
Perfectly  
  
Boom boom boom  
I bet they'll desert you  
They would if they met you  
Met you with me  
  
Every move you make is poetry  
They all fake what you do naturally  
If not for you  
I wouldn't come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
Move your phoney ass  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Love me like I'm cash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
You can see the clash  
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Teach me with your brain  
All right  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Things that I say  
When I say nothing at all  
It leaves a taste in my stomach  
And its no taste at all  
  
I can sing, I can't dance  
But it don't stop me at all  
Its a ball and I'll call , if I call you at all  
  
Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent  
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent  
I won't be happy till the moneys been spent  
I forget to forget, oh forget, oh forget  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

There's no earthly way of knowing,  
What's in your heart when its' stopped going.  
The whole world shook,  
The storm was blowing through you.  
  
Waiting for god,  
To stop this.  
I'm too young and,  
And darkness.  
Everyone around you was corrupted,  
Say something.  
  
There's no dignity in death,  
To sell the world your last breath.  
Your still fighting over everything you left,  
Oh.  
  
I saw you standing at the gate,  
When Marlon Brando passed away.  
You had that look upon your face,  
Advertising Space.  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
Oh  
  
Through your eyes the world was burning,  
Please be gentle I'm still learning.  
He seemed to say,  
As you kept turning up.  
  
They poisoned you with compromise,  
At what point did you realize.  
Everybody loves your life,  
But you.  
  
A special agent for the man,  
Water gates and Vietnam.  
No one really gave a damn,  
Do you think the CIA did?  
  
I saw you standing at the gate,  
When Marlon Brando passed away.  
You had that look upon your face,  
Advertising Space.  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
Oh oh  
  
And no one learned from your mistakes,  
The little profits go to waste.  
All that's left in any case,  
Is advertising space.  
I've seen your daughter man she's cute,  
I was scared but I wanted to.  
Boy she looks a lot like you.

I sit and wait  
Does an angel contemplate my fate  
And do they know  
The places where we go  
When we're grey and old  
'cos I have been told  
That salvation lets their wings unfold  
So when I'm lying in my bed  
Thoughts running through my head  
And I feel the love is dead  
I'm loving angels instead  
  
And through it all she offers me protection  
A lot of love and affection  
Whether I'm right or wrong  
And down the waterfall  
Wherever it may take me  
I know that life won't break me  
When I come to call she won't forsake me  
I'm loving angels instead  
  
When I'm feeling weak  
And my pain walks down a one way street  
I look above  
And I know I'll always be blessed with love  
And as the feeling grows  
She breathes flesh to my bones  
And when love is dead  
I'm loving angels instead  
  
And through it all she offers me protection  
A lot of love and affection  
Whether I'm right or wrong  
And down the waterfall  
Wherever it may take me  
I know that life won't break me  
When I come to call she won't forsake me  
I'm loving angels instead  
  
And through it all she offers me protection  
A lot of love and affection  
Whether I'm right or wrong  
And down the waterfall  
Wherever it may take me  
I know that life won't break me  
When I come to call she won't forsake me  
I'm loving angels instead

Well I'm standing here looking at you  
What do I see?  
I'm looking straight through  
It's so sad  
When you're young  
To be told  
You're having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
Well I'm standing here what do I see?  
A big nothing  
Threatening me  
It's so sad  
When you're young  
To be told  
You're having fun  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'

And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
Don't tread on an ant he's done nothing to you  
There might come a day  
When he's treading on you  
Don't tread on an ant you'll end up black and blue  
You cut off his head  
Legs come looking for you  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
'ant music' 'ant music'  
  
So unplug the jukebox  
And do us all a favour  
That music's lost its taste  
So try another flavour -

Come into the parish of wisdom  
But leave your nervous system  
With the bouncer on the door  
Sell your innocence  
For a decade of decadence  
Everything all at once all the time is yours  
  
Don't believe in Jesus Christ  
Since I believed in your cocaine  
All that praying and wailing will leave a stain  
So take your Sunday songs and shove it  
  
Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
They'll come bearing you  
And charge the earth for it  
If you're lucky they'll let you breathe  
So scream as you go faster  
If that's the world you're after  
But make sure you're home for tea  
  
Don't believe in clever people  
Clever people drop the bomb  
Don't believe your big and evil, they're aliens  
So take your rocket science and shove it  
  
Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
"We interrupt this song for a newsflash  
Daisy, the first sheep to be cloned  
Has died today at the rivaled age of 101... days  
Other news:  
Two people burned to death whilst they were on the internet  
And now to the sport"  
  
Hey now, my baby, maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
Hey now, my baby, maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be  
  
Hey now, my baby, maybe now were free  
With the appliance of science  
We can be anyone we want to be

I was born long ago  
I am the chosen I'm the one  
I have come to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  
So that's why you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don' tknow why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We haven't changed and rearranged  
And turn this planet back to one  
So tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
We've got to love and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and fall in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know got to know

You say you're sick and tired  
Of feeling sick and tired  
I walked and told the truth  
Do you wish I'd stayed alive?  
  
'Cause she said that you said that I said  
She said that I said the love's dead  
And I tried to explain  
Don't expect you to be the same  
  
On this rockin' rollercoaster, an emotional ride  
We were just an average b-side  
We were just an average b-side  
  
I watched the past run by on the silver screen  
We played our parts and died, scene by scene  
When she said that you said that I said  
She said that I said the love's dead  
And I try to explain  
Don't expect you to feel the same  
  
On this rockin' rollercoaster, an emotional ride  
We were just an average b-side, oh, b-side  
  
Pretend you like me  
Pretend I like you  
Pretend, pretend, pretend  
This is not happening  
  
Oh, rockin' rollercoaster, an emotional ride (this is not happening)  
We were just an average b-side (this is not happening)  
Oh, rockin' rollercoaster, an emotional ride  
We were just an average b-side  
We were just an average b-side  
We were just an average b-side  
You say you're sick and tired  
Of feeling sick and tired  
I walked and told the truth  
Do you wish I'd stayed alive?  
  
'Cause she said that you said that I said  
She said that I said the love's dead  
And I tried to explain  
Don't expect you to be the same

I've got you rainbows seen your sunbeams  
I know a place where heaven breathes  
And it's through her window  
Your baby girl's window  
  
I know you're happy where you are  
Singing to the moon talking to the stars  
Through her window  
Your baby girl's window  
  
There's fingermarks around her soul  
But your laughter fills the hole  
Through her window  
Your baby girl's window  
  
Aaah I wish you would stay  
Aaah to see what she made of herself  
  
People say you were gone too soon  
I see your face when flowers bloom  
Through her window  
Your baby girl's window  
I'm looking for the words to say  
Something to take her pain away  
Through her window  
Aaah I wish you would stay  
Aaah to see what she made of herself  

"Gonna do something you might know,  
But don't worry it gets better at the chorus")  
  
I guess now it's time for me to throw up  
I feel it's time  
Got a picture of you beside me  
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,  
Wash it off  
Got a fist of pure emotion  
Got a head of shattered dreams  
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now  
  
[Chorus]  
whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it  
I just want you back for good  
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it  
You'll be right and understood  
  
Unaware but underlined I figured out the story  
It wasn't good  
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory  
But it wasn't to be  
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free  
Can't you find a little room inside for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we'll be together, this time is forever  
So complete in our love  
We will never be uncovered again  
  
Mosh!  
  
[Chorus]

Dear Eva Friedel  
Got a brand new needle for you  
You said weed was evil  
So we smoked it in the lobby in the hotel foyer  
It wasn't even noon yet  
We didn't want to peak too soon yet  
But when the sun goes down through the after glow  
The night is yours, but your mother should never know  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a bastard, plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
  
Eva tore my heart out  
I got wasted in action  
But you know that I am a sucker for  
Instant satisfaction  
There's nothing more obscene now than seeing where I've been  
But you learn you know, to see the after glow  
You've got to burn to grow, but your  
Mother should never know  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a bastard, plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
  
You were everything, everything,  
Everything to me  
You were everything, everything,  
Everything to me  
You were everything, everything,  
Everything to me  
You were everything, everything,  
Everything to me  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a baster, plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
Everything, everything, everything to me you were everything,  
Everything,  
Everything to me  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
'Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
You were everything, thing, thing,  
Everything to me  
I still love you, I do  
Everything, everything, everything now

I'm gonna write you a letter  
I think the sooner the better  
'Cause the time is right to find a better day  
  
I'm an angry young man  
Man I wish I was young  
My guitar is out of tune even that's highly strung  
  
And the words we didn't say last night  
Shook the world to the core  
We had nothing to say last night  
We'd said it all before  
And I say  
  
Lonely times and lonely tears  
Will fade away when you disappear  
The time is right for me to stray  
I'm gonna find a better day  
  
Kickin' off cause it suits me  
I'm gonna leave the country  
And the time is right to find a better day  
  
Makin' sense of my past now  
I'll only love when I want to  
Cause the time is right to find a better day  
  
Maybe I didn't love you  
Maybe you loved her less  
Would you have preferred it  
If I'd have worn the dress  
Cos I say  
  
Lonely times and lonely tears  
Will fade away when you disappear  
The time is right for me to stray  
I'm gonna find a better day  
  
Lonely times and lonely tears  
Will fade away when you disappear  
The time is right for me to stray  
I'm gonna find a better day  
  
No where to run to baby  
No where to hide  
I got no where to run to baby  
And nowhere to hide

Send someone to love me  
I need to rest in arms  
Keep me safe from harm  
In pouring rain  
  
Give me endless summer  
Lord I fear the cold  
Feel I'm getting old  
Before my time  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord I'm doing all I can  
To be a better man  
  
Go easy on my concious  
'Cause it's not my fault  
I know I've been taught  
To take the blame  
  
Rest assured my angels  
Will catch my tears  
Walk me out of here  
I'm in pain  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord I'm doing all I can  
To be a better man  
  
Once you've found that lover  
You're homeward bound  
Love is all around  
Love is all around  
  
I know some have fallen  
On stony ground  
But love is all around  
  
Send someone to love me  
I need to rest in arms  
Keep me safe from harm  
In pouring rain  
  
Give me endless summer  
Lord I fear the cold  
Feel I'm getting old  
Before my time  
  
As my soul heals the shame  
I will grow through this pain  
Lord I'm doin' all I can  
To be a better man

Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me,  
My lover stands on golden sands,  
And watches the ships that go sailing.  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
She's there watching for me,  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing.  
  
It's far beyond a star,  
It's near beyond the moon.  
And beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon.  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore,  
We'll kiss just as before,  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea,  
And never again I'll go sailing

On the road to Damascus  
I met you and the task was thankless  
We were carefree and classless  
And then you changed  
I'm nouveau rich  
What can I do  
  
You're legionnaires on a summer breeze  
It's who you do  
You had something to put to me now  
I got something I'm gonna stick in you  
  
I couldn't give a flying toss 'bout the relatives you lost  
I think it's better that  
Your bloodline stops from here  
On in and  
Whoops there I go again  
With friends that I wanna rip apart  
  
Limb by limb  
Soak the skin with paraffin  
Drop a row  
Hit'n the limb  
And Max let's see what happens  
Hey now you're getting in my way now  
You're a waste of time  
You're a waste of time  
  
You got under my radar  
You said kicking shins in the clock end  
Was just a phase so I paged ya  
And you became my new best friend  
For a while  
  
I should have known you were a psychopath  
It's who you do  
I was lonely we were having a laugh  
Should have known but worshipped a few  
  
I couldn't give a flying toss 'bout the relatives you lost  
I think it's better that  
Your bloodline stops from here  
On in and  
Whoops there I go again  
With friends that I'd like to tear apart  
  
Limb by limb  
Soak the skin with paraffin  
Drop a row  
Hit'n the limb  
Oh Max let's see what happens  
  
Hey now there's nothing left to say now  
You're just a waste of time

You're the Mona Lisa,  
You're The ravin Papa,  
You're the stupid baby,  
Ur the blue blue swade swade shoessss,  
  
You're the angel from hell,  
The devil from heven,  
Have you ever been to haven holidays,  
Ur the blue blue swade swade shoessss  
  
Youre the preminition,  
Youre the inspiration  
Youre the demolition  
In those blue swade shoessss  
  
In those, in those in those blue swade shoes  
In those in those in those blue swade shoes in those  
Blue swade shoeeeeeeees

I was there to witness  
Candice's inner business  
She wants the boys to notice  
Her rainbows, and her ponies  
She was educated  
But could not count to ten  
How she got lots of different horses  
By lots of different men  
And I say  
  
Liberate your sons and daughters  
The bush is high  
But in the hole there's water  
You can get some, when they give it  
Nothing sacred, but it's a living  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too loud or a little too close  
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat  
And she thinks she's made of candy  
  
Ring a ring of roses  
Whoever gets the closest  
She comes and she goes  
As the war of the roses  
Mother was a victim  
Father beat the system  
By moving bricks to Brixton  
And learning how to fix them  
Liberate your sons and daughters  
The bush is high  
But in the hole there's water  
As you win  
She'll be the Hollywood love  
And if it don't feel good  
What are you doing this for  
Now tell me  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too loud or a little too close  
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat  
And she thinks she's made of candy  
  
Liberate your sons and daughters  
The bush is high  
But in the hole there's water  
As you win  
She'll be the Hollywood love  
And if you don't feel good  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
What are you doing it for  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too loud or a little too close  
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat  
And she thinks she's made of candy  
  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too high or a little too low  
Got no self-esteem and vertigo  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy  
Hey ho here she goes  
Either a little too loud or a little too close  
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat  
And she thinks she's made of candy

Take your time, to unwind  
You will find it's love you are living  
Clear the space, find a place  
You will see it's love you are giving.  
  
Take you time to make things last  
Love for the future, not the past  
I can't change the way I am  
This is all I got, this Cheap Love Song  
  
Take your time, make it rhyme  
You will see it's all believing  
One fine day, we'll find a way  
You will reach your own destination.  
  
Seven clowns with different faces  
Love we've lost, but we're still chasing  
One day we'll leave this town,  
It's all we've got, this Cheap Love Song.  
  
Take your time, feel fine  
You will see, it's all believing.  
One fine day, we'll find a way  
You will reach your own destination.  
  
Come on, carry on now  
  
Better make a try now  
Hold your head up high now  
Win love.  
It's nothing superficial,  
Been wrote to break the dish, oh  
I'm making it 'ficial  
In love.  
  
Carry on now

It's in the laxative they're cutting in the cocaine baby  
It's in the heroin, the ecstasy they're mixing lately  
Give me the boys and girls in bathrooms getting plenty friendly  
  
With just the thought of us debauched and in the missionary  
  
Watch me out of my skull  
Watch me out of my mind  
I'm out of control  
But I'm still alive  
Go get me cigarettes  
Watch the circus pass by  
Twos up on an eighth  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
I'll keep on kneeling  
For my chemical devotion  
Let me kiss the ceiling  
It's just a notion for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
It's in the black sick and the choking on the blood and your  
Tears  
It's in the echo of the jackdaw ringing in your ears  
Watch me out of my gates  
Ill advised, unprepared  
No one gave a shit  
When nobody cared  
Another wasted talent  
But that's just fine  
Two's up on an eighth  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
I'll keep on stealing  
For my chemical devotion  
Don't kiss the ceiling  
More than a potion for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
I can't take the fever from you  
I don't want to neither  
They're dropping science on you  
You just need a breather  
I'll be looking over you  
  
Overlooking me  
It's all in God's time  
All back to mine  
  
What a feeling  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
So appealing  
This chemical devotion  
Got to kiss the ceiling  
More than an ocean for you  
More than a feeling  
That sweet devotion for you  
  
Shallow in the deep end  
Got steep my sweet dysfunction  
And I can depend  
On chemical devotion  
It's like my best friend  
That keeps the world in motion  
I've got to defend  
My chemical devotion

There was a time  
When crazy days would start with wine  
And now I tow a different line  
I stay in bed and use my loaf instead of my bread  
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long  
That something's gonna go wrong  
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But I'm clean yeah  
Friends with Mr Sheen yeah  
Don't have to wean myself up on nothing  
I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
Stroll on  
  
There was a time  
When I would dread what I had said  
Waking up in someone's bed  
Wondering who I was  
Naked and cold  
With an ache in my head  
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long  
That's something's gonna go wrong  
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But I'm clean yeah  
Friends with Charlie Sheen yeah  
Don't have to wean myself up on nothing  
I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
  
I'm clean yeah  
Gonna meet the queen yeah  
I won't be obscene yeah  
'Cos I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
Stroll on and on and on and on and on  
Oh yeah  

At the first sign of the morning light  
Old Glory is in the sky  
Cross the pond it's afternoon and the Union Jack flies high  
We're on our first cup of coffee, we're on our third cup of tea  
We can't pretend to live on different planets, you and me  
In this collision of worlds, watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds, oh you can't sit this out no more  
  
Abbey Road, Route 66, cia to the mi6, right lane, left lane  
Metric, Imperial, pounds, dollars, howdy, cheerio  
V8 growl to a V12 scream, Hail to the Chief, well God Save the Queen  
Cops, bobbies, tabasco, wasabi, pistachio ice cream!  
In this collision of worlds, it's too late you can't stop it now  
In this collision of worlds, yeah, find your place and just watch it now,
watch it now  
  
Yeah you're a good old boy, well you're at decent bloke  
I say it's irony, I say it's a joke  
When I look around now I can see  
We ain't so different, you and me  
  
Meat and potatoes, bangers and mash  
Dollars, pounds, dosh, cash, autobahn to the rising sun  
The I10 to the M1, Congress, Parliament, president, the queen  
Petrol you say, gasoline now grab your bird and get your girl now  
It's a small world  
Collision of worlds, watch the new day dawn on a distant shore  
In this collision of worlds, no you can't sit this out no more  
It's a collision of worlds  
It's too late, you can't stop it now  
Collision of worlds find your place and watch it now, watch it now

Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away  
If you can use some exotic booze  
There's a bar in far Bombay  
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away  
  
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru  
In lama land, there's a one man band  
And he'll toot his flute for you  
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue  
  
Once I get you up there,  
Where the air is rarefied  
We'll just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
I'll be holding you so near  
You may here, angels cheer - just because we're together  
  
Weather wise it's such a lovely day  
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco Bay  
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say  
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away  
  
Hit it Jack  
  
Once I get you up there,  
Where the air is rarefied  
We'll just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
I'll be holding you so near  
And you may here, angels cheer - just because we're together  
  
Weather wise it's such a kooky day  
Just say the words, and I'll beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco Bay  
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say  
Come fly with me  
Pack up let's fly away

This is "T" to the mother fucking "Ofty"

Dickhead

When I look you in the eyes,  
Something deep inside me dies,  
'Cause I know you won't get better, better, better  
You'd rather be right done with love,  
The only thing I understood  
Nothing's ever good enough.  
  
I stumble through the words as they're leaving me,  
Tremble at the side of Your Majesty,  
And I cut myself just to get them out.  
  
This time I'll be different, I promise you,  
This time I'll be special, you know I will,  
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.  
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,  
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,  
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
  
You took my youth, you took my health,  
And if you're not here I find myself  
You're supposed to make this better, better, better  
No self-control and no reason why,  
If I don't change, then we both die,  
This is it for you and I.  
  
Blisters at the end of my fingertips,  
Praying to a god I don't think exist  
Will you listen now?  
Can you forgive me somehow?  
  
This time I'll be different, I promise you,  
This time I'll be special, you know I will,  
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.  
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,  
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,  
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
  
Closer now to the end,  
If love was the answer,  
Then what was the question?  
Closer now, let's pretend  
We've never been out here before.  
  
This time I'll be different, I promise you,  
This time I'll be special, you know I will,  
don't leave with me in your eyes.  
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,  
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,  
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
While we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will!

This is a song full of metaphors  
All I be needing is  
Tobacco and draw  
Better let me into your  
Country though  
Then I can show you what  
You're missing me for  
I'm a night kind of animal  
Got a receiver  
What you testing me for  
I was scared so I ate 'em all  
They tasted good  
But they make me look old  
  
And ooh, you teach  
Like a toothache,  
I'm not here for my sake,  
How long will this mickey take  
And ooh,  
There's heavy entertainment,  
Out here on the pavement  
The men about you gotta  
Get away  
  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
  
I'll think you're famous  
If that's what ya want  
But you can pick your  
Own pulpit,  
You must fill your own fonts  
Bring some wine  
And some sensodyne  
Then you can be my  
Favorite dodo  
Anyone fancy Monaco  
I'm a placebo they're  
Chasing me fool  
Don't be scared  
You could eat 'em all  
They taste good  
But they make you look old  
  
Ooh, you sick little cup cake,  
You could be a keepsake,  
You jukebox to generate  
And ooh,  
I'm heavy entertainment  
In need of containment  
I'm mad about you  
Gotta get away  
  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
  
Anyone fancy Monaco?  
  
Go get a portable  
Recliner bin  
Must take a photo for sure  
Got our our problems and  
A real long name  
And she gets high on  
Rollin' roll-ups  
  
And ooh, you teach  
Like a toothache,  
I'm not here for my sake,  
How long will this mickey take  
And ooh,  
There's heavy entertainment,  
Out here on the pavement  
The men about you gotta  
Get away  
  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?  
Do, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ya mind,  
If I, I, I, I, I, I touch ya?

I could be an animal for many years to come  
It would be understandable if this animal had fun  
My wayward soul will never set me free  
And commitment's a miracle, and I'm physical, you see  
  
I'm not your lover, baby  
I'm not the one  
I won't meet your mother, lady  
I don't do love  
  
You won't buy my attitude,  
So it's solitude for free  
And I can't help being rude,  
If you get to close to me  
You are the one, with your finger on the gun  
So I am that animal, and animals will run  
  
I'm not your love's, baby  
I'm not the one  
I won't meet your mother, lady  
I don't do love  
  
I can't believe  
It's not in me  
You see me leave  
If I can't breathe  
  
I could be an animal, for many years to come  
It would be understandable, if this animal had fun  
And I've got my alibi, so I'll say goodbye  
  
I'm not your lover, baby  
I'm not the one  
I've been too smothered lately  
I don't do love  
  
I can't believe  
That you can't see  
It's not in me  
Now see me leave  
  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love

When we were only 17  
And thrown into society  
That was the end of you and me  
From what we could have been  
  
And if we didn't keep in touch  
I guess we didn't care that much  
We never understood that stuff  
But now I need you  
  
I never meant to let you down  
But lettin' you down was easy  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your lives, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you aren't  
But don't say no  
  
We fought together laughed together  
Said things that we hoped were clever  
The thought of missing you forever  
Makes me wanna cry  
  
And now that you've grown up to be  
A sentimental memory  
Are you still you 'cause I'm still me  
At least I hope so  
  
A life beginning somewhere else  
It was our time to die  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you aren't  
Don't say no  
  
So, what do you know?  
Where do you go, has it been fun?  
Oh, did you survive being buried alive  
Like I did?  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and you want  
Don't say no  
  
Didn't it break your heart  
Maybe I'm just too needy  
Do any of you still need me  
In your life, in your heart  
  
Don't say yes just to please me  
If you're still you and then you aren't  
Don't say no

Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper "I Love You"  
Birds singing in the sycamore trees  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say nighty-night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me

Where were you when you stole my pride  
Did you ever get the feeling thatsomeone died  
Hide away in your ivory tower  
And cover me in your golden shower  
Did I make you laugh when I played the clown  
And was I the dog that bit you when you put it down  
Break it nicely break it slow  
Break it so I got no place to go  
  
Ego a go go now you've gone solo  
Living on a memory  
Where've you been lately  
And do you still hate me  
Could you offer an apology  
  
Aaah turn away  
Aaah fade to grey  
  
Where were you when the party ended  
Were you stitching up the wounds  
That you thought I need mending  
Wonderland has crashed to the ground  
The circus has gone all that's left is the clowns  
Did I break your heart when I stole your thunder  
Was there woodworm in the table your feet are under  
Break it nicely break it slow  
Break it so I got no place to go  
  
Ego a go go now you've gone solo  
Living on a memory  
Now you've gone stately  
And yes you do hate me  
Could you offer an apology  
  
Aaah turn away  
Aaah fade to grey  
Aaah I hope you've strayed  
Aaah and got laid  
  
Ego a go go

Close your eyes so your don't feel them  
They don't need to see you cry  
I can't promise I will heal you  
But if you want to I will try  
  
I'll sing this somber serenade  
The past is done  
We've been betrayed  
It's true  
Someone said the truth will out  
I believe without a doubt, in you  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you gave me what I need  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
For eternity  
  
Yesterday when you were walking  
We talked about your mum and dad  
What they did that made you happy  
What they did that made you sad  
We sat and watched the sun go down  
Picked a star before we lost the moon  
Youth is wasted on the young  
Before you know it's come and gone to soon  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you gave me what I need  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
For eternity  
  
For eternity  
I'll sing this somber serenade  
The past is done  
We've been betrayed  
It's true  
Youth is wasted on the young  
Before you know it's come and gone to soon  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you are a friend indeed  
And I hope you find your freedom  
For eternity  
  
You were there for summer dreaming  
And you are a friend indeed  
And I know you'll find your freedom  
Eventually  
For eternity  
For eternity

Everytime we say goodbye  
I die a little  
Everytime we say goodbye  
I wonder why a little  
Why the gods above me  
Who must be in the know  
Think so little of me  
They allow you to go  
  
When you're near  
There's such an air  
Of spring about it  
I can hear a lark somewhere  
Begin to sing about it  
There's no love song finer  
But how strange the change  
From major to minor  
Everytime we say goodbye  
  
There's no love song finer  
But how strange the change  
From major to minor  
Everytime we say goodbye

Written by Stephen Duffey  
  
All aboard the family coach  
It's leaving Greenbank Road  
Christmas 1981  
Christmas when it snowed  
Whilst on board the family coach  
They were circlin' the moon  
No one had been there before  
They were landing there in June  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Meanwhile on the family coach  
The postillion quietly spoke  
He said, "You can not leave your family coach  
This is not a joke  
We must work out our differences  
Though none of us may change  
We all take different routes through life  
But your coach will stay the same. "  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Back onboard Apollo 8  
They had gone behind  
And the human family held it's breath  
And wondered what they'd find  
Our family coach can stay on earth  
Or be a rocket ship  
But wherever, wherever you may go  
Your kin will share the trip  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Now it might well appear to you  
That they were simpler days  
And the family coach is smaller now  
Some have passed away  
But there's never been a golden age  
Nostalgia's for the lame  
The best is yet to come, my dear  
It's that kind of game  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Hey, hey, family coach  
My family coach  
You've got to make the most  
The most of your family coach

Come and hold my hand  
I wanna contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role I've been given  
I sit and talk to God  
And he just laughs at my plans  
My head speaks a language  
I don't understand  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
'Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins  
Going to waste  
I don't wanna die  
But I ain't keen on living either  
Before I fall in love  
I'm preparing to leave her  
  
Scare myself to death  
That's why I keep on running  
Before I've arrived  
I can see myself coming  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
'Cause I got too much life  
Running through my veins  
Going to waste  
And I need to feel  
Real love and the love ever after  
I cannot get enough  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love feel the home that I live in  
I got too much love  
Running through my veins  
To go to waste  
  
I just wanna feel  
Real love and the love ever after  
There's a hole in my soul  
You can see it in my face  
It's a real big place  
  
Come and hold my hand  
I wanna contact the living  
Not sure I understand  
This role I've been given  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand  
Not sure I understand

Sometimes I feel like I am  
Sailing on a sunken dream  
I try to read the signs  
But I don't know what they mean  
I know when I'm with you  
I'm a rich man baby  
  
Grace, I'm not yet born  
Come embrace  
A soul that's torn  
I have got so much to give you  
  
My heart is starved of love  
In these radio days  
I try to listen hard  
To what my conscience says  
I know I've sold my soul  
I'm going to earn it back now  
  
Grace, I'm not yet born  
Come embrace  
A soul that's torn  
I have got so much to give you  
  
Now that you believe in me  
We can fly away  
Somewhere safe  
I know that you will always be  
Giving more than you take  
  
I know when I'm with you  
I'm a rich man baby  
Grace, I'm not yet born  
Come embrace  
A soul that's torn  
Grace, it can mend if you make my heart your friend  
  
Grace  
Grace  
Grace  
Grace  

Hello. Did you miss me?  
I know I'm hard to resist  
Y'all can come and help me pick the sweetcorn out of this.  
It's hard to be humble  
When you're so fucking big  
Did you ever meet a sexier male chauvinist pig  
  
I'm gonna milk it till I turn it into cheese  
Tell your babes in arms and OAP's  
Come take a piece of me  
  
If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you  
If you don't see me I don't exist  
It's nice to meet you  
Now let me go and wash my hands  
Cause you just met the world's most handsome man  
The world's most handsome man  
  
Y'all know who I am  
I'm still the boy next door  
That's if you're Lord Litchfield and Roger Moore  
If I've gone up in the world  
Or is the world gone down on me  
I'm the one who put the Brits in celebrity  
  
Give in and love it  
What's the point in hating me  
You can't argue with popularity  
Well you could  
But you'd be wrong  
  
If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you  
If you don't need me I don't exist  
You voted for me  
Now let me see a show of hands  
Keeping for your stands  
  
Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph  
Though it's not for me  
Flip a grin, shake a thing, name a shame  
Then I'm out of here  
It's not very complicated  
I'm just young and overrated  
  
Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you  
If you don't see me I don't exist  
It's nice to meet you  
Now let me go and wash my hands  
Keeping for your stands  
  
Please don't drop me I'll fall to pieces on you  
If you don't need me I don't exist  
It's nice to meet you  
Now let me see a show of hands  
Cause you just met the world's most handsome man  
The world's most handsome man  
The world's most handsome man  
The world's most handsome man

Let's all make babies  
And salsa from Sainsbury's  
'Cause this is a Happy Song  
Play on my pink flute  
But make it through Beirut  
'Cause this is a happy song  
  
You need a mood maker  
Then go meet my tailor  
I know it's going too fast  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Is getting on with it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah ( debonair )  
I'm feeling so debonair ('cause I care )  
Send you my love 'cause I care (it's a love song )  
This is a love song  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
Goose step through Gangland  
And drive Chitty Ban Bang  
'Cause this is a happy song  
Bosnians and Kurds  
Back with some big bird  
Who's singing a happy song  
  
Fly in the sunshine  
Get there at your own time  
You tell us if I'm in Hong Kong  
Your sister your brother  
His mistress your lover  
Just singing a happy song  
  
[Chorus :]  
  
Happy Song  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do  
  
Yeah (debonair)  
I'm feeling so debonair (in the air)  
Everything's up in the air (from Jamaica)  
Tease me from bedtime  
We bring news from Jamaica  
  
[Chorus :]  
This is a happy song

"Have you met Miss Jones?"  
Someone said as we shook hands  
She was just Miss Jones to me  
And then I said "Miss Jones,  
  
You're a girl who understands,  
I'm a man who must be free."  
And all at once I lost my breath,  
And all at once was scared to death  
  
And all at once, I owned the earth and sky  
But now I've met Miss Jones  
And we'll keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
  
And all at once I lost my breath,  
And all at once was scared to death  
And all at once I owned the earth and sky  
And now I've met Miss Jones  
  
And we'll keep on meeting till we die  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I  
Miss Jones and I

Know no fear I'll still be here tomorrow  
Bend my ear I'm not gonna go away  
You are love so why do you shed a tear  
Know no fear you will see heaven from here  
  
I'll shelter you make it alright to cry  
And you'll help too, cos the faith in myself  
Has run dry  
We are love and I just wanna hold you near  
Know no fear we will see heaven from here  
  
I see real love in your eyes  
And it fills me up when you start to cry  
  
I just wanna hold you near  
We will see heaven from here  
  
Well it all seems out of reach  
I will take the blame if it keeps the peace  
My shelf life's short  
Wish they'd make it more easy to follow  
And I've been caught with nothing but  
Love on my mind  
We are love don't let it fall on deaf ears  
Now it's clear we have seen heaven from here  

There's something crawling up my wrist  
I think it's dying  
Bless the Lord  
I can't think straight anymore  
  
You won't see me crying  
There'll be tears before bedtime for sure  
  
Singing  
I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim in the ocean  
I wanna play in the sea  
I wanna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me, me  
  
I'm gonna buy a farm  
Write a song  
It won't change the earth  
Just the people on it  
  
I was born with  
A silver shovel in my mouth  
Golden balls and a platinum smile  
  
You won't hear the last of  
The good, the bad or the brassed off, for sure  
  
Singing  
I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim with the dolphins  
I wanna play in the sea  
I'm gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me  
  
Then buy a farm  
Write a song  
It won't change the earth  
Just the people on it  
  
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down  
Hip to hip  
Lip to lip  
Free your love  
Free love  
Free love  
  
Singing I won't go to war  
Lay down your guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna swim with the dolphins  
I'm gonna play in the sea  
I'm gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me, me  
  
Singing I won't go to war  
Lay down my guns  
What are we fighting for  
  
I wanna play with the dolphins  
I want to play in the sea  
I'm gonna love my brother  
Love my brother loving me, me  
  
Hear the sound of a million people sitting down  
Hip to hip  
Lip to lip  
Free your love  
Free love  
Free love

Yeah!  
  
Queen Bitch, eat the rich  
I'm on the second course today.  
I'm not the first  
And I won't be the worst  
You done most of LA.  
Can't find a virgin  
I can get you a surgeon  
24 hours a day.  
Wasn't Jean Genie a Rolling Stones hit?  
I'm about to be blown away.  
  
Come on, sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
And we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to LA.  
  
Take the piss  
I was English  
God bless you Uncle Sam.  
You got a cool gene pool  
And I went to school  
And God knows I love to tan.  
Making cents and dead presidents  
Before I could count to ten.  
With the nation behind me  
Can't stop the limey  
She's on her back again.  
  
Come on, sing it  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
'Cause we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to LA, LA, LA  
  
Take me to the place where the sunshine flows  
Oh my sunset rodeo.  
  
Hot fudge  
Here comes the judge  
There's a green card and a way  
The holy ghost  
And the whole east coast  
Are moving to LA  
'Cause we've been  
Dreaming of this feeling  
Since 1988  
Mother, things have got to change  
I'm moving to  
  
Keep a-moving keep a-moving, keep a-moving to LA  
Mo, mo, mo, mo

I am all of the above babe  
Johnny long strokes to the grave  
Saving all the stamps and spend it on a kettle  
  
Rub me rub me up right lovely  
If you lick it, then lick it battery  
Good and properly all night if you want  
  
I haven't got a clue what to do with you  
I need for you to love me so much  
Jesus what am I gonna do with this crush  
Just get the old fella and wack it up against her tush  
  
How peculiar  
  
Bend your long legs against the sofa  
In the Dorchester you can get your All Bran  
I'm not into hard sports  
  
Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you  
Jesus all the things my head is going through  
God what am I going to do with this crush  
Just wack the old man out and get it up against your tush  
  
How peculiar  
  
Jesus what am I to do man  
I am a depressed man  
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day  
How peculiar  
  
I am all of the above man  
I have what you want man  
If you want me here I am  
Come and get it baby

(Hello, hello, hello)  
  
Yoko's cutting keys in Soho  
I've been there and I should know oh face it  
I'll stick up for Aunty Sally  
Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant  
Mia Farrow's patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit  
Robin Cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it  
  
I'm the reserection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it  
Norris Mcwhirter's doing furters in a little place how's he fake it  
It's another appetiser I can go and buy a Tizer laced fit  
I don't know where I've been but I know where I've been is near a lake  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
I live for rock and roll  
  
(Sock it to me daddy)  
  
I am an erection  
I may steal your soul  
I am fairly evil  
Only for rock and roll  
  
(Dance dance)  
(yeah yeah)  
  
(Hello, hello)

I walk into a room  
I say how do you do  
They look at me and I look back at them  
I slip into a chair  
They say are you prepared I said I do not know  
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain  
Sometimes I need and want them through my vains  
Now there's ten in front of me  
Asking me what do I see  
I see nothing but butterflies and  
Tests I did not know  
The answers will not show  
And all I see is butterflies and  
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain  
Sometimes the answer's running to my brains  
And in the long run you always said I'll be there beside you  
And in the long run you always thought I'll be there to guide you  
Sometimes I feel it but I can't explain  
Sometimes I need it like a running train  
Sometimes I feel it in my pride  
Sometimes I take it in my stride  
Slow down feelings  
Loved up with you  
I can't feel my legs  
I can't feel you  
Slow down feelings  
Loved up with you  
The night before an hour, too  
On my back and leaving you  
Falling down the stairs and seen it through  
Falling down feelin' this  
Monday morning I feel out of sorts  
But that's ok  
Dried up and dreaming  
Punching and screaming  
Feeling the morning through  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuududududu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuudu  
Duuududududuududududu

Is the Richard Gere Gerbil story true  
Who came third in World War 2  
Did Sooty sleep with Sue,  
These things I think about,  
When I'm with out with you...  
What are the holes in biro's for  
Which one's which in the Corrs

Coz frankly your a bore,  
And I'm not...  
And if it's leavin' season your second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will,  
I tried love, I'm sorry

Does God ever get it wrong  
Where has Gary Barlow gone  
Why is Christmas Day so long  
It just goes on and on... And on,  
Like you,  
And if it's leavin' season your the second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will,  
I tried love, I'm sorry

Duh duh, duh duh...  
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh,  
Duh duh, duh duh,  
I tried love, I'm sorry

Why is there ketchup on my sleeve  
Do you think Adam fancied Eve  
What if Eve could not conceve  
And he had to breed with Steve,  
We'd all be gay....  
(Laughs......)

Now I'm the king of the swingers  
Oh, the jungle VIP  
I've reached the top and had to stop  
And that's what botherin' me  
I wanna be a man, mancub  
And stroll right into town  
And be just like the other men  
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!  
  
Oh, oobee doo

Gee, cousin Louie  
You're doin' real good

Lay the secret on me of man's red fire  
  
But I don't know how to make fire  
  
Now don't try to kid me, mancub

What I desire is man's red fire  
To make my dream come true  
Give me the secret, mancub  
Clue me what to do  
Give me the power of man's red flower  
So I can be like you

I wouldn't be so alone  
If they knew my name in every home  
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone  
But I'd be too busy  
Come back to the old five and dime  
Cameron Diaz give me a sign  
I make you smile all the time  
and your conversation would complement mine  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing  
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word  
  
Buy up the rights to my book  
And live on a ranch from what the box office took  
I go on visit the set  
They'll call me their savior  
All the people wills come  
Celebrity lives on the moon  
But I'll be back home in June  
To promote 'The sequel'  
  
I will talk and Hollywood will listen  
See them bow my every word  
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing  
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word

Ooh we've got a live one, featherweight icon  
Heroes let 'im down so he sleeps with the  
Light on  
And there's nothin' left to do but kneel down  
And pray  
Sail away with Caesar if you're a non believer  
Everybody get high if you're a  
Diamond geezer  
It's the devil that needs ya so go out and play  
  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
And now it's four in the mornin' yes yes y'all in  
No one can shoot but everybody's scoring  
Trust me it's boring get down and pray  
  
They told you not to meddle with the bass and the treble  
There's dust on your needle and you think that  
You're a rebel  
  
You're Evel Knievel so get down and pray  
Blame yourself it's easier  
There's no need to trouble her you trouble her  
  
Jesus in a camper van he said sorry to  
Leave you but I've done all I can  
I suppose even the son of God  
Gets it hard sometimes  
Especially when he goes round  
Saying I am the way  
  
I am the way, I am the way, I am the way  
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the way

We're all so chic living in class A  
Partying and search sweet sorrow today  
When you don't know who your friends are  
And neither do they  
We're all so amused  
And maybe it's better that way  
She's been seen with him  
He's been seen with her  
Happy propaganda  
Just as their 5 current sur  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
We're insecure, making me think  
I'm not fit to laze your dream  
I've seen you in my bayer  
You're a real player  
Taking it easy, taking it easy  
We all know we shouldn't  
And that is why we do it  
Here's smuggler's house  
Why don't you come and view it  
Sing my way of meaning  
Karaoke overkill  
  
We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
The sooner the better  
I'll send you a letter  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker  
Give us a clue of  
Seeing the night thru  
And you're so kain  
This song ain't about you  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker

(You've been naughty...very very naughty)  
Are you cut up  
Or do you easily forget  
Are you still around  
Why haven't you managed to die yet  
You could prop up the bar in hell  
  
How do you sleep  
You've never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought you'd leave me falling forever  
Karma killer  
  
Needless to say  
I guess you know I hate you  
You're so full of sin  
Even the devil rates you  
I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
How do you breathe  
Why don't you cry  
How come you never ask me why  
You're not a man stand and deliver  
Karma killer  
  
How do you sleep  
You've never loved  
Why was I never good enough  
You thought you'd leave me falling forever  
  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
  
I hope you choke  
On your Bacardi and Coke  
  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
Look what you didn't take from me  
  
I don't need to take revenge  
Cos they're coming to get you  
There's no hope for you my friend  
Cos they're coming to get you  
  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  
Karma killer  

Oh I'm your new best mate  
Help me self-medicate  
Things can all look great  
Stopped in this town to quench my thirst  
The bad man got here first  
Then the bubble burst  
Who's telling stories  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
My love life's gone stiff  
Don't know who I've been with  
And I'm gonna take it 'cause they want to give  
Can you blame me  
Don't need to spend my bread  
People do that for me instead  
Must be thinking that I'll wake up dead  
In the morning  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
You've got a powerful lawyer  
Well I've got money for ya  
I know I appall ya  
But I fucked your daughter  
I got friends stay up till the end  
Try to screw me or my girlfriend  
Until I'm not the latest trend  
Fetch me butler  
I can't handle shit  
And it's beginning to bore me  
Just get on with it  
Kill me or cure me  
I can't handle shit  
Kill me or cure me  
I can't handle shit  
Kill me or cure me

I don't mind the abuse  
It fills in time  
When I'm not much use  
But it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
They all say  
I'm too restless  
But words cut deep  
When you're defenceless  
And they're killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
There was a time when we were fine  
And I could tolerate you  
I do believe that you should leave  
'Cause I've grown to hate you  
Should I be weak and turn my cheek  
'Cause I'm scared to fall  
But I just don't know you  
And you don't know me at all  
  
I've been told that love's a celebration  
But I've lost faith through frustration  
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly  
  
You paint my picture black  
The joke's on me  
And I don't wanna laugh  
Remember the good times  
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow  
  
I don't mind feeling blue  
If I could smile just like you do  
And it's killing me, killing me slowly  
  
I can't go on alone  
Pretending nothing's wrong  
Maybe I just want to belong  
Somewhere, somehow, somehow  

King of the Bongo  
(M. Chao)  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin' my first bongo  
  
Every monkey'd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby  
I'm the king of bongo bong  
  
I went to the big town  
Where there is a lot of sound  
From the jungle to the city  
Looking for a bigger crown  
  
Play my boogie  
For the people of big city  
But they don't go crazy  
When I'm bangin' in my boogie  
  
I'm the "king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
  
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie  
I'm the king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
I'm the king of the bongo, I'm the king of the bongo bong  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
  
They say that I'm a clown  
Making too much dirty sound  
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town  
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me  
Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie  
I'm the king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
  
Hear me when I come  
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
  
Bangin' on my bongo all that swing belongs to me  
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me  
I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town  
But I'm the king of bongo baby I'm the king of bongo bong  
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong  
Hear me when I come, baby, king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong...  
Hear me when I come  
  
Mama was queen of the mambo  
Papa was king of the Congo  
Deep down in the jungle  
I started bangin' my first bongo  
  
Every monkey'd like to be  
In my place instead of me  
Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby  
I'm the king of bongo bong  
  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
"King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong"  
Hear me when I come  
  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour  
Je ne t'aime plus mon amour  
Je ne t'aime plus tout le jour

In my young life I have received  
Callers though they were Christmas Eve  
I'm disappointed and I don't know why  
She gave me laughter and hope  
And a sock in the eye.  
  
In my young life I know something now.  
I've never tried to create a wow  
Wows are few frustration more common  
Now I can feel it in my soul  
That's why I gave the come on.  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?  
  
Faces fall before my feet  
Like blood onto a clean white sheet  
When I grow old I won't forget  
To innocence my only debt  
  
Wow I feel so fresh today  
Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay  
The stars are bright in the abyss  
Now I can feel you in my arms  
I explode inside your kiss.  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?

You said I was northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
That's fighting talk where I'm from  
And I'm not moving baby  
Spent my life dancing with shadows in strobe lights  
It's alright, everything mellows in sunlight  
  
And now London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
I've been runny nearly all my life  
It left me broken baby  
When the meter ran out on life  
I used my tokens lady  
You said I was Northern scum  
I was wounded baby  
That's fighting talk where I'm from  
And I'm not moving baby  
  
London's got its gimmicks  
And New York's had its minute  
But Knutsford City limits  
I'll never change  
  
Saw one transmission  
On the television  
Saying I can't do my job  
Well I just kept dancing  
Don't hate me 'cause I'm handsome  
And the beat will never stop  
  
Saw one transmission

Lazy days calling to you  
Come out to play  
The future lies with you  
Now you can be sure love is the cure  
What we're searching for  
Is to have a jolly good time  
  
Crazy days but you'll get me through  
And here I'll stay holding on to you  
Now you can be sure  
Our thoughts unpure  
Will unlock the door  
And we will have a jolly good time  
  
It can happen in any season  
We don't need any reason  
To sit around and wait  
The world can change in a second so  
I find the sunshine beckons me  
To open up the gate  
And dream and dream  
  
Lazy days don't let them get you down  
Wear your smile  
I don't want to see you frown  
Don't let them get you down  
  
It can happen in any season  
We don't need any reason  
To sit around and wait  
The world can change in a second so  
I find the sunshine beckons me  
To open up the gate  
And dream and dream  
  
Then we will have - a jolly good time  

Out of a million seeds  
Only the strongest one breathes  
You made a miracle mother  
I'll make a man out of me  
  
Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky?  
What did we do wrong, why did it die?  
And all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply'  
  
If you're willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I've got more than I need  
When your love shines down on me  
  
Every tear that you cry  
Will be replaced when you die  
Why don't you love your brother?  
Are you out of your mind?  
  
Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky  
What did we do wrong, why did it die  
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye  
  
If you're willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I've got more than I need  
When your love shines down on me  
  
If you're willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I can't contain how I feel  
When your love shines down on me  
Well if you want to come and make a stance  
So when it's in your hands  
People will show me love  
  
Well if you want to come and make a stance  
So when it's in your hands  
People show me love  
  
If you're willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I got more than I need  
When your love shines down on me  
  
If you're willing to change the world  
Let love be your energy  
I can't contain how I feel  
When your love shines down on me  

There may be trouble ahead  
But while there's music and moonlight and love and romance  
Let's face the music and dance  
Before the fiddlers have fled  
Before they ask us to pay the bill and while we still have the chance  
Let's face the music and dance  
Soon we'll be without the moon, humming a different tune and then  
There may be teardrops to shed  
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance  
Let's face the music and dance

Wake up on Sunday morning  
Everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
Live your life through a lens  
  
Hair is the new hat, brown is the new black  
She shouldn't wear this, he shouldn't wear that  
Pleasure and leisure, make mine a double measure with friends  
Fashion tardis down at Quo Vadis  
Who laughs the longest who drives the hardest  
Pleasure and leisure, make mine a double measure with friends  
Just because I ain't double barreled  
Don't mean I haven't traveled well  
Can't you tell!  
Oh no it's quite appalling  
Your conversation is boring as hell, oh well!  
Wake up on Sunday morning  
And everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
With your life through a lens  
  
And now your boyfriend's suspicious  
So go home and wash the dishes  
And wash them well so he can't tell  
  
She's looking real drab just out of rehab  
I'm talking football she's talking ab fab  
Your clothes are very kitch  
Just because your daddy is rich  
You sound so funny with your voice all plummy  
Now your check's just bounced better run to your mummy  
And you know it's a class act she'll never ask for it back  
  
Just because I ain't double barreled  
Don't mean I haven't traveled well  
Can't you tell!  
Mix with the local gentry and don't crash Tarquin's Bentley  
I'll take the bends with our life through a lens  
You're scared of the poor and needy  
Is that why you're all inbreedy?  
They're just like you, they need love too  
  
Wake up on Sunday morning  
And everything feels so boring  
Is that where it ends  
With your life through a lens  
  
And now your boyfriend's suspicious  
So go home and wash the dishes  
And wash them well so he can't tell

Well, I wake up in the morning  
With my hair down in my eyes  
And she says hi  
And I hurry to the breakfast table  
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye  
And she reaches out and takes my hand  
And squeezes it and says "how you feelin' Hon?"  
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart  
And I see my morning sun  
And if that's not loving me  
Then all I've got to say  
  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
There's no such thing as Dr. Suess  
Disneyland and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
And when my self is feeling low  
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind  
  
Sometimes I call him up knowing he's busy  
And ask if he could get away and meet me  
And maybe grab a bite to eat  
And he drops what he's doing and hurry's down to meet me  
And I'm always late  
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me  
Because he's made that way  
And if that's not loving me  
Then all I've got to say  
  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes  
There's no such thing as make believe  
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves, no B.B. guns  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time  
And when my self is feeling low  
I think about your face aglow and ease my mind

Bah-um, bah-um, bah-um, bah-um, bah-um  
Sun is shining, so why am I feeling the cold?  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Not surprising, something has fallen from the fold  
  
Bah-um, bah-um, bah-um  
Lonestar rising, God only knows where I'll go  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Ohh, what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um  
  
Every others passed to remind of the time  
All the lovers living in limbo divine  
Bah-um, bah-um,bah-um  
Every reason has every reason to go  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
All the seasons melt into one like the snow  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um  
No sensation, not even tears rolling down  
Bah-um  
Conversation, echoes like ghosts on the town  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
Lonestar rising, God only knows where I'll go  
Bah-um  
Ohh, what timing and how blue is the tone  
  
Bah-um, bah-um  
  
Seems like I was always drunk  
I lost myself in someone's song  
And when all is said and done  
I only wanna feel the sun  
  
Bah-um

When he saw her getting off the bus  
It seemed to wipe away the years  
Her face was older, just a little rough  
But her eyes were still so clear  
He drank his coffee and he hurried out  
Across before she walked away  
Then he approached her like a little child  
Too scared for what he had to say  
  
"Hello Louise,  
Remember me?  
Now should we part  
Or stay awhile?  
As if we were still lovers"  
  
She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before  
And as he started to apologise  
Lose any bitterness she bore  
She gently put her finger on his lips  
To let him know she understood  
And with her suitcase standing on the floor  
Embraced him like a lover would  
  
He told louise  
"You look so good  
It's just you see  
You make me feel  
As if we were still lovers"  
  
It's not always true that time heals all wounds  
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal  
The memories of something really good  
Something truly real, that you never found again  
  
As if we were still lovers  
  
And though they talked just for just a little time  
Before she said she had to go  
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign  
That told him all he had to know  
  
And so Louise  
Waved from the bus  
And as she left  
She gave that smile  
As if they were still lovers  
  
It's not always true that time heals all wounds  
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal  
The memories of something really good  
Something truly real, that I've never found again

Love is calling earth  
Do you know how much is hurts?  
I didn't die overnight  
In the wind I had candlelight  
I'm controlled by my fear  
All the voices in my head  
That I can hear  
  
Please don't hurt me  
  
How do I learn  
To give and love and be loved in return  
If this is heaven I'm falling  
I'd rather run and jump away  
Than to see it burn  
I feel I could die  
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek  
And say goodbye  
  
I'm so sorry  
Please don't hurt me  
  
This is love calling earth  
Do you know how much it hurts?  
I didn't die overnight  
In the wind I had candlelight  
  
I'm controlled by my fear  
And all the voices in my head  
That I can hear  
  
I'm so sorry  
Please don't hurt me  
  
If you could see me through my mother's eye  
Only then would you begin to realise  
All the places I have ever been  
Have scared me half to death or  
somewhere in-between  
  
I'm so sorry  
Please

It's the end of the night  
I want to know you  
Get the phone, call a cab and take you home yeah  
I think there's something you should know  
I'll send my boys an order through Interflora  
Tell you lies like "I love you" and "I adore you"  
I think there's something you should know  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
The curtain's closed  
And the night is fun  
I think it's time for me to not be home alone  
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone  
I hardly know you but I like your figure  
Suppose I'll read about you in The Mirror  
I think there's something everybody should know  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you look so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
I'm a Love Cheat  
And you're looking so sweet  
Can take you home where I live  
Lay you by the fire  
Love me, lady  
I'm a liar  
  
You love me  
You love me  
You love me  
You need me  
I'm a liar  
You want me  
You need me  
You want me  
And I'm a liar

Always and forever is forever young  
Your shadow on the pavement  
The dark side of the sun  
Gotta dream the dream all over  
And sleep here tight  
You don't want to sing the blues  
In black and white  
  
And it's hope that spring's eternal for everyone  
If it ain't broken break it or the damage done  
  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
  
Violet in the rainbow just melt away  
There's not enough minutes in the hour  
Or hours in the day  
The song played in a circle that never skips a beat  
The stranger in a country that I have yet to meet  
  
And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone  
Got a lifetime in a second oh the damage done  
  
Trying to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Guess there's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Baby lay your love on me  
  
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in  
The blind leading the blind, Lord  
Getting underneath your skin  
I can feel you in the silence  
Saying let forever be  
Love, only love, will set you free  
  
I want to love somebody  
Want to love somebody right now  
There's just no pleasing me  
I want to love somebody  
Just want to love somebody right now  
Lay lay, lay your love on me  
  
It'll come in your sweet time, Lord  
I just gotta let you in  
The blind leading the blind, Lord  
Getting underneath your skin  
I can feel you in the silence  
Saying let forever be  
Love, only love, will set you free

Some will sing a song  
To reel 'em in  
It's a song I sung before  
And a song I'm gonna sing again  
I mean every word  
I don't mean a single one of them  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Tell a joke  
Tell it twice  
If no one else is laughing there why am I  
I split myself both times and laugh till I cry  
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I don't have to try  
I just dial it in  
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering  
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones  
Beneath this skin  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
Smoking kills  
Sex sells  
I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell  
I know I'm gonna die so my revenge is living well  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
I stopped praying  
So I hope this song will do  
I wrote it all for you  
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?  
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?  
  
So I look for love  
I like the search  
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe  
Let every president get the country she deserves  
Oh Lord, make me pure  
But not yet  
  
And I've been seeing  
Somebody's wife  
She said she'd leave him for me and I said that wasn't wise  
You can't lie to a liar because of all lies  
Oh Lord, please make me pure  
Not yet

It was me and my monkey  
Him with his dungarees and roller blades  
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet
black Chevrolet  
He had the soft top down  
He liked the wind in his face  
He said "Son, you ever been to Vegas?'  
I said "No" he said "That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place"  
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he
said  
"I left my wallet in El Segundo" and proceeded to take two grand of mine  
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel  
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well  
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said  
"If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed"  
  
Me and monkey  
With a dream and a gun  
Hoping my monkey  
Don't point that gun at anyone  
Me and monkey  
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid  
Trying to understand  
Why he did what he did  
Why he did what he did  
  
And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor  
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen
before  
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke  
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages  
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke  
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door  
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores  
"Hi, my name is Sunshine.  
These are my girls.  
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world"  
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun  
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium  
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine  
"What's up?"  
"You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good
time"  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
Don't point that gun at anyone  
Me and my monkey  
Like Billy the Kid  
Trying to understand  
Why he did what he did  
Why he did what he did  
  
Got tickets to see Sheena Easton  
The monkey was high  
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died  
We left before encores  
He couldn't sit still  
Sheena was a blast baby  
But my monkey was ill  
When I played black jack  
Kept hittin' 23  
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me  
Or was it my monkey  
I couldn't be sure  
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before  
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run  
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun  
"My name is Rodriguez" he says with death in his eye  
"I've been chasing you for a long time amigos  
And now your monkey is gonna die"  
  
Me and my monkey  
Drove in search of the sun  
Me and my monkey  
We don't want to kill no Mexican  
But we got ten itchy fingers  
One thing to declare  
When the monkey is high  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
You do not stare  
  
Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy  
And I ain't about to run  
Put your gun down boy  
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow

Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely  
Standing on the corner feeling blue  
Sweethearts out for fun  
Pass me one by one  
Guess I'll wind up like I always do  
With only  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue  
Me and my shadow  
Not a soul to tell our troubles to  
And when it's twelve o'clock  
We climb the stair  
We never knock  
For nobody's there  
Just me and my shadow  
All alone and feeling blue  
When the sun sets on the far horizon  
And the parlor lamps begin to glow  
Jim and Jack and John  
Put their slippers on  
They're all set but we'restill on the go  
So lonely  
Me and my shadow  
Strolling down the avenue  
Me and my shadow  
Not a soul to tell our troubles to  
And when it's twelve o'clock  
We climb the stair  
We never knock  
For nobody's there  
Just me and my shadow  
All alone and feeling blue.

I knew a man Bojangles  
And he'd dance for you  
In worn out shoes  
  
With silver hair a ragged shirt  
And baggy pants  
He would do the old soft shoe  
  
He would jump so high  
Jump so high  
Then he lightly touch down  
  
He told me of the time he worked with  
Minstrel shows travelling  
Throughout the south  
  
He spoke with tears of fifteen years  
How his dog and he  
They would travel about.  
  
But his dog up and died  
He up and died  
And after twenty years he still grieved  
  
He said "I dance now  
At every chance in the Honky Tonks  
For my drinks and tips  
  
But most the time I spend  
Behind these country bars  
You see on I drinks a bit"  
  
Then he shook his head  
Oh lord when he shook his head  
I could swear I heard someone say please  
  
Mister Bojangles  
Call him Mister Bojangles  
Mister Bojangles come back and dance please  
  
Come back and dance again Mr Bojangles

And now the end is near  
So I face the final curtain  
My friend, I'll say it clear  
I'll state my case of which I'm certain  
  
I've lived a life that's full  
I've traveled each and every highway  
And more, much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few  
But then again, too few to mention  
I did what I had to do  
And saw it through without exception  
  
I planned each charted course  
Each careful step along the byway  
Oh, and more, much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall  
And did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fails, my share of losing  
And now as tears subside  
I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way  
Oh, no, no not me  
I did it my way  
  
For what is a man, what has he got  
If not himself, then he has not  
To say the things he truly feels  
And not the words he would reveal  
The record shows I took the blows  
And did it my way

You said when you died that you'd walk with me everyday  
And I started to cry and said please don't talk that way  
With a blink of an eye and the Lord came and asked you to leave  
You went to a better place but they stole you away from me  
  
And now she lives in heaven  
But I know they let her out  
To take care of me  
There's a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight  
Pray silence my fear  
She is near  
Bringing heaven down here  
  
I miss your love I miss your touch  
But I'm feeling you every day  
And I can almost hear you say  
You've come a long way baby  
  
And now you live in heaven  
But I know they let you out  
To take care of me  
There's a strange kind of light  
In my bedroom tonight  
Pray silence my fear  
She is near  
Bringing heaven down here  
  
You taught me kings and queens  
While stroking in my head  
In my darkest hour  
I know you are there  
Leaning down beside me  
Whispering my prayers  
There's a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight  
Pray silence my fear

From sun up to the moon on his back  
Sent the villains to Hades  
A hit with the ladies  
A stallion in the sack  
You can't get your life back  
When right follows left Jack  
The more you see the less you know  
When others would leak it  
His service is secret  
Plays God when it's your time to go  
  
Queen and country safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who  
Up the creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
From the House of Lords  
Saving Norfolk Broads  
Commoners and landed gentry  
His word is Bond  
Whether brunette or blonde  
Baby it's so elementary  
For the man never messed up your life with one stare  
See the film you'll know how it goes  
But this ain't no fiction  
Just check the diction quit pro quo a prose pro yeah  
Fellows  
Don't be jealous  
When they made him they broke the mould  
So charismatic  
Will on automatic  
Never prematurely shooting his load  
  
Queen and country safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who  
Up the creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home

I like to reminisce about a time I've never had  
A book that no-one read  
A film that never made me sad  
And you remind of a place I've never been  
  
And something no-one said  
When I was 17  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it  
  
Remember when we never struggled through?  
A bad time we never had  
A love we never fell into  
Please don't remind me to forget  
  
'Cause forgiveness is a place  
I ain't got used to yet  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it  
  
All I ever wanted  
Was to radiate your home  
But I guess it doesn't matter  
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have  
  
I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad  
Don't rewrite my history  
'Cause you never really know  
How much you didn't mean to me  
  
One fine day  
In the middle of the night  
You'll wake up in it  
One fine day  
  
In the middle of the night  
But you probably won't admit it

It's quarter to three  
There's no one in the place  
Except you and me  
So set 'em up Joe  
I got a little story  
I think you should know  
We're drinking my friend  
To the end  
Of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
I got the routine  
Put another nickel  
In the machine  
Feelin' so bad  
Won't you make the music  
Easy and sad  
I could tell you a lot  
But it's not  
In a gentleman's code  
Just make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
You'd never know it  
But buddy I'm a kind of poet  
And I've got a lot of things  
I'd like to say  
And when I'm gloomy  
Won't you listen to me  
Till it's talked away  
Well, that's how it goes  
And Joe I know your gettin'  
Anxious to close  
And thanks for the cheer  
I hope you didn't mind  
My bending your ear  
But this torch that I found  
It's gotta be drowned  
Or it's soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
The long, it's so long  
The long and winding road  

You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special  
And I cry so I can talk like this  
From my downbeat existence  
And I know that you can make my wish  
If my wish is pure  
  
But I don't know  
I just don't know  
I don't know  
Let me love you so  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special  
It must hurt to see your favourite man  
Lose himself again and again  
And I know that you're my only friend  
From way back when  
  
My wish was pure  
It was oh so pure  
It was pure  
I couldn't love you more  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
'Cos I don't know no more  
I just don't know no more  
I jsut don't know  
Let me love you so  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you  
Now I can't live this without you  
I'd die without you  
Without you, without you  
  
You're one of God's better people  
And you don't know  
That's why you're special

You Got Love You Want It

Let me lie down  
Please don't wake me  
Nothing's sacred  
And no one saved me  
  
In my black eye  
I can feel it  
Moving closer  
Can't you hear it  
  
The only gift you gave to me  
Was self-fulfilling prophecy  
I need to change the sounds  
That shape my life  
  
And if you die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one here  
To love me and hold me  
  
Take me dancing  
I love music  
Keep on singing  
We won't lose it  
  
Picture me there  
Missing no one  
If young hearts run free  
Why can't we go on  
  
Go on 'til they kick us out  
We've everything to talk about  
I could bring a song into your life  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one here  
To love me and hold me  
  
Maybe I've been away too long  
I know I'm not always right but is that wrong  
They say there's nothing I can do  
But talk to strangers and wait for you  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one  
To love me and hold me  
  
If you should die before I leave  
What on earth becomes of me  
Look around there's no one  
To love me and hold me

Hello sir, remember me?  
I'm the man you thought I'd never be.  
The boy who you reduced to tears,  
The lad called "thingy" for six whole years.  
Yeah that's right, my names bob,  
The one who landed the popstars job.  
The one who you told: "Look don't touch"  
The Kid who wouldn'y amount to much.  
Well I'm here, and you're still there  
With your fake sports car and receding hair  
Dodgy, farout trousers that you think are smart  
Married to the woman that teaches art  
Married to the life  
Married to the school  
"I want to sing and dance sir"  
Now who's the fool?  
Sing and dance, you thought I was balmy  
"Settle down thingy, join the army"  
And who were you to tell me this  
The dream I want I'll have to miss  
Sir is god, he's been given the right  
To structure lives overnight.  
Now I know life's true path,  
Tanks and guns, that'll be a laugh.  
Nah, not me, I'm a mega civillian  
I won't leave my life riding pillion  
But thanks for the advice and I'm sure it'll do  
For the negitive dickheads just like you.  
As for now the different weapon  
Stage and screen is about to beckon  
And here I sit in first class  
Bollocks sir, kiss my ass.

(Irving Berlin)  
Have you seen the well-to-do  
Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thoroughfare  
With their noses in the air  
  
High hats and arrowed collars  
Wide spats and fifteen dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time  
  
If you're blue and you don't know  
Where to go to, why don't you go  
Where fashion sits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Different types, who wear a day coat  
Pants with stripes, and cut away coat  
Perfect fits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Super-duper!  
  
Come, let's mix where Rockerfellers  
Walk with sticks, or umber-ellas  
In their mitts  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Spangled gowns upon a beauty  
Of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie  
All misfits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
  
Strolling up the avenue so happy  
All dressed up just like an English chappie  
Very snappy!  
  
You'll declare it's simply topping  
To be there, and hear them swapping  
Smart tidbits  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
Puttin' on the Ritz  
Puttin' on the Ritz

For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you  
For those of us who live in fear  
Of Happy Christmas and New Year  
I raise a toast to you  
  
And if it hurts to be so blind  
Why don't you try being kind  
  
They've decided to become  
A little more proactive  
Creep upon you while you sleep  
And make you less attractive  
  
Born without a spine  
Why don't you try being kind  
  
For those out drinking their mother's wake  
You'll find a way to soldier on  
For those whose love evaporates  
I pray you find where you belong  
  
Oh the words I have repressed  
Are coming out today I guess  
It's justice not respect I'm after  
And that just leaves comtempt  
For you all  
  
I am just a simple man  
With simple expectations  
With deep regrets they're seldom met  
God speed my generation  
  
And with Crowley on my mind  
I should try being kind  
  
For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you  
For those about to die we salute you  
For those of about to cry we love you

Don't fight the feeling, relax  
Oh child the knot's in your back  
'Cause you've been holding on  
I feel you when you're reaching out  
  
I'll talk you through memories  
Just keep breathing with me  
It's time to hold my hand  
And walk into the revolution  
  
When there's no one to touch  
And you've been thinking too much  
You only hurt yourself  
When it's all about retribution  
  
I see the pain in your face  
And praying rare for this space  
It's time to lead you on  
C'mon, it's a revolution  
  
When you can't keep on keeping on  
And everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody falls sometimes  
But love shines on  
And on and on and  
  
With love in your eyes and a flame in your heart  
You're gonna find yourself some resolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
Walking with the revolution  
  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Talking about the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Walking with the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Taking you higher  
  
Old love lingers on  
You're just feelin it wrong  
I know you're tired  
But when it's time to sleep you're gone forever  
  
Make friends with your past  
And you can leave it at last  
It's time to find yourself  
Walking with the revolution  
  
And you can keep on keeping on and  
Everything you lean upon is all but gone  
Everybody hurts sometimes  
But love shines on and on and on and  
  
Time and tide's on your side  
There's no need to hide  
I feel your pain  
Don't talk to me about evolution  
A million miles with one step  
You'll find yourself yet  
When you're walking with the revolution  
  
Walking with the revolution  
A million miles with one step  
And you'll find yourself yet  
When you're walking with the revolution  
  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Walking with the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Get on with your revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
It's all about resolution now  
  
Talking about the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Oh oh  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Talking about the revolution  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Lead you on to the revolution  
  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)  
Talk about the revolution baby  
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on get the revolution)

But your making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos you're keepin' me up all night  
  
Singin' in the classes  
Music for your masses  
Give no head  
No backstage passes  
Have a proper giggle  
I'll be quite polite  
But when I rock the mic  
I rock the mic  
(Right)  
You got no love, then you're with the wrong man  
It's time to move your body  
If you can't get a girl  
But your best friend can  
It's time to move your body  
  
I don't wanna be sleazy  
Baby just tease me  
Got no family planned

Every night  
Pimpin' ain't easy  
But if you're sellin' it  
It's alright  
  
Come on  
  
I don't wanna rock, DJ  
But you're making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos you're keeping me up all night  
  
I don't wanna rock, DJ  
But you're making me feel so nice  
When's it gonna stop, DJ?  
Cos you're keeping me up all night  

Dealers keep dealin'  
Thieves keep thievin'  
Whores keep whorin'  
Junkies keep scorin'  
Trade is on the meat rack  
Strip joints full of hunchbacks  
Bitches keep bitchin'  
Clap keeps itchin'  
  
Ain't no use in prayin'  
That's the way it's stayin', baby

25 and I've come alive  
21 was the time to come undone  
Doesn't everyone  
  
Very young and very ape  
I'm gonna drink and stay up very late  
And hate the sun  
  
And now my heart kicks up a fuss  
I'm a rolling stone  
They say I'm dangerous  
But I'm never alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
You'll be a rolling stone  
  
Got an A in attitude  
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood  
I guess I'm just like you  
  
Being young is over-rated  
One day I'll be old and understated  
But before I'm through....  
  
I'll run naked through the streets  
Be a rolling stone  
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone  
  
I know that you're like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
  
When we die we'll find out other ways  
For getting drunk and throwing it all away  
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday  
It's all in your head  
So get out of your head  
  
And now your heart kicks up a fuss  
You're a rolling stone  
They say you're dangerous  
But you're never alone  
  
I know you're just like me  
You want your kicks for free  
Be a rolling stone  
Be a rolling stone

Oh it seemed forever stopped today  
All the lonely hearts in London  
Caught a plane and flew away  
And all the best women are married  
All the handsome men are gay  
You feel deprived  
  
Yeah are you questioning your size?  
Is there a tumour in your humour,  
Are there bags under your eyes?  
Do you leave dents where you sit,  
Are you getting on a bit?  
Will you survive  
You must survive  
  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Oh what are you really looking for?  
Another partner in your life to  
Abuse and to adore?  
Is it lovey dovey stuff,  
Do you need a bit of rough?  
Get on your knees  
  
Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear  
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment  
That echoes in your ear  
Saying love will stop the pain  
Saying love will kill the fear  
Do you believe  
You must believe  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
I spy with my little eye  
Something beginning with (ah)  
Got my back up  
And now she's screaming  
So I've got to turn the track up  
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up  
I know this girl she likes to switch teams  
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme  
  
When there's no love in town  
This new century keeps bringing you down  
All the places you have been  
Trying to find a love supreme  
A love supreme  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Don't let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love  
  
Come and live a love supreme  
Don't let it get you down  
Everybody lives for love  

Close the door, turn out the light  
There's something really wrong tonight with you  
Me and you  
  
You say you're too young to love  
And too old to hate  
Remote control keeps you awake  
So turn me on  
  
Maybe you could talk and make my day  
You don't have to walk away to  
Stay with me  
Make me change  
Answer me  
Break the chain  
  
News at Ten, Eastenders, and another cup of tea  
And then I fight  
Baby, not tonight  
  
'Cause I'm not dressed to be a clown  
I'm not in the mood for shouting out  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Do you keep your lover out of sight?  
'Cause you smell like someone else tonight  
All right all right  
  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me

Hi out there. This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W-A-N-K  
This evening I've got someone really interesting with me.  
He's over from old England and his name is Robbie Williams.  
  
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins!  
  
Great, right on! You know we've been hearing about this boy band that was
really big over there.  
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie?  
  
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first
place  
but to answer your question I can't really answer it.  
I suppose it was a bit like this  
  
Ha  
Riding in your limos  
Hanging with your bimbos  
Riding my old faithful  
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable  
Kipper in the papers  
Coke and whisky chasers  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Services for Britain  
Pouting like a kitten  
Dinner with Diana  
I'm a social Stokey spanner  
Waiting for my knighthood  
She can pin it on my manhood  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
(It works out sometimes it's funny  
Being stupid makes you lots of money)  
  
Bothered Judy Garland  
When I ordered Barbara Cartland  
Champagne in my bidet  
The press all had a field day  
You may think it's an outrage  
My cleaner is wearing bondage  
She makes my place a mess  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
Come on waif  
It looks as if you need a good feeling

Principal actors to the stage please,  
Act One is about to begin in 8 seconds.  
  
First you can't act, now you can't stop,  
(What's my motivation?)  
I used to like you a lot,  
(I was the class nerd)  
Exactly who I'm s'posed to be,  
(I'm totally Strasberg)  
You play a doctor on TV,  
(What you're doing is SO brave)  
  
Deep down you're dirty but you try,  
(I'm a good person)  
The truth would break you so you lie,  
(I want my work to matter)  
It's in the choices that you make,  
(I want to inspire)  
No talent, just fate.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know where you begin,  
I end, we start  
Again,  
They need, you love,  
We all watch  
The Actor Acting.  
  
Good from far but far from good,  
(All I have is my instinct)  
You love to act, I wish you would,  
(It's not acting, it's re-acting)  
Act like you're not from out of space,  
(When I'm on stage I feel alive)  
You know ambition isn't grace,  
(For me it's the craft)  
  
Made of Sex, Maida Vale,  
(Would I do better in New York)  
You are the Alpha Male,  
(I'm just too pretty for that role)  
You are the good, you are the great,  
(The words have power)  
Now let me fill you with my hate.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Monroe,  
(Monroe)  
Barrymore,

Mansfield,

D-d-d-d-Dame d-Dame d-Dame Judi Dench,

Swank.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the future,  
Everybody will be anonymous for fifteen minutes,  
You are, we all are a test card,  
The stars of CCTV,  
We ARE the nature of the beast.

You've done it all, you've broken every code  
And pulled the Rebel to the floor  
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say  
For only metal - what a bore!  
Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies?  
  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
Or do what you want, run on wild  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
Or do what you want, run on wild  
  
MR TOM JONES!  
Baby take off your coat (Tell 'em Tom!)  
Real slow  
Baby take off your shoes  
I'll help you take off your shoes  
  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
You give me reason to live  
  
Well, you can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Well, you can leave your hat on  
You can leave your hat on  
Well, you can leave your hat on  
  
Leave it on, Leave it on,  
Leave it on, Leave it on,  
Leave it on, Leave it on,  
Leave it on,  
You can leave your hat on - yeah.  
  
One two three  
One two three yeah  
  
You gotta know how to pony  
Like Mony Baronie.  
Mashed potato,  
Do the alligator.  
Put your hand on your hip,  
Let your backbone slip.  
Do the Watusi  
Like your Aunt Lucy.  
  
Na na na na na...  
  
You gotta know how to pony  
Like Mony Baronie.  
You gotta mashed potato,  
You gotta alligator.  
Put your hand on your hip,  
Let your backbone slip.  
Do the Watusi  
Like your Aunt Lucy.  
  
Na na na na na...  
Yes!  
Sing it with us now!  
Na na na na na...  
  
Long tall Sally  
Jump back in that alley babe  
Put your hand on your hip,  
Let your backbone slip.

She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater, but doesn't come late  
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair  
Life without care  
She's broke, but it's o'k  
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
Doesn't like dice games, with sharpies and frauds  
Won't go to Harlem, in Lincolns or Fords  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those broads  
That's why the lady is a tramp
