Staring down from this high window  
At the faces in the line  
Cold from hours of waiting  
How many people can you love?  
When you're black and blue with bruises  
From collisions on the road  
The friction grind of traveling  
This is the never ending show  
All over the world in eighty days  
Head in a blur of information  
What kind of a man could live this way  
I do what I can  
I do OK  
But right now  
All I want to do is  
Get real  
If that's alright with you  
Woke up last night under the mountains  
Driving from Zurich to Milan  
I lay there listening to the echoes  
Thinking of Iceland and Japan  
So many smiles So many faces  
And my home so far away  
I lose some of me in all these places  
And I can't help the way I'm changed  
All over the world in eighty days  
Memories turn like magazine pages  
What kind of a man could live this way  
I do what I can  
But I can't escape it  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Is get real  
If that's alright with you  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Somehow  
Be myself with you  
All over the world in eighty days  
Alcohol haze of information  
What kind of a man could live this way  
As long as I have  
And stay the same  
Right now  
All I want to do is  
Get real  
If that's alright with you  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Get real  
If that's alright with you  
For just one night with you  
Get real somehow

I've got a photograph  
I took a picture of you  
I took your picture in front of my favorite view  
  
You play the part so well  
You look so sure and free  
No one could ever tell that you belong to me  
  
And 'cause you lie so well  
I've got to pin you down  
Under lock and key  
So you will always be in my collection  
  
If you can't speak you can't lie  
If you can't run, you can't hide  
I know a place you can't die  
So no one lives inside  
My collection  
  
I want to capture you  
I want to immortalize  
The way you play with your hair  
The way you flash your eyes  
  
I taste the air you breathe  
I taste the food you eat  
I keep your nails and hair  
And some of the clothes you wear  
  
If you can't speak you can't lie  
If you can't run, you can't hide  
And if you're dead you can't die  
So no one lives inside  
No one lives inside my collection  
  
I've got some photographs  
I'd like to show them to you  
Though you don't know the girls  
You'll recognize the view

"The songs and the music that I portray comes from the heart, and comes from
the mind. That makes it... that makes me feel that I am delivering the right
information"  
  
Can you make it your own  
Can you take it by the throat  
Make your own luck, learn the skills  
Get in early for the kill  
  
It carries on  
  
Pick up the weapon  
Marry it, give it your name  
Define yourself by it  
Take it down 'the disco  
  
Trigger happy, pulling power  
Lady killer, take 'em out  
See the weirdos on the hill  
Come to get you if you stand still  
  
It carries on  
  
Somewhere in history you were wronged  
Teach your children to bang the drum  
Tell all your family, tell all your friends  
Teach your brothers to avenge  
  
It carries on  
  
Or you could love  
You could love  
  
Lie down in the flowers  
In the blue of the air  
Open your eyes  
Why use up your life for anything else?  
No need to fight for what everyone has  
What do you need?  
It's already there  
It's already there  
  
You could love  
  
So he carried the stars in his pocket  
Drank the sunrise till he was drunk  
He embraced the angels  
They swam like little minnows in his blood  
Ghosts in his eyes  
Out walking beside him  
Laughing like children in his mind  
They chanted his mantra together  
  
You could love  
  
They were happy

When I leave you  
I will leave you  
Things that might not help you  
Things that might  
Problems that I never solved  
Dreams to keep you up at night  
  
As I leave you  
I will leave you  
Things that stick for ever  
Things that slide  
Mysteries I swallowed whole  
  
Happiness I couldn't share I will leave you  
Promises I never kept I will leave you  
Stories that I never told  
Principles betrayed or sold  
  
Love I tried to spread too wide I will leave you  
Muscles you can grow in hate I will leave you  
Summer darkness  
Winter light  
Young mans shame and  
Old mans pride  
  
When I leave you  
I will hate to leave you  
That's the heat that grows  
With growing old  
  
So never let me leave you  
Never let me leave you  
Cold

Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend Abraham  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
'Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just turned around  
And he was gone  
Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend Martin  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
'Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just looked around  
And he was gone  
Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend John  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
'Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just looked around  
And he was gone  
I just looked around  
And he was gone

Drive the road to your surrender  
Time comes around... out of my hands  
Small boats on the beach at the dead of night  
Come and go before first light  
  
Leave me running in the wheel  
King of the world  
How do you feel?  
What is there to feel?  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight?  
Tell me girl why you and me  
Scared of sunlight?  
  
Been in pain for so long  
I can't even say what hurts anymore  
I will leave you alone  
I will deny  
I will leave you to bleed  
I will leave you with your life  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight?  
Tell me girl why you and me  
Scared of sunlight?  
  
All your spirit rack abuses  
Come to haunt you back by day  
All your Byzantine excuses  
Given time, given you away  
  
Don't be surprised when daylight comes  
To find that memory prick your thumbs  
You'll tell them where we run to hide  
I'm already dead  
It's a matter of time  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
How do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
  
Day-Glo Jesus on the dash  
Chalk marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith  
Don't lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be?

Dressed in black, no turning back  
We blanked out on the Great White Way  
Fingers in desire's crack  
We'd bridge and tunnel into day  
Abandoned to the salt of skin  
Abandoned to the highway  
Sand running in the hourglass  
Heat of leather and mirages  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
  
Day-Glo Jesus on the dash  
Scorch marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith, don't lose your head  
Don't lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
Afraid of Sunlight  
  
Agave flower  
Sleep beside me  
Driving on  
Nevada's burning  
Phoenix rising  
Driving on  
To sunlight  
  
Day-Glo Jesus on the dash  
Scorch marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith, don't lose your head  
Don't lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be afraid of sunlight  
How do we now come to be afraid  
Afraid of sunlight

There's a line on her jeans that a ball-point made  
From a careless mistake that she can't wash away  
And there's a heart on her sleeve from a spill of red wine  
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes  
She named it after me  
  
There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street  
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him  
And he claws at the door to be let out at night  
And she makes do without him, and she worries about him  
She named him after me  
  
So if you ever decide that you have to escape  
And travel the world, and you can't find a place  
Well, you could wind up believing  
That paradise is nothing more than a feeling  
That goes on in your mind  
So if ever find out what that is  
There's something you could do  
  
'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again  
I want to tell you  
I'm gonna name it after you

See those people there? They look after me  
This is a photograph of who I might be  
Man in a uniform, bride on his arm  
Mum always was a fool for money and charm  
  
He's been talkin' in his sleep again  
Sayin' he's sorry, callin' my name  
Sayin' how he's so ashamed  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
  
Since it happened I had nothin' to say  
It used to bother them but now it's okay  
Mother cleans his dreadful house every day  
Scrubbing at the stains that won't go away  
  
They sent me away to the school in the park  
They said it would be good for me  
I still hear the other kids cry in the dark  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
Is there no escape from the lap of luxury  
  
I don't remember the last time I cried  
I don't remember much except lies  
See the little girl spirallin' down  
This is a photograph of who she is now  
  
"One day this will all be yours" he said  
Tidy your room and straight to bed  
Tidy up those thoughts in your head  
  
Alone again in the lap of luxury  
  
I could be anywhere right now  
If I only had the nerve to leave this house  
Maybe somewhere by the sea  
Take me somewhere, anywhere please!  
  
We could make a pillow of sand and sleep  
We could roll  
We could make  
We could see  
We could scream  
  
Far, Father, Farthest  
Oh daddy, you do not do anymore  
  
For God's sake don't pretend to be concerned  
Turn into nightmares in the end  
Throw a party for all my friends  
  
I. Now Wash your Hands  
You give up hope  
You settle down  
With your favourite soap  
  
Now wash your hands

You ask me how I'm feeling  
I only wish you knew  
How hard it is for me to share  
Share that kind of thing with you  
  
It's not that I don't love you  
It's just I can't connect  
'Cause I was taught from much too young  
To shine and not reflect  
  
And if you sense a smoke screen here  
A trick of the dry ice  
Just try to see there's more to me  
Than sour grapes and sugar mice  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
  
You ask me if I'm happy  
I only wish I knew  
'Cause happiness is not a thing  
I ever learned to do  
  
It's not that I'm complaining  
It's all the same to me  
If everything that happens  
Happens accidentally  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
  
I was taught for every secret  
There's a price you have to pay  
Yes, I was taught for every secret  
There's a price you have to pay  
I was taught from much too young  
To never give myself away  
  
Just try to understand  
I don't say all I can  
A stranger to myself, I am  
An accidental man  
Just try to understand  
I don't do all I can  
A mystery to burned-out love  
An accidental man

I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence  
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis  
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend  
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend  
No incantations of remorse, my friend  
Unsheathe the blade within the voice, my friend  
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot  
Who camouflaged emotion in a thousand yard stare  
Who gouged the notches from the family tree  
Who hypnotised the guilt in career rhythm trance  
Assassing, assassing, assassing, assassing  
Listen as the syllables of slaughter cat with calm precision  
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sow the ice incision  
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell the creed of tempered diction  
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption  
Venomous verbs of ruthless candour plagiarise assassins fervour  
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds  
Let bitter silence infect the wound  
You were a sentimental mercenary in a free fire zone  
Parading a Hollywood conscience  
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish  
Pavlovian slaver at the cash till ring of success  
A non com observer - I assassin the collector - defector  
So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend  
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend  
To eradicate the problem, my friend  
Unsheathe the blade within the voice  
I am the assassin  
I am the assassin  
And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins anyway, my friend?

I went to Morisson's grave at Pere Lachaise cemetery  
The stony flowers and the matching graffiti were guiding me  
To the steps inside of me  
  
And what would you do if I got down on my knees to you?  
What would you do if I lied to your face?  
Could you still hold your dreams?  
Could you live with your silent face?  
  
So what would you do, would you walk right through me?  
Would you stand in the way like the others before?  
Get in the way  
Would you drink to me next Beaujolais day?  
  
Tell me the truth, save a prayer for me  
I would love to leave you but you would cry all night long  
Eternal romantic victory failed on Beaujolais day  
  
I heard a wheelchair whisper across a stale silent gymnasium  
Trailing an ivy league jacket like a matador  
Through the jitterbug steps of the night before  
  
Through the chalk white chill and the tear fandango  
Heading away to the inner wrangle  
Do we cry for a cell?  
Do we need for a cell?  
  
What would you do, would you cry for me?  
Could you set off, could we go gently?  
Blame it away  
Do you really want to head for the open door?  
  
Got to crack a bottle while you dream for me  
Just an absent friend and a misery  
Laying awake do we stay right there  
'Til Beaujolais day, on Beaujolais day  
  
So what would you do, would you lie to me?  
Would you sit right back in a victory?  
Would you play for me?  
Could you die for me?  
  
So what would you do, would you walk right through me?  
Heading away saying it's just another victory  
This is Beaujolais day

Everybody knows that we live in a world  
Where they give bad names to beautiful things  
Everybody knows that we live in a world  
Where we don't give beautiful things a second glance  
  
Heaven only knows that we live in a world  
Where what we call beautiful is just something on sale  
People laughing behind their hands  
While the fragile and the sensitive are given no chance  
  
And the leaves turn from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
To be trodden down  
  
And the leaves turn from red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
Fall to the ground  
  
We don't have to live in a world  
Where we give bad names to beautiful things  
We should live in a beautiful world  
We should give beautiful a second chence  
  
And the leaves fall from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
To be trodden down  
And the leaves turn green to red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
And get kicked around  
  
You strong enough to be..  
Have you the faith to be..  
Have you the courage to be..  
Honest enough to say..  
  
Don't have to be the same..  
Don't have to be this way  
Come on and sign your name  
You wild enough to remain beautiful?  
Beautiful  
  
All the leaves turn from red to brown  
To be trodden down  
Trodden down  
And all we fall green to red to brown  
Fall to the ground  
To be kicked around  
  
You strong enough to be..  
Why don't you stand up and say  
Give yourself a break  
They laugh at you anyway  
So why don't you stand up and be  
Beautiful.

The mascara'd blonde from the Berliner bar  
Rises at twilight, gets dressed in a daze  
Black leather crackles and cold water runs  
As she touches the walls of memory maze  
  
And the shadows of men she has known fill her day  
She's held half the world in her arms so they say  
But she wakes up without them with a hole in her heart  
And she puts on her clothes lives her life behind bars  
  
The mascara'd blonde from the Berliner bar  
Sighs at the skylight gets lost in the haze  
Black leather crackles and cold water runs  
As she touches the walls of her memory maze  
  
Someone got stranded in no man's land  
Dancing in the spotlight to the sound of clapping hands  
Nobody knows who's side he was on  
It's a risk that you take in no man's land  
Nobody knows what made him decide  
To run for freedom and to certain suicide  
When they turn off the guns and his fingers uncurl  
He's clutching a photograph of a Berlin party girl  
  
Come in from your checkpoints on your lonely roads  
Come in from your ditches in your silent fields  
Where intensified light from a rifle sight  
Makes the darkness day  
And the day too bright,  
  
And we wake up without you  
We wake up without you  
With a hole in our hearts  
  
You mad dog shaven head bottle-boy freaks  
In Martens and khaki, drunk on sake  
You stare at yourself in the cruel flush of dawn  
Terrified, sunken eyed, withered and drawn  
The butcher, the baker, the munitions maker  
The over-achiever, the armistice breaker  
The freebase instructor, the lightning conductor  
The psycho, the sailor, the tanker, the tailor  
The black market mailer  
The quick and the dead  
The spotlight dancer  
The quick and the dead  
We wake up without you  
With a hole in our hearts  
  
The mascara'd blonde from the Berliner bar  
Rises at twilight, gets dressed in a daze

Today! I saw music in the sky  
I drove towards it in my car  
And I turned left and I turned right  
But I could never lose the light  
That shines towards tomorrow night  
  
Who can say what it means?  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
It's just somethin'  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
It's as sweet as can be.  
  
Today! I saw music in the sky  
It sang around me. I went blind.  
Like a masterpiece in a disguise  
Couldn't stop it pulling at my eyes  
  
Who can say what it means  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
Ice and fire  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me  
  
Monday.. Tuesday.. Blow a fuse day  
Fix it in the usual way  
Meet me at the church and we'll get in a state  
Stay up late and I'll wake up feeling like  
A kid swingin' on heavens gate  
With no God to complain  
Or point the finger of blame  
We'll get it all down on video 8  
You comin' out to play?  
Could be quite a day  
  
And I sang that pretty tune  
An open airy song  
And my heart looped the loop  
Well I could do no wrong.  
  
Who can say what it means?  
What goes on in between  
Who can say what you see  
And what gets in between you and me  
  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me.

If you were a baby I would take you and run  
I could hide you in the folds of my heart  
There's a truth in the madness that I can't get beyond  
And a fever that won't leave me alone  
  
I don't want my heart  
Don't want my head  
Don't want my friends  
Don't want my bed  
I can't live with myself  
I can't live with myself  
Can't take no help  
I try to want to  
But I can't get beyond you  
  
I will stare from the window  
At the shapes in the rain  
As the space between us drives me insane  
  
I can't live with myself  
I can't live with myself  
Can't take no help  
Don't want no one else  
  
If I was a child  
I would refuse to leave  
I would sit down on the street  
Kick my legs and scream  
  
I'm not much of a man  
But I know how I am  
I know this won't fade away  
I will pretend and be strong  
But I wonder where I belong  
  
And the feeling comes in waves  
A hole in my body, aching  
Like a heart dying  
A soul crying  
Exhausted and insecure  
Took all you have and I still want more  
So I reach out to hold you  
But all I do is hurt you  
Hurt you  
  
I can't live with myself  
I can't live with myself  
Can't take no help  
I try to want to  
But I can't get beyond you  
  
If I was a child I would take you and run  
And I say I don't know... But I know  
And I say I'll go  
  
You just spent the whole day  
Driving away

I've got a bike, you can ride if you like  
It's got a basket, a bell that rings  
And things to make it look good  
I'd give it to you if I could  
But I borrowed it  
You're the kind of girl  
That fits in with my world  
I'll give you anything, everything  
If you want a thing  
I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke  
There's a tear up the front, it's red and black  
I've had it for months  
If you think it could look good  
Then I guess it should  
I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house  
I don't know why I call him Gerald  
He's getting rather old but he's a good mouse  
I've got a clan of gingerbread men  
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men  
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish  
I know a room of musical tunes  
Some wine, some gin, most of them are clock work  
Let's go into the other room and make them work

A spider wanders aimlessly within the warmth of a shadow  
Not the regal creature of border caves  
But the poor, misguided, directionless familiar  
Of some obscure Scottish poet  
  
The mist crawls from the canal  
Like some primordial phantom of romance  
To curl, under a cascade of neon pollen  
While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father  
Your carnation will rot in a vase.  
  
A train sleeps in a siding  
The driver guzzles another can of lager  
To wash away the memories of a Friday night down at the club  
  
She was a wallflower at sixteen  
She'll be a wallflower at thirty four  
Her mother called her beautiful  
Her daddy said, "A whore".  
  
The sky was Bible black in Lyon  
When I met the Magdalene  
She was paralyzed in a streetlight  
She refused to give her name  
  
And a ring of violet bruises  
They were pinned upon her arm.  
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand  
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears  
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear  
"'J'entend ton coeur"  
I can hear your heart  
  
It's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper  
Something's gonna give under this pressure  
And the cracks are already beginning to show  
It's too late  
The weekend career girl never boarded the plane  
They said this could never happen again  
So wrong, so wrong  
  
This time it seems to be another misplaced rendezvous  
This time, it's looking like another misplaced rendezvous  
With you  
The parallel of you, yo  
  
On the outskirts of nowhere  
On the ring road to somewhere  
On the verge of indecision  
I'll always take the roundabout way  
Waiting on the rain  
For I was born with a habit, from a sign  
The habit of a windswept thumb  
And the sign of the rain  
It's started raining

I. Vocal Under A Bloodlight  
Last night you said I was cold, untouchable  
A lonely piece of action from another town  
I just want to be free, I'm happy to be lonely  
Can't you stay away?  
Just leave me alone with my thoughts  
Just a runaway, just a runaway  
I'm saving myself  
  
II. Passing Strangers  
  
Strung out below a necklace of carnival lights  
Cold moan, held on the crest of the night  
I'm too tired to fight.  
  
So now we're passing strangers, at single tables  
Still trying to get over  
Still trying to write love songs for passing strangers  
All those passing strangers  
And the twinkling lies, all those twinkling lies  
Sparkle with the wet ink on the paper  
  
III. Mylo  
  
Oh I remember Toronto when Mylo went down  
And we sat and cried on the phone  
I never felt so alone  
He was the first of our own  
Some of us go down in a blaze of obscurity  
Some of us go down in a haze of publicity  
The price of infamy, the edge of insanity  
  
Another Holiday Inn, another temporary home  
And an interviewer threatened me with a microphone  
'Talk to me, won't you tell me your stories."  
  
So I talked about conscience and I talked about pain  
And he looked out the window and it started to rain  
I thought maybe I've already gone crazy  
So I reached for a bottle and he reached for the door  
And I picked up the sleeping pills crushed on the floor  
Inviting me to a casual obscenity.  
  
IV. Perimeter Walk  
  
It would be incredible if we could  
Retrace all the times that we lived here  
All the collisions  
Wasted, I've never been so wasted  
I've never been this far out before  
  
Perimeter walk  
There's a presence here  
I feel could have been ancient,  
I could have been mystical  
  
There's a presence  
A child, my child  
My childhood, a misplaced childhood  
Give it back to me, give it back to me  
A childhood, that childhood  
Oh please give it back to me.  
  
V. Threshold  
  
I saw a war widow in a launderette  
Washing the memories from her husband's clothes  
She had medals pinned to a threadbare greatcoat  
A lump in her throat with cemetery eyes  
  
I see convoys curbcrawling West German Autobahns  
Trying to pick up a war  
They're going to even the score  
Oh... I can't take any more  
I see black flags on factories  
Soup ladies poised on the lips of the poor  
I see children with vacant stares, destined for rape in the alleyways  
Does anybody care, I can't take any more!  
Should we say goodbye?  
  
I see priests, politicians?  
Heroes in black plastic body-bags under nations' flags  
I see children pleading with outstretched hands  
Drenched in napalm, this is no Vietnam  
  
I can't take any more, should we say goodbye  
How can we justify?  
They call us civilised!

The quiet sadness of the people of the North  
Echoes silently around the cold grey places  
Ecstasies undared  
Tremble upon the edge of the tightly, respectably unfulfilled  
Who drink to excess in order to forget what never happened  
  
Brave faces  
Well dressed ordered minds on suicide's edge  
Reflected in the rain-skimmed slate grey, battleship grey, hardship grey  
  
[Blue grey]  
  
And further South, and homeless  
Here I am  
Globally altered and dishevelled  
Oh darling, I've done it all  
An antithesis of sorts  
And yet bound together and hopelessly in love  
With the inevitable loss  
And the end  
How can we run from ourselves?  
  
Pete: "A is a nice place to go. What were those chords again?"

(Let's meet up and get beat up)  
  
Well she tied me to the headboard with a surf leash  
And her wet hair hugged her body like a long-lost friend  
And I really tried my best to get across to her  
But nothing she would say could be defended  
  
Well her birthday suit it was her only present  
When I looked into her eyes - no history  
And I told her eating people wasn't pleasant  
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals  
I watched her as she walked across the coals  
  
Singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
And I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for the perfect microwave?  
  
So I really did my best to get across to her  
I said: "One day every pebble hits the beach"  
And I kissed her face and held her like a long-lost friend  
But she was too far out there to be reached  
To be reached  
She was too far out there  
  
She was singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for the perfect microwave?  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightly-coloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said "Well we're all heaven's beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear... you're going to enjoy this"  
  
And she looked like she'd had sex  
With a Tyrannosaurus Rex  
  
Singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird, old man  
I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for that perfect microwave?  
Perfect microwave  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals...  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightly-coloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said "Well we're all heaven's beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear... you have enjoyed this"

Yeah!  
Slow French kissing with the Dauphin's daughter  
If I fall in love now I'll be floating in Seine  
Plastered in Paris I've had an Eiffel  
Gonna make my escape on the midnight train  
Choo, choo to you - Choo, choo to you - Charting the single  
Schnapping my fingers on an alcoholiday  
Sniff round a Fraulein when I'm scent to Cologne  
All night hotel Liebling make your mark  
Let sugar daddy melt in his home sweet home  
Home is where the heart lies, but if the heart lies  
Where is home, is where the heart lies, but where is home?  
  
Get a pizza the action when I Romeo again  
Chianti see you with me, so just let him wine  
Juliet on the balcony, it's pasta serenade  
Wedding rings, I know when Venice time, Venice time  
To chart the single, to chart the single  
  
Charting the single, charting the single  
The chicks are getting cheaper on the not so common market  
Stockpile experience before the blond hairs turn to grey  
Before the blond hairs turn to grey  
I like to train, express myself in the universal language  
Ego on my face in the nicest possible way  
It's absolutely the nicest possible way  
  
Charting the single  
I got no clause in my contract, got no shares in my name  
I'm just charting the single in a bachelor's game  
Charting the single  
It's a solo performance on a one way street  
You'll never have the chance again and never again we'll meet  
Charting, charting, charting, charting the single

Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress  
Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town  
Awaiting the prince in his white Capri  
Dynamic young Tarzan courts the bedsit queen  
She's playing the actress in this bedroom scene  
She's learning her lines from glossy magazines  
Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams  
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen  
Patience my tinsel angel  
Patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you  
You'll charm them with that smile  
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday  
Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of London  
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland  
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles  
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause  
She'll pray for endless Sundays as she enters saffron sunsets  
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn  
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the St. Tropez mirage  
Fragrant aphrodisiac, the withered tuberose  
Patience my tinsel angel, patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you, you'll charm them with that smile  
But for now it's just another Chelsea Monday  
[Hello John, did you see The Standard about four hours ago?  
Fished a young chick out of The Old Father  
Blond hair, blue eyes. She said she wanted to be an actress or something  
Nobody knows where she came from, where she was going  
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face  
She was smiling, what a waste]  
Catalogue princess, apprentice seductress  
Buried in her cellophane world in glitter town  
Of Chelsea Monday  

On the rebound, fumbling all the lines  
The light at the end of the bottle, alcoholic alphabet  
Through the looking glass the proof in my own reflection  
Five senses down and reeling on the Cinderella search  
  
On the rebound, fumbling all the lines  
Decay on the vertical hold with a horizontal aim  
Conversation needs translation  
Three dimensions down dissolving on the Cinderella search, Cinderella search  
  
On the rebound, writing all the lines  
Dreaming bartenders, bourbon and saxophone  
Out of luck, out of charm, out the game of rejections in a cigarette city  
Only courting the homing of direction on the Cinderella search, Cinderella
search  
  
But the Samaritan of the heartbroken, heartbroken  
Swam through the nicotine seize, and we exchanged the kiss of life  
Resurrection in a trance, the model, the Grail, in a Marquee of promises  
I touched the dream, I hold the dream, I have the dream  
  
To end the Cinderella search, Cinderella search, oh no more, no more!  
Exposing bedside manners on a work extension  
Awaiting development with paranoid Polaroid eyes, Polaroid eyes  
The footman memorised the number  
  
But the prince still holds both the slippers  
And would you leave a palace for a bed sit  
And Canterbury Tales, Canterbury Tales?  
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill of the chase  
  
Maybe you were always beyond my reach and my heart was playing safe  
But was that love in your eye I saw or the reflection of mine?  
I'll never really know for sure, you never really gave me time  
Give me time, won't you give me that time!  
  
Welcome back to the circus  
Welcome back to the circus  
Welcome back to the circus  
I always use the cue sheets but never the nets  
  
Always the cue sheets but never the nets  
Never the nets, never the nets  
Nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless, nevertheless  
Welcome back to the circus!

They got money, they got sun  
They look like they're havin' fun  
Don't it seem it's so unfair  
They know something you don't know  
They've got a better place to go  
They're thin and rich and they don't care  
  
We get the dreams that we deserve  
The magazines that we deserve  
Page one and three that we deserve  
  
The joy and the pain that we deserve  
The sun and the rain that we deserve  
The material gain that we deserve  
We get what we deserve  
  
They got tension, they got stress  
They got their lives in the press  
The whole world stares as they undress  
Sold their friends to get ahead  
They do therapy instead  
They've got demons in their bed  
  
We get the toys that we deserve  
The quiet and the noise that we deserve  
The girls and the boys that we deserve  
  
We get what we want if we really want it  
We get what we want if we're really honest  
You know what you are  
You know what you want  
You know what you deserve  
  
We get the seas that we deserve  
The flowers and the trees that we deserve  
The spores on the breeze that we deserve  
  
We get what we want if we really want it  
We get what we want if we're really honest  
You know what you are  
You know what you want  
You know what you deserve  
You deserve  
We get what we deserve  
We deserve

There'll come a time when all of this is over  
Something else will grow and take it's place  
The brand new car:scrap metal in a junkyard  
The children playing will grow up and leave home  
  
Put it away this dream you can't stop dreaming  
Put it away this anger and desire  
The open road is infinitely hopeful  
Take all those memories and throw them in the fire  
  
And don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
There's old man on a warm and sunny island  
No job, no money, just a smile to call his own  
Know what he says?. "The past will only haunt you.  
Live for today. Each day's an open door  
  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
Nothing to lose is nothing to fight over  
The shining stars!  
They've seen it all before.  
  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself  
Don't hurt yourself anymore  
  
Dust keeps coming. Rust keeps coming. Weeds keep growing. Seeds keep growing  
Where you going?

In all the time that I've known you  
You've been so edgy and nervous  
I never wanted to own you  
I was aware of the danger  
Of making a bid for your favours  
You're such a natural stranger  
I made excuses and ran  
You're an island  
But I can't leave you all out at sea  
You're so violent with your silence  
You're an island  
I can't sleep  
Won't you speak to me  
I'm on dry land  
Won't you help me please  
In all the time that I've known you  
There has been something between us  
I don't hink it's my imagination  
I felt like I couldn't touch you  
But I had the feeling you'd love to  
Tell me the truth if you could do  
I made excuses and ran

Bound up in this energy ball again  
Laughing and bouncin' off the magic  
Rollin' under like a surfboard in a wave  
Washin' me up ...I want to do it again  
  
Entwined in her arms  
Spinning around and submarine beneath the deep of her  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
Building a rod for my back it's all right, it's all right  
  
Dreamin' a dream that only the sleepless know  
Chilling the afternoon in "Viva Vida"  
Watchin' the sun slide down the avenue  
So real...  
  
I feel...  
Dizzy to fever with this love  
The blues and the greys are waved away inside a day with her  
Riding the forks of the lightning  
Feeling the sparks along my back it's all right, it's all right  
  
I thought I was born to take and to damage  
But I'm giving and healing and feeling  
Ultramarine and ultra-serene  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
She told me today it'll be okay it's all right, it's all right  
  
I'm a submarine in this ocean

I saw a blue umbrella in Princes Street Garden  
Heading out west for the Lothian Road  
An evening news stuffed deep in the pocket  
  
Little did I know that even a heavy load  
I found us walking Grierson's dockyards  
Where the only thing working was foreign film crews  
Making an impressive documentary  
  
For the big news  
To the satellite  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a sense of pride and identity  
  
The waters left behind we shouldn't forget  
Laid low in the books of history  
I saw the starlings wheel round Georgian spires  
Gathering on patrol in the skies  
  
In the distance burns the flame of Grangemouth  
And the dream is lost  
Everything what it could inspire  
From the take you know there is no distance  
  
How we talk about in the secret affairs  
Taking our ride into the distance  
To be what it was or could have been  
What I should have said  
  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
'Till we take some more steps to unity  
Take it back to me  
  
Take it back  
In a city run out of luck  
And all we're left with is the black, black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
  
Calling the ... for identity  
What it meant to me, what I said  
What we could have had  
I saw a blue umbrella in Princes Street Garden  
  
Heading out west for the Lothian Road  
An evening news stuck deep in the pocket  
Little did I know that he'd fall  
Carrying a heavy load  
  
And all we're left with is the black black oil  
With a strong sense of national pride  
Calling a name in the sake of unity  
What it means to me you'll never know  
  
You'll never know  
I see myself forced in servant exile  
Turning around at another's command  
All I want to see is identity  
  
What I could have been  
What I did  
Could have been  
Internal exile  
  
Internal exile

Islands are mountain-tops  
  
It's always a struggle  
To let somebody go  
It's a natural desire  
To own your lover, I know  
  
And you can screw a man down  
Until he takes to drinking  
He'll give you all of his money  
You still won't know what he's thinking  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights in the water  
The moment outside of real life  
  
I never could dream while I was sleeping  
Put your arms around my soul  
And take it dancing..  
  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
Take me to the fantastic place  
Keep the rest of my life away  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll watch the rain over your shoulder  
The streetlights on the wet stone  
The moment outside of real life  
  
Say you understand me  
And I will leave myself completely  
Forgive me if I stare  
But I can see the island behind your tired, troubled eyes  
  
Take me to the island  
I'll tell you all I never told you  
The boy I never showed you  
More than I gave in my life  
Take me by the hand  
You'll either kill me or you'll save me  
Take me to the island  
Show me what might be real life

Have you ever met a lady, screaming angst potential?  
Have you ever dreamed of romance, no matter how experimental?  
Have you ever felt an alien drifting back into your hometown?  
Did you think you were buying safety  
When you bought that piece of ground?  
  
She said all the best freaks are here  
She said all the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
  
Have you ever woke up, sweating in the middle of the night?  
You search the darkness and you're scrambling for the light  
Have you ever walked down the street, heard bootsteps following you?  
Don't worry my son, you've got the spook squad looking after you  
  
He said all the best freaks are here  
He said all the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me, stop staring at me  
  
Airport terminal, patiently waiting on the last call  
You feel the eyes burn the back of your head  
Sign the autograph, get out of the picture, gonna have the last laugh  
Feel the whispers as you head for the plane  
Stop staring at me  
  
Love and linen sheets seem so very far away  
You save your pennies and you buy another day  
But after all it's only hide and seek, just another game  
There's so much fun to be had when you're living with a name  
  
All the best freaks are here, all the best freaks are here,  
Please stop staring at me, all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
Oh, stop staring at me, oh, stop staring at me  
  
They said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me  
All the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here, please stop staring at me

Is it wrong to talk to myself even when there's nobody else  
I'm just checking out that I'm not gone under the water  
Thrown on the beach like a seal ready for slaughter  
  
Can't you understand that the way things were planned  
It never worked out so I just went crazy  
I took to the drink, like something says its "maybe"  
  
I ain't got no excuse and that's really the news  
Got nothing else to say, that it's my way, it's always my way  
I seem to be running away so often  
  
I'll try anything once and that's the way we should be  
But it's always the same getting caught up again in a habit  
A habit I just can't shake off the way it always turned out  
  
Can you understand it's the way I choose to be  
Everything seems so easy this way but I'm going under fast  
Slipping away  
Am I so crazy

Midnight suns bid moors farewell, retreats from charging dusk  
Mountain echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks  
They place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight  
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea  
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams  
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame  
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere  
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear  
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify  
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky  
  
Earth rim walker seeks his meals  
Prepare the funeral pyres  
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear  
Within their eyes, their eyes  
  
Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew  
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through  
Mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf and stream  
An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams  
The shaper's lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp  
Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart  
  
Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell  
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell  
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife  
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries  
  
Screams are his music, lightning his guide  
Raping the darkness, death by his side  
  
Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams  
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene  
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe  
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know  
  
Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave  
Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the
brave  
  
So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out  
You should have known better after all this time  
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander  
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes  
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame  
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame  
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame  
  
So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws  
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives  
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot  
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods  
  
Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand  
You call for justice and distort the truth  
Well I've had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches  
Receive your punishment, Expose your throats to my righteous claws  
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, flow, flow, flow.

Well I hear that you were looking out to hunt me down  
And I guess you're used to having everything you want  
But you know that love can be as hard as sticks and stones  
I tell you nothing else can be as hard as love can  
  
Well I hear you got my number and you want my name  
I'm a stream of noughts and crosses in your are-A-M  
But you know that love can be as hard as algebra  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love  
  
Well I hear that you were lookin' out to take me home  
And I hear that you can handle it and you're not scared  
Have you heard about the pictures on my bedroom wall?  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love  
  
Well it makes you hungry and it makes you high  
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry  
But it's all worthwhile  
  
It makes you humble and it makes you crawl  
It makes you tremble and it makes you fall  
But it's all worthwhile  
  
It makes you desperate and it makes you dream  
It makes you dangerous and it makes you scream  
But it's all worthwhile  
Just lie back and smile  
  
"We will continue to love you even though the rest of the world hates you."  
  
It makes you hungry and it makes you high  
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry  
It makes you panic and it makes you vain  
It makes you primitive and sick inside  
It makes you angry and it makes you blind  
It makes you guilty and it makes you lie  
Tied up and beaten  
Spat out and eaten  
Suicidal  
Nothing's ever been as hard  
  
Well I hear that were lookin' out to change my faith  
You can bash me with your book of words, hammer me down  
But you know that love can be as hard as six inch nails  
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love  
  
Hard as love

Wide boys, wide boys, wide boys,  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys, we were wide boys,  
Born with hearts of Lothian  
Wide boys, we were wide boys,  
These hearts of Lothian.  
  
It's six o'clock in the tower blocks  
Stalagmites of culture shock  
And the trippers of the light fantastic,  
Bow down, hoe-down  
Spray their pheromones on this perfume uniform.  
  
And anarchy smiles in the Royal Mile  
And they're waiting on the slyboys, flyboys, wideboys  
Rooting, tooting cowboys  
Lucky little ladies at the watering holes  
They'll score the Friday night goals.  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
I was born with a heart of Lothian  
With a heart of Lothian  
  
I was born with a heart of Lothian,  
With a heart of Lothian.

Did you ever feel that just by jumping on a plane  
All your cares would drop away  
And you'd be born again  
  
Returning to a nature child  
Happy wild and free  
But forgetfulness is a river  
And you know where the river leads  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Life before the fall  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Feel no guilt, feel no guilt at all  
  
Naked through the jungle  
Mud between your toes  
Following the river  
Where the river flows  
  
The creatures of the forest bid you  
"Welcome to the dark"  
Nothing here can hurt you  
Darkness has no heart  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Paradise regained  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Throw your past away  
  
You wake up one morning  
Wondering who you are  
There's a map of a new country up on the wall  
All your new lovers merge into one  
You've done everything under the sun  
There's a date on the air ticket  
And the money's gone  
  
Back in your own country  
Nothing seems the same  
No one comes around at night  
Or uses your new name  
  
Hearing silent whispers  
Old friends are acting strange  
No one wants to know you now  
People say you've changed  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Life before the fall  
See no, hear no, speak no evil  
Feel no guilt at all  
  
Holidays in Eden  
Paradise and light  
Heaven loses you to this world  
Leaves you alone  
Kiss your home goodbye  
  
(She says she's lonely)

I was out in the cold of a North London street  
A cog in the hurrying world  
Above the walls and the gate police  
I caught a glimpse of a Holloway girl  
  
She was reachin' out of a window  
From a space just a few inches wide  
'Till the hand of justice pulled her back inside  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
  
I know how hard it can be to wait  
For proof you were right all along  
Self-destruction is easy for you  
We know what you're capable of  
  
But like a needle in a haystack  
The truth gets so disguised  
In a kingdom built on madness and on lies  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
In deepest darkness, the faintest light looks bright  
So hold on, hold on  
It's gonna be all right  
  
You're lookin' up at a mountain  
Between you and the outside  
But there isn't a mountain in this whole world  
Hasn't been climbed  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
In deepest darkness, the faintest light looks bright  
So hold on, hold on  
It's gonna be all right  
  
One day, freedom  
One day, freedom will unlock your door

'I feel so strange what's wrong with me'  
You've got a problem that you can't see  
But I've got a feeling that the rumours are true  
I see the girl's go a hook in you  
You carry on believing  
That you can take or leave it  
Now who are you deceiving  
Cause when it's own up time  
She's in the back of you mind  
She's got her hooks in you  
You said you'd never let it happen again  
You spend your money and you're deeper in  
Your fairweather friends call two by two  
To let you know what's wrong with you  
But now your heartbeat's thumpin'  
You watch you nerve ends jumpin'  
Well I can tell yo somethin'  
When it's own up time  
You're gonna toe the line  
She's got her hooks in you  
She's got her hooks in me too.

I've been feeling kind of down and loose  
Like a Rosicrucian pope  
Head down deep in the womb of time  
Carrying a message of hope  
My hands steady as a hangman's hands  
Surer than the hangman's rope  
I could sleep for invisible years  
Carrying a message of hope  
For the future  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope  
  
I found a power on a dusty shelf  
Hey! the languages I learned  
Now I'm so powerful I hurt myself  
I hurt myself  
I feel kind of limbic brain  
Like the library of an astronaut  
Found hidden in a pyramid  
Shadowing a body of thought  
  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope  
  
Madam I'm Adam, I'm a palindrome  
Never odd or even any time  
Fishin' and smilin' like a garden gnome  
Twisting tales and spinning lines  
Why don't we twist like we did last year?  
  
Carrying a message  
Carrying a message  
Message of hope

Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
Bell boys checking out the hookers in the bar  
Slug-like fingers trace the star-spangled clouds of cocaine on the mirror  
The short straw took its bow  
  
The tell tale tocking of the last cigarette  
Marking time in the packet as the whisky sweat  
Lies like discarded armour on an unmade bed  
And a familiar craving is crawling in his head  
  
And the only sign of life is the ticking of the pen  
Introducing characters to memories like old friends  
Frantic as a cardiograph scratching out the lines  
A fever of confession a catalogue of crime in happy hour  
  
Do you cry in happy hour, do you hide in happy hour  
The pilgrimage to happy hour  
  
New shadows tugging at the corner of his eye  
Jostling for attention as the sunlight flares  
Through a curtains tear, shuffling its beams  
As if in nervous anticipation of another day

This house aches  
I whistle it's tune  
After so much noise  
Freedom is silence  
  
Half the house is missing  
Taken half of me with it  
I had imagined this  
Hurting in a different way  
Hurting in a different way  
  
I still have the hi-fi  
Quiet at all volumes  
As my dull thoughts  
Echo viscous and slow like the tolling of some great bell under water  
  
When she cries she cuts me  
And when she smiles I want to die  
Afraid of knowing myself  
Our eyes stare out while we hide inside  
  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
  
The open windows  
Let in the spring air today  
And the birds sing their thankfully happy, brainless song  
But the silence here finds a way to stay  
Some kind of explosion  
God, if you hear me  
Throw me a line or strike me down  
Do you refuse even to accuse  
c'mon, do your worst  
But lift this curse  
  
Built this house on solid ground  
But now it's crumbling tumbling down  
Will nobody here even cry out for help?  
As it slowly collapses into itself  
  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
Looking at it, not seeing it  
  
Hanging on to this pain  
It's no good  
It's no good  
  
But we try again  
  
We try again

Escape is on your mind again  
Escape to a far away land  
Sometimes it sems there is no end  
To long hard nights of drinking  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
Fell over on the couch again  
But you know not all sleep is wasted  
Your dreams are alcohol inspired  
I can't find a better way to face it  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
And you know I'll be fine  
Just don't ask me how it's going  
Give me time, give me time  
'Cause I want you to see  
That the world, that the world  
Is a tangled up necklace of pearls  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in

I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day in the morning.  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning?  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.  
The virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day in the morning

Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever fall in love  
Did you ever dream of falling  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
We are alone in the world  
We must do what we feel we should  
We are told what is right  
Need hurts within us  
We can see sense  
We can feel what feels right  
And so often  
All these things are not at all the same  
They're not at all the same  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
Did you ever dream of running  
And find you couldn't move  
Did you ever dream of running  
Running scared  
Ankle deep in glue  
With the monster after you  
And it's catching up  
Monsters catching up  
And it's catchin' up and you're going nowhere  
And you're slowin' up And you can't wake up  
And it's catchin' up  
and you're going nowhere wake up wake up  
You're falling..  
  
If my heart were a ball  
It would roll uphill  
  
Did you ever see a shadow  
Cast against your bedroom wall  
Crooked shadow in the lamplight  
Ten feet tall  
Did you ever dream of falling  
And find you couldn't move  
Did you give up.  
And discover that you haven't given up  
Did you ever dream of falling  
Did you ever fall in love  
  
hard ball dream love now roll  
fall clown stain truth space time  
race give black white all one  
church state god fast as I could cry  
laugh hide feel no clouds will  
to win sweet seed you me  
hard ball dream love now roll

never do that  
If my heart were a ball it would roll uphill  
All one insane wild sweet heart  
Wild rose  
  
Did you ever fall in love?

When footlights dim in reverence to prescient passion forewarned  
My audience leaves the stage, floating ahead perfumed shift  
Within the stammering silence, the face that launched a thousand frames  
Betrayed by a porcelain tear, a stained career  
  
You played this scene before, you played this scene before  
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye  
A misplaced reaction  
  
The darkroom unleashes imagination in pornographic images  
In which you will always be the star, always be the star, untouchable  
Unapproachable, constant in the darkness  
Nursing an erection, a misplaced reaction  
With no flower to place before this gravestone  
And the walls become enticingly newspaper thin  
But that would be developing the negative view  
And you have to be exposed in voyeuristic colour  
The public act, let you model your shame  
On the mannequin catwalk, catwalk  
Let the cats walk, and the cat walks  
  
I've played this scene before, I've played this scene before  
I the mote in your eye, I the mote in your eye  
A misplaced reaction, satisfaction  
  
You can't brush me under the carpet, you can't hide me under the stairs  
The custodian of your private fears, your leading actor of yesteryear  
Who as you crawled out of the alleys of obscurity  
Sentenced to rejection in the morass of anonymity  
You who I directed with lovers will, you who I let hypnotise the lens  
You who I let bathe in the spotlights glare  
You who wiped me from your memory like a greasepaint mask  
Just like a greasepaint mask  
  
But now I'm the snake in the grass, the ghost of film reels past  
I'm the producer of your nightmare and the performance has just begun  
It's just begun  
  
Your perimeter of courtiers jerk like celluloid puppets  
As you stutter paralysed with rabbits eyes, searing the shadows  
Flooding the wings, to pluck elusive salvation from the understudy's lips  
Retrieve the soliloquy, maintain the obituary  
My cue line in the last act and you wait in silent solitude  
Waiting for the prompt, waiting for the prompt  
  
You've played this scene before

We are jigsaw pieces aligned on the perimeter edge,  
Intelocked through a missing piece.  
We are Renaissance children becalmed beneath the bridge of sighs,  
Forever throwing firebrands at the stonework.  
  
We are Siamese children related by the heart,  
Bleeding from the surgery of initial confrontation,  
Holding the word scalpels on trembling lips.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
This is the ricochet...  
  
Drowning Tequila sunsets, stowaways on midnight ships,  
Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.  
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,  
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.  
  
We are pilots of passion sweating the flight on course  
To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,  
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
This is the ricochet...  
  
Are we trigger happy, happy, happy?  
Russian roulette in the waiting room,  
Empty chambers embracing the end.  
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,  
  
Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.  
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,  
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,  
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.  
  
Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.  
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.  
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,  
And the problems always seem to be,  
We're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.  
  
This is the ricochet,  
I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,  
Will you show me the pieces next time on the ricochet, (ricochet)  
I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,  
  
There's a problem, there's a ricochet, (ricochet)

Many's the time I've been thinking about changing my ways  
But when it gets right down to it it's the same drunken haze  
I'm serving a sentence to write life's sentences  
It's only when I'm out of it I make sense of this  
  
Just for the record I'm gonna put it down  
Just for the record I'm gonna change my life around  
  
Just a revolutionary with a pseudonym  
Just a bar room dancer on my final fling  
Just another writer paying off my dues  
Just finding inspiration well that's my excuse  
  
Just for the record I'm gonna put it down  
Just for the record I'm gonna change my life around  
  
Just another empty gesture with an empty glass  
Just another comic actor behind a tragic mask  
But I've got no discipline got no self control  
Just a little less painful here when my back's against the wall  
  
It's too late, I found, it's too far, I'm in two minds  
Both of them are out of it at the bar  
When you say I got a problem that's a certainty  
But I can put it all right down to eccentricity  
It's just for the record it's just a passing phase  
  
Just for the record I can stop any day

How long can you stand  
Tightening up  
Avoiding the fight  
Avoiding the truth  
Tighten the smile  
Tighten the lie  
Will you get what you want  
To be cursed with your dreams  
I hope for your sake  
Something gets in the way  
  
How long can you stand  
Living under the lens  
The kiss of success  
The ensuing, all consuming, mess  
  
Message of love  
They arrive everyday  
People you touch  
Wasting away  
People you don't know  
Give you no choice  
  
And you're sick to your stomach  
At the sound of your voice  
And the shape of your face  
And the sound of your name  
They send you pictures of yourself  
It's someone you don't know  
And they call you a genius  
Cause you're easier to sell  
But the fire in your belly  
That gave you the songs  
Is suddenly gone  
And you feel like a fake  
Is that what you want?  
  
I hope for your sake  
You've got what it takes  
You've got what it takes  
To be spoilt to death.

(Derek dick, Steve Rothery, Mark Kelly, Pete Trewavas, Ian Mosley)  
  
I was walking in the park  
Dreaming of a spark  
When I heard the sprinklers whisper  
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns.  
Then I heard the children singing  
They were running through the rainbows.  
They were singing a song for you  
Well it seemed to be a song for you  
The one I wanted to write for you  
  
Lavenders blue, dilly dilly, lavenders green  
When I am King, dilly dilly  
You will be Queen  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You. For your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
  
Lavenders green, dilly dilly, lavenders blue  
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You. For your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
  
Lavender dreams dilly, dilly lavender true  
When you miss me dilly dilly, I did miss you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I. O. You for your love  
I. O. You. For your love  
For your love

Well I gave up cocaine and I gave up smack  
I gave up drinking alcohol and smoking crack  
I gave up living on the never never  
But I can't give up believing that I'm going to live forever  
  
Well I gave up computer games, I gave up meat  
I gave up watching TV in my favorite seat  
I gave up wearing fur and I gave up wearing leather  
But I can't give up believing that I'm going to live forever  
  
Give it up, give it up  
Don't you know you've got to lose?  
The desires you were born with  
And your talent to abuse  
Give it up, give it up  
There's a better life to live  
Give it up, give it up  
Give it all you've got to give  
  
Well I gave up sugar and I gave up spice  
I gave up everything that feels alright  
'Cause I feel that these addictions are a chain you have to sever  
I'm addicted to believing that I'm going to live forever

It all began with the bright light  
The bright light and the noise  
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire  
  
Touching and being touched  
A million loose ends to tie up  
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock  
  
The colours stand still  
And then they move around  
Comin' in and out of focus upside down  
  
Empty winter trees  
How space feels  
Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky  
  
One fine day  
The chaos subsides  
Bleeds into awareness  
And a lifetime of surprise  
  
The beauty of your mothers eyes  
The pain when you fall  
You drink it in and marvel at it all  
But you never really figure it out  
  
You get used to it  
  
The babble of the family  
And the dumb TV  
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets  
  
Chemicals in the water  
Drugs in the food  
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system  
  
The attitude of authority  
The laws and the rules  
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school  
  
The heroes and the zeroes  
The first love of my life  
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down  
When they're choosing the sides  
  
I was never any good at it  
I was terrified most of the time  
I never got over it  
  
I got used to it  
  
Alone in the city at seventeen  
With the hollow and the lonely  
The drowning and the drowned  
I was made to feel worthless  
The wretched and the mean  
Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round  
  
Holdin' on, holdin' on  
  
The greed and the missiles  
Exploding somewhere every day  
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground  
  
The cold war's gone  
But those bastards'll find us another one  
They're here to protect you, don't you know?  
So get used to it  
Get used to it!  
  
The clash of religions  
And the loaded prayers  
Information  
The face of starvation and the state of the nation  
  
The sense that it's useless  
And the fear to try  
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us  
Living with the big lie  
  
You get used to it  
Get used to it!  
It's okay, I got used to it

A love song with no validity  
Pretend you never meant that much to me  
Numb, a Valium child, bored by meaningless collisions  
A lonely stretch of headlight, diamonds trapped in black ice  
A mirror cracked among the white lines  
  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
Ashes are burning, burning  
Ashes are burning, burning  
  
A lifestyle with no simplicities  
But I'm not asking for your sympathy  
Talk, we never could talk, distanced by all that was between us  
A lord of the backstage, a creature of language  
I'm so far out and I'm too far in  
  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
I just wanted you to be the first one  
Bridges are burning, burning  
Bridges are burning, burning  
Now, now, now, now

Tell me I'm mad  
How should I know?  
Tell me I'm mad  
I have been here for so long  
  
Help me paint a picture  
They say it's a lie  
Tell me I'm mad  
You're a fine one to decide  
  
Burn me in the fires of wild heaven  
Like it never, never, never would stop  
Tell me I'm mad  
Tell me I imagined that  
  
Was it something I didn't say  
Or was it something I said?  
Leave that stuff alone  
Use me instead  
  
I know I'm always falling off the edge of the world  
I got space in my bed  
You've got Egypt in your head  
I've got a head full of Troy  
Chandeliers and Charlemagne  
Fireworks and toys

I have been here many times before  
In a life I used to live  
But I have never seen these streets so fresh  
Washed with morning rain  
  
I have seen this face a thousand times  
Every morning of my life  
But I never saw these eyes so clear  
Free of doubt and pain  
  
Like the whole world has been made again  
  
I have been here many times before  
In a life I used to live  
  
And it's all because you made me see  
What is false and what is true  
Like the inside and the outside of me  
Is being made again by you  
  
And it's all because you made me see  
What is false and what is true  
Like the inside and the outside of me  
Has been made again by you  
  
Like a bright new morning  
Like a bright new day  
I woke up from a deep sleep  
I woke up from a bad dream  
  
To a brand new morning  
To a brand new day  
Like the whole world has been made again

I'm the man of a thousand faces  
A little piece of me in every part I take  
I hold the tape for a thousand races  
A different point of view in every speech I make  
Cut me a piece of my divided soul  
Cry me a river, call it rock and roll  
Give me an attitude and watch me make it lie  
Pass me a microphone  
I need to testify  
  
Well I speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to the present in the past and future tense  
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience  
  
I'm the man of a thousand ages  
You see my face in the stones of the Parthenon  
You hear my song in the babble of Babylon  
I'm the man of a thousand riches  
Be my guest at the feast of Satyricon  
You spend the money that my logo's printed on  
  
Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to the present in the past and future tense  
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience  
  
I stole a fire but it burned up much too soon  
I took a leap and I landed on the moon  
Look at my life and it looks like CNN  
You see something once  
You know it's gonna come around again  
  
Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to a woman with the fatal charm of a snake  
Forgive like a giver and account for all I take  
Yes, I speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak like a leader with the voice of power and command  
And when I talk to God I know he'll understand  
  
Cause I'm the man of a thousand faces  
Yes I'm the man of a thousand faces  
  
I stole a fire but it burned up too much too soon  
I took a leap and I landed on the moon  
  
Voice of command  
Voice of a snake  
Voice of humanity  
Voice of insanity  
Voice of obedience  
Thousand faces  
Thousand races  
Cry me a river  
Steal a fire  
Face in the stars  
Stones in the Parthenon  
Babble of Babylon  
Landed on the moon

IV  
That was almost the end of my marbles  
Confiscated, I choked back the tears  
I hung onto a handful of favourites  
That disappeared over the years  
  
Did anyone see my last marble  
I swear that I had it before  
Sometimes I think I should go see a shrink  
In case he can find me some more  
  
Did anyone see my last marble?  
I'd saved it to give it away  
Since I was a youth  
Now I don't have no proof  
Only words  
Only words  
Only words.

You sound truly heartbroken  
You can do it. you're a pro  
Agony from every pore. and such control  
The orchestra swoops and the drum samples roll  
You hold the high scream into the key change for the outro  
It's another number one  
And that's exactly where you're comin' from  
But can you play me a song  
For the deliberate loser  
Like an olympic ice skater you've put in the hours  
Learned the routines and the high scoring loops  
And even before you sing the sweet opening line  
You're know that you're scorin at least 5.9  
Here come the flowers  
I saw them gathered all around you  
Hangin' on your every word  
You were telling them you're masterplan  
World domination  
... any way you can  
  
Don't you ever wonder if this will to win is a weakness?  
Don't you ever wonder...

He's seen too much of life  
And there's no going back  
The loneliness calls him  
And the edge which must be sharpened  
He's losing it. And he knows.  
But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough  
The years have been unkind but kind enough  
  
The smell of the earth  
It's his favourite smell  
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell  
To the place where he hurts and he's scared  
And there's no one to tell  
And no one who doesn't listen  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
And I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
For now."  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldn't trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet ocean cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
For now."  
  
"Only me and the sea  
We will do as we please."  
  
He remembers the day he was marched to the front  
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games  
"Look lads" he declared, "This boy's a cream puff  
No guts and no muscles  
No spine and no stuffing"  
The whole schoolroom sniggered  
And silently thanked God it wasn't them..  
  
But time is revenge. All the bullies grow weak  
And must live with faithless women who despise them  
I'll be in Barbados in a couple of weeks  
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard  
A story to tell and a story to save  
..unless she changes her mind  
I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen to much of life so the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight  
  
The wind changed  
I felt it run beneath my ear  
Like silk drawn across my neck  
A dream of your legs  
Defying gravity in love  
  
The medium wave  
Brought signals here from far away  
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray  
Something in the air  
For those who know the signs  
Something in the air  
A storm..  
  
When I was alive  
When I was alive  
Don't wanna remember  
When I was alive  
  
Watch me watch me  
Paint this picture  
Stretchin Hurtin Cursin  
Watch me  
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it....  
Watch me. Watch me. God above..  
  
Between two planets  
In between the points of light  
Between two distant shorelines  
Here am I  
  
Between two planets  
In the black daylight of space  
Between two heavenly bodies  
The invisible man.  
Ripping out the radio  
I want to be alone  
  
"You can take all the boys and the girls in the world  
I wouldn't trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed  
I've seen too much of life  
So the sea is my wife  
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my bones tonight..

She's older than me  
I don't care about them talkin'  
Why can't they see  
I've got all that I need?  
  
All the pretty young things  
Seem suddenly boring  
When I look in her eyes  
All the world is behind  
  
Every line on her face  
Is a place and a memory  
When our fingers touch  
All the years fall away  
  
Mistakes that she made  
Are lessons she carries  
And still she's prepared  
To tell me she'll stay  
  
She's older than me  
She's shown me the heaven  
And we're gonna be over the hill  
And far away...

When we were young we used to say  
Things would be different  
One fine day  
The walls would crumble  
Nations sing as one  
We live in hope  
Cause so far it hasn't come  
  
Listening to the pouring rain  
Waiting for the world to change  
Beginning to wonder if we'll wait in vain  
For one fine day  
  
Oh, how years change  
The things for which we strive  
A better world, or just a quiet life  
What seemed so simple  
Is still so far away  
Don't hold you breath waiting  
For one fine day  
  
Listenin' to the pouring rain  
Waiting for the world to change  
Beginning to wonder if we'll wait in vain  
For one fine day  
  
Life is strange  
It can seem you're high and dry  
Turn around  
You find there's nothing in this world you recognise  
Did we fall asleep babe?  
Dreaming that dream babe?  
  
Listening to the pouring rain  
Did we fall asleep babe?  
Dreaming that dream babe?  
One fine day

Three hundred miles an hour on water  
In your purpose-built machine  
No one dared to call a boat  
Screaming blue  
Out of this world  
Make history  
This is your day  
Blue Bird  
  
At such speeds, things fly  
  
What did she say?  
I know the pain of too much tenderness  
Wondering when or if you'll come back again  
Wanting to live for you  
And being banned from giving  
  
But only love will turn you around  
Only love will turn you around  
Only love  
Only love will turn you around  
  
So we live you and I  
Either side of the edge  
And we run and we scream  
With the dilated stare  
Of obsession and dreaming  
What the hell do we want  
Is it only to go  
Where nobody has gone  
A better way than the herd  
Sing a different song  
Till you're running the ledge  
To the gasp from the crowd  
Spinning round in your head  
Everything that she said

Good morning!  
  
When you look into the mirror  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise  
If you look into the sun too long  
Do the things you see begin to burn your eyes  
  
Paper lies  
  
Just to express what he's thinking  
Must a man take all the mail will bring  
Are we living only for today  
It's a sign of the times  
We believe anything and nothing  
  
Paper lies  
  
When you kill the truth  
You can make a killing  
You might just make losing look like winning  
  
You came to tell the people what's goin' on  
But nobody knows whose side you're on  
Seems like you're sailin' pretty close to the wind again  
  
Paper lies  
You have already won a prize!  
  
I know something that you don't know  
Something that you ought to know  
It's burning a hole in my pocket book  
Listen ... do you want to know a secret?  
We can print our own money here  
If you let us do a piece on you  
We can take you to pieces  
  
When you look into the money  
Do you see a face you hardly recognise?  
When you get behind the news of the world  
Do the things you find begin to bend your mind?  
  
Paper lies  
  
Why don't you let us take a piece out of you?

You carry me around  
Like loose change jingle janglin'  
At the bottom of your bag  
You don't seem to feel it though  
Because you swing down the street  
Walking that unique birthday candle glow  
In broad daylight, in broad daylight  
  
And you don't even know  
The way I love you  
  
You never knew power until you  
You thought that power was this scar  
People pass the laws in gold  
Seen our needs, emotional parts  
  
Oh baby, that's nothing  
  
You think it's kind of sweet  
The stammer and the tremble in my voice  
But don?t mistake it for weakness  
Or some kind of incompleteness  
'Cause round about now  
I can feel it tingle tanglin'  
It's coiled up inside me  
And it?s ready to blow  
  
You never knew power until you  
You saw it fizzed in the over-head lines  
Burning steel are borne to currents  
  
Satisfied the vertical pylons  
You never knew power until you  
Saw it roll like a head with thoughts  
Or melting stone, a new volcano  
Earthquake, thunder, lightning, stars  
  
The way I love you  
Is something you don't understand  
  
The way I love you  
Took more than I could imagine, even now  
You never knew how hard  
All the time you felt so strong  
  
But now you can't function  
The wave of a sleeve  
Is the meaningless slew  
Falls away from your feet  
And the Universe uses  
It's light, streaming free  
Life will scream in the meteor shower  
Of this guided light  
Where you sparkle and fail  
From heavens fell  
  
Take each guiding light  
In in every hour, in every hour  
I know the power, power  
  
Listen to me  
My feelings tremble  
Am I feeling?

Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono  
Wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding  
Nicotine smears, long, long dried tears, invisible tears  
Safe in my own words, learning from my own words  
Cruel joke, cruel joke  
Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono  
A morning mare rides, in the starless shutters of my eyes  
The spirit of a misplaced childhood is rising to speak his mind  
To this orphan of heartbreak, disillusioned and scarred  
A refugee, refugee.

I can imagine nothing more tedious  
Than trying to have fun with you again  
Maybe it's just something in my mind  
But I hate feeling like I'm trying all the time  
It's a kind of lie  
When we pretend that we're still friends  
  
I'm sure you're not exactly short of people to  
hang out and laugh at your jokes  
Tell you you look great  
You wouldn't want me around  
Making it all feel "forced "  
And "put down"  
  
And every time I smile to wonder if I'm laughin' at you  
And with every little grin you don't want to be wonderin'  
Just exactly what it is I'm taking pleasure in  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
It's so easy to persuade myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
I guess that irony  
Will surely be  
The death of me  
  
And every time I smile d'you wonder if I'm laughin' at you?  
And with every little grin you don't want to be wonderin'..  
  
Although I always said  
We were basically the same and all one  
All one  
It's so easy to persuade myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're only happy when you wind me up and I know  
You're so reliable it isn't true  
And it's so easy for me to break down  
If I could jump a ride between the skin and silicon then  
We could join hands and understand. Hallelujah!  
But I listen  
to the ticking  
I guess we're worlds apart  
It's so hard  
So hard  
  
I know there's no going back  
And you know there's no going back  
  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're only happy when you're oiled and jewelled  
You're never happy  
  
I need maintenance  
I need patience  
I'm not foolproof  
I'm not waterproof  
I'm not shockproof  
Bombproof  
Bulletproof  
Fireproof  
Leakproof  
Childproof  
Stainproof  
Pressureproof  
  
I know I told myself  
We're all basically the same and all one all one  
why'know sometimes I just can't help myself  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
I'm clockwork and you're quartz  
  
I know I never get the balance right  
And turn up half an hour late night after night  
And being totally dependable is so very commendable  
Although you're never wrong  
One of these days.. you're just gonna stop.

Such a pretty girl  
The anger didn't hide it  
You shaved your head, pulled a face  
Dressed yourself up without grace  
It didn't hide a life times damage  
It didn't hide a life times fears  
Against your better judgement  
You put your whole self up for sale  
The horror show when you where young  
We couldn't wait to hear about it  
But even whores  
Don't kiss with tongues  
Nonetheless I do believe  
You cry real tears  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
The wrong side of a lifetime's drinking  
It's where it seems I'm coming from  
I took my demons by the hand  
Bent them, twisted them  
Until they scanned and rhymed  
And I took your love  
And all the hurt inside  
Laid it out on the market stall  
Agony at a knockdown price  
Reduced to clear is what I cry  
The wrong side of a lifetime's wishful thinking  
Dragged me here to pills and ale  
Come and listen  
Come and listen to my tale  
Come and get it  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
Real tears for sale  
All the hurt  
All the secrets  
All the damage  
All the shame  
All the dirty absolutions  
All the rage  
All the rage  
All the rage  

Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Put a lock on the door and the telephone  
Was a runaway girl all they could see  
  
Have the nights and the days that you've come through  
Made the right seem wrong and the false seem true  
Was a runaway girl all they could see  
A teenage extra from the satellite TV  
  
Runaway girl  
Too bad, too bad  
Runaway girl  
Too wild, too wild  
  
Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies  
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why  
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see  
All they were prepared to admit to  
  
Runaway girl  
Too bad, too bad  
Runaway girl  
A real wild child  
  
So you cower in the towns forgotten places  
And you make your bed with unfamiliar faces  
And at last you've got your freedom but that's all you've got  
You're tryin' to make your mind up if you're better off  
  
You pretend to wait for washing in some laundromat  
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back  
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them  
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again  
  
Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Did you cry when they dragged you home  
Poor little runaway, poor little runaway

Getting close to seasons end  
I heard somebody say  
That it might never snow again  
In England  
  
Snow flakes in a new-born fist  
Sledging on a hill  
Are these things we'll never see  
In England  
  
We'll tell our children's children why  
We grew so tall and reached so high  
We left our footprints in the earth  
And punched a hole right through the sky  
  
We'll tell them how we changed the world  
And how we tamed the sea  
And seasons they will never know  
In England  
  
So watch the old world melt away  
A loss regrets could never mend  
You never miss it till it's gone  
So say goodbye, say goodbye  
  
We'll tell our children's children why  
We grew so tall and reached so high  
You never miss it till it's gone  
So say goodbye, say goodbye  
To seasons end

Looking at a star you?ve never seen before  
Try to forget it  
So you can see it  
Tasted like you?ve never tasted it before  
Try to forget it  
So you can remember it  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
Love her like you?ve never fallen in love before  
Fall out of love with her  
So you can remember  
And love him like you?ve never been with him before  
Try and forget it  
So you can remember it  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like a baby  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
You see it like  
You see it like  
You see it like a baby  
You see it like  
You feel it like  
Feel it like  
You touch it like  
You touch it like  
You touch it like  
You touch it like?..  

Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
  
So unpleasant inside and out  
So unpleasant inside and out  
If you like I'll tell you about it  
You wouldn't want to know  
  
My heads full of water  
Tears I never cried  
Could you hold me under the shower  
In the cold outside  
  
So unsteady inside and out  
So unsteady inside and out  
If you like I'll tell you about it  
You wouldn't want to be  
  
Separated out  
Separated out  
Separated out  
  
I need medical attention  
Where's my memory gone  
Everything I told you - including this,  
I already forgot  
  
Separated out  
From the living stream  
The thing that couldn't lie straight  
Straight in the machine  
  
So unstable inside and out  
Don't know how much longer I'll take it  
If you like I'll sell you a ticket  
Or you can get in for free  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
Can you kiss my face  
Let me know it's there  
Can you give it shape  
Can you kinda care  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Enough  
Enough  
  
They're pointing and laughing  
They're pointing and laughing at me

Storm clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
I find myself an island in an island  
I have to sort things out just my way  
  
And all I find is my bar  
To laugh, to me I say  
Like all you know is true  
Is for every time we know it's mine  
  
I saw clouds cruise floating cross the blue sky  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Hero down the right way  
Everything will come out my way  
  
Now I know, I see, I find  
It's the only way I ever felt the way I do today  
All I say, I play the game  
I know I never could be sure of all the places that I've seen  
  
Clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Every self an island in an island  
Working every problem out my way  
  
Now I see, I feel, I know  
It's the only way that anything could sort out to the way  
I say you'll find it's out of mind  
It's the only way I could have been  
It's the only way I stand  
  
Clouds cruise  
Float upon the barley

Sheltering her ego on the edge of a floodlit arc  
She'll contemplate seduction, she'll calculate the catch  
When she moved, her presence speared me  
When she spoke, her words ensnared me  
Watch the lizard, watch the lizard,  
Watch the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
She crucified my heart in the depth of a satin grave  
As I lay in sweating monologue I sensed the love light fade  
Within the spiral of the cigarette  
You betrayed your bedside etiquette  
I saw the lizard, I saw the lizard  
I touched the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
I've seen a different doorway shut a million times before  
The smiling she chameleon, the smiling vinyl whores  
  
They know what they want, they sing your name  
And glide between the sheets  
I never say no, in chemical glow we'll let our bodies meet  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I said  
Loving just for laughs, carnal autograph, lying on a lizard's bed  
  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I bled  
Degraded and alone, raped and still forlorn  
Betrayed on a lizard's bed  
We chameleon, we chameleon, we chameleon

A hand held over a candle in angst fuelled bravado  
A carbon trail scores a moist stretched palm  
Trapped in the indecision of another fine menu  
And you sit there and ask me to tell you the story so far  
This is the story so far  
Shuffling your memories dealing your doodles in margins  
You scrawl out your poems across a beermat or two  
And when you declare the point of grave creation  
They turn round and aks you to tell them the story so far  
This is the story so far  
  
And you listen with a tear in you eye  
To their hopes and betrayals and your only reply  
Is Slainte Mhath  
  
Princes in exile raising the standard Drambuie  
Parading their anecdotes tired from old campaigns  
Holding their own last orders commanding attention  
We sit here and listen to all of the story so far  
This is the story so far  
  
Take it away, take it away, take it away  
Take me away, take me away, take me away  
  
From the dream on the barbed wire at Flanders and Bilston Glen  
From a Clydeside that rusts from the tears of its broken men  
From the realisation that we've been left behind  
Is to stand like our fathers before us in the firing line  
  
Waiting on the whistle to blow  
We stand here waiting on the whistle to blow  
They promised us miracles, and the whistle still blows  
Broken promises but the whistle still blows  
Waiting on the whistle to blow  
We stand here waiting on the whistle to blow

Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day'll play you sounds that can't be made  
They'll sing in you from somewhere inside your head  
You'll never hear them from the earth or the air  
You'll never hear them from the outside world  
  
You'll hear it happen inside you  
You'll hear it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day'll play you sounds that can't be made  
I'll feel them humming from somewhere inside your hand  
You'll never hear them from the boring ordinary tawdry world  
You'll never hear them from the anywhere you could call anywhere  
  
I'll make it happen inside you  
I'll make it happen inside you  
  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
Silent and high  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
One day I'll play you sounds that can't be made  
They'll sing in us from somewhere inside our heads  
No One ever heard them but you and me  
  
We'll make it happen inside us  
We'll make it happen inside us  
  
Silent and High  
  
Like the wind blowin'  
In the palms of my mind  
I feel the wind blowin'  
In the palms of my mind  
  
Aurora Borealis shimmering green and blue  
Indigo and violent like phantoms half imagined something unreal but realer  
Than everything seeing all the planet's love floating in the air caressing  
You every day  
If only we can hear them  
  
Sounds that can't be made  
Sounds that can't be made  
  
No it ain't just in your mind babe  
It's inside you dig it out dig it out It's inside you  
Only love can stop you from merely exinsting  
Play me sounds that can't be made

There's a hot hard hurt  
Burning under her skin  
And it pricks her like thorns  
And it's needles and pins  
And it twists in her body  
And I know what it is  
  
And I'm paying in pain  
But it's the cost of the high  
'Till the weight of the secret  
And the weight of the lie  
Makes my heart want to burst  
Feel the ache as time goes by  
Getting better and worse  
Getting better and worse  
  
And there's a screw that I tighten  
As I dream of the kiss  
And it twists and it cuts me  
And you know what it is?  
It's a fragment of love  
From a splintering heart  
And it tears her apart  
But not as much as this  
  
So you save up your tears  
For the moments alone  
'Till the splinters you gather  
Leave you glass-hard and numb  
And the same sun is shining  
On the old and the young  
On the saints and the sinners  
On the weak and the strong  
  
And there's a burning and freezing  
And a cross for a kiss  
So she learns to stop dreaming  
And you know how it is  
With these fragments of love  
And this splintering heart  
With the fragments  
And this splintering heart

I heard the battle raging on the other side of the wall  
Buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all  
Every night when I hear you, I dream of breaking down your door  
An avenging knight in shining armor to rescue you from it all  
From the family business  
  
When I see you in the supermarket  
With sunglasses in the shade  
Averting your eyes from the staring questions  
How were those bruises made  
It's family business  
  
Children clutching to your legs  
They've got so much they want to say  
But daddy's sitting home drunk again  
So they bite their lips and pray  
  
And daddy don't like no strangers prying  
And noses in his private affairs  
And if anyone asks from the social  
Well, you fell down the stairs  
It's family business  
  
So I'll become an accessory  
And I don't have an alibi  
To the victim lying on my doorstep  
The only way I could justify  
It's family business  
  
'Cause every day it's getting harder  
Try to see, to go away  
To all the people that surround you  
You have to sit down and explain  
  
To be the writing on the wall inside  
To be the pledge you call your own  
And if you run into the day  
You sure, you know you'll find a home  
You sure, you know you'll find a home  
  
The traffic lights shine upon  
And the broken home  
Everyone could be so far away  
And the white lines lead the way  
  
The writing on the wall  
They're carving out the martyrs  
  
Could've been the same this way  
Could've been the same this way  
Tell them I'm the same today  
We could have been much younger  
It could have been much longer  
  
Until the real time too far  
You run away today  
Tomorrow, you take away the time  
You took away a mind  
  
Something to the light she said  
Everyone's burning  
We could have been much younger

I was flicking through the channels on the TV  
On a Sunday in Milwaukee in the rain  
Trying to piece together conversations  
Trying to find out where to lay the blame  
But when it comes right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
I heard Sinatra calling me down through the floorboards  
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme  
To the jukebox crying in the corner  
While the waitress is counting out the time  
  
For when it gets right down to it there's no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame  
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me  
We're just sugar mice in the rain  
  
'Cause I know what I feel, know what I want I know what I am  
Daddy took a raincheck  
'Cause I know what I want, know what I feel I know what I need  
Daddy took a raincheck, your daddy took a raincheck  
Ain't no one in here that's left to blame but me  
Blame it on me, blame it on me  
  
Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone  
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone  
Can't you understand that the government left me out of work  
I just couldn't stand the looks on their faces saying, "What a jerk"  
  
So if you want my address it's number one at the end of the bar  
Where I sit with the broken angels clutching at straws and nursing our scars  
Blame it on me, blame it on me,  
Sugar mice in the rain, your daddy took a raincheck

At that time of the night  
When streetlights throw crosses through window frames  
Paranoia roams where the shadows reign  
Oh, at that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Your senses tangled in some new perfume  
Criticism triggers of a loaded room  
Oh, at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
How do I fell inside  
I could honestly tell you  
We've been taken on a very long ride  
And if my owners let me  
Have some free time some day  
With all good intention  
I would probably run away  
Clutching the short straw  
  
At that time of the night  
When questions rally in an open mind  
Summon all your answers with an ice cube chime  
At that time of the night  
At that time of the night  
Pretend you're off the hook with the telephone  
Your confidence wounded in a free fire zone  
Oh, at that time of the night  
  
So if you ask me  
Where do I go from here  
My next destination  
Even isn't really that clear  
So if you join me  
And get on your knees and prey  
I'll show you salvation  
We'll take the alternative way  
Clutching the short straw  
  
If I had enough money  
I'd buy a round for that boy over-there  
A companion in my madness in the mirror  
The one with the silvery hair  
And if some kind soul  
Could please pick up my tab  
And while they're at it  
If they could pick up my broken heart  
  
Warm wet circles

We flew here to see you  
My feelings and I  
I looked down on the city  
From up in the sky  
The sun was reflecting  
From the roofs and the water  
Spring had come early  
In the parks and the old town  
I came with a mission  
To patch up a dream  
We walked and I talked and my words were absorbed  
Into the answering machine  
  
I came two thousand miles  
Just to take a look at you  
But you were broken and frozen  
A heartbreak of a statue  
In the bullet-proof mirrors  
Where your eyes used to be  
I stared at myself and I called for some help  
Into the answering machine  
  
The day slipped by and I tried and tried  
You took me home and you said  
"Goodnight, Sleep tight"  
On the floor by the bedroom door  
I watched you sleep and I left before first light  
  
The bugs don't bite  
The bugs don't bite  
The bugs bite  
  
From the land of the frozen  
To the land of the low  
We journeyed together  
But we were always alone  
So if I should come calling  
Best not pick up the phone  
Cause I'm no good for you and you're no good for me  
Let me talk to the answering machine  
I can cope with the answering machine  
I'm a friend of the answering machine

I'm scared of opening the can  
Scared of changing who I am  
Might've taken all I can  
I'm scared of everything I am  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin..  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
The damage!  
She said she's not telling it today  
She said "Come back when you're alone"  
"Come back when you're alone"  
The damage The damage  
The damage The damage  
The damn damn dam damage  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin'  
Dissent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Don't give me what's in the window, babe  
I want the stuff you think would never sell  
Whatcha have under the counter on the bottom shelf?  
I'll buy the lowdown deepdown primal truthful self  
  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin'  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
Tell me you're the million-to-one  
Are you a natural woman?  
Are you a natural woman?  
I'm a natural man.

I think I have become one of the hollow men  
As I shine on the outside more these days  
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside  
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place  
I think I have become one of the hollow men  
  
I think I have become one of the lonely  
Now that everybody talks to me  
I feel I have become one of the empty  
  
Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye  
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out  
Hollow men have got you long before you realise  
  
The poison paralyses  
  
I think I have become one of a pair of men  
It's a feeling I've been having for some time  
I look down upon myself and watch my movements  
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised  
  
Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men  
Find us anywhere you look  
Come and meet our friends  
Stand us in our silly clothes  
Put our batteries in  
Line us up like fairground ducks  
Watch us grin and grin  
See the lies behind our eyes  
See the will to win  
We'll buy you and we'll sell you  
But perhaps we'll save your skin  
  
Sit quietly and listen to the breeze  
The hollow and the lonely listen too  
Sniff the air for something we can use  
  
We're tin-hard and we rattle when we're shaken

The world's gone mad  
And I have lost touch  
I shouldn't admit it  
But I have.  
It slipped away while I was distracted  
I haven't changed  
I swear I haven't changed  
How did this happen?  
  
I didn't feel myself  
Evaporating...  
  
My body has gone  
But my eyes remain  
Hovering. Witnessing.  
Cold as a ghost ..watching the streets  
Sheltering in doorways of  
Venice, Vienna,  
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam  
  
I have become the invisible man  
  
The invisible heart beating against you  
The invisible pulse silently thumping  
  
I shout my name in the public places  
No one seems to notice  
No one understands  
I stand perfectly still  
In the middle of the road  
I hold my nerve  
I hold my nerve  
Hold my nerve  
But the cars don't swerve  
  
I will hear your prayers  
As you whisper alone  
I am the one you felt was close  
Close behind you in St.Stephen  
You lit a candle  
Blessings in the cold night air  
  
I'll feel your breath as you turn to go  
I'll watch you leave  
From somewhere up high  
As you cross the park  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
In the Autumn light  
  
If I close my eyes  
I can see where you live  
Climb the winding stairs  
Up to your apartment  
The scent of you preparing  
His evening meal  
I must watch in dread  
When he's cruel to you  
In horrified silence  
As you make love  
I cannot lift a hand  
Lift a hand to stop him  
I don't exist What can I do?  
What can I do?  
  
I will scream in your ear  
As you're passing by  
I will wrap my arms around you  
You won't hear, you won't feel me  
I will walk stride for stride with you  
I will try to help  
When you stumble  
You will stumble through me.  
  
I have become the invisible man  
It's all I am  
Invisible  
  
I have read all your letters  
I know what you contain  
I have dreamt your dreams  
My head..  
My head is haunted  
I will scream again  
'I am perfectly sane'  
'I am perfectly sane'  
But I am  
The invisible man  
I am  
The invisible man  
  
Talk to me  
Acknowledge me  
Confide in me  
Confess to me ... or  
Leave me be  
Leave me be.

(fish, steve rothery, mark kelly, pete trewavas, ian mosley)  
  
Hotel hobbies padding dawns hollow corridors  
A typewriter cackles out a stream of memories  
  
Drying out a conscience, evicting a nightmare  
Opening the doors for the dreams to come home  
  
We live out lives in private shells  
Ignore our senses and fool ourselves  
To thinking that out there there's someone else cares  
Someone to answer all our prayers, all our prayers...  
  
Are we too far gone, are we so irresponsible  
Have we lost our balls, or do we just not care  
We're terminal cases that keep talking medicine  
Pretending the end isn't quite that near  
We make futile gestures, act to the cameras  
With our made up faces and pr smiles  
And when the angel comes down, down to deliver us  
We'll find out that after all, we're only men of straw  
  
But everything is still the same  
Passing the time passing the blame  
We carry on in the same old way  
We'll find out we left it too late one day to say what we meant to say  
  
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water  
Those problems seem to arise the ones you never really thought of  
The feeling you get is similar to something like drowning  
Out of your mind, you're out of your depth, you should have taken soundings  
Clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws, we're clutching at straws  
  
And if you ever come across us don't give us your sympathy  
You can buy us a drink and just shake our hands  
And you'll recognise by the reflection in our eyes that deep down inside we're
all one and the same  
  
We're clutching at straws  
We're still drowning  
Clutching at straws  
We're still drowning, yeah clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning  
We're clutching at straws  
I'm still drowning

The only unforgivable thing  
Hauls itself out of bed  
Looks over my shoulder  
At the Bloodyenglishweather  
The only unforgivable thing  
Waits for me in the corner of the room  
Laughs as I clean my teeth  
Laughs as I rub at my eyes  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Is curled up in the wardrobe with my clothes  
Sticks like chicken bones in my throat  
Ruins the ritual Sunday lunchtimes  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Watches itself with me  
Every night on the tv  
Follows me across the park  
As I go out walking in the dark  
Waits for me in the kitchen cupboards  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
  
We will close down  
Hide in the corner of the  
Lost and Found  
For to live without the ground  
Is so unsound  
Gravity would only pull us down  
  
Will no one help the boys  
Who exist only as voices?  
  
I have lost the stars and the sky  
It was so that I could keep the earth  
So now I'm found  
Beyond the rocket-burst among the burned out fireworks  
In No-vember  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Is comfortable in it's own skin  
Whispers "Why did you do this to me?"  
'til it's just about all  
Just about all I can see  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
  
I did..  
I did..  
You did.. You did.. You did..  
We did..

The alarm by the bed  
Wrings the dreams from my head  
It's a new day  
Leave the flakes in the bowl  
Milk unopened, I'm gone  
But I'm still late  
Join the fight for a cab  
Take our place in the jam  
And watch the clock again  
There is a man in my head  
I think he came from the screen  
Or the bible  
All he wants is for me is to be strong  
But I seem to be unreliable  
You know it gets so hard  
When everything you are  
Is everything you don't want to be  
But at the end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away  
The end of the day  
You're the one, you're the one  
The end of the day  
So won't you show me those pictures you hold in your head  
And can you lose me somewhere inside them all  
Because there are colours that run through the heart of me  
That only you can see  
But at the end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away  
The end of the day  
You're the one, you're the one  
The end of the day  
You're the one who burns it all away

On top of the world like a flag on a mountain  
Feeling so high you can feel so alone  
Unable to breathe at the height that you flew  
Staring on clouds with no view of below  
  
On top of a girl like a dream in a hotel  
Falling towards something out of control  
Unable to miss like the man in the tram  
Crashing your car in Amsterdam  
  
He did it without knowing, didn't feel a thing  
He just wrecked it and kept going  
  
The space around the stars  
Is something that you know  
A billion miles of darkness  
Left your feeling low  
The space around the stars  
Is something that you know  
  
Everything about you  
So perfectly restrained  
But everything inside you  
Bites you  
  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
Feels the same inside  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
  
Everyone is only everyone else  
Everybody's got to know  
Everybody lives and loves and laughs and cries  
And eats and sleeps and grows and dies  
Everybody in the whole of the world  
Is the same this time  
Is the same inside  
In the whole of the world

You may not recall the moment that you asked me  
But your invitation was clear  
You'll pretend you've never met me but it's far to late  
Now I'm here  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the one who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your fifteen-stone first-footer  
I'm the uninvited guest  
  
I was there when you said insincere "I love you's"  
To a woman who wasn't your wife  
And I fronted you the money  
That you ran away and blew  
On the biggest regret of your life  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your New Year's resolution  
I'm the uninvited guest  
  
I'm the face you hoped you'd never see  
But always knew you would  
I'm the one thing you knew you shouldn't do  
But did because you could  
  
I'm the evil in your bloodstream  
I'm the rash upon your skin  
And you made a big mistake all right  
The day you let me in  
And you can fly to the other side of the world  
You know you'll only find  
I've reserved the seat behind you  
We can talk about old times  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your fifteen-stone first-footer  
I'm the uninvited guest  
Let me in!  
I'm your New Year's resolution  
I'm the uninvited guest

The rain auditions at my window  
Its symphony echoes in my womb  
My gaze scans the walls of this apartment  
To rectify the confines of my tomb  
  
I'm the cyclops in the tenement  
I'm the soul without the cause  
Crying midst my rubber plants, ignoring beckoning doors  
Clippings from ancient newspapers lie scattered cross the floor  
Stained by the wine from a shattered glass  
Meaningless words  
Yellowed by time  
Faded photos exposing pain  
Celluloid leeches bleeding my mind  
Christ, you've finished playing hangman  
You've cast the fateful dice  
Advice, advice, advice me, this shroud will not suffice  
And thus begins the web  
  
Attempting to discard these clinging memories  
I only serve to wallow in our past  
I fabricate the weave with my excuses  
Its strands I hope and pray shall last  
Oh please do last  
Oh please do last  
  
The fly trap needs the insects  
Ivy caresses the wall  
Needles make love to the junkies  
The sirens seduce with their call  
Confidence has deserted me, with you it has forsaken me  
Confused and rejected, despised and alone, I kiss isolation on it's fevered
brow  
Security clutching me  
Obscurity threatening me  
Christ, your reasons were so obvious as my friends have qualified  
I only laughed away your tears, but even jesters cry  
But even jesters cry  
  
I realize I hold the key to freedom  
Oh I cannot let my life be ruled by threads  
The time has come to make decisions  
The changes have to be made  
  
I realize I hold the key to freedom  
I cannot let my life be ruled by threads  
The time has come to make decisions  
The changes have to be made  
  
Now I leave you  
The past does have it's say  
You're all but forgotten  
A mote in my heart  
Decisions have been made  
They've been made  
  
Decisions have been made  
I've conquered my fears, all my fears  
The flaming shroud, the flaming shroud  
Thus ends the web, the web, the web, the web, the web

Everything crashed  
His wife left him  
He lost all his money  
And most of his friends  
He lay awake all night  
Lonely and desperate  
Contemplating starting again  
  
These chains are all your own  
These chains are comfortable  
  
Four in the morning  
Sat in the kitchen  
Keys on the table  
Went out for a drive  
He didn't know  
Where he was going  
Didn't know  
If he was alive  
  
The dawn was breaking  
A new day was rising  
Shadows creepin' over the fields  
He watched the pink light  
Steal across the horizon  
He realized  
He saw with new eyes  
  
These chains are all your own  
These chains are comfortable  
This cage was never locked  
Born free but scared to be  
This cage was made for you  
With care and constant attention  
This cage is safe and warm  
Will you die and never know what it's like  
Outside

(...If you could only see what I've seen with your eyes)  
  
A wise man once said  
A flower is only  
A sexual organ  
Beauty is cruelty  
And evolution  
A wise man once said  
that everything could be explained with mathematics  
He had denied  
His feminine side  
Now where is the wisdom in that?  
  
I came just as fast as I could  
Through the dirty air  
Of your neighbourhood  
Your name on a grain of rice  
Hangin' around my neck  
And a head like lead  
  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
The Universe demystified  
Chemicals for God  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
  
A wise man once wrote  
That love is only  
An ancient instinct  
For reproduction  
Natural selection  
A wise man once said  
That everything could be explained  
And it's all in the brain  
  
We lay on a velvet rug  
by the open fire  
She blew air on my eyelids  
I cried "What's it all about?"  
As she kissed my hair  
She said "There, there.."  
  
"This is the 21st century  
I heard everything you said  
The universe demystified  
Astronomy instead  
This is the 21st century  
Can't you get it through your head  
This ain't the way it was meant to be  
Magic isn't dead  
Come to bed  
Come to bed  
  
And rest your heavy head my love.."  
And slowly, from above,  
She showed the answer's something that can't be written down  
  
This is the 21st century  
Flash to crash and burn  
Nobody's gonna give you anything  
For nothing in return  
There's a man up in a mirrored building  
And he just bought the world  
  
Would you want  
To have kids  
Growing up  
Into what's left of this?  
  
She shook her head,  
She said "Can't you see?  
The world is you  
The world is me."

There was a boy who came into this world  
At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place  
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog  
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes  
Lived in the shadow of the mountains  
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather  
And the polished wood of his bed  
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river  
Holding the hands of his mother  
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread  
  
And his father on the other side of the world  
On the ships railings and some far away tide  
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad  
In his far away eyes  
In his far away eyes  
  
The smell of the wax on the wooden floor  
Mixture of polish and soap  
No children to fear or to play with  
Rows of empty hooks for the coats  
An upright piano and the boys in the choir  
Still remind him of just before he was born  
Remind him of just before he was breathing  
Strange misty visions of God  
Turn the cities into families  
Into villages of souls  
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping  
With their houses invisible  
Chase the moon between the buildings  
Running as fast as I could run  
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas  
Whispering, "You're the only one"  
  
And ever since I was a boy  
I never felt that I belonged  
Like everything they did to me  
Was an experiment to see  
How I would cope with the illusion  
In which direction would I jump  
Would I do it all the same  
As the actors in the game  
Or would I spit it back at them  
And not get caught up in their rules  
And live according to my own  
And not be used, not be used  
To find the fundamental truths  
It was going to take some time  
Thirty five summers down the line  
The wisdom of each passing year  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
Seems to serve only to confuse  
  
Daddy came out the navy and took us away  
To his dirty grey home town  
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service  
So that he could be around  
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust  
Of his Triumph motor bike  
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner  
Holding tight  
  
From the horizon  
Came home from the Navy to the mine  
From the horizon  
To buried alive  
Took his dream underground  
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes  
  
And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine  
Of a half remembered afternoon  
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain  
Found the boy, decided that his time had come  
Came down out of the sky  
Stung him in the face  
Again and again  
Blue pain  
Screaming like baptism  
Intravenous, Jesus!  
Like being chosen  
Blue pain from something with no brain  
I can't explain  
It's happening again  
It's happening again  
  
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you sit a while with me  
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory  
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay  
Table mountain, flying fish, banana spiders, pots of paint  
And the sun on the equator  
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water  
From crimson to black  
But coming back  
Tomorrow  
On the horizon  
  
The blue pain  
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade  
It stayed  
Blue  
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine  
This love  
  
This love  
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond  
This puzzle  
I don't understand  
That knows no faith  
And tries and fails  
And tries again  
Stares at the sea  
The night's dark deep  
For one last time  
And bleeds  
And bleeds  
And dies for you  
And lies  
And is to blame  
And is ashamed  
And is not the same  
And is true  
And is true

The cars leave their trails of hot and cold light inside my head  
Like burned-in long exposure pictures  
The wheels spin slowly backwards  
Strobing in the amber light  
And the rain comes down and washes my brain  
But it don't get clean  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses me up like a stranger  
This town performs in the window like the ultimate gift  
This town takes us down  
I feel like I'm losing you to this town  
  
We were saving our money for half of our lives  
We were saving our dreams  
And we came to this place to make the chances real  
In the big city  
But I've been counting the days  
I've been watching you change  
And I can feel it dying  
The noise outside takes you in its arms  
Like a lamb to a lion  
  
And down there somewhere among the noise  
The magazine dolls and the big money boys  
Move silently on their easy heels  
They move silently on their greasy wheels  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses you up like a stranger  
This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me I'm late  
This town takes us down, takes us down  
I feel like I'm losing you to this town  
  
The morning breaks and I watch you awake  
This town takes you down away from me again

Here today  
Gone this afternoon  
Another tune we almost remember  
What's the story  
Sex and drugs again  
Business as usual  
The clock's already ticking  
La la la la  
  
When he was young  
Staring at the TV  
He watched the fun happenin' to other people  
Now they scream  
As they run after him  
Like a dream  
Like Elvis and the Beatles  
  
A three minute song is all he wrote  
He only did it for a joke  
They played him on the radio  
From Tokyo to Timbuktu  
A three minute boy, ain't that somethin'  
They named their children after him  
The good times rolled beneath his feet  
He skipped along the one-way street  
  
She's a pretty girl  
She don't know how it started  
She made a movie  
He almost remembered  
She measured up  
They moved into a basement  
"We're so in love!"  
They giggled to the nation  
La la la la  
  
Three minute millionaire they said  
The numbers rattled round his head  
They spun him three times round the globe  
She waited patiently at home  
And all the pretty girls wanted him  
In places that he'd never been  
Too much love will do you in  
Forgive Forgive Forgive Forgive  
Yeah Yeah Ooo  
  
Three minute kid is here again  
Surrounded by three minute friends  
He found someone to understand  
To shock the world and hold his hand  
No religion, no restraint  
No direction, no complaints  
No future and no way out  
No time now to think about it  
All the money's gone  
He don't know what he spent it on  
  
Girlfriends gone off with the Jag  
Gone back to her mum and dad  
He's curled up on the studio floor  
He just can't do it anymore  
The flashgun went off without warning  
He'll read about it tomorrow morning  
  
She's goin' out with someone new  
In this week at number two  
Three minute boy ain't that somethin'

We are led by the light at the end of the tunnel  
We are guided by the fires of our burning dreams  
We're inspired by our ideals and driven by conscience  
To cross what the cynics perceive as naive  
  
We the people want it straight for a change  
We the people are getting tired of your games  
We the people want the answers laid out on the lines  
No more of your cheap propaganda  
And stop talking tic-tac-toe  
  
We the people fight your arms dealers wars  
We the people want our futures secure  
We the people want a peace staying all the way  
So cut out your message  
And take all your talking tic-tac-toe  
  
Everyone needs a symbol  
If you don't know of the reason  
Well how can you take a stand  
You need to return to an open  
Take a lesson from me  
Take a lesson from me  
That children play tic-tac-toe

She took my hand and said "Let's go together"  
"You and me against the world"  
And so we stuck it out through still and stormy weather  
And so we tumbled down the years  
I took her hand and said "Let's go together"  
Just you and me against the world  
  
Let's go together  
Stay together  
We'll tumble down the years  
And we'll come to find the key behind it all  
  
We never stopped to see if we were still in step  
We never checked each other's eyes  
To see who lived in there behind them  
And down the years we disappeared  
  
Let's go together  
Say no together  
We'll tumble down the years  
Let's try together  
Let's lie together  
We'll tumble down the years  
  
And though we never found the key behind it all  
I think we came to know the meaning of the fall  
  
Let's go together  
We said "forever"  
You and me against the world  
Hold on together  
And damn the river  
We'll tumble down the years  
We'll tumble down the years  
We'll tumble down the years

Tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on  
He has eyes down at the bingo on that lucky Friday night  
The match was rained off Saturday but the panel came in bright  
And on Sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub  
  
And on Monday you went to London  
To pick the cheque up with your mum  
You had a tux on, you had a tux on  
The first time you had a tux on, lucky man  
  
There's a photo on the mantelpiece, when you bought your first guitar  
And your girlfriend came to see you when you were the rising star  
You knew your luck was holding when you filled the local hall  
The first time and the last time that you thought you had control  
  
You had a tux on, lucky man, you had a tux on  
You got a tux on, tux on  
Now you're touring stadiums, you've let it go too far  
Standing with your manager, your back to every bar  
  
Burning all your credit cards, chopping out the pain  
Crowding into toilets with a host of your new-found friends  
You got a tux on, nothing's changed, you got a tux on  
Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on  
  
It was eyes down in the parlour, they prayed it wouldn't rain  
A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein  
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late  
The final performance, the main man lies in state  
  
With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on  
Somewhere in a tenement, in a well-thumbed magazine  
Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream  
  
The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life  
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive  
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
He's gonna get one with a tux on, free admission with a tux on  
  
Get it anyway with a tux on  
He's got a tux on the easy way with a tux on, tux on

It used to rain  
Dreary and grey  
Most every day but not any more  
We come out of our homes  
We lie down  
Under the cloud that never comes  
  
We roll in the radiation  
And we make love  
Under the sun  
Under the sun  
  
The polar ice is melting  
'Suits me fine  
We go to the beach  
On the Northern Line  
  
We watch the sea  
Comin' up the street  
Under the sun  
Under the sun  
  
It used to rain  
Dreary and grey  
Most every day but not any more  
We take off our clothes  
And have some fun  
Under the sun  
Under the sun

I lie awake at night  
Listening to you sleeping  
I hear the darkness breathe  
And the rain against the window  
  
After all this time  
Cynical and jaded  
All the stones are diamonds  
All the blues are faded  
  
Everything I've been through  
All I've seen and heard  
Spend so much of my life  
In the spiritual third world  
But you came and brought the rain here  
  
Something waiting to happen  
Something learning to fly  
We can talk without talking  
From inside to inside  
I have waited to feel this  
For the whole of my life  
  
We took ourselves apart  
We talked about our faces  
You said you didn't like yours  
I said I disagree  
  
I keep the pieces separate  
I clutch them in my coat  
A jigsaw of an angel  
I can do when I feel low  
  
From emptiness and dryness  
The famine of our days  
I watch the heavens open  
Wash it all away  
You came and brought the rain here  
  
Something waiting to happen  
Something learning to fly  
On the edge of exploding  
Something wild and alive  
Something waiting to happen  
Any time that you like  
I have waited to feel this  
For the whole of my life

On promenades where drunks propose to lonely arcade mannequins  
Where ceremonies pause at the jeweller's shop display  
Feigning casual silence in strained romantic interludes  
'Til they commit themselves to the muted journey home  
And the pool player rests on another cue  
Last nights hero picking up his dues  
  
A honeymoon gambled on a ricochet  
She's staring at the brochures at the holidays  
Chalking up a name in your hometown  
Standing all your mates to another round  
Laughing at the world 'til the barman wipes away the warm wet circles  
The warm wet circles  
  
I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths  
A classroom's shabby butterflies  
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes  
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts and token proclamations  
Rolled from stolen lipsticks across the razored webs of glass  
  
Sharing cigarettes with experience with her giggling jealous confidantes  
She faithfully traces his name with quick bitten fingernails  
Through the tears of condensation that'll cry through the night  
As the glancing headlights of the last bus kiss adolescence goodbye  
In a warm wet circle  
  
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart, a warm wet circle  
Like a bullet hole in Central Park, a warm wet circle  
And I'll always surrender to the warm wet circles  
  
She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse  
Giving it all away before it's too late  
She'll let a lovers tongue move in a warm wet circle  
Giving it all away and showing no shame  
She'll take a mother's kiss on her first broken heart a warm wet circle  
She'll realise that she played her part in a warm wet circle

We need to talk.. about the way you've been behaving  
We need to talk.. about the Christmas lights in your clothes  
We need to talk.. about the stranger in the kitchen  
We need to talk.. about the scissors and the silver foil  
I thank God..  
You're so fabulously..  
Odd  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right for me  
  
We need to talk.. about the wedding cake, and the wet-suit  
We need to talk.. about the policeman down the hall  
You're truly strange  
But it wouldn't do for us all to be the same  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
Just right for me  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me  
So right  
  
Whatever is wrong with you  
Is so right for me.

And if the bottle's no solution  
Why does it feel so warm  
And if that girl is no solution  
Why did she feel so warm  
And if to feel is no solution  
Why do I feel  
Why do I feel so tired  
Why do I feel so broken  
Why do I feel so outside  
Why do I seem so blind  
I'm so sick of feeling  
It's ruined my life  
  
If living rough is no solution  
Why does it ease my mind  
If looking back is no solution  
Why are we all  
Nothing but children  
Children inside  
  
Why do the Gods  
Sit back and watch  
So many lost  
What kind of mother  
Leaves a child in the traffic  
Turning tricks in the dark  
What kind of God?  
  
I crawled around inside myself  
It was a long way down  
It was a mine and it was mine  
And in the darkness  
I saw a perfect mirror  
Floating in space  
  
When I meet God  
I'm going to ask her  
What makes her cry  
What makes her laugh  
Is she just stars and indigo gas  
Does she know why  
Love has no end  
But it's dark-angel friend  
Tearing women and men  
Slowly apart  
  
Stain  
Don't do that  
Scream  
Don't do that  
Fail  
Never do that  
Never do that  
I want to go out  
Don't do that  
I want an adventure  
Just stay..  
I want  
Just stay in  
I want to make love  
  
And if the bottle's no solution  
Why does it feel so warm  
And if looking back is no solution  
Why are we all just children inside  
And if to feel is no solution  
Why does the whole damn world feel so broken  
So outside and out-of-sorts  
  
A perfect mirror  
Floating in space  
Waves and numbers  
But oh, such beautiful numbers  
And oh, such waves..

When I hit the streets back in '81  
Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown  
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears  
Where have I been for all these years?  
I saw political intrigue, political lies  
Gonna wipe those smiles of self-satisfaction from their eyes  
  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But I'm proud to own my heart  
I will wear your white feather  
I will carry your white flag  
I will swear I have no nation  
But I'm proud to own my heart  
My heart, this is my heart  
  
We don't need no uniforms, we have no disguise  
Divided we stand, together we'll rise  
  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But we're proud to own our hearts  
We will wear your white feather  
We will carry your white flag  
We will swear we have no nations  
But we're proud to own our hearts  
These are our hearts  
These are our hearts  
You can't take away our hearts  
You can't steal our hearts away  
I can't walk away  
No more

Where do we go from here?  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
They boarded up the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner  
You can't take a photograph of Uzis on a street corner  
The DJ resigned today they wouldn't let him have his say  
Surface scratched where the needles play, Uzis on a street corner  
Where do we go from here  
Terror in Rue de St. Denis, murder on the periphery  
Someone else in someone else's pocket  
Christ knows I don't know how to stop it  
Poppies at the cenotaph, the cynics can't afford to laugh  
I heard in on the telegraph there's Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
The more I see, the more I hear, the more I find fewer answers  
I close my mind, I shout it out but you know it's getting harder  
To calm down, to reason out, to come to terms with what it's all about  
I'm uptight, can't sleep at night, I can't pretend everything's all right  
My ideals, my sanity, they seem to be deserting me  
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons  
  
They're burning down the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner  
The heralds of the holocaust, Uzis on a street corner  
The silence never louder than now, how quickly we forgot our vows  
This resurrection we can't allow, Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
We buy fresh bagels from the corner store  
Where swastikas are spat from aerosols  
I sit in the bar sipping iced White Russian  
Trying to score but nobody's pushing  
And everyone looks at everyone's faces  
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence  
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence  
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home  
  
We place our faith in human rights  
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight  
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy  
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks  
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me  
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home  
  
You can shut your eyes, you can hide it away it's gonna come back another  
day  
Racing the clouds home, are we racing the clouds home  
Racing the clouds home

I saw you there last night  
In the latest place  
You were taking in the scenery  
Hungry for a new face  
Seems what I said to you  
Didn't change your mind  
You could open your eyes, realise  
You don't need anyone  
Who's always on the phone  
You don't need anyone  
Who won't leave you alone  
You don't need anyone  
Who'd want you to cut him a key  
You don't need anyone  
  
Out on the streets today  
In the clothes you bought  
And your glossy picture pages  
Full of other people's thoughts  
Will you just wander along  
Live your life this way  
'Till some magazine shows you what to do  
  
You don't need anyone  
Who's always on the phone  
You don't need anyone  
Who won't leave you alone  
To fill up the holes in your life  
To tell you what you're needing  
And make you do what you don't like  
  
You don't need anyone  
To show you where to go  
And turn you into somebody  
You wouldn't even want to know  
You don't need anyone  
As far as I can see  
You don't need anyone  
But Me

You're gone. As suddenly as you came to me  
Like nightfall followed dawn without a day between  
You're gone and suddenly I can't see  
I'm in the shadow of you  
I'm in the shadow of you  
  
I can see you in my minds rose-tinted eye..  
Somewhere you're drifting by  
Your heels rolling sparks on the lucky street  
  
While here am I, left behind  
Stunned and blind  
But I can see you from here  
I can see you so clear  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours together  
  
You're gone, and heaven cries.  
A thunderstorm breaks from the northern sky  
Chasing you back to the daily grind  
  
You're gone. And where am I?  
A haunted life  
The ghost of your laughter  
The half-empty glass  
The half-empty glass  
  
And I wait  
'Til midnight tolls  
Two souls almost touching in the dark  
I'll be allright  
  
You are the light  
You are the light  
You have the day  
I have the night  
But we have the early hours  
We have the early hours  
We have the early hours together

Here I stand head in hand  
Turn my face to the wall  
If she's gone I can't go on  
Feelin' two-foot small  
Everywhere people stare  
Each and every day  
I can see them laugh at me  
And I hear them say  
Hey you've got to hide your love away  
Hey you've got to hide your love away  
How could I even try  
I can never win  
Hearing them, seeing them  
In the state I'm in  
How could she say to me  
Love will find a way  
Gather round all you clowns  
Let me hear you say  
Hey you've got to hide your love away  
Hey you've got to hide your love away
