88 seconds  
Is all it takes  
88 seconds  
Don't make mistakes  
  
We've seen you  
We can see you  
  
In red and blue  
In black and white  
Under crystal skies  
In full daylight  
  
You know it  
God you know it  
  
88seconds  
Is all it takes  
In 88 seconds  
We don't make mistakes  
  
We know you  
Oh yes we have known you  
  
Times are changing  
But not in our street  
Once we played there  
Like the good times  
  
You know it  
God you know it  
  
They're heading for  
A shallow grave  
With a big black cross  
By a tall white house  
To a place down south  
We won't forget  
To be stabbed in the back  
By a man they met  
  
In 88 seconds  
In greensboro  
88 seconds  
In greensboro  
  
88seconds  
In greensboro  
Is all we take

Stop stop going around  
With the girl that I love  
She's already taken  
She's all sewn up  
It'll only end in tears  
She'll only break your heart  
If my fist doesn't get you  
Before she tears you apart  
  
Stop stop going places  
Where you know that she goes  
I've heard all the stories  
It's just another pose  
You'll only get rejected  
Just when you think you've scored  
And when you think you've made it  
She'll be walking through that door  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you won't see me  
Again  
  
Well  
You'd better be careful  
With the things that you say  
Your mouth will get you in trouble  
One of these days  
I know you don't believe me  
And I know it seems absurd  
But it just goes to show  
How little you know that girl  
  
Every little now  
And every little then  
Toe to toe with my best friend  
Arm in arm in luxury  
Heaven knows you won't see me  
Again

I'd travel oh so far  
To be where you are  
I'd travel there by car  
To be where you are  
But if I get there I'd find  
That I'd change my mind  
It happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
  
Always making statements  
And moving step by step  
Always acting theories  
I will regret  
My only consolation  
In the things that I've done  
Are the people who know me  
And the objects I own  
  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time  
To a friend of mine  
Happens all the time

I discovered a big town  
On the crest of a wave  
Throwing money at strangers  
Taking candy from babes  
  
Shaking hands in a big top  
As the rain came down  
I though it would not stop  
Sending letters to paris  
From the empire state  
Taking pictures from the top  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
I grew up in a big town  
The lessons were not hard to learn  
If you want them to love you  
Then you must not love them in return  
  
Spent the night at a party  
Where I drank so much  
I fell under your spell  
  
Eight o'clock in the morning  
And the daylight makes me  
Look and feel like hell  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
There's a lot of things  
For you to do  
There's a lot of dreams  
That won't come true  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry  
  
When you live in a big town  
There are sights and sounds  
That make you want to cry

I want to go up to detroit  
I want to lie in the shade  
I want to visit the president  
And then I want to get laid  
  
I want to go down to memphis  
I want to talk to the king  
I want to tell him we're sorry  
And it won't happen again  
  
I've got a photo of james joyce  
It's a photo by man roy  
It's not very very much like him  
But it's not for me to say  
  
She sacrifices her body  
Almost every night  
Just like a lamb to the slaughter  
And she thinks it makes him feel right  
  
  
You gave me so many problems  
You made me crash in my car  
I'll have a martini cocktail  
And then we'll see where we are  
  
So just be nice to your brother  
I'll take your sister to bed  
And I can bloc bloc bloc till the weekend  
But you'd better come back soon

I've seen a new sensation  
I heard you call in pain  
But running round in circles  
Wont make it right again  
The telephone keeps ringing  
Your head is in the sand  
The future is unfolding  
But it's not what you had planned  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Caught between two evils  
You should have stayed at home  
To wish upon and walk upon  
A planet of your own  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Yes I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
No matter what you do  
There's no escape for you  
You say we go too far  
You say I'll take my car  
  
So it always ends the same  
There's no one else to blame  
But I'd die  
If you would call my name  
  
Oh yes I'd die  
If you would call my name

As the sun descends too quickly  
Behind the distant city  
She will ride under the water  
She will leave her son and daughter  
  
Reduced to lying naked  
To feed those she holds sacred  
She is bare of clothes and beauty  
On disply in her nudity  
  
If someone calls her name out  
All she ever hears are cars  
Through the window in the bathroom  
Through the broken glass and bars  
  
Seeking comfort in the wallet  
Where she placed eighty dollars  
When the last one has departed  
She can slide into the darkness  
  
And slowly down the river  
The current pulls her under  
And it bathes her in it's splendor  
Is unmoved by her surrender  
  
And faint through the water  
The lights like brittle stars  
Someone called her name out  
She no longer hears the cars  
  
Christine...

Rain rain  
Go away  
I couldn't take you  
One more day  
There's broken glass here  
On the floor  
And I can't take this anymore  
  
Stay stay  
Don't leave now  
I'll do anything  
But let you go  
My hands are cold  
My eyes can't see  
You can't do this  
Not to me  
  
Rain rain  
Go away  
I can't stand this one more day  
I'll close my eyes  
I'll shut my brain  
I can't stand this  
Fucking rain  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Close my eyes

Say it isn't right  
To be alone tonight  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
  
All I ever do  
Is what you want me to  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
  
Say it isn't right  
To be alone tonight  
So in love with you  
Tell you what I'm gonna  
Do about it  
  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme  
I had an idea  
Based on a love theme

If you were born in heaven girl, I'd understand so well  
But ever since I've met you child, you've made my life such hell, hell, hell  
With every day that passes I fall nearer to the ground  
It seems that I've been looking for something that won't be found  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye, bye, bye, bye  
  
Could this be the new answer then to all the dreams we've made  
Could there be some solution, please, to rid me of this grace  
But every single second that you held me in your arms  
You build me up, you raise me up  
You kill me with your charms  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye, bye, bye, bye  
  
(Trying to catch your eye)  
Would you stay with me tonight?  
Won't you make these feelings last?  
Can we start this all again?  
Would that be just to much to ask?  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye  
I was only dreaming (Dreaming)  
I was only trying to catch your eye (Trying to catch your eye)  
I was only wishing you would notice me  
Instead you said goodbye

Everyday  
I'm on my knees to pray  
Since I kissed you once  
And I held you once  
Things have never been the same  
  
And I've tried  
God knows I've tried  
But there's nothing left  
In the world today  
That's making sense in any way  
  
Even now, I'm in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
There'll always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
But every time  
I've tried to make you mine  
It seems there's nothing else  
I will ever find  
That will make you stay  
Make you change your mind  
Sad to say  
It's the same thing everyday  
But there's no one else  
In the world today  
That will make it change  
Take the pain away  
  
Even now, I'm in love with you  
No matter what you put me through  
There'll always be someone like you  
Who lets me down again  
  
And everyday no matter what I do  
I'm more and more in love with you  
I can't believe it's really true  
You wouldn't really go

Efficient, logical, effective and practical  
Using all resources to the best of our ability  
Changing, designing, adapting our mentalities  
Improving our abilities for a better way of life  
Babies, mother, hospital, scissors

When all god's children on the Earth will evermore be saved

really must be told

Well  
Here we are again  
Too  
Too good to be friends  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Well  
Look at what we've done  
Three  
Threee rolled into one  
  
Together, together, together  
  
So!  
How can this be true  
We  
We thought that we knew you  
  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
We will watch the morning star  
Rising home over georgia  
Dancing in the ruins of the western world  
Blindfolds on and we don't care

So she treats that guy like a hole in the head  
Can you see him now  
He'll never get lucky again

Heaven is a woman  
Dressed in blue  
And heaven is knowing  
Someone who is in love with you  
Heaven is a television  
Left on all day  
And heaven is making love  
And then running away  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
Heaven is believing  
What your eyes don't see  
And heaven is christy canyon  
Falling in love with me  
Heaven in waking up  
To be a millionaire  
And heaven is spending the whole next day  
Just walking on air  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
All these things you say and do  
It doesn't mean that much to you  
But all these things you said to me  
The memories won't set me free  
Heaven is a dream  
When it won't come true  
And heaven is the sky  
When it's always blue  
Heaven is the girl  
With short black hair  
And heaven is a woman  
With enough to spare  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
  
Heaven is  
And heaven is taking a holiday  
And heaven is having you here to stay  
And heaven is never ever saying sorry  
And heaven is as easy as abc  
And heaven is your eyes when they're always blue  
And heaven is just right here with you  
  
Heaven is  
Heaven is  
Heaven is

To hold you  
Love you  
To see you smile at the break of day  
To touch you  
Know you  
Want you by me when you're far away  
  
It's easy to say  
But hard to do  
When you're in love  
With a foolish child  
And everybody  
Just can't understand  
They say, see him, watch him  
He will change his mind  
  
But I see you  
Want him  
You're always with him  
When the lights go down  
You need him  
Love him  
He promises  
He'll always stay around  
  
It's easy for me  
When the daylights here  
It's easy to be happy  
When I'm in the crowd  
But maybe someday  
I could take his place  
I want you, need you  
I won't change my mind  
  
But he holds you  
Loves you  
He has you with him  
Loves you  
  
But he holds you  
Loves you  
He has you with him  
Loves you  
At the break of day  
He'll touch you  
Know you  
Wants you by him  
When you're far away  
  
If all these things you say are true  
There's one thing I need to know  
Is this love or lies, just a flame or a fire  
There's something I need and only you can help  
  
To hold you  
Love you  
See you smile  
At the break of day  
  
To touch you  
Know you  
Want you by me  
When you're far away  
  
To hold you  
Love you  
Have you with me  
When the lights go down  
  
To see you  
Need you  
Promise me  
You'll always stay around

First you say you're in love with me and that it lasts eternally.  
Then I find that you change your mind, but one and one will not make three.  
Well, I'm glad to say the distance is one thing I never mind.  
But every thought of leaving is the last thing on my mind.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
Everything that I've promised you,  
I tried and tried to make it all come true.  
But if I break your heart again, well this time it'll never mend.  
When I beg for freedom, you only chain me down.  
With everyday that passes now, the answer can't be found.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
All across the nation.  
People in frustration.  
There's those who need someone to stay.  
And those who've got to run away.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.  
  
So if you're still in love with me then why won't you just set me free?  
Cause if I'm not in love with you then there's no chance to see this through  
Again.

The youth and the imperialist tribune was also addressed by a young girl  
From nicaragua whose hands had been cut off at the wrists by the former  
Samosa guards.  
Veronica merco, of the german federal republic, had this to say:  
  
Aber ich habe eine ausbildung gemacht  
Ak industrie kaufmann und... ? ?  
  
I'm a shop assistant at the... ? ?  
And I must say I'm a shop assistant by profession,  
But it is difficult for.... ? ?  
  
Now and then a little thing gets by.  
Now and then we'll cry.  
  
Like a fall in a war, like a mother's open arms.  
Like a pawn in a game, hard to take.  
There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and pray.  
  
All the time we are gone, there's no reason, there's no way.  
Oh, the soul is the one so they say.  
There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and play.  
  
She never thought he'd be this way.  
Her arms aloft, she holds.  
But now it's all a memory.  
And it's gone...

Little catholic girl is fallin' in love  
A face on a page, a gift from above  
She should've known better than to give her heart  
She should've known better than to ever part without me, without me  
I gave her everything that I ever owned  
I think she understood it but she never spoke  
She shouldn't oughta try to be that way  
She shouldn't have to go there every day without me, without me  
  
Now listen to us good and listen well  
Listen to us all and everything we tell  
We should've known better than to give her away  
We should've known better to this very day, without me, without me  
Listen Joan of Arc, all you gotta do  
Say the right words and I'll be coming through  
Hold you in my arms and take you right away  
Now she's turned away to another land  
We never understood it why she gave her hand  
She shouldn't oughta promise, cause it's just pretend  
I know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again without me, without me  
Without me, without me

The means to an end  
The sinful distress  
Writing down meaningless words  
Vaguely off hand  
So the rest of the band  
Can learn from the bees and the birds  
Concentrate business man you,  
You haven't got long  
Planets are ruling your hearts  
Stilletos and thighs may be burning your eyes  
But it keeps you from falling apart  
  
Heavy but generalised  
Sordid and wet  
Someone advised me to die  
Blowing your mind  
'cause you know what you'll find  
When you're looking for things in the sky  
Under the influence  
Rotting our nerves  
Cutting us off at the mains  
Nearing the end with your grandmother's friend  
It's something to do when it rains  
It's something to do when it rains  
It's something to do when it rains

La femme accident's  
Got everything you want  
You never have to know  
She's hanging on your every word  
  
She clings to your heart  
She won't let you depart  
Oh this mine  
But she's with you all the time  
She's crying like a fragile child  
  
But if you get to know her  
She's not a little girl  
And if she gets to know you  
You can't escape her world  
  
La femme accident  
A woman full of want  
Her hearts on the line  
You haven't go the time  
She suffers like some joan of arc  
  
She says there's just no justice  
In this world  
She's paradise for a day  
  
La femme accident  
What reason could you want  
Just use her and turn away  
  
La femme accident  
Got everything you want  
She's paradise for a day

Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
Crossing every ocean for the sake of locomotion  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldn't have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I can't say no to you  
  
I can't say no I can't say yes  
I can't even write down my own address  
I can't touch heaven it's a little too far  
It's the only way to travel  
Got dreaming on a par  
I'm staring through the window  
Wondering where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every nation  
From the harbour to the station  
It's a form of inspiration  
It's a power to the state  
They run down the railways  
Sail across the seaways  
Fly through the airways  
But they can't say no  
To you  
  
I can't stand up I can't stand still  
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel  
I just want to say that it's only common sense  
But the words always fail me at my own expense  
I'm staring out the window  
Wonder where you are  
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour  
  
Across every ocean  
For the sake of locomotion  
But I wouldn't have a notion  
How to save my soul  
I walk down the sidewalk  
Run down the boardwalk  
Stop and make small talk  
But I can't say no to you

She walks real slow  
Talks like an animal  
What am I  
Supposed to do  
I've tried to explain  
My heart's not a radio  
But I can't seem  
To get to you  
Face to face  
Tears on a heart of stone  
When she talks  
I walk away  
It seems to me  
It's just a waste of time  
These are words  
I know she's heard before  
She's the girl  
Guess I'll always know  
And I've tried  
I've tried  
She always seems to know  
The morning after  
But not before  
I haven't slept  
Worrying  
I know I promised  
To come see you  
But now I have these  
Things to do  
All in all  
It seems to me  
You don't understand subtlety  
Shall I make it obvious  
Do you really want me to make up?  
She doesn't talk  
For days and days  
And when she does  
She always says  
That I act real slow  
Behave like an animal  
What am I supposed to do?  
And I've tried  
I've tried  
But she always seems to know  
We don't make sense  
Love and Violence  
We don't make sense  
Love and Violence

I love and hate you  
At the same time  
I need you don't need you  
Is that such a crime  
I wouldn't walk down the road  
To say goodbye  
I couldn't give you up  
To some other guy  
I wouldn't do anything  
That you asked me to  
But you know  
That it's true  
I still love you  
I want you to help me  
To make up my mind  
I need you to hear me at least  
Some of the time  
I wouldn't blame you  
If you had to run away  
I couldn't stand to live  
Like this another day  
But I would sell my soul  
To get you back today  
Cause you know  
That it's true  
I still love you  
I wouldn't blame you  
If you had to run away  
I couldn't stand to live  
Like this another day  
But I would sell my soul  
To get you back today  
Cause you know  
That it's true  
I still love you  
And you know  
That it's true  
I still love you  
And you know  
That it's true  
I still love you

It worries me this kind of thing  
How you hope to live alone  
And occupy your waking hours  
We're taking sides again  
I just wept I couldn't understand  
Why you started this again  
  
And every day you send me more  
It makes it worse is this a plan of yours  
To ensure I don't forget  
I'd write and tell you that I've burnt them all  
But you never send me your address  
And I've, I've kept them anyway  
  
So don't ask me if I think it's true  
That communication can bring hope to those  
Who have gone their separate ways  
It hardly touched me when it should have then  
But memories are uncertain friends  
When recalled by messages  
  
Coded messages  
Poison letters

Mystereality  
It's not the same game anymore  
A-nor the time or the places before  
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know  
  
If you see me you'll be asking  
It's always take take take take take take take take  
Oh reality don't fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
Mystereality  
Well really it's all just promises  
You know how much I hate the unforeseen  
Oh don't you know  
  
A-never never a regard for the truth  
What's the meaning of that mister are  
Oh reality don't fool me  
No mistakes this time  
  
My my reality  
So where did we go wrong  
Have you seen just a-recently  
The lengths to which we've been  
  
Now you could say that it's time  
Escapes they seldom work  
Oh reality don't fool me  
I count on you to know

In ecstasy they cry to know  
If their parents love will let them grow  
Their mother's pride, their father's joy  
We thank the stars that they're not boys  
The native daughters of the golden west  
Their beauty is priceless  
  
As children do they stayed at home  
Waiting for the day that they were grown  
The future seemed so far away  
But every night they'd kneel and pray  
  
But all in all they did their best  
And one by one they left the nest  
Across the globe they searched for love  
And put their faith in God above  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They're made out of light  
We never would have guessed  
  
So by and by their dreams came true they fell in love with boys they knew  
Their children grew fed from the breast  
Of the native daughters of the golden west  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They talk all day  
But we were not impressed  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They're sisters of mercy  
They'll grant your last request

Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
I dream of you  
With me tonight  
We're all alone  
Under the neon lights  
  
And walking home  
You're by my side  
The neon lights  
Are in our eyes  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light  
  
Neon lights  
Shimmering neon lights  
And at the fall of night  
The city is made of light

Save it for the next time  
Hands over my head  
Faintest sound of lightning  
Faintest sound I heard  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
  
All around my body  
All around my feet  
Please they are watching now  
Placed around my feet  
  
All around my body  
Please they are watching now  
  
Save it for the next time  
Hands over my head  
Faintest sound of lightning  
Faintest sound I heard  
  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
I'll never, no, no  
I'll never...  
  
All around my body  
Please they are watching now

Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
And when you start to lose the fight  
And nothing else will make it right  
  
Only hearts are meant to break  
And when you make that last mistake  
And everything you tried to say  
But all the words got in the way  
  
Only God can hear you now  
When you make that final vow  
Say the words and say them loud  
Say the words that make you proud  
  
And when you lose someone you depend upon  
Only tears will fall  
And when you need a friend I will send you one  
Only tears are meant to fall  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all  
  
Only tears are meant to fall  
Only once and that is all

I got a secret and I can't explain  
All the time, I've waited for this day  
All along I was never in doubt  
I always knew it would never get out  
There are things that I cannot tell  
And there are things that you know damn well  
This is getting very hard for me  
I guess you'd better just wait and see  
  
This is all, this is all  
You heard a message and the message was clear  
All the time you wipe away that tear  
And all I want is to hold your hand  
To see the sun and walk the sand  
You make me sad and you make me glad  
My secret is this love  
Is love, is love  
All my secret is this love  
  
Everyday you're always there  
You comfort me  
And make me feel it's worth my while  
And then I look around and you're not there  
And everyday you say you care and I'll beware  
  
This is all, this is all  
  
I've got a secret and I can't explain  
All I want is to hold your hand  
All along I was never in doubt  
To see the sun and to walk the sand

If there's one thing I know  
Things are gonna change  
There's gonna be a different ending  
Though I'm not one to complain  
  
But there's never been a right time  
And we've never been too far  
But you're the only single reason I know  
That's holding back my heart  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
And the second time  
Just wouldn't be the same  
But you're changing with your faces and  
You're gonna be lost again  
If you're with or without me  
I've made up my mind  
Well I'm hpoping and praying  
But you're running out of time  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
Take your kiss from my mouth  
Take your heart from my heart  
This will never happen again  
You know that your promises  
Won't last for one day  
God knows it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
God know it's a shame  
But it's always the way  
  
God know it's a shame  
But it's always, it's always the way

Everyday  
A new start  
A cheap affair  
A sordid truth  
We'll never learn  
To guide our hearts  
We'll never find  
What we deserve  
  
She's leaving  
She waited for so long  
  
She'd pretend  
Thant she cared  
Invent some tale  
Just to gain his heart  
But no more dreams  
She didn't dare  
She washed her hands  
Of this whole affair  
  
She's leaving  
She waited for so long  
  
But as she left  
She gave her heart  
Abandoned hope  
And turned for home  
I thought I'd ask  
But then again  
The more we learn  
The less we know

God only knows this isn't heaven.  
The promises made, we never keep them.  
  
Chorus:  
We're walking on air, we're taking our time.  
But God only knows this isn't reason or rhyme.  
  
I've had this feeling I don't believe in.  
It's happened before, I just reject it.  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
These are the feelings, I know their outcome.  
It's useless pretending, I'd like to beat them.  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
We're walking on air, we're taking our time, this time.  
But God only knows, this isn't reason or rhyme.  
  
We're walking on air...

Have you heard about the hollow man?  
Too frightened so he turned and ran, from the vision that he cherished so.  
Couldn't see it, so he let it go.  
Everybody has a secret sin.  
But everybody needs a chance to win.  
Anyone could see I'm a man that's sad and broken by the things I've done.  
But now I'm sorry that I said goodbye.  
And I'm sorry cause it's me that's crying.  
I never finished what I started to, but I'm just so sorry that I'm hurting
you.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
Now I'll never make a new beginning,  
And I'll never stop the pain from winning.  
Nothing matters to me anymore now.  
I've lost the things I was fighting for.  
And now I'm sorry that the dreams are gone,  
And I'm sorry cause I'm not the  
One who comes running when you need me so,  
Cause I'm the fool that's let you go.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
All the tears of pain are falling down, (oh, oh, oh, oh).  
All the tears of pain are falling down, and you know...  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
But it's too late for us to just be friends.  
And too late for anything but the end.  
And too many dreams fell through our hands.  
And it's just too late to understand.  
  
But it's too late... Too late... It's too late...

It doesn't matter if you're black or white  
Or the God that you choose to pray to  
It doesn't matter about the clothes you wear  
Or which creator made you  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
  
It doesn't matter who you think you are  
You're living and you know you feel it  
It's not important as to why we're here  
You know there is no reason  
  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
It's universal, it's universal  
We all bleed the same blood  
We all need the same love  
And when we die there's no heaven above  
It's universal, it's universal  
It's universal, it's universal
