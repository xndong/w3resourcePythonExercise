Who was it organizing the right  
To follow my leader  
Seems we look and stand around waiting  
For a sign from God  
Speaking for myself  
The christian need  
The Muslim need  
The Buddhist need  
To testify the need for brotherly love  
  
I know there's so many hundred things  
Things to talk about  
Making us laugh  
Just like a Shakespeare revolution  
Please organize our spiritual evolution  
Do that you'll feel it  
And we'll feel it  
Appreciate it's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
  
Saint or sinner  
Makes no difference in who you believe  
In a world of superstition  
Caught in a total nuclear greed  
  
Pioneers of the twenty first century  
Looking on and looking fast  
To try and fix and try and help  
This very need  
I know there's so many ways  
That we can work it out  
Whether we live or die  
  
Please organize the simple evolution  
so there's got to be  
so we can see  
to be free  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
It's almost like love  
  
So promised in a hundred letters  
Should be getting to you any time now  
So promised a surprise for you  
For getting so far from now  
It's almost like love  
The way the first one out discovers  
It's almost like  
How many times can you recover  
It's almost  
  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like  
It's almost like love

I could not take it oh so seriously really  
When you called and said you'd seen a UFO  
But then it dawned on me the message in writing  
Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before  
  
I looked out, in the night  
Strange and startling  
Was this voice of time just saying  
There's got to be a linking of everyone  
Got to be a center  
It all comes flooding back  
  
Arriving through eons of times immortal power of the future to behold  
Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have known  
  
So look out, in the night  
Once they arrive  
On that perennial light  
Impress a bolder empire of energy  
In the ships we see  
The coming of outer space  
  
You say there's no reason to conjure  
With the force as it has been known to be see  
You say I'm a fool, a believer  
Put your feet on the earth it is green  
  
But look out, in the night  
Wait for they arrive  
To start such sciences anew  
Here it is the coming of outer space  
Such a pure delight  
The coming of outer space

And in the ruins of the balloon  
Stood a man with glasses held high,  
Wondering when to do it again  
Have another fly into the sky,  
Somewhere flying high.  
  
Astral trav'ller leaving without her,  
Wandering where lights go,  
Leave out the body load.  
  
Once in the air, people who dare  
Get a great respect in being.  
(Astral trav'ller.)  
Heavenly flight wondrous night  
And all the sights worth seeing  
Just believe in  
  
Astral trav'ller leaving without her,  
Wandering where lights go,  
Leave out the body load.

High vibration go on  
to the sun, oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me.  
Where can I be?  
  
Wish the sun to stand still.  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here,  
be here now.  
Here we can be.  
  
AWAKEN SUNS HIGH STREAM through AWAKEN  
GENTLE STRONG DREAMS BEGIN HERE AWAKEN  
MASS .)(. MASS  
TOUCH STAR,SONG,AGE,LESS TOUCHING  
  
Workings of man  
set to ply out historical life.  
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree.  
All awakening, all restoring you.  
  
Workings of man, crying out from the fires set aflame.  
By his blindness to see that the warmth of his being  
is promised for his seeing, his reaching so clearly.  
  
Workings of man  
driven far from the path.  
Rereleased in inhibitions  
So that all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all this left for you now.  
  
Master of things. Master of light.  
Songs cast alight on you. All pure chance.  
Hark through dark ties. As exists cross divided.  
That tunnel us out of sane existence. In all encircling mode.  
In challenge as direct. Oh closely guided plan.  
As eyes see young stars assemble. Awaken in our heart.  
  
Master of soul. Master of time.  
Set to touch. Setting sail.  
All impenetrable youth. Over all of our lands.  
Ask away. And as we look.  
That thought be contact. Forever closer.  
With all that's clear. Shall we now bid.  
Be honest with yourself. Farewell, farewell.  
there's no doubt, no doubt.  
  
High vibration go on  
to the sun, oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me.  
Where can I be?  
  
Wish the sun to stand still.  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here.  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me.  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me.

Never underestimate the loving  
How we intertwine our very soul  
How we fill each other's spaces to lose control  
When you're talking, be the children  
Who stand on solid ground  
Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around  
  
I'll be there, to bring this love in the morning  
I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night  
I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing  
  
Never underestimate a giver  
The gift of love will surely be  
When you're asking for the secrets to set you free  
When you're talking to the friendship  
That love of higher self  
This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts  
  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the good in life desert you  
Be the one, giving in to love  
Never let the fools destroy your dreams  
Be the one, giving in to love  
I can dream myself every minute  
So how did we become, masters of limitation?  
  
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there  
To make it right for you  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
It's the balance of this everyday feeling  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Without love our dreams become illusion  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can hear you singing every minute  
So you can sing the song, and see the truth  
  
So we worked all around amidst the glory of life  
Any fire of the flame would be made  
Should the famine of change to disguise everyone  
Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made  
But all because we're changing now  
As the prophets of doom speak their mind  
It's a long, long way from where mankind began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
  
So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat  
All our efforts as one sent today  
Taking back instead of giving, taking back more or less  
Taking back a sense of being afraid  
So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man  
And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead  
  
But all this senseless killing, and all these chains and lies  
I want to know right now, I want to know right now  
I want to know where we come from  
For it's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind  
It's a long, long way from where the system began  
It's a long, long way humankind, yea  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can see and feel the truth every minute  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you  
Giving in, giving in to love  
There's no way that you can live without it  
So we can become, masters of our invention  
  
Giving in, giving in to love  
I can see and feel the truth every minute  
Giving in, giving in to love  
Be the one to rescue you, rescue you  
Giving in, giving in to love  
There's no way that you can live without it  
So we can become, masters of our invention  
  
Never underestimate the power  
Never underestimate the power

Sparkling trees of silver foam cast shadows in winter home,  
Swaying branches breaking sound, lonely forest trembling ground.  
Masquerading leaves of blue run circles round the morning dew,  
Patterns understood by you, reaching out beyond and before.  
  
Time, like gold dust, brings mind down to hidden levels underground,  
Say a few words to the wind, that's all that's left of winter's friend.  
  
Reaching the snow in the days of the cold, casting a spell out of ice.  
Now that you're gone,  
The summer's too long and it seems like the end of my life  
Beyond and before.  
Time, like gold dust, brings mind down.

Can you imagine what it's like seeing life  
From the other side  
Do you imagine darkened light, starless night?  
You might need a guide  
  
And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts  
And alter your mind  
Or become a delusion, exclude you  
Change your existence  
For another kind  
  
See what you see for yourself, 'til your heart  
Is open wide  
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it there  
And you believe it  
And you believe it  
  
Can you imagine what it's like, seeing life  
From the other side  
Do you imagine light darkened, starless night  
You might need a guide  
  
And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts  
And alter your mind  
Or become a delusion, excuse you  
Change your existence  
For another kind  
  
See what you see for yourself, till your heart  
Is open wide  
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it here  
And you believe it  
And you believe it

City of love City of love City of love  
  
Once bitten twice shy  
No  
No regrets at all  
Justice  
Body smooth take over  
Good girls they work the city  
Good guys they spike you hard  
How they jive ad jingle  
When you're in their backyard  
  
Street corner wonder lust  
Beckoning the good guy  
Take this get that  
Have a good time  
  
He young and tactile  
He ready for anything that is  
How they jive and jingle  
They've read the book that gives  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
Supervise this good treatment  
Alternative line by line  
So the street guys so observant  
Take him for a ride  
Have a good time  
Like a legend the man he sharp  
His woman gladly watching  
As he strides out of the dark  
Better be quick get away  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
Solo  
  
Good timing has its good price  
One trick and you're stuck with the dice  
How they jive and jingle  
When you're their sacrifice  
  
Fast as lightning  
Go  
Go get high  
He's looking good  
Once bitten twice shy  
No woman no cry  
No woman don't cry  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come  
  
We'll be waiting for the night  
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all the reasons lately  
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die  
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being  
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life  
  
Shirley gets to help her with the child though  
she's strung out on crack time  
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love  
Together getting high to get to mess up their night  
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind  
Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get  
higher  
  
Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says

That's what you say  
Does it really happen to you  
Does that explain  
This is the season for this display.  
To take a look  
In time to move together  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is the measure before it's begun  
Slips away like running water  
Live for the pleasure, live by the gun  
Heritage for sun and daughter  
Down to the slaughter up for the fun  
Up for anything.  
  
Could this be true  
Does it ever happen to you  
And can you prove  
That wheels go 'round in reason  
You take a step  
In time,  
To move together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You walk, the way  
You take, the path  
To be, assured  
You draw, a graph  
The scale, you use  
Is all, on black  
Be brave, the weight  
Will make, the heat  
There is, no way  
To take-it back.  
  
[Chorus]

You're first I'm last  
You're thirst I'm asked to justify  
Killing our last heaven beast  
Don't hunt the whale  
  
In beauty vision  
Do we offer much  
If we reason with destiny, gonna lose our touch  
Don't kill the whale  
  
Rejoice they sing  
They worship their own space  
In a moment of love, they will die for their grace  
Don't kill the whale  
  
If time will allow  
We will judge all who came  
In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail  
Don't kill the whale  
  
CETACEI....

When I'm walking beside her,  
People tell me I'm lucky  
Yes I know I'm a lucky guy  
I remember the first time  
  
I was lonely without her  
Can't stop thinking about her now  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
When I'm with her I'm happy  
Just to know that she loves me  
Yes I know that she loves me now  
There is one thing I'm sure of  
  
I will love her forever  
'Cause I know love will never die  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
When I'm with her I'm happy  
Just to know that she loves me  
Yes I know that she loves me now  
There is one thing I'm sure of  
  
I will love her forever  
'Cause I know love will never die  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
Every little thing,  
Every little thing,  
Every little thing,  
Every little thing.

Get the idea cross around the track  
Underneath the flank of thoroughbred racing chasers.  
Getting the feel as a river flows.  
Would you like to go 'n shoot the mountain masses?  
And here you stand no taller than the grass sees.  
And should you really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
  
Going for the one  
Going for the one  
  
Get in the way as the tons of water  
Racing with you crashing through the rudder.  
Once at the start you can gamble  
That you really surely really mean to finish.  
After seeing all your sense of fear diminish.  
As you treat danger a pure collection.  
As you throw away misconceptions.  
Going for the one.  
Going for the one.  
Going for a  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touch time  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high.  
Roundabout, sounding out, love you so  
Love you so  
Love you so  
  
Now the verses I've sang  
Don't add much weight to the story in my head  
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line.  
But they're so hard to find  
In my cosmic mind  
So I think I'll take a look out of the window.  
When I think about you  
I don't feel low.  
N'should I really chase so hard.  
The truth of sport plays rings around you.  
Going for the one.  
Going for the one.  
Going for to  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touch time  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high  
Taking your time  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
Listen in time  
Taken so high  
To touch to move  
Listen to life  
Touching touchtime  
Travel twilight  
Taken so high  
Taking your time  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
Turn on to love  
Turnstile to one  
Tender timing  
Rocking rolling  
  
Moments decide.  
Moments delight.  
Moments in flight.  
Talk about sending love.

Love comes to you and you follow  
Lose one on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with its arms  
All around me  
  
Lost on a wave and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
Lost in the city  
  
Lost in their eyes as you hurry by  
Counting the broken ties they decide  
Love comes to you and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Lost on a wave that you're dreaming  
Dram on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with its arms all around  
Me  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
I feel lost in the city  
  
Lost in their eyes as you hurry by  
Counting the broken ties they decided  
  
Straight light moving and removing  
Sharpness of the colour sun shine  
Straight light searching all the meanings  
Of the song  
Long last treatment of the telling that  
Relates to all the words sung  
Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits  
You  
  
Love comes to you and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the sun with its arms all around  
Me  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
I feel lost in the city

How you caught me when I was falling fast  
Caught me when I was falling fast

Into your life

Jacaranda  
Help me out tomorrow  
Jacaranda  
Don't want to be alone  
Keep falling over  
A spell that brings me sorrow  
Give and take  
I shouldn't be afraid  
So you give me this big story  
It wakes me every day  
The challenge is to chase the sounds  
Just to break away  
  
And I'm running  
Running  
Yes I'm running  
A simple peace  
Just can't be found  
Waste another day  
Blasting all their lives away  
I've heard the thunder  
Underground  
Tunneling away  
At the very soul of man  
  
And I'm running  
Yes I'm running  
I'm running  
Through a new world  
  
There is the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D  
There stands our children's lives  
  
All in the sharp step  
As one together  
All in all we race  
As one

Just can't be found  
Waste another day  
Blasting all their lives away

Underground  
Tunneling away  
At the very soul of man  
At the very soul of man  
  
And I'm running  
Running

See through science  
Part of a back door  
A door made up of doors  
To an endless time  
To a new world

Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D

Now and forever  
This time, brothers in time  
Is it hard to take  
Take this coice  
Is it hard to find  
Now and forever  
This fire brothers of fire  
Hard to find  
  
As it kicks so hard  
Hard to find  
As it kicks on time  
As it kicks on time  
  
There in the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
There stands our future  
There can be no denying  
Simple as A be see D  
As it kicks so  
As it kick so  
As it kick so  
There in the heart of millions  
Seen as a godsend to us  
  
All in a sharp step  
As one together  
All in all we race  
As one  
This time

Deeper than every ocean  
Deeper than every river  
That's what your presence brings to me  
  
Revealing the words I listen  
Seeing you in my silence  
Learning I'm with you constantly  
As I was before  
  
If we were flowers  
We would worship the sun  
So why not now?  
This high is shining brightly  
Brighter than before  
  
As the door was open wide  
There inside was a diamond chair  
Where I sat when I was young  
I wrote down the words  
  
Only when the young at heart  
Can enter the real world  
This chance I've waited for  
For you to see  
  
If I had chances I would spend them with you  
To hold you close and let your love surround me  
Deeper than before  
  
(Deeper than every ocean)  
And I know this love is real  
(Deeper than every river)  
Realize this is meant to be  
That's what your eyes they say to me  
You are listening to how I feel  
So expectedly  
(Brighter than every morning)  
From the ocean to the sky  
(Beautiful as the sunset)  
Every river to the sea  
Nature surrounds me constantly  
We can hear love constantly  
This is for you and me  
  
Turn around and come deeper now  
So what happens when I touch you there  
You feel the words roll over you  
Thinking of the better scenes  
The memories  
As everybody else just  
Hasn't got the time  
To help you anymore  
  
'Cause if the reason for  
The things that pleasure us  
To please ourselves  
Not pressure us  
To give our ego  
Some pleasure time  
  
Can you imagine  
Any reason  
To know you're only fooling yourself  
And then you'll understand why  
You'll understand why  
  
So if we choose to realize  
All existence is a dream  
This perfect resume to you  
From me  
  
Just had a tough time with magic  
The death of ego  
The moon  
It was just coming through  
  
Send me such a good time  
In a letter form, tell me  
The pleasure, no pressure  
Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream  
  
I get amazed like a true beginner  
I get amazed like a true believer  
I get amazed when I see you there  
And I come alive  
  
I believe I'm a true beginner  
I believe I'm a true beginner  
In your arms I can see it all  
I can see it all  
  
If we were flowers  
We would worship the sun  
So why not now?  
This light is burning brightly  
This light is burning brightly  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
  
Turn around and remember that  
When it gets so low  
As you finally hit the ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
Now I'm standing tall  
Standing on my sacred ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
When it gets so low  
As you finally hit the ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
Now you're standing tall  
Standing on sacred ground  
Standing on sacred ground  
Standing on sacred ground

Memories, how they fade so fast  
Look back, that is no escape  
Tied down, now you see too late  
Lovers, they will never wait  
  
I am a camera  
  
Take heart, I could never let you go  
And you, always let the feeling show  
Love us all, how you never broke your heart  
You lose them  
If you feel the feeling start  
  
I am a camera, camera, camera  
  
And you, may find time will blind you  
This to just remind you  
All is meant to be  
  
There, by the waterside  
Here, where the lens is wide  
You and me  
By the sea  
Taken in tranquility  
  
Taken, taken so easily  
To pass into glass reality  
Transform, to transfer, to energy  
  
Taken, taken, so easily  
To pass into glass reality  
Transformer, transferring energy

You can fool yourself  
You can cheat until you're blind  
You can cut your heart  
It can happen  
  
You can mend the wires  
You can feed the soul apart  
You reach  
It can happen to you  
It can happen to me  
It can happen to everyone eventually  
  
It's a constant fight  
A constant fight  
You're pushing the needle to the red  
Black and white  
Who knows who's right  
No substitute you're born you're dead  
Fly by night  
Created out of fantasy  
Our destinations call  
  
Look up  
Look down  
Look out

It can happen today  
As it happens

This world I like  
We architects of life  
A song a sigh  
Developing words that linger  
Through fields of green through open eyes  
This for us to see

Golden forest, golden lake  
Sanctuary, state of grace  
I will find reason a place to begin  
It will be a good day  
  
Beginning is one place, I've been before  
Watching the sunrise on the silver shores  
Setting me free again, leading the way  
It will be a good day  
  
Sometimes I forget, how mighty this earth  
Astounding winter skies, truth is in birth  
Peace that it brings to me, my beautiful eyes  
Be a good day  
  
Make me believe again  
Making me free again  
Making me see again  
  
Golden mountains, golden seas  
A thousand reasons singing to me  
Alive to this message, realizing it all  
Be a good day  
  
Learning to listen, learning to see  
Learning is power, making me free  
Free to believe again in my human side  
Giving me good reason  
Giving me good reason  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Make me believe again  
(Destiny)  
(Take the river)  
Making me free again  
(To the sea)  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Making me see again  
(Will be free)  
  
Like a river  
Time feels so much closer now  
You are with me, so real  
  
We make our own heaven  
Clear through the sky  
The making of reason for you and I  
I sing of each season  
Making us feel  
This will be a good day  
This will be a good day  
  
(Come tomorrow)  
Make me believe again  
(Destiny)  
  
(Take the river)  
Making me free again

I can feel no sense of measure  
No illusions as we take  
Refuge in young man's pleasure  
Breaking down the dreams we make real  
  
One down one to go  
Another town and one more show  
Downtown they're giving away  
But she never came back  
  
No phone can take your place  
Do you know what I mean  
We have the same intrigue  
As a court of kings  
  
Ah leave it, ah leave it  
Dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit  
Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot  
  
Two down there you go  
McArthur Park in the driving snow  
Uptown they're digging it out  
Better lay your claim  
  
Get home you're not alone  
You just broke out of the danger zone  
Be there to show your face  
On another dreamy day  
  
Ah leave it, ah leave it  
Dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit  
Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello, hello, heaven  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello, hello, heaven  
  
I can feel no sense of measure  
No illusions as we take  
Refuge in young man's pleasure  
Breaking down the dreams we make real  
  
Ah leave it, ah leave it  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello, hello, heaven  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello, hello, heaven

Long distance runaround  
Long time waiting to feel the sound  
I still remember the dream there  
I still remember the time you said goodbye  
Did we really tell lies  
Letting in the sunshine  
Did we really count to one hundred  
  
Cold summer listening  
Hot colour melting the anger to stone  
I still remember the dream there  
I still remember the time you said goodbye  
Did we really tell lies  
Did we really count to one hundred  
  
Long distance runaround  
Long time waiting to feel the sound  
I still remember the dream there  
I still remember the time you said goodbye

Cold summer listening  
Hot colour melting the anger to stone  
I still remember the dream there  
I still remember the time you said goodbye  
Did we really tell lies  
Did we really count to one hundred  
  
Looking for the sunshine

Looking around me,  
There's not so much in life I miss.  
Things that I can't see,  
I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss.  
Then I saw you standing there  
With a smile I couldn't share,  
Just looking around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Tunes that I can't hear  
Would take me for a while my smile.  
Fares that are too dear,  
I'd rather walk out another mile.  
Then I heard a tune so right,  
It was in the dark of night,  
Just list'ning around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Smiles that I don't see,  
I'll make them up as I go on.  
Laughs that just can't be,  
I'll make and laugh at ev'ry one.  
Then I saw you in your place  
With a laugh upon your face,  
Just looking around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Looking around with my feet on the ground  
Full of words and of sound, bringing smiles all around.  
  
Satisfy me with your words that can be,  
Full of sound and I'll see I'm just looking around.

Love can seem such a mystery  
Confusing though it may be  
It's the one thing that we all need most  
  
Love can make your world go round  
Sometimes it can bring you down  
Yet there's no way to avoid the fall  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
Love will finally bring us all  
Together eventually  
There's only one road for us all  
  
Releasing our fear of the unknown  
Believing in what could be  
Now it's time for each of us to answer the call  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
Sometimes love can be so true  
Sometimes it's running out on you  
No matter how hard you try  
You can't avoid the fall  
Only love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Believe in what could be  
Now its time for each of us  
To answer the call  
  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all  
  
We can solve the mystery  
Together eventually  
Love conquers all

All good people  
  
Your flame is the fire that burns in the night  
Guiding me through  
Drawn out of the darkness and into the light you bring me to  
  
Give me hope  
When I need it  
Give me peace  
When I feel it  
Give me life  
When I breathe it  
Give me dreams

I won't dream again until I dream again with you  
1234567  
All good people got to feel the love  
I won't sleep again until I sleep again with you  
  
One chance in a million  
To find a true love between two  
Taken by the powers of what you believe  
Knowing you can't lose  
  
Give me hope  
When I need it  
Give me peace  
When I feel it  
Give me life  
When I breathe it  
Give me dreams

Do you feel the love shine?  
Beyond the sun  
Beyond the sky  
These very questions lie  
Starlight  
Loving, in a lifetime  
  
It was the first time candlelight  
Something happens in your lifetime  
It's the dance we all go through  
Bring it in now  
Bring it in true  
Bring it in fast  
Bring it right through  
Right through  
  
Feel the love shine  
1234567

You want to get close to me  
The feeling so clear  
But I need some time to see  
Vision through my tear  
You want to get next to me  
I need your intrusion  
I don't need to be  
Blinded by confusion  
  
Here is my heart  
Waiting for you  
Here is my soul  
I eat at chez nous  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way for me and you  
  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
So you want to get over me  
And that's how you feel  
Everything you want to be  
Seems so unreal  
I want to be all of you  
And that's the confusion  
It's so hard for me  
To draw a conclusion  
  
Here is my heart  
Waiting for you  
Here is my soul  
I eat at chez nous  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
Love will find a way  
I believe that there's a way  
If you want it to  
Will love find a way  
Love will find a way  
Will love find a way  
Love will find a way

Run down a street  
Where the glass shows  
That summer has gone  
Age, in the doorways  
Resenting the pace of the dawn.  
All of them standing in line  
All of them waiting for time.  
From time, the great healer,  
The machine-Messiah  
Is born.  
  
Cables that carry the life  
To the cities we build  
Threads that link diamonds of life  
To the satanic mills  
Ah, to see in every way  
That we feel it every  
Day, and know that  
Maybe we'll change  
Offered the chance  
To finally unlearn our lessons  
And alter our stance.  
  
Friends make their way into systems of chance  
(Reply- friends make their way of escape into systems of chance)  
Escape to freedom I need to be there  
Waiting and watching, the tables are turning  
I'm waiting and watching  
I need to be there.  
  
I care to see them walk away  
And, to be there when they say  
They will return.  
  
Machine, Messiah  
The mindless  
Search for a higher  
Controller  
Take me to the fire  
And hold me  
Show me the strength of your  
Singular eye.  
  
History dictating symptoms of ruling romance  
Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance  
All of us standing in line  
All of us waiting for time  
To feel it, all the way  
And to be there when they  
Say they know that  
Maybe we'll change  
Offered the chance  
To finally unlearn our lessons  
And alter our stance.  
  
Machine, machine Messiah.  
Take me into the fire  
  
Hold me, machine Messiah  
And show me  
The strength of your singular eye.

I will be there said my friend of a distant life  
Covered in greens of a golden age, set in stone  
Follow me, "he sounded of dreams supreme" follow me  
Drifting within the glow and the after-glow of the eve  
  
And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame  
  
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age  
  
Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love  
Most of all play with the game of the age  
Highest of places remain all as one with you  
Giving us light and the freedom of the day  
  
And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame  
  
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age  
And have always been here  
  
Celestial travellers have always been here with us  
Set in the homes of the universe we have yet to go  
Countless expansions will arrive and flow inside of us  
My friend, he of fantasy, dancing with the spirit of the age

Days that we speak  
I believe that you are right  
Shouldn't chase the demons and the phantoms of the night  
  
Some treat as lovers  
Some treat as slaves  
This fusion of insight is all that we imagine  
  
Speak to me clearly  
You're the magnet to my soul  
I get so distracted trying to reason with it all  
Like the faithful  
I'm clinging to the edge of every world  
Spinning in creation  
So afraid to let my feelings really show  
  
Teach me to teach me  
How the key unlocks the door  
As we open we surrender, holding hands with many more  
There's a feeling that's coming  
There's a feeling so real  
To justify, to magnify, to realize that  
Everything is love  
  
Now, after all the love you have  
You can always get it back  
Knowing how you really see  
Knowing it will come to you  
Knowing it can really be  
  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Growing taller learn to survive  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Listen to your heart  
Growing taller learn to survive  
  
Perception of living  
I realize I'm not alone  
The rings that divide  
Break again on solid stone  
I will show you a necklace  
Where the pearls would all be lost  
Without the thread between together  
This would be the golden thread of trust  
  
Speak to me, teach me  
Magnify the truth you are  
Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star  
  
A symbol is planted  
On the brow of every child  
To justify, to magnify  
To realize that everything is love  
  
Now giving all the love you have  
You will always get it back  
Giving all the love you have  
You can always get it back  
Giving all the love you have  
Giving all the love  
  
Magnificate, magnification  
Magnificate, magnification  
First you're smaller being alive  
Growing taller learn to survive

I am the man in the moon  
And I hope to shine upon you very soon  
Waiting in the night  
To bathe you all in moonlight  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Silently revolving  
Wandering through the heavens above  
On my own  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
I am a creature of the night  
And I hope to come and shed a little light  
Although the universe our teacher  
I remain the central feature  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Silently revolving  
Wandering through the heavens above  
On my own  
  
I am the man in the moon  
Round and round  
And I hope to shine upon you very soon  
Round and round  
Waiting in the night  
To bathe you all in moonlight  
I am the man  
I am the man in the moon  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
Round and round and round I go  
When I stop no one will know  
  
It's that old devil moon  
It's that old devil moon

Don't forget to seek out the world  
If you want to stay [stake out]

Holding the fire  
Just as long as you can control  
This point of your desire  
  
Great days, it will all come to you [Wait as it will ...]  
Feel another future response [Feel it as a...]  
You get the heaven you like  
You get the heaven  
You get the heaven you need  
You get to heaven now

From the inside  
Just as long as you hold the key  
From the inside

Ascend and create  
Ascend and create  
Ascension

Looking for the chance to call  
Making the world  
Independently  
  
Whole  
Watching for the place to run  
Dancing, dancing, move  
  
We will make it right  
We will dance for you  
On this night of nights  
They will make it through  
  
Through the eyes of child  
And the wish you are  
As the thought that comes  
From a distant star  
  
Whatever thoughts you have  
Can become a new dream  
For the perfect stance  
Take you there and back again  
  
And you believe you are  
Independently whole  
Waiting for the signs, whole (home)  
Reaching for the far side show  
  
Whole  
Dancing for the moon  
Dancing for the light

Pushing for the mind drive  
Dancing for the hour [earth]  
Dancing for the light  
Whole

Each and every night

Close around your soul  
It will count for you  
It will make you whole  
  
To the eyes of child (Through the eyes...)  
And the song of songs  
It will make you move  
It will transfer you  
  
And so it comes to this now  
When you walk into the bliss that  
Holds down the fire  
As pleasure will divide (divine)  
  
So close, so let your heart enter  
Succumb and let your heart enter this (So come, and let...)  
  
So close, and let yourself lose control  
Heaven help the love that you send  
Heaven has the love you send.  
Really (Breathe)

If you want to stake out  
Actions speak much louder the words (than words)  
And you get to realize  
Just as long as you have control  
Holding the fire  
Just as long as you get to keep  
This point of your desire  
  
When tense, it will come to you (Wait as it will come to you)  
Fear of the future response (Feel it as a future response)  
You get the heaven you like  
You get to heaven  
You get the heaven you need  
You get to heaven now

Step out in the night  
When you're lonely  
Listening for the sounds  
That your ears don't hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
And he'd walk miles for you  
  
Stop, you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Dawn turns to day  
And the dawning  
Daytime, nighttime  
And we still can't see  
Why must we wait until the morning light  
To wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
Wake up and be  
  
Step out in the night  
When you're lonely  
Listen for the sounds  
That your ears don't hear  
I know your cross is heavier  
With every step  
Every step  
But I know a man  
Who'd walk miles for you  
  
Stop, you stay where you are  
Take a look at yourself  
Take a good look at yourself  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know  
  
Can tell your momma  
She'd only tell ya  
That she told you so  
The life you're leading  
She won't believe  
The riches of life  
We all know

There can be no answer for us all  
There can be no stopping what is ever changing  
Living for the perfect dream  
It's time to make a resolution  
There will be some peace in our hearts and our minds  
  
[Chorus:]  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
There's no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
There's no way we can lose  
  
Ready or not  
We can all find a way  
  
We will be forgiving to the ones we love  
We will see the blossoming of the new spirit  
Shaping everything to our design  
We'll build a brighter future  
We will free ourselves from the chains that would bind  
  
[Chorus]  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
There's no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
There's no way we can lose  
No way we can lose  
  
Ready or not [Repeat x1]  
  
There's no way we can lose  
  
We can all find a way  
Ready or not [Repeat: x1]  
  
[Chorus]  
We can all find a way to resolve our differences  
There's no way we can lose  
When we all realize that there are no differences  
There's no way we can lose  
No way we can lose  
  
Ready or not [Repeat x2]  
  
No way we can lose

Toledo was just another good stop  
Along the good king's highway  
My fortification took me by surprise  
And hit me sending me sideways  
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine  
Can't help thinking  
  
Singing the Rule Britannia  
And this is where it grabs you  
There's method in the key of see  
Toledo's got to be the silver city  
In this good country  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
That stuff of syncopation  
  
Ever tried driving it to golden heights  
Just simply jiving it  
My mystification it got a  
Jewel skies crazy spacing it  
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices  
Singing speechless  
  
Touching of the healing heart  
So this is where we really start  
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions  
As long as music plays its part  
Good good part  
  
Our song  
It gives us a reason  
Our song  
That good remedy  
Music has magic  
It's good clear syncopation  
  
Treat it good  
Treat it rightly  
And if you get it flowing  
The harmony is glowing  
So get ready  
So get ready  
Don't go toledo toledo don't go  
Music  
Good to you  
Music  
Good to you

Move yourself  
You always live your life  
Never thinking of the future  
Prove yourself  
You are the move you make  
Take your chances win or loser  
  
See yourself  
You are the steps you take  
You and you, and that's the only way  
  
Shake, shake yourself  
You're every move you make  
So the story goes  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Much better than a  
Owner of a broken heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Say - you don't want to chance it  
You've been hurt so before  
  
Watch it now  
The eagle in the sky  
How he dancin' one and only  
You, lose yourself  
No not for pity's sake  
There's no real reason to be lonely  
Be yourself  
Give your free will a chance  
You've got to want to succeed  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Much better than a  
Owner of a broken heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
After my own indecision  
They confused me so  
Owner of a lonely heart  
My love said never question your will at all  
In the end you've got to go  
Look before you leap  
Owner of a lonely heart  
And don't you hesitate at all - no no  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Much better than a  
Owner of a broken heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Much better than a  
Owner of a broken heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Sooner or later each conclusion  
Will decide the lonely heart  
Owner of a lonely heart  
It will excite it will delight  
It will give a better start  
Owner of a lonely heart  
  
Don't deceive your free will at all  
Don't deceive your free will at all  
Owner of a lonely heart  
Don't deceive your free will at all  
Just receive it

When you've tried most everything and nothing's taking you higher.  
When you come to realize, you've been playing with fire.  
Hear me when I say to you, it's really down to your heart.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love in sight.  
You've got the way to make it all happen.  
Set it spinning turning roundabout.  
Create a new dimension.  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection.  
  
I've been all around the world and seen so many faces.  
Young and old a story told, filling in my spaces.  
Now without a trce of doubt I feel it every hour.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love inside.  
Could be an ever opening flower.  
No hesitation when we're all about  
To build a shining tower.  
No explanations, need to work it out.  
You know we've got the power.  
  
Parallel our sights.  
And we will find, that we, we need, to be, where we, belong.  
Parallel our heights  
Display our rights, and wrongs, and always keep it--STRONG.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love in sight.  
Could be an ever opening flower.  
No explanations, need to work it out.  
You know we've got the power.  
  
It's the beginning of a new love inside.  
You've got the way to make it all happen.  
Set it spinning turning roundabout.  
Create a new dimension.  
When we are winning we can stop and shout  
Making love towards perfection.

I see the cold mist in the night  
And watch the hills roll out of sight.  
I watch in ev'ry single way,  
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry day.  
  
The sun can warm the coldest dawn  
And move the movement on the lawn.  
I learn in ev'ry single day,  
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry way.  
  
And there you are,  
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,  
And boy you'll see  
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,  
  
And then you'll say  
Even in time we shall control the day,  
When what you'll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me.  
  
And one peculiar point I see,  
As one of many ones of me.  
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,  
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,  
Perpetual change.  
  
And there you are,  
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars,  
When all you see  
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me,  
  
And there you're standing,  
Saying we have the whole world in our hands,  
When all you'll see,  
Deep inside the world's controlling you and me.  
  
You'll see perpetual change.  
You'll see perpetual change.  
  
And there you are,  
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,  
And boy you'll see  
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,  
  
And then you'll say  
Even in time we shall control the day,  
When what you'll see  
Deep inside base controlling you and me.  
  
As mist and sun are both the same,  
We look on as pawns of their game.  
They move to testify the day,  
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,  
All of the way.  
Ah, Ah.

Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth as it circles by  
Get the sky sea creation fly  
  
This point of living  
This point of giving  
This chance of living has got to be known  
  
Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind  
To the animal, primalistic grind  
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life (Bring me reason)  
You don't say you're sorry  
  
Call this real love  
Activates this mission to be  
On the same time line  
Call this free love  
Get a ticket on the master plan  
On the freedom climb  
  
Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
The point of living  
The point of living  
This chance of living  
Far away in the depths of Hawking's mind  
To the animal, the primalistic grind  
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life  
You don't say you're sorry  
  
Call this free love  
Activate the mission to be on  
The same time line  
Call this free love  
Get a ticket on the master plan  
On the freedom climb  
  
Call this free love  
You can activate this message  
On the concourse of your fine mind  
Call this real love  
Get off those chains, get off those chains  
Get off those changes coming to you

Innocence no answer  
To your breaking heart  
If the situation  
Sometimes falls apart  
  
Then in this ecstasy  
Your charms are frozen  
No emotion falling through your arms  
Morning, daydream, time still growing shorter  
  
Take me over lead me to the water  
To the rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
Why should I escort you  
To your secret needs  
Climbing up your ladder  
I keep falling down  
  
Anyway will do  
Anyone will do  
When you dance to your darkest tune  
Surrounded  
  
As you crawl around the room  
Night time fever burning till you're higher  
Take me over lead me through the fire  
The rhythm of love  
  
To the rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
To the rhythm of love  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Inhibitions keep you from your point of view  
Information needing to confuse  
In this situation I have found you  
  
In the rhythm of  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Rhythm of love  
  
Rhythm of love  
To the rhythm of love  
Rhythm of love

I'll be the round about  
The words will make you out 'n' out  
I spend the day your way  
Call it morning driving through the sound and  
In and out the valley  
  
The music dance and sing  
They make the children really ring  
I spend the day your way  
Call it morning driving through the sound and  
In and out the valley  
  
[Chorus]  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
  
I will remember you  
Your silhouette will charge the view  
Of distance atmosphere  
Call it morning driving through the sound and  
Even in the valley  
  
[Chorus]  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
  
Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching  
Down on the land  
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees  
The rim of the land  
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather  
Spins out of hand  
  
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more  
Than grains of sand  
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers  
By in our hand  
Nex to your deeper fears we stand  
Surrounded by a million years  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out 'n' out  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out 'n' out  
  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you  
  
I'll be the roundabout  
The words will make you out 'n' out  
You spend the day your way  
Call it morning driving through the sound and  
In and out the valley  
  
[Chorus]  
In and around the lake  
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there  
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you  
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too  
Twenty four before my love you'll see  
I'll be there with you

I asked my love to give me shelter  
And all she offered me were dreams  
Of all the moments spent together  
That move like never ending streams.  
  
Run to the light  
Everything is alright  
Run thro' the light of day  
You run to the light of night  
  
And every movement made together  
Till every thought was just the same  
And all the pieces fit forever  
In the game.  
  
Welcome to the light  
Now everything is okay  
Run thro' the light of night  
You run to the light of day.

Now the season now the question  
Time to breathe a moments grace  
For the hunter and the hunted  
Taking time to break the pace  
  
Are you hopeful are you haunted  
By the ghost of Christmas past  
Face the future Undaunted  
Step aside or take your chance  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love comes and goes  
Run with the fox  
  
Every year the revolution  
Won or lost before begun  
While we thrive on mass confusion  
Thus we walk before we run  
  
Run with the fox  
Into the wind on to the dawn of tomorrow  
Run with the fox  
Into the wild into the wild and the cold  
Beware of the rocks  
And be prepared prepare for love finally grows  
  
Let us live to tell our story  
Here on earth and out in space  
Forward on the road to glory  
History records the chase  
  
Have yourselves that certain Christmas  
Eat be glad and drink the wine  
Leave your sadness by the river  
Giving love and given time  
  
Across the ice of frozen lakes  
Run with the fox  
Along the lanes a lover takes  
Run with the fox  
Beneath the moon a Christmas moon  
Run with the fox  
And sing a tune a dreamers tune  
Run with the fox  
Across the bridge of many ways  
Run with the fox  
On to the planes where dreamers play  
Run with the fox

Does it matter if you broke this spell  
So unreal is the future life along the way  
They dare you  
To turn around, it all comes through this feel  
It doesn't ring true  
  
Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world  
Silent talking, always dreaming, sing me to this beautiful world  
Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world  
Silent talking, always dreaming, sing me to this beautiful world  

Soft as a dove  
Touching the hand that lays next to me  
Innocent light  
Leading us through a moment in time  
  
Then you came home  
I let you cry like a father should do  
Innocent light  
Leading us to a moment in time  
  
Soft as a dove  
Touching the hand that lays next to me  
Innocent light  
Leading us through this moment in time  
Thoughts run away  
You're overcome by a flood of believing  
  
Just like a dove you're flying away  
Everything beautiful coming your way  
Everything beautiful coming your way

So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars  
In the moonlight we prays for forgiveness that's ours  
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs  
And the freedom of love  
  
Chances are when you give the love you have  
You will find it coming right back  
Giving into the love  
You know it's right  
It's a feeling you'll long remember  
  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
Sailing into the dreams of what could be  
Reaching out for some form of contact  
Waiting for the one you know is right  
All you're needing to do  
Surrender  
  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
So many times on the clouds of forgiveness  
We walk through the country and feel so at ease  
A gentle reminder how things really are  
In the homelands of love  
  
Face to face with the one you really love  
Moving forward down the right track  
Chances are when you give all that you have  
You will find it flooding right back  
  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
Somehow  
Someday  
Hearts will be chosen  
  
O'er the green mountains and o'er the green valleys  
The bluebird of faith sails far off to the shore  
She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love  
For the homelands of Ireland  
  
So many times on the clouds of forgiveness  
We walk through the country and feel so at ease  
A gentle reminder how things really are  
In the homelands of love  
  
So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars  
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours  
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs  
And the freedom of love

Could be  
Who knows?  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannon-ballin' down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows?  
  
It's only just out of reach  
Down a block, on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling there's a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
  
Could it be  
Yes it could  
Something's coming  
Something good  
If I can wait  
  
Something's coming  
I don't know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
With a click  
With a shock  
Bell will jingle  
Door will knock  
Open the latch  
  
Something's coming  
I don't know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
Around the corner  
A-whistlin' down the river  
Come on deliver  
To me  
To me  
  
Could be  
Who knows?  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannon-ballin' down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows?  
  
It's only just out of reach  
Down a block, on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling there's a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
To me  
  
Tonight, Tonight  
Won't be just any night  
Tonight there will be no morning star.  
  
Tonight.

Soon oh soon the light  
Pass within and soothe the endless night  
And wait here for you  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the time  
All we move to gain will reach and calm  
Our heart is open  
Our reason to be here  
  
Long ago, set into rhyme  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here

Faster moment spent spread tales of change within the sound  
Counting form through rhythm electric freedom  
Moves to counter-balance stars expound our conscience  
All to know and see  
The look in your eyes  
  
Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene  
New encounters spark a true fruition  
Guiding lines we touch them  
Our bodies balance out the waves  
As we accelerate our days  
To the look in your eyes  
  
From the moment I reached out to hold  
I felt a sound  
And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds  
And to know that tempo will continue lost in trance of dances  
As rhythm takes another turn  
As is my want I only reach  
To look in your eyes  
  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha  
Cha Cha Cha Cha Cha

In this world the gods have lost their way  
  
Can't keep this picture from out of my mind  
This fear hand in hand crossing innocence, time  
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap  
The youngest offenders will witness confusion  
  
They drive him so fast not a care in the end  
Escaping collision every twist every bend  
When you're young invincible nothing to lose  
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle  
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light  
Who's lost in the dark will crash in the night  
  
These lessons we're living the lies of the day  
Expect them to honor and never disobey  
Yet greed is controlling the elders display  
No wonder the younger look at them in shame  
  
The spirit of survival  
Who's teaching the hatred  
The spirit of survival  
Or the class of your school  
The spirit of survival  
The color of your money  
We're standing in a circle  
We don't understand at all  
  
They don't understand at all  
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place  
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place  
  
The younger the older the wiser become  
Recover misfortune this true life as one  
Our genius is shining the past has all gone  
What's left is the clearest perception of one  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the power  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the soul  
The spirit of survival  
To magnify the love  
We're standing in a circle  
We don't understand at all  
We don't understand at all  
In this world

You can hear the siren screaming  
Take me to the promised land  
See the intervention  
Take you higher and higher  
  
See we are the giving world  
We are responsible  
We're not about to break  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just a state of play  
It's just a state of play  
  
This is the revolution coming  
With the giving world  
No need to wait for your  
Appointment is made  
  
No need to ask for help, it's in  
The love we breathe  
Dancing in the new design  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Secret needing from this love I'm feeding  
High time flying monumental  
Reaching to God love  
Secret needing all i really  
  
Want to know right now  
The state of play  
Are you looking at it  
Is it looking at you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No point in kidding let the  
Children split the atom  
A firm believer this appointment with love  
  
All those who look for glory  
They see the flags are flying  
They hear the siren screaming  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Secret needing from this love I'm feeding  
High time flying  
All I really want to know  
Right now, right now  
  
(I want to be inside your heart)  
I want to know right now is  
This the state of play  
Are you looking at it

PURANAS: The Ancient probes still further into the past beyound the point of  
remembering. Here Steve's guitar is pivotal in sharpening reflection on the  
beauties and treasures of lots civilisations, Indian, Chinese, Central  
American, Atlantean. These and other people left an immense treasure of  
knowledge.  
As one with the knowledge and magic of the source  
Atuned to the majesty of music  
They marched as one with earth  
Sol, Dhoop  
Sun  
Ilios  
Naytheet  
Ah Kin  
Saule  
Tonatiuh  
Qurax  
Gunes, Grian  
Surje  
Ir  
Samse  
So the flowering creativity of life wove its  
Web face to face with the shallow  
And their gods sought out and conquered, Ah Kin  
Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn  
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white  
Does a shadow come between us in the winter  
Is the movement really light  
And I heard a million voices singing  
Acting to the story that they had heard about  
Does on child know the secret and can say it  
Or does it all come out along without you  
along without you  
along without you  
Where does reaon stop and killing just take over  
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead  
Are there many more in comfort understanding  
Is the movement in the head  
And I heard a million voices singing  
Acting to the story that they had heard about  
Does one child know the secret and can say it  
Or does it all come out along without you  
along without you  
along without you

Feel the calling of a miracle  
In the presence of the word  
Now we hold the right to rearrange  
How the stories can be heard  
  
In the beginning is the future  
And the future is at hand  
I'll be calling voices of Africa  
Be the rhythm to the plan  
  
From the Congo to Lenasia  
Be the writing on the wall  
I'll be calling the colors of India  
See the Asian life explode  
  
[Chorus]  
Head into the headlight  
Don't turn from the rain  
There's a fire raging somewhere near  
like a longtime friend who's  
Seen it darker than ebony  
Take off on the turnpike  
(Asking for the first call)  
Give me more of the same  
(Asking for a song)  
There's a fire burning in my heart again  
  
I'll be calling the dragons of China  
See the dancers of the Nile  
See the wings of change are on display  
This revelation mine  
  
Feel the calling of the miracle  
In the presence of the word  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel the calling of a miracle  
The revelation mine

La la, la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la, la la la.  
  
Stand and fight we do consider  
Reminded of an inner pact between us  
That's seen as we go  
And ride there  
In motion  
To fields in debts of honor defending  
  
Stand the marchers soaring talons  
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom  
Fighting we know,  
Destroy oppression  
The point to reaction  
As leaders look to you attacking  
  
Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor  
Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow  
Casting giant shadows off vast  
Penetrating force  
To alter via the war that seen  
As frictions spans the spirits' wrath ascending to redeem  
  
Wars that shout in screams of anguish  
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver  
Surely we know.  
In glory we rise to offer,  
Create our freedom, a word, we utter a word.  
  
Words cause our banner, victorious our day  
Will silence be promised as violence display  
The curse increased we fight the pow'are and live by it by day  
Our Gods awake in thunderous roars and guide  
The leader's hands in paths of glory to the cause  
  
Listen should we fight forever  
Knowing as we do know  
Fear destroys?  
Listen should we leave our children?  
Listen our lives stare in silence  
Help us now  
  
Listen your friends have been broken  
They tell us of your poison  
Now we know  
Kill them give them as they give us  
Slay them burn their children's laughter  
On to Hell  
  
The fist will run  
Grasp metal to gun  
The spirit sings in crashing tones we gain the battle drum  
Our cries will shrill the air will moan and crash into the dawn  
The pen won't stay the demon's wings, the hour approaches  
Pounding out the Devil's sermon  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Pass within and soothe this endless night  
And wait here for you  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the time  
All we move to gain will reach and calm  
Our heart is open  
Our reason to be here  
  
Long ago, set into rhyme  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here

Judging by the voice  
He was free to himself so real  
We slaved ourselves to sacrifice  
More than that we do not know  
Then you hear him on the radio  
He would play the sacred themes  
That my children sang to me  
  
Amazing as it seems  
It was the answer to my dream  
His heart that touches me  
More than that I do not not know  
Then I hear him on the radio  
Remembering his every word  
  
That my children sing to me  
We have seen the world, this ecstasy  
Now my children sing to me  
This loving place, beyond belief  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
To keep the message alive  
  
Spirit up moving, spirit up  
Rhythm of sunfire  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
Listening for his words  
He would speak in ancient verse  
So we mesmerize a way to go  
Reaching out the universe  
Reaching out the universal  
Not afraid to learn new words  
  
That our children sing to us  
We have seen the world, this ecstasy  
So his children bring to us  
This inner peace, beyond belief  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
To keep the message alive  
  
Spirit up moving, spirit up  
Rhythm of sunfire  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
One voice  
One world  
One touch  
One life, truly, truly say it  
One world, one voice  
One touch, truly, truly say it  
Some people realize  
Some people see it  
From the beginning  
One world, one touch  
One voice, one life  
One touch, one voice, one world, one life

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,  
Chased amid fusions of wonder  
In moments hardly seen forgotten,  
Coloured in pastures of chance  
Dancing leaves cast spells of  
Challenge,  
Amused but real in thought,  
We fled from the sea whole.  
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching  
Earth  
Revelaing corridors of time, provoking memories,  
Disjointed but with purpose,  
Craving penetrations offer links with the self-instructors sharp  
And tender love  
As we took to the air, a picture of distance.  
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused  
Expression,  
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing  
Late into corners,  
And we danced from the ocean.  
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many  
Won't to follow,  
Only tunes of a different age.  
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life  
Everlasting.  
  
Talk to the sunlight caller  
Soft summer mover distance mine  
  
Called out a tune but I never saw the face  
Heard but not replaced  
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place  
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day  
Lost in lights array  
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play  
  
What happened to this song we once knew so well?  
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell  
I must have waited all my life for this  
Moment moment  
  
The future poised with the splendour just begun  
The light we were as one  
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun  
  
And for a moment when our world had filled the skies  
Magic turned our eyes  
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device  
  
What happened to wonders we once knew so well?  
Did we forget what happened? surely we can tell  
We must have waited all our lives for this  
Moment moment moment  
  
Starlight, movement, reasons  
Release forward  
Tallest rainbow  
Sun shower seasons  
Life flower reasons  
  
They move fast, they tell me,  
But I just can't believe that I can feel it  
There's someone to tell you,  
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you  
  
Getting over overhanging trees  
Let them rape the forest  
Thoughts would send our fusion  
Clearly to be home  
  
Getting over wars we do not mean  
Or so it seems so clearly  
Sheltered with our passion  
Clearly to be home  
  
They move fast, they tell me,  
But I just can't believe they really mean to  
  
There's someone, to tell you,  
And I just can't believe our song will leave you  
  
Skyline teacher  
Warland seeker  
Send out poison  
Cast iron leader  
  
And through the rhythm of moving slowly  
Sent through the rhythm work out the story  
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.  
  
Young christians see if from the beginning  
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.  
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.  
  
They move fast, they tell me,  
But I just can't believe they really mean to.  
  
There's someone, to tell you  
A course towards a universal season.  
  
Getting over overhanging trees  
Let them rape the forest  
They might stand and leave them  
Clearly to be home  
  
Getting over wars we do not mean  
We charm the movement suffers  
Call out all our memories  
Clearly to be home  
  
We've moved fast  
We need love  
A part we offer is our only freedom  
  
What happened to this song we once knew so well  
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell  
We must have waited all our lives for this  
Moment moment  
  
Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only  
Through him we know  
Send flowered rainbows  
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to  
Follow and show all we feel for and know of  
Cast round  
You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and  
Breath and hope and chase and love  
For you and you and you.

No need to wonder  
Do you belong?  
No need to worry  
You can be strong  
  
Don't disbelieve it  
Let your fears go  
There must be more to this life  
And we all know  
  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Looking for  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
The past can haunt your future so  
Shadows are falling look out below  
  
Voices are calling echoes unknown  
There must be more to this life than we all know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
  
Over and under and down we go  
(Down we go)  
Caught at the crossroads  
Which way to go?  
(Path unknown)  
Choosing the right path?  
Only you know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
You hold the key  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Set yourself free  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
It's all up to you

Realising a form out of stone.  
Set hands moving.  
Roan shaped his heart  
Through his working hands.  
Work to mold his passion into clay, like the sun.  
  
In his room, his lady  
She would dance and sing so completely.  
So be still he now cries  
I have time, oh let clay transform thee so.  
  
In the deep cold of night  
Winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!"  
For his lady, deep her illness.  
Time has caught her  
And will for all reasons take her.  
  
In the still light of dawn, she dies.  
Helpless hands soul revealing.  
  
Like leaves we touch we learn.  
We once knew the story.  
As winter calls he will starve.  
All but to see the stone be life  
  
Now Roan, no more tears.  
Set to work his strength.  
So transformed him  
Realising a form out of stone. His work  
So absorbed him.  
Could she hear him?  
Could she see him?  
All aglow was his room dazed in this light.  
He would touch her  
He would hold her.  
Laughing as they danced.  
Highest colors touching others.  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me.  
  
Like leaves we touched we danced.  
We once knew the story.  
As autumn called and we both  
Remembered all those many years ago.  
I'm sure we know.  
  
Was the sign with a touch  
As I kiss your fingers.  
We walk hands in the sun.  
Memories when we're young.  
Love lingers so.  
  
Was it sun through the haze  
That made all your looks  
As warm as moonlight?  
As a pearl deep in your eyes,  
Tears have flown away,  
All the same light.  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet how we'll look  
As we smile time will leave me clearly.  
  
Like leaves we touch, we see.  
We will know the story.  
As autumn calls we'll both remember  
All those many years ago.

Don't you know it's my way out  
To be on my own  
When I feel like crying out I do it best alone  
Can you give me love and  
Protection to shield my heart  
All the fear I feel from doubt  
Is tearing me apart  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to love, I want to give  
I want to find another way to live  
Another shout, another cry  
And the walls come tumbling down  
  
Don't you know there's now way out  
Your pain's your own  
And the more we scream and shout  
The more we feel alone  
I can feel my anger rising  
Am I to blame?  
And I'm not gonna keep it inside me  
Do you feel the same?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm calling you

Answers never clear again  
This turning of the page  
This turning look away  
  
There I took a left turn  
Before I came of age  
I agreed to let it out  
I agreed to let it go  
I agreed to turn around  
I agreed to turn my face away  
  
Danger is the most important  
Fear you'll ever know  
The transporting of refugees  
The silent night is cold  
  
And all the time  
We looked around  
As we were never told  
  
But we agreed to let it out  
We agreed to let it go  
We agreed to turn our backs  
We agreed to turn our face away, away  
  
Thousands to the million  
Sisters, grandmothers and more  
It's not the feast we throw away  
It's the way we close the door  
  
Their silence deafens every sound  
We try just to ignore  
To waste their future freedom  
We'll regret forever more  
  
I believe in  
I believe in  
These are the days that we will talk about  
I believe in  
I believe in  
One understanding what is real  
  
If we are one  
Then we are refugees  
We are the prisoners of our own design  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song  
Perpetuate this song of love  
  
Now we build the bridges  
That we walk upon together  
At the last count many lonely souls  
The sadness always kills  
  
Each breaking point is waiting  
For the promise to fulfill  
  
When we agree to turn the page  
When we agree to help them free  
When we agree to let it out  
When we agree to let it shine  
When we agree to let it run  
When we agree to let it change our lives  
  
I believe in, our lives  
I believe in, our lives  
These are the days we will talk about  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
Song of love  
  
Yeah, yeah, perpetuate this song of love  
  
Seeing through the eyes of child  
Seeing through the eyes of child

Where will you be when you're not here  
How many lives in this earth time  
You are my soul and this you are  
Two souls intertwined that's what we are  
  
We can we walk hand in hand  
All the life  
Be the one everything to me  
You I am dreaming  
We have lived and known before I feel it  
  
Where will you lie  
  
When will I know  
When you are gone  
Where I be and I will miss you  
We are this love in this life  
Two souls intertwined like once before  
See this meeting, hand in hand  
Every life  
Be the one everything to me  
You are my feeling  
  
No need to fear this love of life  
We are the truth of every earth life  
No need to fear this life at all  
We are the sun and everlasting life  
Where will you be hearing this song  
How many lives in this earth time  
You are my soul and this you are  
You are my soul and this you are  
  
Where will you be

I believed that one day love would cast a line  
I believed there was something more for me to find  
Hoping today  
Hoping tomorrow  
Taking it all in stride  
I believed  
I could be chasing my mind  
  
There you were  
Like a dream to me  
Wonderlove  
Could this really be  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
I believe if only we could take the time  
Eventually we would learn each other's life  
Open your heart  
Give it a moment  
Leaving the cares behind  
Happily  
We could be two of a kind  
  
There you were  
Like a dream to me  
Wonderlove  
We were meant to be  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
It was the very next day that I came alive  
The door flung open  
There was a vision  
Couldn't believe my eyes  
Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it  
Everyone believing here at last receiving  
Wonderlove  
It's a place we all belong  
Wonderlove  
  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're my world  
  
I believe I could walk a thousand miles  
Just to see the vision of your simple smile  
Everyday  
Wanting to follow  
Forever by your side  
Faithfully  
You are my destiny  
  
There you were  
Wonderlove  
We were meant to be  
Wonderlove  
It's the world where we belong  
Wonderlove  
Together we will faithfully  
Wonderlove  
Can I make you see  
You're the world to me  
  
Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to  
If you're looking for the wisdom of the world  
All you've got to do is let it coming through  
Be forever  
  
Just imagine  
Wonderlove

I awoke this morning  
Love laid me down by a river.  
Drifting I turned on upstream  
Bound for my forgiver.  
In the giving of my eyes to see your face.  
Sound did silence me  
Leaving no trace.  
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories.  
Beg to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
He spoke of lands not far  
Or lands they were in his mind.  
Of fusion captured high  
Where reason captured his time.  
In no time at all he took me to the gate.  
In haste I quickly checked the time.  
If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories.  
Had to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
Hearing  
Hearing  
Hearing your wonderous stories.  
Hearing your wonderous stories.  
It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.  
Imagine everything  
You're close  
And were you there to stand  
So cautiously at first and then so high.  
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky.  
I bid it to return  
To hear your wonderous stories.  
Return to hear your wonderous stories.  
  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,  
Hearing,

Why is there you when there are few people around making me feel good?  
Why is there me when air is free, some I can see better than I should?  
There's only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy.  
  
I think of you ev'ry way, yesterday and today.  
I think of things that we do, all the way, ev'ry day.  
  
Stand in the sea, sing songs for me, sing happily, making me feel good.  
Watching your eyes, feeling your sighs, saying goodbyes better than I could.  
There's only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy.  
  
I think of you every way, yesterday and today.  
I think of nothing but you, things we do, things we do.
