Bet you never thought  
That time would go so fast  
Bet you never thought  
A memory would last  
Is it wrapped up in boxes  
With your fashion crazies  
Packed all away with life's scars and grazes  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you,  
Still remember you  
In my life  
Hey baby blue  
Where you running now,  
Where you running now  
In your own life  
  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
  
Everytime I saw your face  
There was magic in the air  
I see a sunny San Fransisco morning  
Baby you meet me there  
Sometimes I'm left wondering  
Sometimes it makes me so blue  
Let me take you down to Mexico  
'cause I'm still in love with you  
  
Every time I get to thinking,  
Thinking of you  
Under a sweet Corella  
Does it burn you too  
And if sometimes I wonder when,  
When sleep don't come at night  
I still move and I groove  
And I jump and shout  
Oh God I'm still in for the fight  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you  
Don't leave the world behind  
Leave the world,  
Leave the world behind  
  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
Going round  
And round and round  
In my little world  
  
Hey baby blue  
I still remember you,  
Still remember you  
In my life  
Hey baby blue  
Where you running now,  
Where you running now  
In your own life

I'm every man here in disguise  
Lie cheat and give you a spoonful of lies  
I'm a high toned mother with an axe to grind  
Come a little closer honey, see what you find  
Your worst nightmares all rolled in one  
I'll find you sure as the rising sun  
Don't make a noise it's understood  
'Cause this ain't no story like red riding hood  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man oh yeah  
I'm your back door man, come on babe  
And I'll take you where I can  
Systematically I choose at will  
But with you there's an obscene thrill  
It's funny now how you can't say no  
It's the smell of fear that you love so  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man, oh yeah,  
I'm your back door man baby, Just take it where you can  
This first kiss has a touch of ice  
Now how's that feel, it ain't so nice  
Blackhearted mamma I've something new  
Oh Lord look what I've turned into  
  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man

Oh Belladonna never knew the pain  
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe it'll drive you insane  
The open letter just carelessly placed  
And you move in silence, the tea so delicately laced  
  
Out of reach, out of touch  
How you've learned to hate so much  
  
Came from passion, and you gave it a name  
The fingers are poisoned like needles in the drivin' rain  
So smile discreetly as you watch with such grace  
Now I must slip away, but can you forget my face

He walked into the sunset  
He walked out of the dawn  
He rode that Palomino  
It was a one man storm  
  
Oh is this the party  
Ah I just got started  
  
He disappeared fell down the cracks  
He walked out never came back  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Falling down the stairs  
Falling out of cars  
Lying in the gutter  
Just looking at the stars  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you?  
  
Oh is this the party  
Ahh I just got started  
  
It was the biggest circus in town  
They came from far and wide  
Consuela and her sisters now  
Couldn't hold the tide  
  
She was a girl with a diamond smile  
Lost herself on the golden mile  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Falling down the stairs  
Falling out of cars  
Lying in the gutter  
Just looking at the stars  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you  
Oh black and blue  
We're stuck together  
With just a little glue now  
  
He was a man sad and over  
Caught a bus back to California  
Oh black and blue  
Look what loves done to you  
Who's been beating up on you  
Out of this cuckoos nest  
I guess you flew  
Where are you tonight  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you  
Turn out the light  
My baby's in flight

Captain midnight and Captain cruise  
Out on the ocean  
Like a storm of bad news  
It took three monkeys in a plastic mac  
To fit inside a paper sack  
And they're cooking up an alibi  
Cooking up some steam  
Out in the madness  
Somewhere in Orleans  
They had a plan,  
They had a plot  
Beggars and blues was all they got  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops  
Baby's wishing on a wishing well  
She's moving up  
And ringing her bell  
Can't fly to heaven  
On a persian rug  
So put some coins in the old sailor mug  
They travelled up together  
From the coast  
East of Aldgate  
Silently like ghosts  
They had a scam,  
They had a scheme  
For drunks and bums counting beans  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops  
Solo  
Black cold coffee  
Black Irish soup  
Cold on a silver spoon  
She's dancing through hoops  
  

Goin' down to George's where you just have been  
To see if you've been boogie-ing, ah you know what I mean  
My left leg's dragging my right leg's limp  
My heads so wavy and I can't feel it  
I gotta see you baby, you'll be alright  
I want to boogie baby, boogie tonight  
  
Well old George is boogie-ing he's been a boogie-ing with you  
Ah I want to boogie with you baby  
I want to boogie all night long  
I want to move with you I want to move  
I want to shake, want to boogie too  
I want to boogie...boogie

Wonder if you belong, think you've got it down  
Does it still feel the same, now that he's not around  
Born to lose, Born to lose, make your mind up no fooling round  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.  
Wonder how it all began, as if that mattered anyway  
There's someone else you're always wanting, every single day  
Born to lose, born to lose, make your mind up no fooling round,  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.  
  
Born to lose, Born to lose, make your mind up no fooling 'round  
Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one.

Some folks built like this  
Some folks built like that  
Way you move you ain't talkin' back  
I'm built for comfort, ain't built for speed  
Got everything all you good girls need  
Don't need no diamond, don't need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
I'm built for comfort, ain't built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need  
I don't need no diamond, don't need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need  

She looked for truth  
Inside a bottle of rain  
Posted an ad  
Then changed her name  
On a roller coaster  
That couldn't be caught  
She left one note  
At the hotel last resort  
  
And it said  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown no  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown,  
Don't let me drown  
  
Well the precious friends  
And their special needs  
They're like a cancer  
That just feeds and feeds  
Saddle up and lets get out of here  
You don't need one more  
To shed one more tear  
You couldn't make a stand now  
You couldn't get it right  
I only got this message now  
Late, late last night  
  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown no  
Don't let me drown  
  
Call me  
  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown  
Call me  
Don't let me down  
Walk me on the water  
Don't let me drown,  
  
Don't let me drown

Gotta give you love oh cherry  
Dance for me there's only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies  
Wish I wasn't just passing through  
Tell me your secrets, tell me no one way lyin' now  
We are golden , We are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone  
On the tabletops she's dancing, sit and smile into your beer  
Turn around no cherry for me, let me know you know I'm here  
We are golden, We are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night, making it feel all right  
Come on cherry let's make it together  
Out of the neon and into my life  
We can't play this game forever, now...  
  
Gotta give my love oh Cherry, dance for me there' s only you  
Play the barrooms just for pennies, wish I wasn't just passing through  
Tell me your secrets, tell me no one way lyin' now  
We are golden, we are golden  
And I'm out here on the road, I feel just like a rolling stone  
Into the highways of the night I roll alone

(instrumental)  
I'm not looking to change your mind,  
There's a place, call it home  
It's no secret, the world unwinds  
Maybe now you're not alone  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Straitlaced to the bone  
(this story will not play? )  
You take the wheel and play the chance  
Suddenly the room's divided  
As in the way of true romance  
It's always undecided  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Shipwrecked to the bay  
(this story will not play? )  
Every time he climbs back up  
Smacked down with a dime  
It's evens or odds now  
Just ran out of time  
(instrumental)  
Love's a struggle, there's a fight  
No bone of contention  
So unhappy, well here's the bite  
That's the mother of invention  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
Strange place to play  
It's just another day  
In the life of cowboy joe  
(fade out)  

The enemy is at the door  
The enemy within.  
Dressed up in the strangest clothes,  
Smells of drinking Bombay gin.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
My father was a Russian Jew  
My Irish mother crazy.  
I see summer, winter, fall.  
When grown men  
Cry like babies.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
Solo  
  
Wish I never had to leave.  
Wish I'd never known.  
Wish I could stay here forever.  
Watch my garden grow.  
  
There's a deadman walking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman walking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
  
There's a deadman talking  
And his shadow's growing long.  
There's a deadman talking  
Taking it in  
Before his time is gone.  
There's a deadman walking  
Deadman walking  
Deadman talking  
  

Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh the mess I'm in  
She walked up to me  
And really stole my heart  
And then she started  
To take my body apart  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, I'm goin' fast  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh, I'm goin' fast  
It's only just a moment,  
She's turnin' paranoid  
That's not a situation for a nervous boy  
  
Doctor doctor, please  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
Doctor doctor, please,  
Oh, the mess I'm in  
But you look so angry  
As I crawled across your floor  
She's got the strain,  
And I can't take any more  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you  
  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
Far away from you  
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run  
So far away from you

On the wires I can hear you comin'  
With a rush and a strummin'  
This electric phase ain't no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin'  
  
Just a hot touch that keeps lingerin'  
You said loving's easy only if you please  
All I need is communication  
Not a line on your reputation  
  
I don't want a handshake  
There ain't no big mistake  
  
There's no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows I'm crazy, no chance of maybe  
I'd like to know you better  
But I"m goin' down so fast  
  
Help me now to feel it, I just can't conceal it  
Sweet time I've got to show you how it's really got to be  
Just let me be alone, left with your dialing tone  
  
There's no illusion in this wild confusion  
Who knows I'm crazy, no chance of maybe  
I'd like to know you better  
But I"m goin' down so fast  
  
On the wires I can hear you comin'  
With a rush and a strummin'  
This electric phase ain't no teenage craze  
In your house a phone is ringin'

Heaven knows that you're an evil child,  
Drive me crazy, drive me wild  
Get home from work I don't feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Moving in, moving out, baby you move my mind about  
Don't give me no reason don't give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school you've broken all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is a bit of your love  
All I want is a part of you  
  
Heaven knows that you're an evil child  
Drive me crazy, you drive me wild  
Get home form work I don't feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Movin' in , movin' out, baby you move my mind about  
Don't give me no reason, don't give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school you've brokin' all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is to hold you tight  
All I need is a part of you

[disputed lyrics in brackets]  
Have you ever had the time to see, me and you could change to be  
Take a dream away with you live it now and you will see  
Found myself on an open road [got no hand] to show the way  
Upped and started walking on to a land seemed so far away  
After so long felt I was damned then I reached some gates and held a hand  
But came to the point of sing and say, laughing people led me in to stay  
Their happiness [held me, made me ] strong. I felt this is where I belong  
I don't want another day just wanna laugh live sing and say  
It's so strange I feel this way, it's so real, it's happening today,  
Stop still something burns my body falls I begin to turn  
(instrumental verse)  
Flying drifting falling down, I found myself beneath the ground,  
In a place that's strange to me, the earth is black and there's not a tree  
Well it's so dark there's not a sound just the feeling of wanting to be found  
I must make haste to be gone, in this place I do not belong  
I thought I tried to move a foot, I just remained where I stood,  
And in the distance I heard aloud the shrill of blank deathly sound  
I tried, I tried, I tried to run, but every move I was where I begun,  
It's too late, shadows over me blind my eyes I cannot see  
All my strength all my love, someone help me please above,  
Death will surely take me down, I'll be doomed to live beneath the ground  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one,] see your tomb, see you run, you fool, you fool
your life has just begun  
I'm here to taunt and torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to  
Black it out and drag you down, all kinds of evil wear a crown  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free I can be just anyone that I want to be  
Leave me now get out of my way  
(instrumental)  
[see your two, see your one] see your tomb, see your rock, who are you fooling
life's just begun  
Here to taunt, to torment you  
I can make you do what I want you to,  
Knock it out drag you down, all kinds of people were aware of it now?  
Chase you rape you feast upon your hurt, lay your body in the dirt  
If I were a fool I'd believe it's true but I have no fear of what you can do  
See I'm free so leave me alone I wanna go my way and be alone  
Get out of my sight, get out of my way  
(more instrumental)  
I'm not through, and I'm on the run, you're the fool my life's not been done  
I'll taunt you and I'll torment you  
(instrumental)  
Have this way with a dream never leave me so it seems  
Life by night, life by day, the tale they tell will always stay  
Walk the earth, walk the sky, don't let all this time go by  
Hang on fast, don't let go or someone else will never know  
Ride a road along with me chase a dream we all can see  
Don't let bad, just see good it's all that just what you should  
No truth will ever come along shine so bright in your eyes  
No wide wonder will do that for you, just lock it fast, do what you got to do  
Shout it loud, shout out loud just live how you want to be  
Show yourself show yourself, live how you got to be  
  
(more instrumental, followed by a verse from rudyard kipling's "gunga din"
taped backwards: "though I've belted you and flayed you, by the living God
that made you, you're a bette  
Than I am, gunga din."  
And then, in ultra super-slo-mo, "yes we know it's all be done before before
before before before before")  

If you want me to do everything girl just for you  
Change your mind telling me lies  
Come and see you in the morning come and see you in the morning  
Time after time, told me lies these are things girl which I despise  
If I go wrong in your eyes, leave you girl in the morning  
Leave you girl in the morning  
  
As time goes by wish you had never treated me so bad  
You know you're only going to want me back  
Far away in the morning far away in the morning  
If you want me to do everything girl just for you  
Change your mind telling me lies  
Come and see you in the morning, come and see you in the morning  
Follow you home in the morning, follow you home in the morning

(intro)  
Fool's gold, sparkling like the midnight sun  
Fool's gold, touch the ivory handles on my gun  
(sold out to me? ), charlatans and thieves  
(so wrong not to see? ), jokers and the priests?  
Fool's gold, stranded on a (point gloss? ) sea  
Fool's gold, nothing here and nothing to see  
(sold out to me? ), the weasels and the feared  
(and it's so wrong not to see? ), the ghosts of the disappeared  
All gone away...  
(instrumental)  
Sometimes, when I'm touched by love, by hate, or by the grace of god  
Sometimes, in the dark when hope is fading,  
Or no longer flies,  
I won't sympathize  
Spend my time getting high  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
Tired of living on my own, someone came and take me home  
Sometimes, this jungle life is boring, pawing,  
Ready for a feast, someone kill the beast  
Outside, streets are teeming, breathing heavy,  
Ready to explode, my brother's heavy load,  
What you reap is what you sow  
Someone came to rescue me  
Lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own  
Someone came to take me home  
(instrumental)  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
When I'm out here on my own, someone came and took me home  
Someone came to rescue me, lit up like a christmas tree  
Stranded here on my own, someone came and took me home  
(instrumental fade out)  

Take away your daughters, don't stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys, I know where I'm supposed to be  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only your cosmic father, banished from above  
I was having pipe dreams about congregation scenes  
When I'm asked the minister beamed in on me  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only your cosmic father, banished from above  
Take away your daughters, don't stand in front of me  
Take away your young boys, I don't know how I'm supposed to be  
Don't ask me to tell you about galactic love  
I'm only a cosmic father, banished from above  

Give Her The Gun  
Downtown, drive by, a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engine, she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun, boy you'd better hold on tight  
I don't know why, she brings me on  
I don't know why, ooh but she brings me on  
She's a right runner, real mean mother too  
I can't wait to see her break in front of you  
Making a movie star upon the screen  
If daddy's looking, you come on like a queen  
I don't know why, she brings me on  
I don't know why, but she brings me on  
  
Downtown drive by, a drink card in her hand  
All night hustler parking by the stand  
Full blown engines she comes on like a fight  
Give her the gun, boy you better hold on tight

Early in the morning when the sun come up  
I sat there drinking from your loving cup  
Tell me pretty babe what can I do  
Want to drink from your loving cup  
On the Sunday morn you're acting funny  
You should be working earning money  
Slow down baby you move too fast  
Want to come and catch ya laying in the grass  
-  
(instrumental)  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
Hey babe ya, your loving cup yeah  
Tell me pretty babe what can I do  
Want to drink from your loving cup  
(instrumental)  
Just want to drink from your loving cup yeah  
Just want to drink from your loving cup yeah

(instrumental intro)  
Oh my darling will you come to me  
Shaking now just like a willow tree  
So tell me what's the story  
This track we'll ride to glory  
Coming home  
Pretty karla and her russian clothes  
Clapboard house and a different nose  
Love keeps a candle burning  
These steel wheels are turning  
Back for home  
Come in out of the rain  
Come out of the night  
Out on the midnight train  
Midnight train  
Come out of the light  
Come out of the rain  
Riding the midnight train  
Midnight train  
Moscow lights, well they dim and glow  
The taste is sweeter than it's driven snow  
So tell me what's the story  
This track to ride to glory  
Coming home  
Come out of the rain, come out of the lights,  
Out on the midnight train, midnight train  
Come out of the lights, come out in the rain,  
Riding the midnight train, midnight train  
(instrumental)  
Oh my darling will you come to me  
Shaking now just like a willow tree  
Come out of the lights, come out in the rain,  
Riding the midnight train, midnight train  
Out of the rain, live again, riding the midnight train, midnight train  
Come of the lights, into the rain, riding the midnight train, midnight train  
One little strange, come back again  
(instrumental fade out)  

(intro) walking tall, full of tedious charm,  
The smoothest (? ? ? ) in (? ? ? )  
The mission boys all cross their palms  
Don't you know who I am  
I guess you miss the lights? huh!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Little caesar is prince of the city  
? ? ?  
In this town there's no pity  
This man stands alone  
I guess you miss the lights - ha!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Sometimes when you're all alone  
And the blue turns to gray  
Better get down on those pinky knees,  
And you start to pray  
I guess you miss the lights - ha!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kiss-kissing your name  
(instrumental)  
A glimmering ? , a twilight star  
And so much love for show,  
A returning wave from the gallery bar  
And share the afterglow  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Ha!  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame, haha!  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
(fade out music and chorus)  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kiss-kissing your name  

[Chorus 1]  
Try to make some changes really on the line  
Given your religion, never ever time  
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor  
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more  
  
Head held up to ransom, by a quick hand and a gun  
Just your education, hard to understand  
Will the teenage legend make a mark on you  
Make a big time status, with a pen we'll stab it through  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Mother Mary could you ever really feel the same  
And would you try to understand a wild colonial boy  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
[Chorus 1]

Train arrive sixteen coaches long  
Train arrive sixteen coaches long  
Well that long black train drop my baby and gone  
Train train coming right round the bend  
Train train coming right round the bend  
Well it took my baby but it never will again  
Train train come on down this line  
Train train rolling on down the line  
Well it's bringing my baby 'cause she's mine oh mine  
Mine oh mine, mine oh mine  
Train train coming round this bend  
Train train coming right round the bend  
Well it took my baby but it never will again  
Never again no, no, no never again  

Love me tender, love me true  
Oooh baby what a song could do  
We were sharp like needles in the dark, no question mark  
My friend billy was one of a kind  
Growin' up and runnin' wild  
We could take a sunset and make it real  
We stood together on the edge of a knife  
(Fools) To be friends, brothers for life  
  
And we have seen the night run, it's a thousand miles away  
Yes we have seen the night run, it passed us by in just one day  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Used to say well it's me and you  
Oooh we could make dreams come true  
And we put some magic in this night, oh feels so right  
Came across your photograph  
Everything was just a laugh  
Where do you go when you reach the end  
Into the night we would explode  
With hand on my heart, rules of the road  
  
[Chorus 1 x2]  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Big city lights they fade then they go  
(Along with your sense of humor, no...)  
Some people give up and lose the fight  
We could prove it night after night after...  
  
[Chorus 2 x3]

Joey rides the subway  
Fast from east to west  
On the street he's number one  
Some say that he's the best  
Got something going on  
In a honkey tonk down town  
He is expected  
Word has got around  
  
The other-side of midnight  
Or in the combat zone  
Meeting no resistance  
Joe stands alone  
  
Night riders prowling  
Out into the night  
There's someone else out there  
And they're looking for a fight  
  
Between the rain soaked buildings  
A distant whistle blows  
Fate lies in waiting  
It's hand it never shows  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart beating like a drum  
Out in this wasteland  
And there's no place baby for us to run  
(In) Jungle land (baby)  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land. jungle land  
  
Under the railway arches  
Someone calls his name  
Streams out the words  
Come on boy this ain't no game  
  
One flash of bright cold stsel  
In a stranger's hand  
Kids dance away like shadows  
There's no one to command  
  
Joey's got his name  
Pairited on the wells  
On the side of buses  
Subways and tenement halls  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land

Well, I'm struttin' up and down  
Tryin' to get my face in town  
Wonderin' the hang where  
To turn each time around  
  
Look in your mirror just to see my face  
Two way time, baby, it's no disgrace  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
  
Ladies used to dancin' but I move for real  
Lookin' for reaction, something you can feel  
When ya dance,  
I move and they look me in the eye  
Two way time, baby, it's no lie  
  
[Repeat: x 3]  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
Oh my, how the times have changed

Guess it's just the same old story  
Fool I didn't have a chance  
She took me like a house that's burning  
Never gave a second glance  
Eat 'em up let 'em go and you never  
Let your feelings show  
She ain't here and you're asking why  
Life's a bitch and then you die  
Come on lover just let go  
  
Is there something I should know  
Was it just one of those nights  
Something you don't remember, yeah  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
Sitting at the bar drinking beer  
Happy hour's over and love's cost me dear  
The piano player sits at his stool  
He's playing "Feelings" ain't' life cruel  
Uptown downtown life's a river  
And I wish I could drown  
  
I could still hear those loving sighs  
A lesson learnt love's just a lie  
I know I made a big mistake  
With love there's no even break  
There's a price you have to pay  
I got the bill when I heard you say  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember  
  
Was it just one of those nights, baby  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something I don't remember  
  
(Was it) just one of those nights (baby)  
Something I don't remember  
Just one of those crazy nights  
Something you don't remember

Who's taking time out, we'll take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school and stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me rock me  
Come on back now do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
  
Come on the street now on every corner  
Breaking out and we're doing what we want to  
Just like a jewel shines in the night  
She burns so hot out under the street light  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We are here and there's no end  
We keep on coming again  
We are here and there's no end  
We just keep coming again  
  
Who's taking time out, we take a shine out  
We're the boys we got nothing to lose  
I've had enough now of school  
  
And stuff now  
If you ain't with us then it's just bad news  
  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Come on back now, do it again  
Only you can rock me, rock me  
Kicking out just like a hurricane  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again  
  
We can't wait from day to day  
'Cause we've got something to say  
We are here and there's no end  
We'll keep on coming again

[Chorus]  
Lady loves to hang on  
Lady liked a real intellectual  
Sweet sister your still shaking  
And your tragedy is never ending  
Silver shoes you're wearing  
Every window that you've ever stared in  
Over my head, over my head  
  
Sidewalks of the city  
And every theater there you've ever played  
Your comic book impersonations  
Your wish for cinders embers to keep  
Over my head, so it' all  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Out in the street for just one more matinee  
Yes, your vaudeville carries on  
So put a smile in front your man can see  
Yes, your vaudeville carries on  
  
[Chorus]

I came out of the fifties  
Now that's when men were men  
I am like the red red rooster,  
Always couping hens  
I guess that I'm a rarity  
Some call a dying breed  
I am a macho bronco stallion  
Call me Mr Seed  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
  
When you're talking Elvis,  
Well I saw him yesterday  
He touched me on the shoulder  
Asked me if he could play  
I buttered up my ducktail,  
Put on my long black drape  
I polished up my Boneville  
To make those girlies gape  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
the outlaw man  
Solo  
Jimmy Dean was riding next to me and Steve McQueen  
And we're burning up the street now  
And we're looking pretty mean  
I'm not living in the past  
And I'm not history  
I'm here to set the records straight,  
Unlock this mystery  
  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rolling stone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
I'm one big bone  
I'm a rocker  
I'm a rocker  
Motorcycle man  
love don't fit in a can  
  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
  
I am one of lifes miracles  
I have my fate in my hands  
I see my colours before me  
I am the outlaw man  
I'm the outlaw man  
  

My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
now you are 16  
and your stuck in jail  
18 plus  
there's no sign of bail  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for  
a heart that aches  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
21 is easy,  
but I don't know why  
There's no difference  
this bird will fly  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
Solo  
And she mesmerizes,  
captivates  
A message for a  
heart that aches  
My sweet darling night  
How the city swings  
A little kiss of angels  
A little tune of things  
My thousand dollars  
ain't going nowhere  
And the revelations  
kiss, tell, and dare  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
I've got a perfect view  
of what I really want to do  
I've got a perfect view  
am I getting through to you?  
Perfect view  
I've got a perfect view

Heaven knows why I'm left here in this place  
With the sun up in my eyes  
Symbols of the morning comin' on  
With the love that's got too strong to hold  
If I'd been so much wiser then  
I would have known which path to choose  
Heaven help the lucky one  
Heaven help you  
  
Heard the news come on the radio  
About the loves and the flame  
I'd already heard before  
Baby, two years ago  
  
Say it's too hard to return  
Now it seemed just like a dream  
I saw and already seen it  
On my TV screen  
  
Now I could see all these conflicts goin' on  
Don't you think you could show some thanks  
I just might give you a standin' ovation  
When I'm here and gone

New feel of you running through my vein  
Little bit of everything  
You know that's what you said  
  
[Chorus]  
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love  
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love  
Cause always you indulge  
And parents try to get you out of these jams  
You got that envy cause they won't understand  
  
The social life you lead leaves nothin' to desire  
Don't wanna see you bleed  
But you came on like a liar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrecked myself to love you  
All you want is more  
One thing you're after  
You just try and score  
  
[Chorus]

(instrumental intro)  
Going to jamaica,  
Warm and coral waters flow  
There she goes  
Sun kissed her body, in this magic feel love grow,  
Love grows  
Feel like letting go  
Hey mr. Saturday night  
? ? right out the hole  
It stops in a minute,  
It's right down in it  
Hey, we're really back on a roll  
I don't know why, I don't know why  
Feel so good I could die, I could die  
Great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth, on a wish and a prayer  
With a head full of hammers, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna
rise again  
Dream time (lavinia? ? ),  
Even though the odds are stacked, she's coming back  
(moon monkeys barking? ) in a bitter chocolate glow,  
There she goes, feel like letting go...  
Hey, mr. cool jazz nights, let the fever go,  
It stops in a minute, I'm down in it  
Hey, play it long and slow  
I don't know why, I don't know why,  
Feels so good I could die, I could die,  
With a great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer  
With a head full of hammers, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna
rise again  
(instrumental)  
With a great escape, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer  
With a head full of hammers both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna
rise again  
I've been stricken, I'll be there, by the skin of my teeth on a wish and a
prayer, and I'm  
Not going down, both feet in the grave, I'm gonna stand I'm gonna rise again.  
Dream time (lavinia? ? )  
Feel like letting go.  
(end!)  

Seventeen a nature's queen, know what I mean  
Twenty one, a long one,  
And you can see the numbers run  
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep  
With the wings of God above you  
Before the spirits meet  
  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom  
  
Shadow Earth is closin' in above the lamps in your street  
Lucifer goes walkin' down free to meet  
Minutes pass so slowly by the, hands on your clock  
Heaven don't open when you knock  
  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom  
  
With all darkness closin' in  
Will the light reveal your soul  
One sweet kiss on your clay cold lips  
I'll know sleep you'll never know  
Where do we go, where do we go  
Where do we go from here  
  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom  
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

Was a fast tough woman loved to play the clown  
You won't do nothin' about it  
Break a good boy's resistance down  
Know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
She said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
Convinced me that she was worth it  
Never knew I was her kill  
And two 45's would do the trick and pay the bills  
  
know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now  
  
Holding out in my hotel room police they finally come  
Had her as the prosecution, and my prints upon the gun  
  
know she's got a pistol  
Laid it down on me  
And she said shoot, shoot, shoot it boy  
You gotta shoot it for me  
  
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here  
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now

This morning as I walked, I gazed out across my land  
Lying there all still lying there upon the sand  
A big silver bird had planted itself into the ground  
And being the kind of person who isn't very easily alarmed  
Decided to take a walk to see just what I could find  
Walked around the walls, tapping to find me a door  
Looking for a windows to see if I could find out more  
Big silver bird let me inside your plane  
Want to fly so high fly me high, away  
All of a sudden the door slid back and someone was there  
A strange kind of being spoke to me in my tongue  
"step inside, we'll take you away in our plane  
We'll fly you so high, you'll never have the chance to complain  
To leave this earth, never even (? ? ? ) ...  
Stepping inside I fixed myself into a seat  
Holding on, lord, I heard them engines start to beat  
Big silver bird let me inside your plane  
Want to fly so high, fly me high away  
(instrumental part)  

All the world knows  
Yet none too well  
To shun the heaven  
That lead men to this hell  
If all the stars  
Disappear and die  
And I'm looking at an empty sky  
Oh I'll be damned  
Back behind the sun  
This kind of love  
Can't be bought or won girl  
And when every second counts  
When the minutes  
Turn a night into a day  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
When the summer rain came  
Well it kissed our feet  
And a magic moon lay down on our street  
Love and death  
It's like war and peace  
One single outreach  
On this empty beach  
'Cause you're damned if you do  
And you're damned if you don't  
Want her to stay away hey  
Because the closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away  
Ooh  
Na na na na na na,  
Na na na na na na  
Slipping away,  
Slipping away  
These plastic bags and  
These crushed up cans  
This twisted wreck  
On some foreign land  
Better hold close  
What you hold so dear  
'Cause the vanishing point  
Is coming oh so near  
All this world knows  
Yet none too well  
To shun the heaven  
That lead men to this hell  
He closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away  
He closer you get  
The further you slip away  
'Cause the closer you get  
The further love slipped away,  
Slipped away

American beauty  
Came up and spoke  
She touched her toes  
And we shared a joke  
Taxi's, limos,  
Power boat glides  
Jet skies, mensa,  
Babes without a ride  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
There's no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me,  
Someone's gonna have to pay  
  
Moonshot, rockets  
Nineteen sixties cool  
Sonny Boy Williamson,  
Pope John Paul  
The Congo to Vietnam  
The Beatles to the Stones  
Is nobody left  
Who's gonna shake those bones?  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
There's no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me,  
Someone's gonna have to pay  
Pay all the time  
  
Solo  
  
All of the misfits  
All of the scars  
All of life's promises  
Bottled in jars  
There's a hum and a howl.  
Lovers on the run  
Tell me what's on offer  
From the government scum  
  
Solo  
  
Rats will get richer  
And the dirt beg for more  
Crumbs on the table  
For the world of the poor  
News of self worship  
Fresh from Hollywood  
The pygmies of poison,  
Don't know bad from good  
  
You know the revolutions gone now  
There's no revolution song  
Somewhere down the line  
You know on one of Gods good days  
Can you hear me,  
Someone's gonna have to pay  
Oh that's pay all the time  
Someones got to pay  
you ain't walkin'  
You ain't talkin'  
You got to pay  
while I'm looking over your shoulder  
You got to pay  
  

Lost myself in a distant starry storm  
Trying to find my way down  
Somebody shut child a door in my head  
Had to turn around  
But I gotta little time to set by  
Gotta let my feelings all shine  
You know that it will be all right  
I gotta get your love for just mine  
Found a starry storm it held me close,  
Tryin' to find my way home  
Took a distant walk in a starry mile  
Had to turn and smile  
But I gotta little time to let my  
Gotta let my feelings all fly  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your love for just mine  
Hold on fast gonna catch a shooting star  
Gotta find me a way  
Get from this starry storm today  
Never leave this place  
But I gotta little time to let fly  
Gotta let my feelings oh shine  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your loving just right  
Instrumental  
Found a starry storm held me close  
Take me back today  
All I want to do is fly away  
Really couldn't say  
But I gotta little time to set by  
Gotta let my feelings all shine  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your loving just right  
Lost myself by heaven's chance  
Trying to find a way down  
Took a distance walk in a starry mile  
Had to turn and smile  
But I gotta little time to let fly  
Gotta let my feelings oh shine  
You know that it will be oh right  
Gotta get your loving just fine  

Just down here said hello, tell me are you trying to get on

Want you to push me around

So you've seen the sunrise on the Nile  
Solved the mystery of the mona Lisa's smile  
You proclaim your innocence  
What you saying  
Makes no sense to me at all  
So you help the needy and the sick  
Heard confessions of a lunatic  
My eyes are growing dim  
Ghost shadows closing in  
Around me now  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone  
To make me happy  
So you've scattered roses at Versailles  
Wiped a teardrop from an old man's eye  
Seeing you in such distress  
I'm afraid I must confess  
That boys don't cry  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone  
To make me happy  
  
[Solo]  
  
And there ain't no sympathy at all  
Just a sea of angry faces  
Staring at me  
There ain't no sympathy at all  
I gotta find someone,  
Gotta find someone,  
Gotta find someone

One more time said the lady Jane  
Walk on in the fire  
Chinese whispers ringing now  
Step into the mire  
I've been strung out to dry  
Blowing in the gale  
My names been left hanging,  
Hanging on your nail  
All the misfits  
Are flying like a kite  
All of my friends  
Have come to see the fight  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
I can hear the Quireboys singing  
And it's falling on my ears  
I can hear the trumpets playing  
Running down the years  
Don't ask me how the world looks  
How it looks tonight  
I'm gonna be leaving babe  
Outta here and outta sight  
I've been laying down  
Coming off the rails  
I've been chasing shadows  
Playing Happy trails  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
Solo  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
This love has never gone away  
Whoa oh oh, the spark that is us  
I hold a moment every single day  
  

We Was going through A lifetime  
I had a banshee on my back  
We're down in corpus christie now  
Picking up the slack  
Now I was wondering where the wild boys  
Had started off and gone  
This memories jamming buttons  
Stuck on some old song  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
She was gone in twenty seconds  
Right before my eyes  
No more honey kisses  
No more long goodbyes  
And I feel like pink nevada  
Or cooler shade of blue  
Mother earth is closer now  
Walk me out in the morning dew  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
Looking for the  
Solo  
Sometimes I stop breathing  
Just to feel reborn  
And it's like rolling thunder  
Blowing through the corn  
Through my back pages  
I can see the change  
There's a storm a coming now  
Coming through the rain  
Solo  
and I'm out here drifitng  
A million miles alone  
Floating in a spaceship somewhere  
Falling like a stone,  
Falling like a stone  
Still looking for the wild one,  
Yeah yeah  
  

I'm the writer got a front page cover  
Hot gossip 'bout who's with their latest lover  
I write all chapters by the second scene  
I call the shots, don't need a Fleet Street team  
I am a writer and I'm the news  
You cross me you know you're gonna lose  
I'll do the story if you're dead or alive  
If seconds out or if you're gonna take a dive  
Slip out the news or a piece of scandal  
Don't toe the line, 'cause nothing's too hot to handle  
I am the writer and I'm the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
Yeah you're gonna lose  
  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
And where you are it's because of me  
'Cause overnight you know it don't come free  
I'll put you up there or I'll bring you down  
'Cause nothing moves without me in this town  
I am a writer and I am the news  
If you cross me you know you're gonna lose  
Boy you're gonna lose I said you're gonna lose  
I write the news I am the news  
Got to, got to lose  
Oh yeah you're gonna lose  
So don't step on my blue suede shoes...

White lines on the highway  
Rolling out into the night  
Got no bag to slow us down  
We're travelling light, travelling light tonight  
  
Feel the wheels roll away  
How many miles have i been gone  
Listen girl you never knew  
The road goes on all night long  
  
[Chorus:]  
This fire burns tonight  
The streets are alight  
Out on this town we are bursting  
This fire burns tonight  
The streets are alight  
(And) out on this town we are bursting  
  
Now me and my partners are moving  
We run on from town to town  
And this here road surface  
Is setting them up rolling them down  
There's girls out in the neon  
Singing blues every night  
And you that they'll never love you  
They're travelling light, travelling light  
  
[Chorus x3]

Kid's gettin' tired, hangin' around  
So cocksure, thinkin' aloud  
Can't get it in, can't get it out  
Sure ain't enough and there ain't no doubt  
Can't stop a train with just a smile  
Stop me at the start only for a while  
Hole in my pocket, hole in my arm  
All that's left when life's lost it's charm  
This could be for us just any other day  
Come on girl, we've really got to get away  
It's the only chance you'll ever have to change  
Stickin' in this city will drive you insane  
Kid's gettin' tired, hangin' around  
So cocksure, thinkin' aloud  
Can't get it in, can't get out  
Sure ain't enough and there ain't no doubt  
Can't win or lose when there's little left to choose  
Now 'til next year it'll always be the same  
The black back streets and people  
Who don't know your name  
Go with the wind, it'll only carry us away  

Timothy tries but he can't explain  
All of the things that shatter his brain  
Comes from the garden shouting and grinning  
Hey Timothy where do you come from  
Only befriended with Jerry the mouse  
Seems to know what Timmy?s talking about  
Comes from the garden shouting and grinning  
Hey Timothy where do you come from  
  
Does he come from the sky? Does he come from the land  
Does he come from the earth? Does he come from the sea? Timothy?  
Hey Timothy, where do you come from, where do you come from Timothy?

I really tried my hardest just to make you understand  
It feels like to a boy, when he don't feel like a man  
But you gave me so much money  
And you would not understand  
I realize I hurt you, so I stay just as I am  
  
[Chorus]  
But the whole world keeps on turnin'  
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'  
But the whole world keeps on turnin'  
I just roll along  
  
There's been too many mornings  
And one too many years  
Once went by the big ones who just can't take the pace  
We found out the hard way  
I hope you understand  
That my life is just my head  
And I had an overdose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to try, I used to try  
Used to cry, oh I used to cry  
  
[Chorus]

Well, I've stuck out in your street  
And I'm lookin' for some kind of halo  
When somebody says to me, boy  
She's too young to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I didn't make your time  
I never said you were mine  
Don't you think you show  
I guess I'll have to teach you how to roll  
Met you outside school  
when sure no one was lookin'  
And your teacher looks at me,  
all his envy growin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said, take it easy baby,  
you sure know what's showin'  
And I can't help myself  
without your friends all knowin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
You got a long, long way to go

I walked through this place, although it wasn't really there  
And when I reached the other side, thought I didn't really care  
I moved round a bit, and started seeing people  
And the people that I met, oh were all covered in treacle  
  
Everyone was laughing, everyone except for poor old me,  
So I tried to entertain them, oh but they were hard to please  
As time went by, oh backwards I walked  
Backwards I talked, and backwards I laughed

Tell me why were never more than strangers  
Tell me why you never let it show  
  
But when you're close to me  
And whisper, I need you  
In the cold mornin' light  
  
Try me, oh take me for a little while  
Before it's over and you leave me with just a smile  
Try me, oh let me be the one  
You say it's over  
But for me it had just begun  
  
Tell me why we seem no more than strangers  
Tell me why the feelin' never goes  
  
But when you're close to me  
And whisper, I need you  
In the cold mornin' light  
  
Try me, oh take me for a little while  
Before it's over and you leave me with just a smile  
Try me, oh let me be the one  
You say it's over  
But for me it had just begun

(instrumental intro)  
Yes she will be beautiful  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over  
She will suck out your brain  
Give me back my life  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
  
Put a black hat on me  
Take out a voodoo bone  
And the scars across my ceiling  
They paint a picture to the great unknown  
I'm coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
It's taking it's toll  
And the lamps keeps sliding  
Across the kitchen floor  
And there's something to remember  
Is this the life of a cross-cut saw  
And I'm coming unraveled  
Spinning out of control  
I'm becoming unstable  
I'm still paying the toll  
Great expectations will have a glitch  
Searching for power, may kill the bitch  
Theater of pain  
Love or lust in vain  
Unraveled again!  
Give me back my life,  
Give me back my call  
Simply set me free,  
Stop banging my head on the wall  
She will be beautiful,  
And you will be vain  
When the honeymoon is over,  
She will suck out your brain  
I'm coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
I'm becoming unstable,  
And I can't, I can't let go  
(instrumental)  
Coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable  
Nobody, nobody knows  
I'm coming unraveled,  
Spinning out of control  
Becoming unstable,  
I can't, I can't let go  
(instrumental and vocals fade out)  

Tell me now and I'll understand  
Does Venus hold you in the palm of her hand  
Has her blackness touched your very heart  
She'll smile sweetly as your world falls apart  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't quit it babe  
I just can't stand the pain  
And I just can't quit it babe  
I keep running back again  
  
Little by little piece by piece  
Your defenses have all slipped away  
And real beauty's such an elusive thing  
Somewhere down the line you'll have to pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, its such a cold, cold feeling  
Cuts your body to the bone  
Oh no, its a strange, strange feeling  
Loves been abandoned and I'm so alone  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I've nothing left but this very life to save  
And evrey night I feel that I'm a winner  
She's taking me down to the grave  
  
And everyday I see my flame growing dimmer  
I can't seem to chase the ghosts away  
And every night I get too high, I'm a winner  
I've nothing left but to pray  
  
And every night she makes me feel like a winner  
And every night she makes me think I'm a winner  
Venus smiles and encircles me  
And wraps me in a soft princely gown  
  
Waves of darkness rise like the sea  
In her addiction I will drown

I remember you when you was me  
Oh what a beautiful sight  
You'd cool it up  
Or you'd cool it down  
From some dizzy, dizzy height  
I can still hear that rolling sound  
Like a diesel in my head  
Sometimes I wake and I think of you now  
Forgetting that you're dead  
I was born on a rolling train  
Runnin' when I hit the ground  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Well  
This hotel rooms like the wild, wild west  
And there's strangers moving underground  
I still have your photograph  
It picks me up when I'm feeling down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me one  
Let's kick back and let it roll  
There's nothing here  
And there's nothing left  
But watching the daylight go to town  
We'd get swept up on a pillow fight  
You just couldn't let it go  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Don't you fade away  
solo  
Well I guess I'm walking right back home  
Got to set this all down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me two  
'cause there's nothing here,nothing left  
But watching the daylight turn around  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Watching this world spin around  
Watching the daylight go to town  
  

It's hot up in the west end, there's panic right downtown  
As the gangs assemble, coming up from underground  
Well Jesus I don't know which side I should be on  
I'm a class contender if anything goes wrong  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one  
  
We sneaked through the no go, very late last night  
Out up from the back streets, cruising for a fight  
  
Well Jackie's got his six string, he can play behind his back  
Mickey's out from Bellevue, he's just makin' tracks  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one  
  
As we rocked through the midnight, took 'em all by storm  
The police boys didn't have a chance, didn't even get warm  
Oh daddy, why am I sittin' here, I'm not a member of the bar  
I'm not the only wild one in a hot wired car  
  
When it's time to rock  
We're the only ones  
No one takes this block  
'Cause we're number one

Who do you love, who , who do, who,  
I've a little girl and she's so fine, no doubt about it she's all mine  
She's the best girl I've ever had, she looks so good she makes me feel sad  
Who do you love, who do you love  
She gimme kisses every night she gonna make me feel all right  
  
When I ask her what she want to do she said to me what you want to do  
Who do you love, who do you love, who do you love, who do you love...  
  
Hey little girl what can I do I want to play house with you  
I'm gonna make you feel all right I'm gonna let you stay all night  
I just want to make love to you  
Who do you who do you  
  
Hey,... Who do you love  
I've a little girl and she's so fine no doubt about it she's all mine  
Before I ask her what she want to do she said to me  
Who do you love, who do you love who do you love  
Who do you love who do you love who do you love  
  
Who do you love who do you love who do you love  
Who do you love who do you  
Who do you who do you want every night  
I'm gonna give you kisses and hold you tight  
Who do you love who do you love who do you love  
Who do you love come on ah who do you love, who do you love,  
Who do you, who do you, who do you love...

Baby you know that there's no choice  
I'm tired of hearing my own voice  
We can't live on love alone  
To find some work I'll have to leave our home  
And I know that things look desperate now  
But stand by me we'll get through somehow  
Ooh when you touch me it all fades away  
Ooh when you hold me I'll make it through another day  
Winter's here and it's looking bleak  
The snow is falling as we speak  
And can we cut back a little more  
Something will turn up I'm really sure  
So please darlin' keep your faith in me  
I'll make it good you wait and see  
Ooh when you touch me it all fades away  
Ooh when you hold me I'll make it through another day  
Winter's here and it's looking bleak  
The snow is falling as we speak  
And can we cut back a little more  
Something will turn up I'm really sure  
So please darlin' keep your faith in me  
I'll make it good you wait and see  
It's so special, oh so special  
Cause there's always you and me  
And we stand alone with our love  
So strong, bold and free  
It's so special, oh so special  
You can't take that away  
There's a bond that holds us together  
It'll always stay  
  
Though I'm getting stronger every day  
Situations change, I hope and pray  
I'm not a man who's afraid to fight  
With you beside me I'll see the light  
We'll be together, I'm sure it's meant to be  
A friend and lover my only loyalty  
If nothing else, it's you and me.
