There's a place where the sun breaks through  
And the wind bites cold and hard  
Stings my ears and  
Tears my eyes  
When the day starts to shout out loud  
  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
When the light is against your face  
And your smile is soft and sound  
That's when you tell me all your fears  
And all your dreams  
So proud  
  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
I try and tell you  
To keep your head upright  
Don't swing your sword and shield against the night  
Don't block your blessings, boy  
You don't have to fight  
You don't have to fight  
Stand tall  
And glide  
When you're all alone in the crowd  
Don't fall  
Don't hide  
When you walk above the clouds  
  
When you walk above the clouds

All through the night  
I'll be awake and I'll be with you  
All through the night  
This precious time when time is new  
Oh, all through the night today  
Knowing that we feel the same without saying  
  
We have no past, we won't reach back  
Keep with me forward all through the night  
And once we start the meter clicks  
And it goes running all through the night  
Until it ends, there is no end  
  
All through the night  
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back  
All through the night  
They have forgotten what by day they lack  
Oh under those white street lamps  
There is a little chance they may see  
  
We have no past, we won't reach back  
Keep with me forward all through the night  
And once we start the meter clicks  
And it goes running all through the night  
Until it ends, there is no end  
  
Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough  
Let me be there let me stay there awhile  
  
We have no past, we won't reach back  
Keep with me forward all through the night  
And once we start the meter clicks  
And it goes running all through the night  
Until it ends there is no end  
Keep with me forward all through the night  
And once we start the meter clicks  
And it goes running all through the night  
Until it ends there is no end

Anna blue oh  
Anna blue oh  
Anna  
  
Not me, not you  
Just time and a sigh  
On a line look in fine print-  
The small town dream  
To be part of the scene  
You can wear it with a style  
In your eyes a story never spoken-  
  
Anna blue oh  
Anne blue oh  
Anna  
  
Just me, just you  
Just a wide eyed girl  
Turn around quick-  
I'm walkin' my high heeled shoes  
And I'll be talkin' pretty smooth  
Like some souped up cosmo girl  
In a stupifying world  
But before I fall I wake up crying  
Oh... When I sit back  
I'll sigh and think...

At last  
My love has come along  
My lonely days over  
And life is like a song  
  
Ooh At last  
The skies above are blue  
Well my heart was wrapped up in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
Oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I  
Could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
Oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
Ooo yea  
You are mine  
You are mine  
At last  
At last  
At last  
At last

Hey you! Come on here on the floor  
And let's rock some more  
Come on here on the floor  
Honey lets rock some more, yeah.  
Now when you get out here don't cha have no fear  
Put your hand on your hip  
And let your backbone flip and work out.  
Mama, mama move up, party move back  
Shuffle to the left, wobble to the right  
Now it's plain to see you're a heading for me  
But it's a natural fact, huh, I like that so work out.  
Work it baby work out, honey work out  
Work out baby, workout baby work out, work it baby work.  
Shout until it's jumped out, work it baby work out.  
Work out, work out, work out, work out, work all night long.  
Round and round and round and round we go...  
Round and round I know. Don't you know, don't you know,  
Round and round we go where we stop nobody knows  
Yeah! The band is swinging on the stand  
We're moving in, we're moving out  
People stop right now, here's a dance with a shout so work out.  
Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it.

Every day the clock kicks off the beat.  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet.  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come.  
Sipping his coffee another day has begun...  
Little Joe got work for minimum wage.  
Tries to get through another dead beat day.  
At five o'clock he comes home to change,  
Takes him many hours just to rearrange...  
And he works his body just to be somebody.  
There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.  
And he works his body...  
And he feels somebody...  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.  
Every night the dj kicks off the beat.  
Little Cleo's jumping just to get up on her feet.  
Waits in her platforms for the right song to come.  
Sipping her cocktail another night has begun.  
And he works his body just to be somebody.  
There's a woman in the mirror looking like a dream.  
And he works his body...  
And he feels somebody...  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen.  
Every morning the clock kicks off the beat.  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet.  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come...

I met a woman at the laundry mat  
She left her sock in my dryer  
I met a woman in a yellow cap  
It said brimstone and fire  
I said is this luck? With just a glance  
She smiled, and I thought, is this a sign ?  
From above or below? Oh no...brimstone...  
Brimstone and fire...  
  
The next week at the cinema  
She pur her hand on my shoulder  
She almost kissed me walking home  
And I didn't even scold her  
Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh  
I quickened my pace and she was following  
As if her heart would never tire  
Brimstone and fire, brimstone and fire...  
  
Now we have dinner every Saturday  
I make spaghetti, she brings cake  
I make spaghetti with tomato sauce,  
Because that's all I can make  
And when she lights the candles  
I think, here we go...  
But it's so pleasant after all  
And I say very low  
Don't forget to light the fire  
  
Brimstone and fire...  
Brimstone and fire...  
Brimstone and fire...

Ever since I could understand  
My mother said to me  
"don't you ever let a man hit you,  
Don't you grow up like me"  
So I swore I'd never be like her  
Or my grandmother too  
Ever if it meant I'd be alone  
Ever if it meant I'd be alone.  
  
'Cause she looked  
'Cause she looked like broken glass  
When she fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When she started coming 'round  
But she couldn't make him stop  
And she wouldn't let it go  
So everytime she got back up  
Like broken glass went tumblin' down  
Tumblin' down  
  
First time that I saw your face  
You looked so lost and kind  
Should have recognized that  
Troubled look  
From the road I left behind  
But I thought that I could comfort you  
Or was it you could comfort me,  
Never saw your anger 'till you blew  
Never saw your anger 'till you blew  
  
And I feel  
Oh I'd feel like broken glass  
When I fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When I started coming 'round  
But I couldn't make you stop  
And you wouldn't let it go  
So everytime I got back up  
Like broken glass went tumbling down...  
  
The slightest thing could spark you  
There was always hell to pay  
I could feel your darkness in me  
And I knew just what to say  
And the rest I can't remember  
But it sounded like a gun  
But it could have been a firecracker  
It could have been a firecracker  
Made me run  
  
And you looked  
Oh you looked like broken glass  
When you fell to the ground  
I heard the sound of thunder  
Trailing off  
When you started coming 'round  
But I couldn't make you stop  
And you wouldn't let it go  
So this time when you got back up  
Like broken glass you went  
Just like broken glass  
Just like broken glass...  
...tumbling down, tumbling down...

The wind is in from africa  
Last night I couldn't sleep  
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here carey  
But it's really not my home  
My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet  
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy french cologne  
  
Oh carey get out your cane  
And I'll put on some silver  
Oh you're a mean old daddy, but I like you fine  
  
Come on down to the mermaid cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine  
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down  
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers  
A round for these friends of mine  
Let's have another round for the bright red devil  
Who keeps me in this tourist town  
  
Come on, carey, get out your cane  
I'll put on some silver  
Oh you're a mean old daddy, but I like you  
  
Maybe I'll go to amsterdam  
Or maybe I'll go to rome  
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room  
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now  
The night is a starry dome.  
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll  
Beneath the matalla moon  
  
Come on, carey, get out your cane  
And I'll put on some silver  
You're a mean old daddy, but I like you  
  
The wind is in from africa  
Last night I couldn't sleep  
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here  
But, it's really not my home  
Maybe it's been too long a time  
Since I was scramblin' down in the street  
Now they got me used to that clean white linen  
And that fancy french cologne  
  
Oh carey, get out your cane  
I'll put on my finest silver  
We'll go to the mermaid cafe  
Have fun tonight  
I said, oh, you're a mean old daddy, but you're out of sight

Here I am  
Just like I said I would be  
I'm your friend  
Just like you think it should be  
Did you think I would stand here andlie  
As our moment was passing us by  
Oh I am here  
  
Waiting for your change of heart  
It just takes a beat  
To turn it around  
Yes I'm waiting for you change of heart  
At the edge of my seat  
Please turn it around  
  
Days go by  
Leaving me with a hunger  
I could fly  
Back to when we were younger  
When adventures like cars we would ride  
And the years lied ahead still untried  
While I stand here  
  
Waiting for your change of heart...  
  
Blind leading blind  
Never hear the laughter  
Search through time  
Nothing reveals the answer  
If it's truth that you're looking to find  
It is nowhere outside of your mind  
I bide my time  
  
Waiting for you change of heart...

It's time to make the Christmas punch  
Let's hang the streamers from the ceiling  
Bring out the old cheer  
Ring in the new year  
And get that Christmas feeling  
  
Chorus:  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga,  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
  
The old white tree still looks good  
And Grandma's angels got me thinking  
String up the new lights,  
Brighten the cold nights  
And get those baubles blinking  
  
Chorus:  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga,  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga  
  
And then we'll put on party hats  
As the year comes to a conclusion  
Turn on the yule log  
Spike up the egg nog  
And break those resolutions  
  
Chorus:  
I wish you joy that never ends  
Happy times with all your friends  
Come on and hold my hips a little longer  
As we do the Christmas Conga,  
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga  
Do the Christmas Conga

I met a man who drew the line  
He couldn't cross his fear of intimacy  
He just sighed  
Because he left behind all his fantasy  
ooh-hoo, ooh, woo, woo, yeah  
  
If you build a wall up, high  
You start to crumble  
And you never know why  
Your tears never dry  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
You say you need a little time  
To heal from some romantic injury  
And I say fine  
But if you change your mind  
You can lean on me  
ooh, woo, woo, yeah  
  
But I'm going on with my life, oh  
I've seen it everyday  
People get burned  
And they throw love away  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
If you build a wall up, high  
You start to crumble  
And you never know why  
Your tears never dry  
  
If you're running from the vision  
That's in your eyes  
There's a collision with what's inside  
This ain't livin'  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
  
Cold, so cold  
Cold, so cold  
Cold, cold, cold, cold  
I need someone to hold  
How did it get so cold  
It's coming from the kitchen  
It's coming from the sky  
It's coming round the corner  
Straight for you and I  
It gets so cold...  

(x)  
Walking down the street  
Memories surround me  
I'm lost in a town without pity  
It brings me to my knees  
Thoughts of me in your arms  
Sends a shiver through me  
My weary heart knows better  
But I want you more than ever  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And it's a cold sky, it's a cold sky  
Wish upon a red star to guide me  
My footsteps lead me nowhere  
I circle in the square  
People stare right through me  
As if I wasn't even there  
A sea of stars above me  
And no one here to love me  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And it's a cold sky  
(x)  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over  
I thought I was over loving you  
But each time I look up I think of you  
And it's a cold sky, it's a cold sky  
It's a cold sky  
Thought I was over, loving you...  
(x)  

It will be whatever it is you're looking for  
It will be whatever it is you need  
It will be better even though I know you're not sure  
Remember the rain even comes down in Shangri-La  
Look up as it soaks into your skin and remember who you are and  
  
Come on home when the road you've been walking gets too long  
Don't be scared in case the grass you thought was greener isn't there  
You can come on home  
  
If you find the sun won't shine through every window  
If you find a moonlit night still makes you blue  
If you find out why you feel the way you do  
Glance over your shoulder boy you know I'll be there  
I've found in the past you know, sometimes life isn't fair so  
  
Come on home when the road you've been walking gets too long  
  
Don't be scared in case the grass you thought was greener isn't there  
You can come on home  
When lifes isn't fair don't go there  
You can come on home

Lot of havoc in the sea  
People rushing endlessly  
Sometimes I think it's just their way  
Of capturing a better day  
You keep rushing home baby  
For your dose of reality  
I'll hold out my hands to you  
You do what you need to  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
  
An ocean of humanity  
Some wash up along the street  
It's hard to keep in stepping round  
It's hard to keep that frame of mind  
Trying to move with the sun  
Gives the illusion that we're one  
I'll be running next to you  
We do what we need to  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
  
But when the moonlight washes over our bed  
And the road slows  
A lonely siren screeching 'round the bend  
The cool air blows  
Raising the hair on my skin  
We come face to face  
Try to let each other in  
  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
Ohh, whoa  
I will comfort you (I will comfort you)  
  
I will I will I will I will  
I will I will I will I will  
I will comfort you

Oh the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
  
Oh cyrus trusts the spirits  
And they fill his life with grace  
Yeah the father of his fathers  
Passed him down the gift of faith  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...  
  
And the two girls start to dancing  
When they hear that drunken voice  
That's when cyrus asks the moonlight  
Do I have to make a choice  
'tween liza with her red hair  
And ramona with her blues  
And with all these gifts they bring me  
Tell me how can I refuse  
  
Well the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...

Holding on to the rhythm  
I'm standing in my leather and lace  
People move to the left, and  
Move to the right, and  
  
The whole place starts to shake  
Without a net on a real high wire  
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire  
I started dancing with a stranger  
  
Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger  
And I just got swept away  
Letting go my inhibitions  
  
Is harder to do than say  
But I surrender to the beat  
I start shuffling my feet  
When I hear that music play  
  
I trip the light fantastic  
I touch the sky and it feels like magic  
I started dancing with a stranger  
Moving to the break of day  
  
Dancing with a stranger  
And I just got swept away  
Give me a dance, dance  
Dancing with a stranger  
  
And it takes my breath away  
I ain't looking for mister right  
It doesn't matter to me  
There's something in the air  
  
Electric I like  
Igniting endlessly  
I started to dance...  
Without a net on a real high wire  
  
I'm stepping out with my wheels of fire  
I started dancing with a stranger  
Moving to the break of day  
Dancing with a stranger  
  
And I just got swept away...

Dear John  
What's wrong?  
Why can't you just be anything you want? Why not?  
Why not? I tried to tell you then.  
You didn't understand.  
They try and pigeonhole you.  
Buddy, they don't even know you.  
But hang on my dear, dear, John.  
Maybe you're not just like everyone, so what, so what.  
And there's more to live for,  
Than some abbreviated encore, much more, much more.  
You can't define yourself in terms of someone else.  
You can't say what you're thinking?  
But I don't know what you've been drinking.  
But don't cry. 'Cause life goes on.  
Dear John, you could be anything you want. Why not?  
Why not?  
Why you could even be an astronaut, dear John, dear John.

Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round  
  
Snuggle up and let me hold kiss  
Your baby breath in the dark and cold  
On a silent night long ago  
Another mother held her babe and told him  
  
Chorus:  
Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round  
  
They had come such a long long way  
Rest your little head on me and I'll tell you of  
A little king and his bed of hay  
It is remembered every Christmas day  
  
Little one, little son  
All my life I've wished you welcome  
  
Chorus:  
Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round

People getting loose now, getting down on the roof

You'll rescue me  
Let my spirit run free  
You'll rescue me  
Let my spirit run free

Just hold me a little softly it's cold  
Hold me again  
'cause that's when our love is ageless and time, time is my friend  
  
So hold me closer, closer, closer baby that's what I need  
And you could lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing, it's whispering  
  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know  
I just want to love you  
  
Remember, I once told you where not two of a kind  
Except I was chasing after something  
Love was the last thing on my mind  
  
And then you started, you started, started something inside of me, yeah  
So come on, lay your head on my dress  
And you could listen to my breathing, it's whispering  
I don't know exactly where it started, I don't know

Baby do you understand me now  
If sometimes you see that I'm mad  
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?  
When everything goes wrong I seem bad  
  
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Baby sometimes I'm so carefree  
with a joy that's hard to hide  
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry  
And then you bound to see my other side  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
If I seem edgy  
I want you to know  
That I never meant to take it out on you  
Life has its problems  
and I have my share  
And that's me one thing I never want to do  
  
Baby  
Don't you know I'm human  
I have thoughts like any other one?  
  
Oh when sometimes I find myself alone regretting  
Some little thing  
Some simple thing I've done  
  
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  
Please don't let me be misunderstood

Listen to the children sing  
Watch them dancing all 'round the Christmas tree ...  
Waiting for the opening  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
All around the world is sleeping  
Little children there's no peeping  
Wait and see what Santa's bringing  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
Icicles and breakfast cakes ...  
Friends and family we will celebrate  
Sounds that joy and laughter make  
Early Christmas morning ...  
  
All around and far off places  
Angels waken smiling faces  
Wrapping us with love and graces  
Early Christmas morning ...  
Early Christmas morning ...

Woke up to the clock  
What knob makes it stop  
Time to be aware  
Time to just be there  
You go, go , go, go,  
I go, go , go, go,  
Conversations rare  
Trail off in the air  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
All that rolls our way  
Wheels that time will play  
Happiness grows back  
Heartache leaves a scratch  
You go, go, go,go,  
I go, go, go , go  
Everyplace I go  
Never told you so  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus]  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days, all of my life  
I will find you  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days all of my life  
Landing next to you  
  
When you're on the top  
Notice what you've got  
I will be your frail  
When your on the trail  
You go, go, go, go  
I go, go, go, go  
Everything you know  
Everywhere you go  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I go back back back  
You go from the top  
Once till we drop  
Never like to stop

I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes  
I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed  
Then I realize that this time, time won't tell  
People like myself can't compromise this well  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Said a lot of words that you never wanted to hear  
Used myself up trying to explain and be clear  
Then I realize we mean the things we say  
When you turn the page the words don't go away  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Christopher Columbus aint got much on me  
And maybe just like Moses, I will part the sea  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
No, I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
I won't let go, just wait and see...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...

I met a man  
And talked about you  
He seemed like a man from Osaka I knew  
And he listened while I told him how you hurt me  
And he consoled me when he told me he'd been hurt too  
  
And he said we are inter-dependent  
And the effects on each other never ending  
And that the air has no boundaries  
I think this water that surrounds me  
Is the same water soaking through to you  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
I had some tea  
With a gal from Paris  
We talked about life, sex, love and poetry  
And you can't help it  
Your name came up again  
And she said man those kind of guys  
Really know how to steal all of the oxygen  
  
And I said we are inter-dependent  
And the effects on each other never ending  
And that the air has no boundaries  
I think this water that surrounds me  
Is the same water soaking' through to you  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
I have a friend I confide in  
He always says 'doll you got to learn not to lead with your chin'  
But you can't help it  
It all comes up again  
And then you have your fill  
And your spill reaches down as far as a flood  
  
So what comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
What comes floating to me  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
  
Eventually  
Eventually  
Will come floating back to you  
Eventually  
Eventually

If you want to see me  
Don't break down and cry  
I can be your sweetie  
If you be a friend of mine  
And I won't be forsaken  
If you think thoughts unkind  
Just bring home the bacon  
And bring it home on time  
  
Hey Louie, can't you see  
I couldn't leave you if I tried  
Hey Louie, listen to me  
We got a thing so dignified  
It don't matter if we lived in a shack  
Or in a shiny cadillac  
It don't matter rich or poor  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you...  
  
Hey Louie, life is sweet  
I can't be bitter  
When you're here with me  
Hey Louie, no regrets  
Holding on to things  
That you ought to forget  
Well, it doesn't matter tit for tat  
'Cause what you give  
You get it back  
It don't matter anymore  
When love is knocking at your door  
  
It feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas with you,  
Everytime I see ya  
Everytime I hear ya  
Everytime I'm near ya,  
I'd be happy  
Because it feels like Christmas  
Just like Christmas  
It feels like Christmas  
With you...

Five days  
I ran a wolf across highways  
In the early spring (don't stop you're gonna break my heart)  
The rest of my days  
Should I stay should I pray  
That I'm here now clear now  
Live with the fears  
To extend my tears  
Shed no have no  
Undecided  
Five days in which I can't wait now (I need you)  
Can't wait now (you needed me)  
Bet you can't wait now (whatever happened to compatible two)  
Making you wait now  
  
I ran a wolf across highways in the early spring  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
  
Have I the meanings  
I don't think I'm cheating  
I create like the windy city (Don't go)  
But the drums spread (I told you so)  
Here we go with the games now  
Maintain now  
Might as well have you down now  
Five days that you can't wait now (no need to smile)  
Making you hate now  
  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
The five to fours can't take it no more  
  
Bet you can't wait now  
Making you wait now  
Don't go I told you so  
After what you've had  
That look on your face you rat  
When you talk like that  
I just want to get you back

Pressure on me  
Can't get out  
Situation it's a melt down  
Nine to fivin', want to shout  
New direction, got to get to high ground  
  
I've got to get back to the floor  
Just grab my keys and pop the door  
  
[Chorus]  
Going to give it up  
Get on down  
Little by little going to turn it around  
  
Wash the week out  
Of my mind  
Slap my face on  
Now I feel sublime  
Put some sounds on  
To unwind  
Caught the moment  
Just about the right time  
  
I've got to get back to the floor  
Just grab my keys and pop the door, yea  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make my heart sing  
Like a wild thing  
Yea yea yea

Going to make a confession  
Going to hope that you listen  
I'm not a story you've read about  
I'm just what I am  
  
And when you open your eyes up  
In the morning you rise up  
Wash yesterday from your face  
And make a new plan  
  
Oh, it's my fascination, with the anticipation  
  
If you want to grab a hold  
If you want to grab a hold  
If you want to grab a hold  
Let it go...  
  
I'm going to write down a letter  
And maybe some day you'll get it  
And know what I meant to say  
And make it ok  
And if ya look at my picture  
You know the one on your dresser  
And if you think that you see a frown  
Turn me upside down  
  
Why don't you use, your imagination?  
Make it what you have to make it  
  
If you want to grab a hold...  
Let it go...  
  
You get your grip  
I'll hold you up  
Just reach with your hand  
And then use your imagination  
Make it want you have to make it  
  
If you want to grab a hold...  
Let it go... (Repeat to fade)

[Chorus:]  
Hang on sloopy, sloopy hang on  
Hang on sloopy, sloopy hang on  
  
Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town  
And everybody yeah, tries to put my sloopy down  
Well sloopy I don't care what your daddy do  
Cause' you know sloopy girl I'm in love with you  
And so I say now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sloopy let your hair down girl let it hang down on me  
Sloopy let your hair down girl let it hang down on me  
Come on sloopy, come on sloopy  
Come on sloopy, come on sloopy  
Well it feels so good  
You know it feels so good  
Shake it, shake it, shake it sloopy  
Shake it, shake it, shake it yeah  
  
[Chorus:]

Don't close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
My image bends its shape  
I'll be written on the wind  
Like in every sailer's dreams  
Heading for the moon  
I reach out (echoes)  
My pulse begins to race (echoes)  
The crashing sounds  
Of fears I've never faced  
Let them echo off these waves  
With thoughts as brave as they once were  
Heading for the moon  
And, look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind, oh  
Heading for the moon  
Don't close your eyes  
Or I might drift away  
Under the night  
Of never ending shapes  
I'll be wishing off the blue  
I'll still want to send my stars  
Heading for the moon  
And, look  
How we write  
Over the white  
Shadows may chase from behind  
But just put them out of your mind, oh  
Heading for the moon  
Ha ha  
Heading for the moon  
So don't close your eyes  
Heading for the moon  
Over the white  
Your shadows may chase from behind  
You might just put them out of your mind  
Heading for the moon

I drop my hat  
To a restless wind  
This time I'm not gonna chase it again  
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words  
  
I woke up crying and no one heard  
You're looking through me like I never was real  
You say you love me but you won't let me feel  
So I'm gonna take a chance this time  
  
I'm gonna find myself some place where I can heal  
And I'm heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And I'm heading west  
  
I'm like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
I'm heading west  
I said my name  
  
Under my breath  
He turned down a twisted road  
I won't forget  
I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all the string  
  
Hold on to hope, let go everything  
I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said  
The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head  
And if I fall down on my knees I'm gonna get back up  
  
I'm gonna get back up again  
And I'm heading west  
Without a sad goodbye  
And I'm heading west  
  
I'm like a letter with no address  
Just like a book I read  
I'm heading west  
And I'm heading west...  
Just like a book I read...

These are the original ones:  
See the way she walks down the street?  
Watch the way she shuffles her feet.  
May she holds her head up high as she goes walking bye.  
  
And she throws her hands out so fast.  
And she's not just one of the pack.  
My baby always the one to try the things they've never done.  
And just because of that they're saying:  
  
She's a rebel and she'll never be any good.  
She's a rebel 'cause she never, never does what she should.  
And just because she doesn't do, what everybody else does.  
That's the reason why I can give her all my love.

I don't want to hear your name  
I don't want to thing  
Just stay away baby

And I don't think I care  
And I don't want to be your friend

I'll forget I ever let  
Ever let you into this heart of mine baby  
You just gotta let me be  
You gotta keep away from me

Don't you come around  
And say you still care about me  
Go now, go now

You take it casually, and that's what's killing me

Don't call me in the middle of the night no more  
I don't want to be your friend  
Don't think that it will be the way it was before  
I don't want to be your friend...

Come to mama 'cause you know  
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  
In the middle of the night  
When the last sheep jumps through my head  
Why shut out the light?  
When I know I'm gonna wake up again  
In crumpled sheets  
There is no silhouette  
To the sight of me  
It's much to cold in this bed  
  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
  
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  
I turn on my side  
And I can hear myself breathe  
It's pretty quiet outside  
I miss the sound of you next to me  
When you talk in your sleep  
And you mention my name  
I close my eyes to remember  
But it's just not the same  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (Ooh, I miss him)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby  
  
Can't pet your head all with the covers to your chin  
And watch you kick them off again  
Can't watch you sleep in the light  
From the slit in the door  
And what I can't have  
It makes me want it even more  
It makes me want it even more  
Ba, ba, ba, ba  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby (in the broad daylight)  
Oooooohhhh (oh, I miss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (oh, I miss you, miss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (gonna kiss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the broad daylight)  
I miss my baby

It might just be too deep  
We've turned your love into a hate  
I can't wake you from this sleep  
I can't lure you with this bait  
And when you're all alone at night  
I feel for you, I fight the fight  
I need to know that where you go  
Is real enough for me to know  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
It might just be too late  
We've turned your heart into a stone  
I can't save you from this fate  
I can't help you be alone  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
Blood is thicker than water  
That could be a bunch of lies  
What makes me think I ought to  
Hold reins on all the ties  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
And if by chance, I'd drown for you  
Would you believe, at last it's true  
That all my soul was yours to take  
Would you believe I wasn't fake?  
  
  

If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that've hurt you  
And you'd stay  
  
I don't know why I did the things I did  
I don't know why I said the things I said  
Prides like a knife it can cut deep inside  
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes  
I didn't really mean to hurt you  
I didn't wanna see you go  
I know I made you cry, but baby..  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that've hurt you  
And you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do  
  
(If I could turn back time)  
My world was shattered, I was torn apart  
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart  
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care  
But I lost everything darlin then and there  
Too strong to tell you I was sorry  
Too proud to tell you I was wrong  
I know I was blind, and darlin...  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that've hurt you  
And you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time...  
If I could turn back time...  
If I could turn back time...  
Oh baby...  
  
I didn't really mean to hurt you  
I didn't wanna see you go  
I know I made you cry, but  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
I'd take back those words that hurt you..  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you  
And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do  
  
If I could turn back time  
If I could find a way  
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay  
If I could reach the stars  
I'd give them all to you

You like the flame and you are drawn by desire  
Watching and waiting in line for your turn  
I've learned to walk with my back to the fire  
I like the heat but I don't want to get burned  
  
And if you need water  
I'll be a river  
Like a wave I will come over you  
You need someone to fall into  
I'll be a river  
And my love will carry you through  
  
Here stands a fortress built with great walls of silence  
Ready to crumble at the slightest word  
Finding the right one is becoming a science  
I'd like to scream but I ain't gonna be heard  
  
And if you need water  
I'll be a river  
Like a wave I will come over you  
You need someone to fall into  
I'll be a river  
And my love will carry you through

Ah, ah ah, ah  
  
We come from the land of the ice and snow  
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.  
The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands,  
To fight the horde, singing and crying:  
Valhalla, I am coming.  
  
On we sweep with treshing oars,  
Our only goal will be the western shore.  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah  
  
We come from the land of the ice and snow  
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.  
How soft your fields so green,  
We calmed the tides of war,  
Can whisper tales of gore:  
We are your overlords.  
  
On we sweep with treshing oars,  
Our only goal will be the western shore.

In the bleak midwinter  
Frosty wind made moan  
Earth stood hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago  
  
Angels and arc-angels  
May have gathered there  
Cherubim and seraphim  
Thronged the air  
But only his mother  
In her maiden bliss  
Worshiped the beloved  
With a kiss  
  
What can I give him  
Poor as I am  
If I were a sheperd  
I would give a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
But what I can I give him  
Give him my heart  

Got this endless itch to ride  
Into the night  
Fortune cookie says I'm right  
Kung Fu like  
  
Shake your body Mister  
Gonna make ya body blister, say hey, hey, hey  
Don't wanna have to make ya  
I don't wanna have to shake ya down, hey, hey, hey  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
Pitter, patter doesn't matter what you got  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
Turn you over baby till its never enough  
I'll take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
Like love  
In the night life  
  
Want to dress for you tonight  
Under the light  
Shot up like a satellite  
Into the night  
Shake ya money maker  
I will never be a faker now, hey hey hey  
Leave 'em standing waitin'  
Till they're practically faintin' now, hey hey hey  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight [Repeat x2]  
Under the light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Into the night life [repeated]  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight  
Under the light

Just the other day-  
I heard you walked out on her  
Just the other day-  
I heard it's not forever  
You say, anyway-  
You said it's not like before  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go.  
Just the other day-  
You lost the girl you adored  
Just the other day-  
You boyish love was the cause  
Did she cost you pain  
You could have held out for more  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go  
I see your walking alone  
Will you still talk to me  
If she's not by your side anymore.

Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see La vie en rose  
  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be La vie en rose

An empty street, a quiet smile  
Without steady feet  
You know the reckless kind  
Keep coming, coming back  
To the same old place  
With that wild eyed stare  
Up in your face  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay me down, let me down  
In a big old town  
Lay me down, let me down  
In a big old town  
  
He must have lost his soul  
When he found the rent  
He wrestles with control  
Still hasn't pinned it yet  
Once in, once in a while  
Loose that cigarette  
There's always some strange smile  
Underneath his breath  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Passion's fist against a wall  
The crush of a kiss, the rise and fall  
Take me there, take me there  
To that wounded sound  
It's just love's despair  
Gone and hit the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay me down,, let me down [Repeated]

The street light  
Through my window  
Makes me feel secure  
There's no one to distract me  
I'm locking the door  
You cannot barge into  
My own little world  
You can't take the joy  
From the soul of this girl  
  
Telling me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies  
  
My thoughts are all tangled  
I don't know what I feel  
You try to confuse me  
'Till I don't know what's real  
You say what's good (for me)  
You don't even know me  
You don't even want the truth  
That you need to feel  
The power that was taken from you  
  
Telling me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me lies, lies, lies...  
  
So I'll pretend,  
And we'll all be happy  
But in the end  
There's no telling when  
You'll slip off the edge  
And you start up again  
But I'm not the same child  
Who just had no defense  
  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies...  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies...  
  
All that's left is this knocking  
Of a heart you left on the shelf  
You twisted your love  
'Cause you don't love yourself  
  
Don't tell me your lies, lies, lies  
Don't tell me lies, lies, lies...  
Don't tell me lies...

I lived in your shadow  
I drove your car  
You thought I belonged in your four walls  
I was never your bunny  
I was never, never your pet  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like a, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me, like a, like a  
  
You thought I'd be purring  
Curled up by your fire  
Don't want to be kept for your desire  
You said I should be happy  
But it only made me sad  
And when you could never tame me  
That made you mad  
No you could never tame me  
Like a, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me  
  
You rescued me I didn't want to be saved  
I got tired of your missionary position babe  
  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
  
I only let you stroke me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you hold me like a  
  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat

I know you expected me  
To act just like a schoolgirl  
Followed your rules  
Just like a fool  
Wrapped up in your world  
What's good for you  
Don't mean that's so good for me  
What can I do, but hang around  
And lose myself just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
  
Well I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand  
And take things lying down like before  
Won't take your crap the way I used to  
Ain't gonna be the way it used to,  
Alright for you, ain't alright for me  
  
Maybe I was weak though the average  
Person probably thinks I'm stronger  
When I need someone else  
I shut out myself,  
Scared to say the wrong words  
What's right for you  
Don't think that's alright for me  
You spread the glue, so I can't move  
And stick to you just like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw...  
  
Oh I ain't gonna walk  
With my heart in my hand...  
Ain't gonna do it like I used to  
Go round and round just like a loose screw  
Alright for you ain't alright for me, no  
Every time you put me down  
Every time you screw me around  
Every time you do that to me  
I'm my own possession  
I'm my own possession...

Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum

Me and my drum, me and my drum, me and my drum, me and my drum

Long ago a lonely man stood  
Off of a quiet avenue  
A pretty girl in passing chanced to look  
That's when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain  
Pounding on the railing  
The beat's a sweet, soft refrain  
Of how he found you LORRAINE  
He's rocking on a porch you used to know  
Here where he swore his love was true  
He sips his drink and dreams the days of old  
Of when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain...

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
  
While shepherds watch their flocks by night,  
They see a bright new shining star,  
They hear a choir sing a song,  
The music seemed to come from afar.  
  
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Came to Bethlehem that night,  
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.  
  
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn,  
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,  
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

Maybe he'll know  
I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be my cure  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Maybe he'll know  
I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be - oh  
  
Something calls to me  
I know, I know  
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum, I'm  
Chanting a song, anchor me-  
But don't take too long...no, no, no, no  
  
I got an anxious feeling  
Got this ache engraved in me like stone-  
Don't take too long  
Say you'll never leave me say you'll never go.

Maybe I'm amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you're with me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you help me sing my song  
You right me when I'm wrong  
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...

Rain falls hard  
Burns dry  
A dream  
Or a song  
That hits you so hard  
Filling you up  
And suddenly gone  
  
Breath Feel Love  
Give Free  
Know in you soul  
Like your blood knows the way  
From you heart to your brain  
Know that you're whole  
  
And you're shining  
Like the brightest star  
A transmission  
On the midnight radio  
And you're spinning  
Like a 45  
Ballerina  
Dancing to your rock and roll  
  
Here's to Patti  
And Tina  
And Yoko  
Aretha  
And Nona  
And Nico  
And me  
  
And all the strange rock and rollers  
You know you're doing all right  
So hold on to each other  
You gotta hold on tonight  
  
And you're shining  
Like the brightest stars  
A transmission  
On the midnight radio  
  
And you're spinning  
Your new 45's  
All the misfits and the losers  
Yeah, you know you're rock and rollers  
Spinning to your rock and roll

sometimes when I lose my head  
I can't make sense of what you said  
but you don't mean it  
or that's what you say  
all the conversation seems to slip away  
  
oh maybe you can say it better (you can say it better...better)  
I can listen  
people do it all the time, baby  
we can make it better (we can make it better)  
cause mincing words (mincing words) will never rhyme  
they never rhyme  
  
same excuses that go round and round  
push them up just to knock them down  
confuse the issue to shift the blame  
and lose the picture like a puzzle game  
  
you never notice if you're right or wrong (right or wrong)  
it becomes a contest of the weak and the strong  
(weak and the strong, baby)  
there is no reason for you to pick a fight (no, no)  
when we lose heart its time to shut out the light  
  
mmmm hmmm  
  
oh maybe you can say it better  
(you can say it better...better)  
I can listen  
people do it all the time, baby  
we can make it better (we can make it better)  
cause mincing words (cause mincing words)  
Will never rhyme  
baby never rhyme  
will never rhyme

Moments like this don't last long  
I lock them safe away  
What good is it to say  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
And I won't care  
I won't care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And I'm not sure of myself anymore  
  
I'm not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what you're doin'  
And don't you say that I could just be an illusion  
And that's ok its alright baby you the feel  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After I'm wondering it it's you  
  
Oh  
  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
And I don't care  
I won't care anymore  
You called my name  
The music played  
And I'm not sure of myself anymore  
I'm not so sure  
  
Say you gotta know just what you're doin'  
Don't you say that I could just be an illusion  
And that's ok its alright maybe I'm the fool  
Love oh baby  
  
After this night is through  
After I'm wondering it it's you  
  
I'll get along  
Just like before  
Just like before

Over land and over sea  
She reaches out to me  
Weaving and threading the loom  
From womb to womb  
  
Slaves and merchants  
Pilgrims and thieves  
Felt her hand and charted skys  
By following her moon  
  
Mother...Mother...Mother ...  
  
Some came and built with stone and bone  
Some planted fields on promised land  
And harvested their dreams,  
Then disappeared  
As generations lose their memory  
I'll try and remind my heart ...  
And hope that it will set me free  
  
Mother...Mother...Mother ...  
  
Condeming my true nature  
I stood outside of myself...outside of myself  
Conditioning is what made me  
Lose sight of myself...lose sight of myself...  
Lose sight  
  
Ravens cry out,  
Tides pull in,  
Somehow she replenishes...  
Giving birth again  
  
Mother...Mother...Mother...

Leave me alone  
I'm not home  
Don't hear your knock at the door  
I'm running away so don't call  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home oh oh  
Oh there'll be  
  
Don't ask me why  
Time goes by, I haven't heard from the witness  
No things are play  
So don't call me  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be  
  
Be better if I fall... After all  
I'm always crying crying  
So would you catch me if I fell  
When there no one listening  
To hear what happened  
When I'm all on my own  
  
Leave me alone  
I'm not home  
Don't hear your knock at the door  
I'm running away so don't call  
There'll be no answer today  
  
There's no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be no one at home  
There's no one at home  
Oh there'll be  
  
Be better if I fall... After all  
I'm always crying crying  
Know if you catch me if I fell  
And there's no one listening  
To hear what happened  
When I'm all on my own  
No one at home  
No one at home  
  
No nah nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah na no no hah hah  
No nah nah nah no no no no uh oh

Walked with no one and talked with no one  
And I had nothing but shadows  
Then one morning you passed  
And I brightened at last  
Now I greet the day and complete the day  
With the sun in my heart  
All my worry blew away  
When you taught me how to say  
  
Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But I'm not afraid  
This Rover crossed over  
  
If I never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
Grab your street

Come on in, and pull yourself up a chair (like chairry!)  
Let the fun begin, it's time to let down your hair!  
Pee-wee's so excited,  
'cause all his friends have been invited (that's you!)  
To go wacky, at pee-wee's playhouse!  
  
There's a crazy rhythm, comin' from puppetland (what that?)  
Dirty dog, cool cat, and chicky baby are the puppet band (yeah!)  
He's got a couple of talkin' fish,  
And a genie who'll grant a wish -  
Golly, it's cuckoo at pee-wee's playhouse!  
  
Globey's spinnin', mr. Window's grinnin',  
'cause pterri's flyin' by (hello!)  
The flowers are singin', the picture phone is ringin',  
And the dinosaur family goes, "hi!"  
Mr. Kite's soarin', conky's still a snorin',  
There's the flashing magic screen.  
The cowntess is so classy, randy's kinda sassy -  
A nuttier establishment you've never seen!  
Spend the day with pee-wee and you'll see what we mean! (come on!)  
  
Get outta bed, there'll be no more nappin'! (wake up!)  
'cause you've landed in a place where anything can happen -  
Now we've given you fair warnin'!  
It's gonna be that kind of mornin' -  
For bein' wacky!  
For getting nutty!  
Golly, it's cuckoo!  
At pee-wee's playhouse!

I pity the fool  
Yeah, I pity the fool  
  
That falls in love with you  
And expects you to be true  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
Chorus:  
look at the people  
i know you wonder what they're doing  
they're just standing there  
watching you make a fool of me  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Oh, I pity the fool  
Yeah, I pity the fool  
Hey, I pity the fool  
I pity the fool that falls in love with you  
  
He'll break your heart one day  
And he'll laugh and go on his way  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
I pity the fool...  
I pity the fool that gives her heart to you  
  
He'll take her heart away  
And he'll find another fool to play  
That's why I pity that fool  
  
(repeat chorus)

My heart keeps beating me to death  
I see you move and I can't catch my breath  
I want to touch you with my lips  
I want to touch you with a kiss  
  
My heart keeps pounding like a fist  
I see you there and I just can't resist  
You make me tremble like this  
You make me tremble like a jellyfish  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me feel  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh  
  
I hear you calling out my name  
And when you talk your words they numb my brain  
You make this fire in me start  
I want to touch you with my heart  
  
I hear you whisper in the dark  
And when you touch me I just come apart  
I feel the fever in your hands  
We feel things we don't even understand  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me feel  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh  
It's animal  
  
Like the moon pulls at the tide  
I'm at your side  
The world in which we live  
  
It's primitive  
You got me  
Oh  
It's primitive  
You make me real  
Primitive  
When you lock me in your arms  
You chain me to your heart  
...Oh

She's just a product of misery...  
  
Everyday she'd go around  
Everytime I see that frown  
Broken down and down and out,  
The drudgery goes on and on.  
Oh I just want to say,  
I ain't gonna live that way 'cause  
  
She's just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that,  
Just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that.  
  
Like her mother and hers before,  
She left her heart out by the door.  
Everybody passed it by.  
They never bothered asking why  
She stayed looked up inside,  
Watching as the world turns by.  
  
Now she's just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery.  
I don't want to live like that.  
I don't want to live like that !  
Hey, like that ?!  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery...  
  
...Annie said she must confess  
She never came and never left,  
Never could communicate and  
Now the time is much too late.  
Passions laid to rest,  
Buried with her wedding dress.  
  
Now she's just a product of misery...  
I don't want to live like that.  
I don't want to live like that...  
Just a product of misery.

Rich man, poor man, beggar man thief  
You can fool some people  
But you can't fool me  
Harbor all the hate and greed  
Threaten demise of democracy  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a raging storm  
In a troubled sea  
But you're clouding my mind  
With celebrity  
  
There are darker times for me  
Behind smoke and mirrors, amputees  
It's a different world  
Now i see the deflowering  
Of the birds and bees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can fight for the right to be  
But ya better not do a bad show on MTV  
  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief  
You can fool some people but you can't fool me  
Smart bombs, rock stars, suit case queens  
God's love we deliver out destiny  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on people, yea yea, yea, yea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on people, yea yea, yea, yea

I saw you gather all your hopes  
With all your dreams  
I waved just like a shooting star  
That once had waved to me  
  
I am a love in mid air  
I think about it I don't care  
Into the fire of despair  
Just like a train that goes nowhere  
  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain, rain on me  
  
There was a time I got it wrong  
Is shakes my memory  
And all the time I had it all  
It's just I couldn't see  
  
I am a robber in the dark  
Singing about a broken heart  
Answering whistles in the air  
Waiting for someone else to care  
  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain on me  
When the rain came tumbling down  
And both your feet were on the ground, oh  
Running fast and free, oh yea  
  
Well maybe time's going to wear you out  
Or maybe you're going to come around, or  
We'll just yea  
  
Well maybe time's going to wear you out  
Or maybe you're going to come around, or  
We'll just wait and see, oh yea  
  
[Repeat x2]  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain on me

The train was leaving at 10 after 10  
I got to the station just in time to check in  
I've been luggin' my bags all around  
I'm trying hard to never knock people down  
But I see I left a few on the ground  
And as the train pulls away I can hear the conductor say  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
I'm not to blame (echo)  
Right track wrong train... Train  
I read my schedule but my train wasn't there  
They read my ticket, it said going nowhere  
Everybody had the same tatooed face  
All the women and men just dressed in lace  
Oh I gotta get out of this place  
Should got off before the engineer locked the door  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
I'm not to blame (echo)  
Right track wrong train, train train train hey!  
"Hey that's a neat tatoo you're wearing. By the way where'd you get it?  
Uh huh. Say is this an express train? Uh huh.  
Snack bar? Uh huh. Uh huh. "  
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv?  
Another empty town fading to gray  
Another open home sign on the way  
Have a cup of coffee, have a nice day  
And as the train pushes off,  
We're headed for Babylon  
Oh no...  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train (echoes)  
Right track wrong train...  
On the wrong train on the right track  
We don't know if she'll ever come back  
(Talking) What train is this?  
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv?  
Have a cup of coffe, have a nice day (talking)  
"Yeah, yeah I'll be right there yeah. I'm gonna get the next train  
Yeah. "

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling  
When you hear  
Voices singing "Let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old fashioned way

All she ever wanted  
When the day turned indigo,  
Was to leave her grubby life behind her  
To the buzzing streets below  
  
Tainted passion and temptation  
Led her down a trail of lust  
Now the fate of Faye Delroy  
Is written in the dust  
Written in the dust  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh my rockin' chair  
Rock me tender in the night air  
Oh my rockin' chair  
Rock me back and make me be there  
  
She said her head don't move the same way  
That their hand usually does  
That she's got memory bubble  
Almost like the rest of us  
And ADD salamanders  
Cannot figure what to wear  
And they'll be standing in the closet  
And every dress is Savoir faire  
Every dress is Savoir faire  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Rock me here rock me there  
Rock me in my rockin' chair  
  
My oh my, rock me tender in the night air  
  
Za va ba, za ba bi ya. ca va pas? za ba bi ya  
Romeo Boys, they'll b dancing with the Cha Cha Girlz  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When I was eight I had a friend  
With a pirate smile  
Make believe and play pretend  
We were innocent and wild  
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate  
Running down my alleyway  
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly  
  
We loved to watch them dive and soar  
Circle in the sky  
Free as a bird from three to four  
And never knowing why  
Neighbors pulled their wash back in  
Put away my Barbie and Ken  
Look out overhead  
While Sally's pigeons fly  
  
I had a fool's confidence  
That the world had no boundaries  
But instincts and common sense  
Come in different quantities  
  
My heart began to  
Skip to the beat  
Of the boy next door  
She had her eye across the street  
On someone shy and tall  
We lived our dreams  
And challenged fate  
In tears she told me she was late  
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly...  
  
On the dresser sits a frame  
With a photograph  
Two little girls in ponytails  
Some twenty one years back  
She left one night with just a nod  
Was lost from some back alley job  
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly  
She never saw those birds again  
And me, I can't remember when  
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry  
I close my eyes  
And Sally's pigeons fly...

People slippin' in the rain  
I watch them get up again  
It makes me feel like I can too  
Hey hey ya  
  
Just when I get off the ground  
Your back tryin' to put me down  
Like some simpleton you can use  
Hey  
  
[Chorus]  
Well It's the same old fucking story  
With your two different sets of rules  
The same old fucking story  
One for me two for you  
It's the same old fucking story  
It's the same old fucking story all around yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyone's surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me you've been around  
Big fish in a big ol' town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah  
  
Still some glory in my eyes  
Much to everyone's surprise  
After everything you put me through  
Yeah well  
Friends tell me you've been around  
Big fish in a big ol' town  
Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's the same fucking story know damn well it's true  
Same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol'  
  
[Chorus]

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon...  
Under the scarlet moon...  
Say a prayer...  
  
So, what are you weaving there marionette  
Keepin' your balance by a single thread...  
Keepin' your heart strings tight and pure  
All you can muster and nothing more and nothing more  
Until you're sore and still you're sore when do you soar...  
Sometimes justice is the line you walk or sign,  
But justice is complex and a matter of time  
Sometimes it's hanging in the balance or  
Dancing in the shadow like a silhouette  
So what are you weaving there marionnette...  
So what are you weaving there marionnette...  
Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down  
Far too soon under the scarlet moon  
Say a prayer, go on say a prayer...  
  
Some people get a sadness so long  
They just go on thinking it's a natural thing  
Some people throw their hands in the sky  
And they wonder why god don't reply  
Well it's strange, strange time all our friends  
Dropping like flies everything that's come to pass  
All the time we thought would last.  
Well I'll just button my coat and cover my neck  
I got barely enough time to catch my breath...  
All these pictures I can't forget...  
It can fill your cup with regret...  
It can fill your cup with regret  
Say a prayer, for all the souls in bloom...  
Say a prayer...say a prayer...

Feel like I'm crawling on my belly  
Longing and glad...  
Excited at prospects,  
Humbled and mad  
Needy as a baby...  
I just need a helpin' hand...  
Hold me like a cradle  
With a touch you might understand...  
I'm searchin'...  
I'm searchin'...  
  
There I go jumping out of my skin.  
Wound a little right.  
Have to throw these covers down  
To get some sleep tonight.  
Tuck my heart in your pocket.  
My dreams are insecure.  
I could drink you to the marrow  
And still cry out for more  
'Cause I'm searching...  
I'm searching...  
And sometimes I feel like I'm just flying blind...  
And I can't help myself...  
And I can't stop myself...

You're my shining star  
More and more I think you've gone too far  
I thought I cried the nite you went away  
You're my shining star  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
Oh oh oh oh baby you're my shining star  
  
Over and over you string around my heart  
So what's your move cause I'm all a-fire  
Hey you! My shining star  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
Oh oh oh oh baby you're my shining star  
More and more and more you are (rock it)  
  
You broke my dreams, you broke my heart  
And now you're tearing us apart (somehow)  
  
And since that night you went away  
Love me, leave me baby let me know  
Don't build me up just let me go  
Don't cha know that you're messing with my heart?  
Goodnite

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Heavenly hosts from Heaven above  
Guardian angels sing Alleluia  
Christ our savior is born  
Christ our savior is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace

Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind.  
I heard the reflection of a sound echoing through my skin ...  
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on ...  
Through my wild heart ...  
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...Sisters Of Avalon...  
  
She is awakening in dark swells and mystery.  
Unbridled night mares powerful and running free.  
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees...  
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve, the Sisters of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...Sisters Of Avalon...  
  
They brought her in in a new white dress...  
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast...  
Now all that's left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor...  
  
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on ...  
Through my wild heart ...  
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon...  
Sisters Of Avalon...  
Come on sisters...come on sister...

Midnight falls on the snow-lit trees  
And as I stand inside I know that I  
Can't watch life through a window  
My indecision is blocking the door  
It's like a religion  
That I never ask for more  
I might stumble and fall  
  
What's someone like me,  
Doing in a life like this?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this  
Slipping back into the past  
  
Sun comes up and streams  
Through the blinds  
And as I throw my clothes on  
Do my hair wrong,  
Stare into my mirror  
Telling myself that everyone falls  
Take the first step  
That's the trick of it all  
Bounce back like a ball  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?...  
  
My mind is filled with  
Runaway dreams  
I can't wake up  
I don't know what it means  
You see I fell asleep  
With the television on  
When I woke up it was gone  
I read my horoscope  
To see what's in store  
I get a little lazy but  
I want more, I want more  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this...

Stay  
Just a little bit longer  
Please please please please please  
Tell me that you're going to  
  
Daddy don't mind, do you  
Mama don't mind, no  
If we have another dance  
Just one more time.  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
Just a little bit longer,  
Please let me hear  
You say that you will  
Say you will  
  
Won't you place your sweet lips  
To mine  
Won't you say you love me  
All of the time  
  
Come on stay,  
Just a little bit longer  
Please please please please please  
Tell me that you're going to  
Oh, come on stay, come on come on come on, stay  
Come on come on come on, stay  
Come on come on come on, stay

Friends they call me  
On the phone  
'cause I'm steady  
Talk about unhappy homes  
'cause I'm steady  
Though I don't like to let it show  
I got troubles of my own  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
Day to day is so unsure  
But I'm steady  
I watch people crash and soar  
But I'm steady  
The more they try  
So hard to change  
The more they stay the same  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
  
We're faced with so much  
Back and forth  
I don't need no ups and downs  
  
We push and pull  
And we fall apart  
I'm not gonna die  
Of a broken heart  
I just don't want to  
Stop and start  
'cause I'm steady  
I'm steady  
I'm steady

Close my eyes  
My mind looks for you everywhere  
You and I intertwined  
In everything we share  
  
You watch me  
Undercover, dirty lover  
1-900-anything  
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, 4  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
Staring out the blinds  
Like I'm in a picture frame  
Dancing out of time  
While you're whispering my name  
  
You've got me in the shutter  
You've got my number  
See the writing on the wall  
Makes me feel like 1984  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
It's just that sometimes  
I think I notice  
A certain change going by  
  
And if I...  
Before I know it, I turn a blind eye  
And I can't see clear anymore  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there  
  
Are you still with me now  
Do you still care  
Have I grown complacent, just  
Know you'll always be there  
Just know you'll always be there

Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Living is easy with eyes closed,  
Misunderstanding all you see.  
It's getting hard to be someone  
But it all works out,  
It doesn't matter much to me.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
No one I think is in my tree,  
I mean it must be high or low.  
That is you can't you know tune in  
But it's all right, that is  
I think it's not too bad.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Always, no sometimes, think it's me,  
But you know I know when it's a dream.  
I think I know I mean a 'Yes'  
But it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
Strawberry Fields forever.

I wanna run my fingers through your hair  
Squeeze your hand and tell you that I care  
Park in the dark and kiss goodnight  
Thrill me h-h-hold me tight  
C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
I'll fall still when you walk in the room  
I'll look up and you'll be lookin' c-c-cool  
Curled up smile upon your lips  
One button low my heart just flips  
C'mon pretty baby you could maybe take a chance with me  
The stars complete the melody  
Could you say you belong to me  
And as they ride the milkyway  
Baby, baby can I have this dance  
Baby, baby can you take a chance someday-  
Did I tell you now  
I wanna...

Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming  
Sometimes I think  
I don't know what I'll do  
But I forget the world  
And everything around me  
That's what I think  
When I think about you  
  
The streets are filled  
With too many babies  
Black air in a sky of blue  
People pass by  
No life in their eyes  
The concrete jungle's  
Really going crazy  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming...  
  
The rent is due  
And the pockets are empty  
People ask machines  
For the truth  
No crystal ball  
Can help see it all  
But where we gonna find  
The dreams to feed the babies  
  
Baby life goes on  
That's what people say  
But I'm nowhere  
If you go away  
I'd just be looking  
For a brighter day  
  
Sometimes I think  
Things are overwhelming...  
What can I do  
Forget about the world  
And everything around me  
That's what I think  
When I think about you

Out in the faraway nearby  
Can your hear my call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
I'm breaking down the walls  
Till you're here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Hot looks, cold words,  
Don't know what it is you heard  
But I didn't mean it,  
If I said something wrong  
Short nights, long dreams  
Something happens in between  
Then a weird feeling,  
Like you're here but still you're gone  
...Oo, heart beats  
Like a knock on the door  
But it sounds so faraway  
  
In the faraway nearby  
Can your hear me call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
I'm breaking down the walls  
Till you're here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Big whisper, small scream  
But it's not like what it seems  
Locked up in the open  
Don't know which way to go  
Deserts, oceans  
Leaving footprints in the sand  
Hoping that you'll see them  
And wishing you'd follow  
...And walk with me hand in hand, ya-ha  
And talk with me you got a plan, ah-ha  
And hold me, and hold me  
Don't stop...in the faraway nearby  
Can you here me call

Here we are  
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues  
Break the chain then we break down  
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it  
Unspoken expectations  
Ideals you used to play with  
They've finally taken shape for us.  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now you'll say  
You're startin' to feel the push and pull  
Of what could be and never can  
You mirror me stumblin' through those  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe you're out of place  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(good enough) for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good, it's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe you're out of place  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(good enough) for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good, it's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(scat)

Each time I look at you is like the first time  
Each time you're near me the thrill is new  
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for  
The rare delight of the sight of you for  
  
The more I see you, the more I want you  
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows  
With every sigh I become more mad about you  
More lost without you and so it goes  
  
Can you imagine how much I love you?  
The more I see you as years go by  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try  
  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Stone, the world is stone  
It's no trick of the light  
It's hard on the soul  
Stone, the world is stone  
Cold to the touch  
And hard on the soul  
In the gray of the streets  
In the neon unknown  
I look for a sign  
That I'm not on my own  
That I'm not here alone  
As the still of the night  
And the choke of the air  
And the winner's delight  
And the loser's despair  
Closes in left and right  
I would love not to care  
Stone, the world is stone  
from a faraway look  
Without stars in my eyes  
Through the halls of the rich  
And the flats of the poor  
Wherever I go  
There's no warmth anymore  
There's no love anymore  
So I turn on my heels  
I'm declining the fall  
I've had all I can take  
With my back to the wall  
Tell the world I'm not in  
I'm not taking the call  
Stone, the world is stone  
But I saw it once  
With the stars in my eyes  
When each color rang out  
In a thunderous chrome  
It's no trick of the light  
I can't find my way home  
In a world of stone

This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
  
Woke up to find myself  
Standing in another day  
Filled with anxiety  
I'm praying for a different way  
I give it all I have  
Till I have no more to give  
I used to think I'd die for love  
Now I'd rather live  
If everywhere you look, you find some misery  
The view from there can make you feel  
Just a little crazy  
  
This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain, but...  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain  
  
Stay walking through life  
Waiting for the other shoe to fall  
Dreams cut like a knife  
When you think you shouldn't dream at all  
I saw a dark cloud  
Looks like it follows us around  
It doesn't take that much, you know  
To make it tumble down  
How did we ever go from being so happy  
To suffer alone and be strong  
Just so we can keep on giving up  
  
This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain, but...  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain  
  
If everywhere you look, you find some misery  
The view from there can make you feel  
Just a little crazy  
  
This kind of love ain't right  
Won't take us through the night  
Some think love equals pain, but...  
This kind of love's not true  
Not good for me or you  
I think we got to get out of this rain

[Chorus]  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And what was on those ships all three  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
A little boy and our lady  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Oh they sailed to Bethlehem  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
Oh they sailed to Bethlehem  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Then let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
[Chorus]

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,  
And think of you  
Caught up in circles  
Confusion is nothing new  
Flashback, warm nights  
Almost left behind  
Suitcases of memories,  
Time after  
  
Sometimes you picture me  
I'm walking too far ahead  
You're calling to me, I can't hear  
What you've said  
Then you say, go slow  
I fall behind  
The second hand unwinds  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
After my picture fades and darkness has  
Turned to gray  
Watching through windows  
You're wondering if I'm okay  
Secrets stolen from deep inside  
The drum beats out of time  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting  
Time after time  
  
You said go slow  
I fall behind  
The second hand unwinds  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting  
Time after time  
  
If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting  
  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after time  
Time after  
Time

Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming 'round  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my
tears  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years
have gone by  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in
your eyes.  
Turn around, bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around, bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in
your arms  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and
cry  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look in you
eyes  
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong  
Together we can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turn around bright eyes, Turn around bright eyes  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way
that I am  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and
wonderous as you  
Turn around,  
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better, there's nothing I just
wouldn't do  
  
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart

You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
Its hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all  
And the darkness inside you  
Can make you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember  
When I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
You call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
(Can't remember when I last saw you laughing)  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
You call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
  
Your true colors  
True colors  
True colors  
Shining through  
  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow

I have carried all my hopes and dreams  
To this new land with my own two hands  
I have followed the sun away from ireland,  
Now like the red man, here I stand.  
  
You hear whispers of the homeland call,  
Love is less kind than the twilight.  
And the passion for me once in your green eyes,  
Like the sunlight fades from sight.  
  
Twilight eyes, I can taste the salty tears of goodbye.  
I can feel the cold north sea,  
You'll be sailing with the tide  
To the island in your emerald twilight eyes.

How long will I last  
Standing out here on my own  
I wonder, did I move too fast  
You know I hate slow dancing alone  
  
I keep leading with my heart  
You keep saying  
That we're worlds apart  
That our love is so taboo  
  
These empty arms  
Won't last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And I'll stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
Now, that's how I feel  
I'm gonna be your lucky star  
If you stop spinning your wheels  
And sending out these false alarms  
  
Why must love feel like a heart attack  
You held me once and  
You keep coming back  
Oh boy you haven't got a clue  
  
Oh these empty arms  
Won't last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And I'll stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated ...  
  
Love is unavoidable  
Love can put you back on track  
As a matter of fact  
Love makes you forget your troubles  
A love like that  
You don't throw back, no, no  
  
I keep leading with my heart  
You keep saying  
That we're worlds apart  
That our love is so taboo  
  
These empty arms  
Won't last too long  
Hope you appreciate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
And I'll stick like glue  
Can I anticipate  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
(to fade)  
Need ya yeah  
I wanna hold ya  
I wanna kiss ya  
I need your unabbreviated love  
  
I wanna hold ya  
I wanna squeeze ya yeah  
I need your unabbreviated love

Whoa! My love, my darling,  
I hunger for your touch,  
Alone. Lonely time.  
And time goes by, so slowly,  
And time can do so much,  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love.  
I need your love.  
God speed your love to me.  
  
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,  
To the open arms of the sea.  
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me,  
I'll be coming home, wait for me.  
  
Whoa! My love, my darling,  
I hunger, hunger!, for your love,  
For love. Lonely time.  
And time goes by, so slowly,  
And time can do so much,  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love.  
I need your love.  
God speed your love to me.

And I want to be everything  
You want me to  
But I'm not sure I know how  
I lose faith and I lose ground  
Then I see you and remember When I see you I remember  
Unconditional love, love, love  
Unconditional love  
  
It doesn't matter what I say  
'Cause it always seems you're taking  
Me the wrong way  
But if you could read my mind you'd see  
I fight myself all the time  
When I see you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love  
Unconditional love, love  
  
Standing on a wilder shore  
I got my head up in the clouds, oh  
I ain't got no sense of direction now  
  
I want to lie next to you I want to lie next to you  
And I want to do everything you want me to  
And I want to do everything you want me to  
Sometimes I wish at the sky But I'm not sure I know how  
I imagine what the clouds look like  
Put your arms around me now  
  
When I see you I remember  
When I feel you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love unconditional love ...  
Unconditional love  
Put your arms around me now  
When I see you I surrender  
When I feel you I surrender  
Unconditional love, love, love unconditional love ...  
Unconditional love, love, love  
When I see you I surrender...  
When I see you I remember  
Unconditional love...  
Unconditional love...  
  
All you need is  
What the world needs  
Now the word is love

Just when everything's in order and good, things fall apart  
Just when life should be resolving I'm back at the beginning,  
And it comes back to the heart ...  
I'm not really sad...I'm not running, I'm looking...  
Did I tell you I've saved all your letters and cards...  
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars...  
  
Do you remember when I told you all that I could and it seemed like too
much...  
Well I was living your life hoping you'd never fall...  
If I held on tight enough...  
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere...  
With time on my hands I can make a new start...  
I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars  
I just didn't want to stay here and unhook the stars  
  
Don't worry for me it's just I'm inspired  
Waiting in the wings made me drunk with possibility  
It rivals my memories...

Though you don't call anymore  
I sit and wait in vain  
I guess I'll rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I want to tell you baby  
The changes I've been going through  
Missing you, listen you  
  
'till you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
  
Why did you have to decide  
You had to set me free  
I'm gonna swallow my pride  
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me  
I'm gonna walk by myself  
Just to prove that my love is true  
Oh, for you baby  
  
'till you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do  
  
Living for you my dear  
Is like living in a world of constant fear  
In my plea, I've got to make you see  
That our love is dying  
  
Although your phone you ignore  
Somehow I must explain  
I'm gonna rap on your door  
Tap on your window pane  
I'm gonna camp on your step  
Until I get through to you  
I've got to change your view baby  
  
'till you come back to me  
That's what I'm gonna do

The lyrics as they performed it  
When I see the sign that points "one way".  
The lot we used to pass by every day.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
And as the rain beats down,  
Upon my weary eyes.  
For me it cries.  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart, upon the wall,  
Still find a way to haunt me,  
Though they're so small.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
These empty sidewalks on my block  
Are not the same.  
You're not to blame.

If you see me walking down the street  
And I start to cry each time we meet  
Walk on by, walk on by  
Make believe  
  
That you don't see the tears  
Just let me grieve  
In private 'cause each time I see you  
I break down and cry  
  
And walk on by (don't stop)  
And walk on by (don't stop)  
And walk on by  
I just can't get over losing you  
  
And so if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by, walk on by  
Foolish pride  
Is all that I have left  
  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye  
Walk on by  
  
And walk on by  
And walk by (don't stop)  
Walk on by, walk on by  
Foolish pride  
  
Is all that I have left  
So let me hide  
The tears and the sadness you gave me  
When you said goodbye  
  
Walk on by (don't stop)  
And walk on by (don't stop)  
And walk by (don't stop)

I went to the water's edge, forgot I couldn't swim  
I went to the water's edge, all ready to jump in  
I saw the water shimmer  
I heard the wind howl  
I saw my own reflection  
I just can't see it now  
  
You say it's the way of the world  
To somehow co-exists  
That eventually life unfurls  
A path to happiness  
  
So I whisper your little secret  
And repeat it under my breath  
I'll save it for you in my heart  
In case we both forget  
  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I'd be released in your tenderness  
I'd be released in your tenderness  
  
I went to the water's edge and saw my life eclipse  
I went to the water's edge and then felt myself slip  
I dreamed that I was floating, just coast until I grew fins  
I want to catch this tide back home and feel you again  
  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I'd be released in your tenderness  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I'd be released in your tenderness  
I'd be released in your tenderness  
I'd be released in your tenderness

Mother, mother  
There's too many of you crying  
Brother, brother, brother  
There's far too many of you dying  
You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here today, yea  
  
Father, father  
We don't need to escalate  
You see, war is not the answer  
For only love can conquer hate  
You know we've got to find a way  
To bring some lovin' here today  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Don't punish me with brutality  
Talk to me, so you can see  
Oh, what's going on  
What's going on  
Ya, what's going on  
Ah, what's going on  
  
In the mean time  
Right on, baby  
Right on  
Right on  
  
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong  
Oh, but who are they to judge us  
Simply because our hair is long  
Oh, you know we've got to find a way  
To bring some understanding here today  
Oh  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Don't punish me with brutality  
Talk to me  
So you can see  
What's going on  
Ya, what's going on  
Tell me what's going on  
I'll tell you what's going on - Uh  
Right on baby  
Right on baby

When you were mine  
I gave you all of my money  
Time after time  
You done me wrong  
Just like a train  
Let all my friends come over and eat  
You were so strange  
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets  
Oh when you were mine  
I use to let you wear all my clothes  
You were so fine  
Maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so  
  
I know, that you're goin' with another guy  
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie  
I love you more mine than I did when you were mine  
  
When you were mine  
You were kindasorta my best friend  
So I was blind  
I let you fool around  
I never cared  
I never was the kind to make a fuss  
When he was there  
Sleepin' in between the two of us  
  
I know, that you're goin with another guy  
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie  
I love you more than I did when you were mine  
  
When you were mine  
You were all I ever wanted to do  
Now I spend my time  
Following him whenever he's with you  
I know that you're goin' with another guy  
I don't care because I love you baby that's no lie, ah  
I love you more than I did when you were mine  
  
Ah I love you more than I did when you were mine  
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more than I did when you were mine  
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more, I love you more when you were mine  
Ah ah oh oh oh I love you more, I love your more, I love you more, I love you
more  
  
I love you more than when you were mine  
  
Ah oh oh

Things like this  
Can always take a little time  
I always thought  
We'd be together down the line  
We start to fight  
And can't get over what was said  
'Cause you see black and white  
And I see red  
  
And I wonder who let in the rain  
You know without you  
I'm not the same  
When love gets strong  
People get weak  
Sometimes they lose control  
And wind up in too deep  
They fall like rain  
Who let in the rain  
  
I make the bed and cover  
Where you used to sleep  
I'm smoothing over promises  
Made in these sheets  
I envy lovers passing by  
Out on the street  
'Cause what they have  
I couldn't keep  
  
And I wonder who let in the rain  
You know without you  
I'm not the same  
When love gets strong  
People gets weak  
Sometimes they lose control  
And wind up in too deep  
They fall like rain  
Who let in the rain...

I used to stand in my doorstep  
I used to dance in the rain  
I used to cast out wishes  
That never came back again  
I used to sit in my garden  
With pretty maids in a row  
Silver bells and cockle shells  
Waiting to see where we're goin'  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything  
  
Same old scenery  
Made me real confused  
Tired of the same old feeling  
Of being lost and used  
I follow lonely footprints  
To see where they would lead  
Dreaming that they would take me  
Where I want to be  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything  
  
An air of confidence  
Is now in my stride  
I swing my shoulders gently  
My hips from side to side  
Now I live in the moment  
Where there are no regrets  
Now I keep my head up  
With nothing to forget  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything

Another yaer's gone by  
Since we said goodbye  
And I can hardly wait to have you come again  
I've been living by the phone  
I keep your letters in my pillow case  
So I can hold you close pretend I am with you  
  
Everyday is pale and empty  
When you're not here with me  
I got your memory burnt into my brain  
I count the lonely nights until you touch me again  
My heart is pounding like an oncoming train  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know it's driving me mad  
And I can't hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To here the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
  
I need to steal your time  
Play it over in my mind  
Hide your clothes behind the firelight  
Wrap me up inside your arms  
And every kiss will melt my lips apart  
Till the minutes stop and swallow up my heart  
  
When you go back to your world  
Does your head skip to me  
My head is swirling snow on my window pane  
I count the lonely nights until you mm... Me again  
I love you just the way a moth loves her flame  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know it's driving me mad...  
And I can't hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To hear the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
  
.. Another day, another night  
I wish I may I wish I might  
The first star that I see tonight  
.. Another day, another night  
The broken watch that's on my counter  
Makes me think I'm lost without ya  
.. Another day, another night...  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know it's driving me mad...  
And I can't hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To hear the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue

Through the burning sun  
And the driving rain  
Over the sea  
Across the plain  
I'll ask you once  
I'll ask you again  
Won't you be my love  
Won't you be my friend  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
The lights are low  
The hour is late  
Don't you want me baby  
Through your garden gate  
Don't you feel it coming  
And it feels so strong  
I will never ever  
Ever do you wrong  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Now the mountain is high  
The river is deep  
We always knew  
We hold the key  
Roses red  
Violets blue  
Love you baby  
Till I'm dead  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't know where you belong  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Relying on rhetoric...  
Not well versed on topics...  
Any idea what you're talking about?  
Revisions of history  
Fair well in some company  
But don't shove that bullshit down my throat  
  
You don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
To find something to swear to...  
Till you don't know what's right from wrong  
You just need to belong somehow.  
  
Left suppresses right  
Right suppresses left  
So what's the left, and what's right?  
You're told what to wear,  
You're told what to like  
I'd be nice if you'd think for yourself sometime,  
But you don't.  
  
Now you don't know where you belong...  
You should be more careful  
As you follow blindly along...  
  
Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity  
You'll play it safe every time  
So life turns up empty  
And you're so dissatisfied  
Who are you blaming this time?  
Don't you know?

We sleep together, close and warm  
We calm each other through the storm  
We set up home, but in a while  
We're tempted by another's smile  
When it's all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We dance around the fading light  
You hold me closer every night  
You fell in love but I did not  
But in the end you're all I've got  
When it's all played out  
When the truth is known  
You have to learn to live alone  
We fly around the world too fast  
We cannot make one moment last  
We love the crowd, we sing and play  
We do it all, we get our way  
When it's all played out  
When the bird has flown  
You have to learn to live alone  
When we're all played out  
If the truth were known  
You have to learn to live alone  

Sweet wonderful you  
You make me happy with the things you do  
Oh, can it be so  
This feeling follows me wherever I go  
I never did believe in miracles  
But I've a feeling it's time to try  
I never did believe in the ways of magic  
But I'm beginning to wonder why  
Don't, don't break the spell,  
It would be different and you know it will  
You, you make loving fun  
I don't have to tell you you're the only one  
You make loving fun  
It's all I wanna do

I don't like you  
But I love you  
Seems like I'm always thinking of you  
Oh, oh, oh,  
You treat me badly  
I love you madly  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me  
  
I don't want you,  
But I need you  
Don't wanna kiss you  
But I need you  
Oh, oh, oh  
You do me wrong now  
My love is strong now  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me  
  
Don't wanna leave you  
don't wanna stay here  
Don't wanna spend another day here  
Oh, I just don't fit now  
I just can quit now  
You've really got a hold on me  
You've really got a hold on me, baby  
  
I love you and all that I want you to do  
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
