Flirting with disaster  
You're the one I'm after  
Think I found my destiny  
Luxury and danger  
Rapture me my stranger  
Hold me close, don't let me be  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-Love  
  
Crezy, hazy feeling  
You're the thief I'm stealing  
Locked you up and lost the key  
Flying on the wings,  
Flying on the wings,  
Flying on the wings of my heart  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-Love  
  
Need your touch, it's what I'm after  
Fatal kiss, your embrace  
You got me baby, You've got me baby  
Fatal kiss, your embrace  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell,  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-love  
L-L-Love, L-L-Love, L-L-Love...

You've got a great car  
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?  
I used to have one too  
Maybe you'll come and have a look  
I really like your hairdo, yea  
I'm glad you like mine too  
I see we're looking pretty cool, get chya  
So what do you do?  
Oh, yea I waiting tables too?  
No I haven't heard your band  
Because you guys are pretty new  
But if you dig, on vegan food  
Come over to my work  
I'll have them cook you something that you'll really love  
Cuz I like you  
Yeah I like you  
And I feeling some Bohemian like you  
(Yea I like you, and I feel some bohemian like you  
Woo hoo oooh)  
  
Wait.  
  
Who's that guy, just hangin at your pad?  
He's looking kinda sad  
Oh, you broke up?  
That's too bad  
But I guess it's fair  
If he always pays the rent  
And he doesn't get all bent  
About sleeping on the couch when I'm there  
Cuz I like you  
Yeah I like you  
And I'm feeling so bohemian  
I feel so bohemian like you  
And I want you  
Please  
Just a casual thing  
Cuz I like you I like you I like you  
Whoo-hoo-ooo
