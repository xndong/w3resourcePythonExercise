All my life  
Without a doubt I give you, all my life  
Now and forever  
Till the day I die,  
You and I will share...  
  
All the things  
This changing world can offer so I sing  
I'd be happy just to stay this way  
Spend each day with you  
  
There was a time  
When I just thought that I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
Trying to find my way.  
  
I do recall  
Every moment spent was wasted time  
But then I chose to lay it on the line  
Put the past away, put the past away, put the past away  
  
Instrumental  
  
All my life  
I will carry you through all my life  
Between each hour of the passing days  
I will stay with you  
  
There was a time  
When I just thought that I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
Started out my way  
  
I do recall  
Every moment spent was wasted time  
But then I chose to lay it on the line  
I want this all my life, I want this all my life, I want this all my life, I
want this all my life, I want this all life,  
I've wanted this all my life...

Girl you are to me  
All that a woman should be  
And I dedicate my life to you always  
  
A love like yours is rare  
It must have been sent from up above  
And I know you'll stay this way for always  
And we both know  
That our love will grow  
And forever, it will be  
You and me  
  
Ooh, you're like the sun  
Chasing all of the rain away  
When you come around  
You bring brighter days  
  
You're the perfect one  
For me and forever will be  
And I will love you so for always  
  
Come with me my sweet  
Let's go make a family  
And they will bring us joy for always  
  
Ooh, you're like the sun  
Chasing all of the rain away  
When you come around  
You bring brighter days  
You are perfect  
For me and you forever will be  
And I will love you so for always

In a world  
When nothing seems to matter no more  
When everybody is out  
To get a little more and more  
There you are  
Shining like a star  
Every minute of the day  
(Showing us the way)  
And all that one has got to do  
Is call your name and know  
That what you were before  
You are today will be tomorrow  
Coz you have a soul desire  
(To) Share this love with everyone  
So when you're down and out and lonely  
If you need some lovin'  
He's got a lot to show  
No he'll never leave  
You just got to believe  
Don't you go believin' the devil  
He takes pleasure in his lies  
Jesus is the giver of life  
And He'll just take you as you are  
No need to be a hero or a superstar  
All your needs are known  
He'll make you know (it)  
That He is provider  
And He'll just take you as you are  
Don't you know that He can mend your broken heart  
No matter where where you've gone  
Or what you've done  
No, it doesn't matter  
('Coz He'll just take you as you are)  
You walk around  
You show the world that all is alright  
Yet not a word is heard about the truth (You're losing the fight)  
Day by day  
Taking come what may  
Give it in to just 'bout anything and everything and everything  
Suddenly things zip from bad to worst  
And now you find  
You need direction  
You need a hand, the loving kind  
(But) He's got a soul desire  
(To) Share this love with everyone  
So when you gotta get it goin'  
He will hear you calling  
Eager to make you know  
That He'll never leave  
You just got to believe  
To the soul of every believer  
He takes pleasure in your life  
Jesus is the way, the truth and life-a

No words are left now to be spoken  
When all my promises are broken  
And all excuses I have used in justifying  
My actions move me so much closer to the fire  
But now I know  
Seems I've lost my soul  
  
Make me and take me  
Can you find me in this world  
I've chosen and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if there's no other way  
To make me whole  
Go ahead and break me  
Then remake me  
Hold it on I won't give up  
Coz I know you wont give up  
On me  
  
Grow weary of my ways pretending  
Showing I'm okay when I am hurting  
But now I know  
Time to find my soul  
  
Make me and take me  
Can you find me in this world  
I've chosen and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if there's no other way  
To make me whole  
  
I've been too proud  
And now I don't know where to go  
And like the son who came back home  
I'm giving you my life  
My mind, my heart, my soul  
I'm trusting you enough to break me  
Then to make me whole  
  
Can you find me in this world  
I've lost and never let me go  
Hold me and mold me  
And if there's no other way  
To make me whole  
Go ahead and break, break me  
Gently remake me  
Hold it on I won't give up  
Coz I know you won't give up  
You're never givin up on me  
  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
You're never givin up on one like me

Fancy meeting you alone in the crowd  
Couldn't help but notice your smile  
While everybody else around us is going about  
Can we just stop and talk awhile?  
  
I've been often told our world's growing old  
And that friends are harder to find  
Do tell me more about yourself  
We could share a thought or two  
Now who would mind?  
  
Maybe then we could go for a ride  
Drive down to the countryside  
Get away from the gray  
And frenzied hurly-burly of the city life  
  
Early yet to say what lies ahead  
It's the first day of the rest of our lives  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile

Minsan sabi niya sa akin  
Sandali na lang  
Akala ko naman ay sigurado na ako  
Handa kong tanggapin ang kanyang oo  
Bigla na lang nagbago ang isip niya  
Hindi ko akalain na gano'n pala siya  
Pinaasa niya lang ako  
Bitin na bitin ako  
Oooh woh  
Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ako pa ba kaya ang nasa puso niya  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ngunit mahal ko siya  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Ngayon araw-araw lumilipas ang panahon  
Kalimutan ko siya'y malayo sa isip ko  
Di kaya, pinaikot niya lang ako  
Bigla na naman nagbago ang isip niya  
Pagkakataon ko na mapasagot ko siya  
Pag ang sinabi ko'y di mabili  
Baka mapahiya muli...  
Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ako pa ba kaya ang nasa puso niya  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ngunit mahal ko siya  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Bakit ka naman ganyan  
Ano pa ba kayang paraan  
Pero kung kailangan mo naman ako  
Agad akong tumatakbo  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Bitin na bitin ako  
Oh...oh...oh  
Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ako pa ba kaya ang nasa puso niya  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ngunit mahal ko siya  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Hindi ko na alam kung makakaya ko pa  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ako pa ba kaya ang nasa puso niya  
Di bale na lang kaya  
Ngunit mahal ko siya  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang  
Di bale na lang...  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooooh.....

Nand'yan ka na naman  
Tinutukso-tukso ang aking puso  
Ilang ulit na bang  
Iniiwasan ka di na natuto  
Sulyap ng 'yong mata  
Laging nadarama kahit malayo, ooh  
Nahihirapan na  
Lalapit-lapit pa di na natuto  
Isang ngiti mo lang  
At ako'y napapaamo  
Yakapin mong minsan  
At muling magbabalik sa'yo  
Na walang kalaban-laban  
Ang puso ko'y tanging iyo lamang  
Ooh...  
O eto na naman  
Laging nananabik ang aking puso,  
Ooh...  
Muling bumabalik  
Sa 'yong mga halik  
Di na natuto  
Refrain:  
Isang ngiti mo lang  
At ako'y napapaamo (woh...)  
Yakapin mong minsan  
Ay muling magbabalik sa'yo  
Na walang kalaban-laban  
Ang puso ko'y tanging iyo lamang  
Refrain:  
Isang ngiti mo lang  
At ako'y napapaamo (woh...)  
Yakapin mong minsan  
Ay muling magbabalik sa'yo  
Na walang kalaban-laban  
Ang puso ko'y tanging iyo lamang  
Ang puso ko'y tanging iyo lamang

[Intro]  
Bakit ba mapaglaro ang buhay  
Problema kuwarata't babae at kung anu-ano pa  
Di naman ito maiiwasan  
Bakit ba nagkaganto, ako  
Ngayo'y litung-lito  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Nawawala bumabalik eto nanaman  
Bigla na lang (tumatapik)  
Dumadating eto nanaman (who)  
  
Paulit ulit lang ang pangyayari  
Wala na akong ibang hiling  
Kundi ang swerting hindi dumadating  
Ngunit kung pagiisipang tunay  
Wala ka namang magagawa  
Ganyan, talaga bahala na who...  
  
(Repeat the chorus 2x)

Paikot ikot ang buhay  
Minsan ay hindi masakyan ang kulay  
Hayaan mona tanggapin mo na lang kaya

Bigla na lang tumatapik ha!

Why do hearts feel the way they do  
Why does men wanna say that I love you  
Till the end of time  
Till I lose my mind  
Till it's over and left so far behind  
  
I just can't keep it all inside  
So unbelievable how much I've tried  
Yet I call for you  
I long for you  
And I say the words I wish you'd want to here  
Though you're never here  
  
Chorus:  
Our heats and though they beat as one  
But in time, the time for us will never come  
So I, I just go on  
And just remember those eyes  
That look right through my heat  
The smile that shows what's in you  
That makes me wanna cry  
Coz I know  
I'll never have you even for a while  
  
Now all is said and done it seems  
I keep remembering what I would call a dream  
Where you came true  
For a minute or two  
That was all the time it took  
To make me know you had to go  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Cause I know  
I'll never have you...  
And I know  
I'll never have you  
Even for a while...

If you let me I will be your shelter  
I will be your strngth and shield  
As you battle in the field alone  
There are moments when I sit  
And look into this heart that now  
You've made your home  
Never really understanding  
All that you have done  
To change this heart  
To flesh from stone  
It's at these moments when I feel  
I'd rather go my way  
That I hear your spirit say  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days  
'Til we meet face to face  
Day by day I seem to fear the fight  
As I do battle with these thoughts in my head  
Thinking of what it would be like for  
Just today to do all that  
I've often felt  
Only one could love somebody  
With a heart so cold  
So lost just like my own  
(But you keep on sayin')  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days  
'Til we meet face to face  
Sometimes I feel you should just give up on me  
'Coz I keep pushin' you to the limit  
But you never ever let me go  
And with that still small voice  
I hear you say to me  
Come home  
Come home  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days

Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful?  
Isn't she precious, less than one minute old,  
I never thought through love you'll be  
Making love as lovely as she.  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she pretty she's so pretty, truly the angel best,  
For I am so happy I'm so happy, we have been heaven blest,  
I can't believe what God has done,  
To you, He has given life to one,  
Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love.  
Isn't she lovely she's so lovely, life and love are the same.  
Life is Aida Aida, the meaning of her name.  
Candies good have not been done.  
Without you she'll be the one.  
Oh so very lovely, isn't she pretty? Isn't she pretty?  
Isn't she lovely, yes, she is made from love.

Lead me Lord  
Lead me by the hand  
And help me face the rising sun  
Comfort through all the pain  
That life may bring  
  
There's no other hope  
That I can lean upon  
Lead me Lord,  
Lead me all my live  
  
Walk by me Walk by me  
Across the lonely roads that I may face  
Take my arms and let your hand  
Show me the way  
  
Show the way to live inside your heart  
All my days,  
All my life  
  
You are my light  
You're the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time, my Lord I need you there  
You are my light  
I can not live alone  
Let me stay, by your guiding love  
All through my live  
Lead me Lord  
  
Lead me Lord,  
Eventhough at times  
I'd rather go along my way  
Help me take the right direction  
  
Take your road  
Lead me lord  
And never leave my side  
All my days, all my life  
  
You are my light  
You're the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time, my lord I need you there  
You are my light  
I can not live alone  
Let me stay, by your guiding love  
All through my life  
  
You are my light  
You're the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time, my lord I need you there  
You are my light  
  
I just cannot live alone  
Let me stay by your guiding light  
All through my life  
All through my days  
  
Lead me O, Lord

Je t'aime te amo  
Ya tyibya I yublu  
Ani ohevet othka  
I love you  
The sounds are all as different  
As the lands from which they came  
And though our words are all unique  
Our hearts are still the same  
Chorus:  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here  
We teach the young our differences  
Yet look how we're the same  
We learn to laugh, to dream our dreams  
We know the sting of pain  
From Leningrad to Lexington  
The farmer loves his land  
And daddies get all misty eyed  
When they give their daughters' hands  
And maybe now we realize  
How much there is to share  
We have too much in common  
To pretend it isn't there  
Chorus:  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here  
Bridge:  
Though the rhetoric of governments  
May keep us worlds apart  
There's no misinterpreting  
The language of the heart  
Chorus:  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here

Name your price  
Ticket to paradise  
I can't stay here anymore  
And I've looked high and low  
I've been from shore to shore  
If there's a shortcut, I'd have found it  
But there's no easy way around it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Light of the world, shine on me  
Love is the answer  
Shine on us all, set us free  
Love is the answer  
  
Who knows why  
Someday we all must die  
We are hopeless boys and girls  
And we are never heard  
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world  
People turn their heads and walk on by  
Tell me is it worth just another try  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell me, are we alive  
Or just a dyin' planet  
(What are the chances?)  
Ask the man in your heart  
For the answer  
  
And when you feel the pain (love one another)  
And when you've lost your way (love one another)  
And when you're all alone (love one another)  
And when you're far from home (love one another)  
And when you're down and out (love one another)  
And when your hopes run out (love one another)  
And when you need a friend (love one another)  
And when you're near the end (love, we've got to love)

I keep coming back to Manila  
Simply no place like Manila  
Manila, I'm coming home  
  
I walked the streets of San Francisco  
I've tried the rides in Disneyland  
Dated a million girls in Sydney  
Somehow I feel like I don't belong  
  
Hinahanap hanap kita Manila  
Ang ingay mong kay sarap sa tenga  
Mga jeepney mong nagliliparan  
Mga babae mong naggagandahan  
Take me back in your arms Manila  
And promise me you'll never let go  
Promise me you'll never let go  
  
Manila, Manila  
Miss you like hell, Manila  
No place in the world like Manila  
I'm coming here to stay

There's something about the rain when it pours  
It gets me thinkin' of you more and more  
There's something about the way you are  
That takes this empty feeling oh so far  
Now I know can't deny what I am feeling  
Can I hold you, can I have you a little longer  
Can I know you, through my eyes let me tell you  
I'm loving you more and more  
There's something about the warmth of your touch  
That came for a moment yet told me so much  
I wish I didn't have to waste all that time  
When I made believe that you are mine  
Now I know can't deny that I am falling  
Coz I love you, wanna have you by me forever (and ever)  
Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you  
(I'm lovin' you more)  
If you knew what I've been going through  
Would you feel the same way too  
Tell me now what more can I do to get to  
Know you and open up your heart  
Show me where to start  
Coz I'm loving you more and more  
More and more...  
Now I know can't deny that I am falling  
(Coz I love you) You should know  
I'm lovin' you so  
Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)  
Can I hold you, through my eyes let me tell you  
I'm lovin' you more and more  
(Can I know you) You should know  
I'm lovin' you so  
Wanna have you by me forever (and ever)  
(Can I hold you) I wanna hold you  
Through my eyes let me tell you  
I'm loving you more and more...

Girl:  
He promised us that He would be counselor  
A mighty God and the Prince of Peace  
He promised us that He would be a Father  
And He would love us with a love that would not cease  
Boy:  
Well I tried Him and I found His promises are true  
He's everything He said that he would be  
The finest words I know could not begin to tell  
Just what Jesus really means to me  
Refrain:  
Duet:  
For He's more wonderful than my mind can conceive  
He's more wonderful than my heart can believe  
He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams  
He's everything that my soul ever longed for  
Everything He'd promised and so much more  
More than amazing  
More than marvelous  
More than miraculous could ever be  
He's more than wonderful  
That's what Jesus is to me  
Coda:  
Boy:  
I stand amazed when I think that the King of Glory  
Would come to "live" within the heart of man  
Girl:  
Oh, I marvel just to know He really loves me  
When I think of who He is and who I am  
Refrain:

What if I never knew  
What if I never found you  
I'd never had this feeling  
In my heart  
How did this come to be  
I don't know how you found me  
But from the moment I saw you  
Deep inside my heart  
I knew  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
I wanted someone like you  
Someone that I could hold onto  
And give my love  
Until the end of time  
But forever was just a word  
Something I'd only heard about  
But now you're always there for me  
When you say forever  
I'll believe  
Baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
With all my heart and soul  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  
Maybe all we need  
Is just a little faith.  
Cause baby, I believe  
That love will find a way.  
Hey..  
Oh baby, you're my destiny  
You and I were meant to be  
I give my love to have and hold  
And as far as I can see  
You were always meant to be  
My destiny  

Only I, no one else but only I  
No one else but only I  
Nobody else but I can call her mine  
Only I, no one else but only I  
Some people call her an angel  
The answer to my prayers  
She's all this heart of mine desires and knows  
They say she's deep as a river  
And gracious as the morn  
Some people say  
She's as lovely as a rose  
They call her gentle  
They call her warm and kind  
But only I, only I can call her mine...  
Some people say she's a candle  
Glowing in the dark  
They say she's the wind  
That blows the clouds away  
They say that she's like the sunshine  
Through the pouring rain  
Her smile can brighten up anybody's day  
They call her radiant  
They call her bright  
They call her a star that shiness  
But only I, only I can call her mine  
Only I have her heart  
And only she has mine  
Who'd have ever thought  
A man like me could be  
The one to say  
She's with me all the way  
The one to say  
She loves only me (only me)  
Some people says she's the best thing  
To ever come my way  
They say she's a blessing  
The best in my life  
They say she's a jewel  
So rare, so hard to find  
They call her a wonder  
They call her one of a kind  
They call her precious  
They call her dear  
They call her divine  
But only I, only I can call her...  
The one that I'll love forever  
Only I, only I can call her mine  
(Only I, no one else but only I)  
(No one else but only I)  
(Only I, No one else but only I)  
Only I, can call her mine

Yakap, yakap ko siya  
Dahil luha'y dagling dadaloy  
Ngunit paano ko sasabihin ito.  
Puso'y tiyak na masusugatan  
Kaya ba niyang maunawaan  
Paano ko sasabihin ito  
  
Chorus:  
Ayaw ko mang saktan  
Ang kanyang damdamin  
Ngunit kailangan malaman  
Puso'y kumakaba  
Sana'y matapos na  
Di' makapag-umpisa.  
Ngunit kahit nais  
Ko man pilitin  
'Di na kayang ibigin  
Paano ipadarama  
Sa 'yo sinta na  
Puso'y ari na ng iba  
Wohh-wohh-wohh  
Wohh-wohh-wohhhh  
  
Labis, laging nagdaramdam  
Bakit sa'kin pa manggagaling  
Paano ko sasabihin ito  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
Hahhhh  
Hahhhh  
Pa'no, pa'no ko sasabihin  
Pa'no, ko sasabihin  
Pa'no... Woohhh  
Puso'y tiyak na masusugatan  
Kaya ba niyang maunawaan  
Oohh, nais mang pilitin  
Di na kayang ibigin  
Pa'no ko sasabihin..  
Hhoohhh...

Pasko na sinta ko hanap-hanap kita  
Bakit magtatampo't nilisan ako  
  
Kung mawawala ka sa piling ko sinta  
Paano ang Pasko, inulila mo  
  
Sayang sinta ang sinumpaan  
At pagtitinginang tunay  
Nais mo bang kalimutang ganap  
Ang ating suyuan at galak  
  
Kung mawawala ka sa piling ko sinta  
Paano ang Paskong alay ko sa'yo  
  
Sayang sinta ang sinumpaan  
At pagtitinginang tunay  
Nais mo bang kalimutang ganap  
Ang ating suyuan at galak  
  
Kung mawawala ka sa piling ko sinta  
Paano ang paskong alay ko sa'yo

Everyday they pass me by  
I can see it in their eyes  
Empty people filled with care  
Headed who knows where  
On they go through private pair  
Living fear to fear  
Laughter hides their silent cries  
Only Jesus hears  
Chorus:  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
At the end of broken dreams  
He's the open door  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
When will they realize  
People need the Lord  
We are called to take His light  
To a world where wrong seems right  
What could be too great a cost for  
Sharing life with one who's lost  
Through His love our hearts can feel  
All the grief they bear  
They must hear the words of life  
Only we can share  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
At the end of broken dreams  
He's the open door  
People need the Lord  
When will they realize  
That we must give our lives  
For people need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord

I.  
What must I do to make you understand?  
You mean everything to me  
Don't have the strength to say  
Give this heart of mine a chance  
And maybe then you will see  
  
Refrain 1:  
And I'll do anything, do anything that you tell me  
And I'll be there, I'll be there if you need me  
  
Chorus 1:  
Reachin' out to you  
Do you feel it too?  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure  
I've never felt this way before  
When I smile you know that there is something more  
  
Ii.  
What must I do so I can make you see?  
The light that shines in my eyes  
You brighten up my day  
You even help me find my way  
I wish you're always by my side  
  
Refrain 2:  
And I can't stop, don't know how to stop thinkin' of you  
And I'll do anything, do anything to be near, near you  
  
Chorus 2:  
Reachin' out to you  
Do you feel it too?  
Loving you is all I wanna do  
I'm completely sure  
I've never felt this way before  
Deep inside you know that there is something more  
  
Repeat chorus 2  
  
Deep inside you know that there is something more

Sana maulit muli  
Ang mga oras nating nakaraan  
Bakit nagkaganito  
Naglaho na ba ang pag-ibig mo?  
Sana'why maulit muli  
Sana bigyan pansin ang himig ko  
Kahapon, bukas, ngayon  
Tanging wala ng ibang mahal  
  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
'Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
'Di na sana lalapit pa  
Kung kaya ko sana  
  
Ibalik ang kahapon  
Sandaling 'di mapapantayan  
Huwag sana nating itapon  
Pagmamahal na tapat  
  
Kung ako'why nagkamali minsan  
'Di na ba mapagbibigyan  
O giliw, dinggin mo ang nais ko, oooh...  
  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
'Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
'Di na sana lalapit pa  
Kung kaya ko sana  
  
Ito ang tanging nais ko  
Ang ating kahapon sana maulit muli  
  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
'Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
'Di na sana lalapit pa  
Mahal pa rin kita  
O giliw, o giliw ko, oooh...

I stop and think for just a while  
Wondering if He'd see me  
Would He think that I'm worthwhile?  
'Cause now I feel so far away  
But I believe, yes I believe  
  
His eyes I know they watch me close  
My every move He knows before it's even done  
And even though I may be wrong  
He changes me and cleanses me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I know how much I've hurt You so  
By doing things I know would go against Your heart  
But now I've come to see myself  
With You in me so patiently  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me in the Way Everlasting  
  
I have never left you on your own, My Precious One  
Hold on, the time is near I'm coming soon  
To take You home with Me  
  
Oh God search and know my heart  
Longing to be near You, I've tried but can't get past the start  
Oh God won't You show me how?  
Lay Your hands upon me and lead me [lead me] oh lead me [lead me] lead me
there...  
  
[Oh God search and know]  
Search and know

Kapwa lumuluha kapwa nasasaktan  
Bakit tinitikis parin ang isa't isa  
Lagi na lamang bang ganito ang buhay natin  
Di na matitiis paghihirap ng dibdib  
Sanay nadarama mo rin ang paghihirap ko  
At sana'y pakinggan ang pakiusap ko sa'yo  
Hindi ko na hinahangad ang yaman sa mundo  
Pagmamahal mo lang ang tanging hinahanap ko  
Maaari bang sana'y patawarin mo ako  
Pagkat tayong dalawa ay sa isa't isa  
  
Di na matitiis paghihirap ng dibdib  
Sana'y nadarama mo rin ang paghihirap ko  
At sana'y pakinggan ang pakiusap ko sayo  
  
Hindi ko na hinahangad ang yaman sa mundo  
Pagmamahal mo lang ang tanging hinahanap ko  
Maaari bang sana'y patawarin mo ako  
  
Pagkat tayong dalawa ay sa isa't isa  
  
Pagmamahal mo lang ang tanging hinahanap ko  
Maaari bang sanay patawarin mo ako  
Pagkat tayong dalawa ay sa isa't isa

Everyday is the same  
Same sorrow and pain  
We laugh and we cry  
We are low and then we get high  
And then we look, and we search  
And we seek to put the pieces  
Of the puzzle together  
Doing our best to keep it all together  
Going 'bout our business  
Seldom thinking of one another  
Hey that's not the only way  
That's the way of the world  
  
Ooh...Yeah...  
(That's the way of the Word)  
(That's the way of the Word)  
  
Has there ever been a time  
When in your mind  
You just felt like giving up  
Wanting to surrender  
You've been tryin' to find your way  
Hopin' that tomorrow would be better  
Much better than today  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home  
If you look in the right place  
You won't be lost out in the storm  
There is a way, the only way  
It will see you through today and tomorrow  
Just believe it in your heart  
  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard about it  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard  
(That's the way of the Word  
Ooh...  
If you believe  
And see with your heart  
And then you will know  
  
Yeah...yeah...ooh...ooh  
  
It's the way of the Word  
You better believe it son  
They say it's the year 2000  
Judgment day will come  
The grand finale, comin' to take you over  
It's the King Almighty, please...  
Forgive us of our sins  
  
Bless us with all your heart  
  
And give me wisdom so I can preach  
All your words to every man, woman  
And child walkin' on the streets  
I ain't got no beef with all ya wanna be  
Ambitious scheming minds  
Read the Bible I suggest and you shall find  
  
Who knows what may happen tomorrow  
Don't fear if you know who you follow  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Never will He leave you alone  
In your heart is where He'll make His home  
Takes away your tears and your sorrows  
Who knows what tomorrow may bring  
Fear not if you follow the King  
He takes away your tears and your sorrows  
  
Keeping it high  
Clapping my hands, look in my eye  
Am I telling a lie? No, Let's keep it real  
  
We've come together on this special day  
To sing our message loud and clear  
Looking back we've touched on sorrowful days  
Future pass, they disappear  
  
You will find peace of mind  
If you look in the right place  
You will find your way back home  
If you look in the right place  
You won't be lost out in the storm  
There is a way, the only way  
It will see you through today and tomorrow  
Just believe it in your heart  
  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard about it  
(That's the way of the Word)  
Haven't you heard  
(That's the way of the Word  
Ooh  
If you believe  
And see with your heart  
And then you will know  
  
That's the way of the Word  
That's the way of the Word  
That's the way of the Word

Why, why?  
'Cause I'm the type of guy  
Who believes in a Spirit I can't see with my eyes  
You can't deny, even if you try  
The one who created you, the earth and the sky  
I'm a baptized disciple, so I shall not tell a lie  
I've got the Holy Spirit, now I'm flyin' high  
Now while I'm rippin' a record take a second  
Do me a favor (make the Lord Jesus Christ your saviour)  
Yes, I must confess, I had a lot of stress  
On my chest - I was a mess  
But now I'm blessed  
By the Lord Jesus Christ being in my life  
Now I'm a whole new guy  
Go tell 'em that's why  
Refrain:  
Maybe you've seen the change - that's why  
Things are not the same - that's why  
Things just happen when you call upon His name - that's why  
Maybe you want the change - that's why  
Maybe you want the same - that's why  
Maybe you'd better call upon His name  
Yeah  
Bridge:  
So light (so light), so free  
That's what I feel now, that I've got the Lord in me  
So right (so right), so real  
Nothing in the world can make me feel  
What I'm feeling now  
Now it's time, time to open up  
Your heart and your mind  
That's why I'm here bustin' this rhyme  
So can you hear me?  
(Just tryin' to save your soul)  
Well can you feel me?  
(Let the Lord take control)  
Then the life you think will be eternal  
Instead it's gonna be inside hell's inferno  
Now get it straight, don't wait  
Hesitate or procrastinate  
The Lord's comin' back, don't wait  
So light (so light), so free  
That's what I feel now, that I've got the Lord in me  
Maybe you've seen the change - that's why  
Things are not the same - t

I, I long for the moment  
When I see you again  
I long to touch and stroke your hair again  
Though my heart goes on beating not knowing when  
  
I, I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
My heart will sing, you know I will soar  
Just like before, just like before  
  
Chorus:  
Until then  
All I'll have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz you'll be on my mind  
Until then (until then)  
  
I, I wait for the time  
I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine  
I know that someday, you'll come back and stay  
  
We'll be together once more  
Just like before  
  
Until then  
All I'll have is just a memory of you  
That I could hold on to  
Until then  
All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you  
Coz you'll be on my mind  
Until then...  
  
Bridge:  
I long for the moment  
I long for the time  
I'll take all my chances  
Until you are mine  
  
All I'll have is just a memory  
That I could hold on to

All I'll have is just this space and time  
To wait and think of you

Wag mo na sanang,  
  
Ano pa kaya ang dapat gawin ng isang katulad ko  
Upang paniwalaan at intindihin mo  
Ang mga nais sabihin ng puso ko  
Bigyan mo ako ng pagkakataon  
Paliwanagan ang iyong isip  
  
Kahit'sandali lang, patutunayan ko lang  
Na mahal kita hanggang ngayon  
  
Oh, ang babae, nakakatuwa  
Maliit na bagay lamang pinalalaki pa  
Ba't ayaw mong limutin ang nakaraan  
'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di na rin minamasdan  
  
Wag mo na sanang isipin ang mga nangyari sa atin noon  
Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon  
  
Sana naman hanggang dito na lang  
Ang paghihirap kong ito  
Dapat pa bang daanin, sa galit o tampuhan  
Dadami pang problemang 'di kailangan  
Kailan pa ba o 'di na ba  
Tayo magkakasunduan  
  
Kahit'sandali lang patutunayan ko lang  
Na minamahal mo pa ako  
  
Oh, ang babae, nakakaaliw  
Kahit sobra siyang pakipot, siya'y nakakabaliw  
Ba't ayaw mong limutin ang nakaraan  
'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di na rin minamasdan  
  
Wag mo na sanang isipin ang mga nangyari sa atin noon  
Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon  
  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
  
'Di mo na ako pinapansin, 'di narin minamasdan  
  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
  
Kahit ano pang sabihin mo maibabalik pa natin ang kahapon  
  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
Wag mo na sanang (wag mo na sanang), wag mo na sanang isipin (wag mo na  
Sanang isipin)  
Wag mo na sanang isipin

Lately I've been winning battles left and right  
But even winners can get wounded in the fight  
People say that I'm amazing  
I'm strong beyond my years  
But they don't see inside of me  
I'm hiding all the tears  
Chorus:  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)  
Unafraid because His arrow is the best  
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest  
People say that I'm amazing  
I never face retreat, oh no  
But they don't see the enemies  
That lay me at His feet  
Chorus:  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)  

As little children  
We would dream of Christmas morn  
Of all the gifts and toys  
We knew we'd find  
But we never realized  
A baby born one blessed night  
Gave us the greatest gift of our lives  
  
CHORUS:  
We were the reason  
That He gave His life  
We were the reason  
That He suffered and died  
To a world that was lost  
He gave all He could give  
To show us the reason to live  
  
As the years went by  
We learned more about gifts  
The giving of ourselves  
And what that means  
On a dark and cloudy day  
A man hung crying in the rain  
All because of love, all because of love  
I've finally found the reason for living  
It's in giving every part of my heart to Him  
In all that I do every word that I say  
I'll be giving my all just for Him, for Him  
He is my reason to live

When I  
Look into those bright eyes  
So young  
Always so ready to run  
Then I  
See your change when fun subsides  
And new colors start to arise  
There's a hidden picture  
That wasn't seen outside  
  
When you run, don't tire  
Keep on reaching, higher  
Even when the pain and trouble bring you down, sometimes  
I will see you through  
I'm forever right here with you  
Even when you feel you don't need me around  
  
I will be your friend, forever  
I will be your one, big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
When I hear you call  
  
Don't cry  
This is not the end, nor goodbye  
But begin  
To know I'm with you 'til the end  
And when you pray  
I will hear every word you say  
And so with all my promises made  
For one like you  
Someone who's especially made  
  
When you run, don't tire  
Keep on reaching, higher  
Even if the pain and trouble bring you down, sometimes  
I will see you through  
I'm forever right here with you  
Even if you feel you don't need me around  
  
I will be your friend, forever  
I will be your one, big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Yeah  
  
I will be your friend, forever  
I will be your big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Yeah  
  
I will be your friend, forever  
I will be your big brother  
Even when I see you fall  
I will be your father  
Be your friend, your brother  
When I hear you call  
Lift you when you fall  
When I hear you call
