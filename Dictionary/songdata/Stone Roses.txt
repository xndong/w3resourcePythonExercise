I'm begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow  
Got the horn good to go, wait, oh his sting's all gone  
Now he's begging you, begging you  
  
Here is a warning, the sky will divide  
Since I took off the lid, no, there's nowhere to hide  
Now I'm begging you, begging you  
  
This is a mystery not to be solved  
But be minded, like minded, I'm gone, still I'm with you  
I'm begging you, begging you  
  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over, give it over  
Yeah I'm begging you (I'm begging you)  
Give it over, give it over  
Give it over  
Yeah, I'm begging you, I'm begging you  
  
Weigh it and say it, is it all in a name  
Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane  
Can it make you remember, time is a place  
How I'm begging you, I'm begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
Make all the dust that you can  
Make all the dust that you can  
  
King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow

I've been casing your joint  
For the best years of my life  
Like the look of your stuff  
Outta sight  
When I'm hungry and when I'm cold  
When I'm having it rough  
Or just getting old  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue  
  
Better man the barricades  
I'm coming in tonight  
Had a line of my dust  
Outta sight  
When I wonder and when I roam  
I'll find a soul I can trust  
I'm coming home  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue, sing it  
  
I'm gonna break right into heaven  
I can't wait anymore  
  
Heaven's gates won't hold me  
I'll saw those suckers down  
Laughing loud at your locks  
When they hit the ground  
Every icon in every town  
Hear this, your number's up  
I'm coming 'round  
  
Listen up sweet child of mine  
Have I got news for you  
Nobody leaves this place alive  
They'll die and join the queue, sing it  
  
I'm gonna break right into heaven  
I can't wait anymore  
  
How many times will I have to tell you  
You don't have to wait to die  
You can have it all, any time you want it  
Yeah, the kingdom's all inside

This is the daybreak  
And this is the love we make  
For love is the law here  
You got to know how I love it, yeah  
It's more than a mover  
You know it takes all fast, all song  
Stone cold wild  
Bring the love in son, brother, man  
True nature child

For Atlanta Georgia  
To Longsight Manchester  
Everyone ready  
So, so willing and able, yeah, yeah, yeah  
For the love you make  
Go no sis, huh, yeah, woo

Sister Rosa Lee parks  
Love forever her name in your heart  
Forever in my heart  
  
Woo, hey  
As I sing on this song  
Someone just got rolled on  
Hey, oh hey, yeah, woo, yeah  
  
New York City to Addis Ababababa  
Keep on keeping strong  
Keep on keeping on  
  
So why no stack for black  
On a radio station in this, the city  
Been going on so long  
Level on the line, I'm a leaf on the vine of time  
Black bones are the original bones  
And so this is the whole wide world should know, y'all  
I came to sing this song in your city  
  
Ooh, for the dreamers  
One more for the dreamers, yeah

Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Here the sea spray give  
I was with her  
We're under the ship so get me over  
  
Now that was me, listen  
Now she fishes now, listen  
There was no one out there we used  
There is the news for me useless  
  
Now so much waste  
How we'll be teased  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
  
Oh won't you just ask me you're an imbecile  
What's the matter for everyone I feel  
Pain, blues singer  
He's playing just a guitar from the top  
  
I wake I still look I feel loose  
We're all here now who'se the first ease into my heart  
He must be one of us  
  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?  
Don't stop, isn't it funny how you shine?

Driving south 'round midnight, man, I must have been insane  
Driving south 'round midnight in a howling hurricane  
I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroad  
He said "I'm going nowhere  
I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul"  
  
"I'm not trying to make you, I don't want to touch your skin  
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins  
Well, you ain't too young or pretty, and yer sure as hell can't sing  
Any time you want to sell your soul  
I've got a toll-free number you can ring"  
  
Yeah, that's what I thought he said anyway  
  
"I'm not trying to make you, I don't want to touch your skin  
I know all there is to know about you and all your sins  
Well, you ain't too young or pretty, and yer sure as hell can't sing  
Any time you want to sell your soul  
I've got a toll-free number you can ring"  
  
0 800 treble six, oh yeah  
0 800 treble six, oh yeah  
  
I stopped for an old man hitcher at a lonely old crossroads  
He said "I'm going nowhere  
I'm only here to see if I can steal your soul"  
He got!

Burst into heaven  
Kissing the cotton clouds  
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat  
I can't stop coming down  
Your shrunken head  
Looking down on me above  
Send me home like an elephant stone  
To smash my dream of love  
Dreaming till the sun goes down  
And night turns into day  
Rooms are empty I've got plenty  
You could move in right away  
  
It seems like there's a hole  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
  
Down through the heavens  
Choke on the cotton clouds  
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat  
I can't stop coming down  
Your shrunken head  
Looking down on me above  
Send me home like an elephant stone  
To smash my dream of love  
  
Did your bed and bookshelf go  
And run run run away  
These four walls saw the rise and fall  
And your midnight getaway  
Seems like there's a hole  
In my dreams  
Or so it seems  
Yet nothing means anything  
Anymore

Dawn sings in the garden  
Phone sings in the hall  
This boy's dead from two day's life  
Resurrected by the call  
Penny here we've got to come  
So come on round to me  
There's so much penny lying here  
To touch, taste and tease  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming round  
Penny's place her crummy room  
Her dansette crackles to Jimi's tune  
I don't care I taste Ambre Solaire  
Her neck her thighs her lips her hair  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
Yeah she looks like a painting  
Jackson Pollock's Number Five  
Come into the forest and taste the trees  
The sun starts shining and I'm hard to please  
Ring a ding ding ding I'm going down  
I'm coming around  
  
All thoughts of sleep desert me  
There is no time  
Thirty minutes brings me round to her number nine  
  
To look down on the clouds  
You don't need to fly  
I've never flown in a plane  
I'll live until I die

Guernica is in fact made of stone backwards.  
Watch me at war really up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores that's us  
He wanted us he swore and all we've got  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores that's us  
Simple lives yeah we don't have  
We pack up in truth it seems this  
Peacemakers has arms that hold fear  
See gargoyles can you see the wonder?  
Yes I fear the carbine  
What does never wrong mean?  
That's right  
Every one of us he swore so hurry up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
We both are stitched up now  
We're hard with fear hard speak up  
You wanna hurt me stop the row  
Both of us are stitched up now  
We're whores sit down  
We're whores  
That must mean sinful eyes that maim of fear  
It's the look that stings I fear boy  
Being distrusting I trust no one  
They've been back down for nothing  
It was never shared it's ours  
We will know those names who follow  

I've seen your severed head at a banquet for the dead  
All dressed up for dinner, looked so fine  
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered  
With the finest military quick lime  
  
Now try and picture this, as I gave you a kiss  
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine  
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade  
We laughed as we put away your wine  
  
So raise your glasses, here's a toast to wasted lives  
May all their ghost come back to haunt you  
And tell you how they died  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now, does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock, knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
When all the fun was over, I put you on my shoulder  
Took you home, away from it all  
Shot down and claimed, mounted and framed  
Tastefully hung up on my wall  
  
Are my dreams your nightmares  
Get off your knees, the party's over  
I'm coming home to you  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now, does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock, knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now, does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock, knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
At your door

Love spreads her arms  
Waits there for the nails  
I forgive you boy  
I will prevail  
  
Too much to take  
Some cross to bear  
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic  
She's over there, yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
She didn't scream  
She didn't make a sound  
I forgive you boy  
But don't leave town  
  
Cold black skin  
Naked in the rain  
Hammer flash in the lightning  
They're hurting her again  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen  
  
I have a dream  
I've seen the light  
Don't put it out, and she's alright  
Yeah, she's my sister  
  
She didn't scream  
She didn't make a sound  
I forgive you boy  
But don't leave town  
  
Cold black skin  
Naked in the rain  
Hammer flash in the lightning  
They're hurting her again  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Let me put you in the picture  
Let me show you what I mean  
The messiah is my sister  
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen

Yeah, she's my sister

Your knuckles whiten on the wheel  
The last thing that your hands will feel  
Your final flight can't be delayed  
  
No land just sky it's so serene  
Your pink fat lips let go a scream  
You fry and melt I love the scene  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Don't these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone?  
Is anybody home?  
  
I'm standing warm against the cold  
Now that the flames have taken hold  
At least you left your life at style  
  
And for as far as I can see  
Tin twisted grills grin back at me  
Bad money dies I love the scene  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Don't these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone?  
Is anybody home?  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Don't these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone?  
Are you made of stone?

River splashes against the rocks,  
And I scale the slope,  
I hope the tracks won't,  
Lead me down to dark black pits,  
Or places where we fall to bits,  
If she were there I'd hold her down,  
I'd push her under while she drowns  
And couldn't breathe and claw for air-  
She doesn't care for my despair,  
  
Or is it me?  
The one that's wrong?  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
As I stare an oil wheel comes sailing by,  
And I feel like,  
Growing fins and falling in,  
With the bricks the bikes, the rusty tin  
I swim around without a care,  
I'm eating sand when I need air,  
You can bet your life  
I'll meet a pike who'll wolf me down for tea tonight  
  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise  
  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
Oh yeah  
I want to be, I want to be,  
Where the drownings are,  
(drownings are),  
You see it in the sea,  
River cools where I belong,  
In my Mersey paradise.

Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
  
I'm no dog I'm a dolphin  
I just don't live in the sea  
You feel my flow and you flood my brain  
Show me your vision your wild apparition  
And sink to the depths of your soul  
  
One love we don't need another love  
One love one heart and one soul  
We can have it all  
Easy peasy  
  
Any time you want me  
Any time at all  
Any time you need me  
All you gotta do is call  
  
You put me one step clear of the chain gang  
And two miles over the line  
All the scenes I saw left me wanting more  
Show me a vision you wild apparition  
And sink to the depths of your soul  
  
One love we don't need another love  
One love one heart and one soul  
  
Your fruit's in season  
And these feet fall surely sound  
And what goes up must come down  
Turns into dust or turns into stone

I can feel the earth begin to move  
I hear my needle hit the groove  
And spiral through another day  
I hear my song begin to say  
Kiss me where the sun don't shine  
The past was yours  
But the future's mine  
You're all out of time  
  
I don't feel too steady on my feet  
I feel hollow I feel weak  
Passion fruits and holy bread  
Fill my guts and ease my head  
Through the early morning sun  
I can see her here she comes  
She bangs the drums  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
She'll be the first she'll be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
She'll be the first she'll be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel  
  
Have you seen her have you heard  
The way she plays there are no words  
To describe the way I feel  
  
How could it ever come to pass  
She'll be the first she'll be the last  
To describe the way I feel  
The way I feel

You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
  
You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
  
I never wanted  
The love that you showed me  
It started to choke me  
And how I wish I'd said  
No too slow  
I couldn't take  
That too fast  
I want you to know  
  
You know it  
You show it  
But I can't back down  
It's far too late  
I can't wait  
Now the time has come  
It'll all work out  
And when this  
Thing is done  
It'll leave no doubt  
So when you've  
Had your fun  
Will you all walk out ?  
  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming  
I'd love to do it and you know you've always had it coming

I'm standing on a hilltop  
A hundred miles from home  
I can see the light surrounds me  
I want you to show me round  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
  
I'm drifting through the city  
I'm swinging from a tree  
I can touch but you can't feel me  
You hear me as you sleep  
  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
And I'm everywhere  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
But I don't think you think like I do  
No matter how how hard I try  
I always thought I'd have the answer  
Let me tell you what I've got  
  
I'm looking through your window  
I might just have the key  
Over me my free-fall baby  
You hear me as you speak

That I'm in heaven when you smile

Or the train can wait, yeah  
  
Do do do do do do  
Heading straight to the man  
How you know they'll never evade you  
  
So now I stand here, love cuts down a revolver  
Amsterdam in Sodom and Gomorra  
So I'm singing to king stone, your teaching a song  
They say it's a fable, though I was made able  
I slipped through the net, want to bet it's a ramble, a sandstorm  
One slip you know you'll never forget, who could ever forget ?  
You know I'll never forget  
  
Do do do do do do  
Straight to the man  
Ah, you know they're trying to fade you  
  
So this revelation, called devastation  
Oh, need no powder, one kinder, easy blind ya  
Yeah, the eyes of Grand Britannia owes a debts  
Say, the eyes of Grand Britannia, all the eyes of Grand Britannia  
All the eyes of Grand Britannia owes a debts  
  
Yeah, the eyes of Grand Britannia  
All the eyes of Grand Britannia owes us a debts

Her hair  
Soft drifted snow  
Death white  
I'd like to know  
Why she hates  
All that she does  
But she gives  
It all that she's got  
Until the sky turns green  
The grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
Until the sky turns green  
And the grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
T takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sister's happy  
With this love of mine  
It'll take all these things and oh much more  
I've paid  
For fifteen or more  
But my guts  
Can't take many more  
My hands are stuck  
To my jeans  
And she knows she knows  
What this must mean  
She wakes up with the sun  
She asked me what is all the fuss  
As she gave me more than she thought she should  
She wakes up with the sun  
I think what have I done  
As I gave her more than I thought I would, ohhh  
At takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sister's happy  
With this love of mine  
Yeah yeah yeah  
The candy floss girl  
The sticky fingered boy  
Oh that sister of mine  
Yeah  

You can't tell me  
You can't tell me  
You can't tell me anything  
I love only me  
I love only me  
I've got the answer to everything  
  
There's only me  
to suggest what I do  
I am the garage flower  
I don't need to stare  
'Cause I know everywhere  
Well there's a place for me anywhere  
  
Tell me tell me  
You tell me anything  
You can't tell  
You won't tell  
Me anything  
Anything  
  
I love only me  
I love only me  
I've got the answers to everything  
I don't need to stare  
'Cause I know everywhere  
Well there's a place for me anywhere  
  
Tell me tell me  
You tell me anything  
Tell me tell me  
You can't tell us anything  
You can't tell  
You won't tell  
Me anything  
Anything  
You can't  
  
I am the garage flower  
I am the garage flower

The hardest thing in the world  
  
Holland it don't please  
I never wanted to leave  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
I'm sick and tired  
It's so obscene  
Will heaven help me be clean?  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
You never heard a word I said  
It's seems simple to me  
That if you knew you wouldn't say  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
And the impression I get  
As the story unfurls  
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
What you feel might not be  
It seems softer to me  
I cannot climb to touch your spire  
I'm getting higher and higher  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
The hardest thing in the world

A girl consumed by fire  
We all know her desire  
From the plans that She has made  
I had her on a promise  
Immerse me in your splendor  
All the plans that I have made  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
I'd like to leave the country  
For a month of Sundays  
Burn the town where I was born  
If only she'd believe me  
Bellona belladonna  
Burn me out or bring me home  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
Oh this is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one  
This is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
So make a plan  
It might go wrong  
This is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
And this is the one  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
This is the one  
She's waited for  
  
This is the one  
Oh this is the one  
Ah this is the one  
This is the one  
I've waited for  
  
This is the one

You should've been an angel, it would've suited you  
My gold-leaf tryptic angel, she knows just what to do  
In the half-light of morning, in a world between the sheets  
I swear I saw her angel wing, my vision was complete  
  
And I know I'll never want another lover, my sweet  
Can there be more in this world than the joy of just watching ya sleep?  
I don't know just what to feel  
Won't someone tell me my love's real?  
  
Are we etched in stone or just scratched in the sand  
Waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land?  
Will the sunshine all sweetness and light  
Burn us to a cinder, our third stone satellite?  
  
I'm on a tightrope, baby, nine miles high  
Striding through the clouds on my ribbon in the sky  
I'm on a tightrope, baby, one thing I've found  
I don't know how to stop  
And it's a long, long, long, long way down  
  
She's all that ever mattered and all that ever will  
My cup, it runneth over, I'll never get my fill  
The boats in the harbor slip from their chains  
Head for new horizons, let's do the same  
  
I'm on a tightrope, baby, nine miles high  
Striding through the clouds on my ribbon in the sky  
I'm on a tightrope, baby, one thing I've found  
I don't know how to stop  
And it's a tightrope, baby, nine miles high  
Striding through the clouds on my ribbon in the sky  
I'm on a tightrope, baby, one thing I've found  
I don't know how to stop  
And it's a long, long, long, long way down

Your star will shine again one day  
Through deep blue velvet skies  
Shine for all the world to see  
The universe in your eyes  
  
When the storm outside is raging  
And the dogs they howl your name  
Lay down, sleep, I'll kiss you  
Your star will shine again  
  
Na na na na na na na na  
  
Hush my darling, don't you cry  
I'll stay by your side until morning  
All through the night, I'll watch the skies  
  
And your distant sun  
Will shine like the gun  
That's trained right between your daddy's eyes
