It seems like yesterday  
But it was long ago  
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights  
There in the darkness with the radio playing low  
And the secrets that we shared  
The mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove  
And I remember what she said to me  
How she swore that it never would end  
I remember how she held me oh so tight  
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then  
  
Against the wind  
We were runnin' against the wind  
We were young and strong, we were runnin'  
Against the wind  
  
The years rolled slowly past  
And I found myself alone  
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home  
And I guess I lost my way  
There were oh so many roads  
I was living to run and running to live  
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed  
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searching  
Searching for shelter again and again  
  
Against the wind  
A little something against the wind  
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind  
  
Well those drifter's days are past me now  
I've got so much more to think about  
Deadlines and commitments  
What to leave in, what to leave out  
  
Against the wind  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind  
Well I'm older now and still runnin'  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
Against the wind  
  
Still runnin'  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
I'm still runnin'  
I'm still runnin' against the wind  
Still runnin'  
Runnin' against the wind  
Runnin' against the wind  
See the young man run  
Watch the young man run  
Watch the young man runnin'  
He'll be runnin' against the wind  
Let the cowboys ride  
Let the cowboys ride  
They'll be ridin' against the wind  
Against the wind ...

I think of you and I together  
I picture you and I as one  
When we sit there in  
The firelight baby  
When we wake to the morning sun  
And though you may leave me  
We're never apart  
You're Always In My Heart  
  
When you're standing at the window  
With the moonlight in your hair  
And you turn and smile  
My favorite smile  
I just have to stop and stare  
And babe when you hold me  
I go off the chart  
You're Always In My Heart  
  
Stay with me stay  
Stay with me babe forever  
Be by my side  
Lets spend our lives together  
  
I picture you and I together  
I think of you and I for years  
And if you're ever lost or worries Baby  
I'll be there to calm your fears  
I think that I've loved you  
Right from the start  
  
Always In My Heart  
Always In My Heart

Headin' out on some uncharted path  
You soon turn back  
It happens time and time again  
You never seem to reach the end  
Someone's out there on the street tonight  
When things go wrong  
He'll guarantee to make them right  
If the price is right  
  
Every time I look you're fallin' fallin'  
Beaten by the wind  
Every time I turn around he's there again  
  
It's like a full force gale  
An american storm  
You're buried far beneath a mountain of cold  
And you never get warm  
It's like a wall of mirrors  
You charge 'em at full speed  
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You never feel the need  
  
Everybody casts a certain light  
A special gift  
It's theirs to use for wrong or right  
When you face the night  
More and more we choose the easy way  
We take no risks  
We figure out which games to play  
And how to make 'em pay  
  
Suddenly the pressure's fallin' fallin'  
Skies have all turned grey  
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way  
  
It's like a full force gale  
Atop a mountain of cold  
You tell your story again and again  
And it never gets old  
It's like a wall of mirrors  
You charge 'em at full speed  
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You face a full force gale  
An american storm  
You're buried beneath a mountain of cold  
And you never get warm - no you never get warm  
You face a wall of mirrors  
You charge 'em at full speed  
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass  
But you never bleed  
You never feel the need

I see it in your convoluted daydreams  
These never ending quests we're always on  
I can't believe the things we give importance to  
These foolish goals we set ourselves upon  
  
Are you gonna make this easy  
Are you gonna make this rough  
This world gonna make you crazy  
If you never have enough  
Most of what we want is just illusion  
Most of what we buy won't change a thing  
Most of what we're told is misdirection  
Offered up to ease our suffering  
  
Are you gonna see the wisdom  
Are you gonna call this bluff  
This world's gonna run you over  
If you never have enough  
  
This is a whole new thing almost like a new religion  
  
The liights are always on the doors are never locked  
We ride in on the light the shelves are overstocked  
  
Everybody's got their own connection  
Everybody's hoping they can score  
Everybody's looking for perfection  
Everybody wants a little more  
  
Are you gonna be addicted  
Are you gonna give it up  
This world's gonna drive you under  
If you never have enough

Went out in norfork hung on a short short  
  
Livin' with a bottle of wine  
  
To music, ladies and burned out babies  
  
I was tryin' to write a couple of lines  
  
Sherriff gribbs with his grim ad libs  
  
Spoutin' 'bout the crime in the streets  
  
And women were screamin' and some were dreamin'  
  
'bout the crowd between the sheets  
  
You know that music died, hurt my pride  
  
Somehow I got through, back in '72  
  
Somehow we made it to baton rouge  
  
We stayed inside for a week  
  
We weren't in town for no mardi gras  
  
So we decided to sleep  
  
Houston, yes, was a good old guest  
  
Tho knows how bad we wanted to play  
  
But we got homesick for lincoln park  
  
(imagine that) and then we just couldn't stay  
  
Tricky dick, he played it slick  
  
Something I was afraid he'd do  
  
Back in '72, oh, '72  
  
Then all our new born philosophers  
  
Out went to alert the world  
  
Then some psuedo-intellectuals  
  
Even got it unfurled  
  
Takin' notes on that harvard course  
  
And got me on a bottle of seed  
  
It was so hip to be negative  
  
So square to try and leave  
  
When the waters cleared, it was what we feared  
  
We learned nothin' new,  
  
Back in '72  
  
'72  
  
'72  
  
In '72  
  
Back in '72  
  
Back in '72 back in '72,...

He wants to dream like a young man  
With the wisdom of an old man.  
He wants his home and security.  
He wants to live like a sailor at sea.  
Beautiful loser, where you gonna fall?  
You realize you just don't need it all.  
  
He's your oldest and your best friend,  
If you need him, he'll be there again.  
He's always willing to be second best,  
A perfect lodger, a perfect guest.  
Beautiful loser, read it on the wall  
And realize, you just don't need it all.  
Hey - you just don't need it all.  
You can try but you can't have it all, oh no, no.  
Oh, oh, can't have it all.  
  
He'll never make any enemies,  
He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze.  
He'll always ask, he'll always say please.  
Beautiful loser, never take it all  
Cause it's easier and faster when you fall,  
You just don't need it all  
Oh, oh, you just don't need it all.

You're old enough to know better as soon  
As you can see  
This world is out to get you the way it's gotten me  
It starts out in the morning then moves to afternoon  
By the time you reach the evenin' you're  
Barkin' at the moon  
Between what you're told and what you've seen  
You'll know that it's just another show  
Everybody sells somethin'everybody's got game  
We all keep believin' no one is to blame  
The world keeps getting hotter, ice falls in the sea  
We buy a bigger engine and say it isn't me  
Between what we say and what we mean  
It's clean far away from that machine  
We talk on the phone because we're alone  
And everyone knows it  
We feel overdue, we want something new  
And everyone knows it  
It's time to join with the living, time to understand  
We're all in this together, we've got to have a plan  
We're facing an extinction every other day  
There's got to be an answer, we've got to find a way  
Between what is dead and what is green  
We learn what to keep and what to burn  
Between what is fair and what's obscene  
It's clean far way from that machine  

Life is like a big river  
  
Sinkin' or swim, depends on you  
you can take or you can be a giver  
you're gonna get through  
Once, a good woman loved me  
If you got love  
  
Kinda cruel, and she left me one day  
now I'm cyin', she loves another  
gotta go alone  
The rest of the way  
  
Take, the advice of a loser  
who's been livin' too long alone  
Follow your heart  
  
follow your rainbow  
And one day you'll find  
You are not alone  
  
  

Once had a woman I used to watch her walk  
Said I once had a woman I used to watch her talk  
Yes I once had a woman in my heart in my mind  
You know the kind  
Once saw my woman with another man  
Once saw my woman take a hold of his hand  
Said I once saw my woman in my heart in my mind  
Ooh Lord she was a mean kind  
She was a good woman yeah  
Nothing wrong with her  
A little bit wild but all right  
Now I'm older  
I'm real good at tellin lies  
But I'll never forget her no no  
Even in my heart even in my mind  
Black eyed girl of mine  
She was a black eyed girl of mine  
Shes so good  
She's still free comin after you  
Yeah

Nights were warm  
Dreams were easy  
No one standing overhead  
Conversation didn't mean much  
We were hungry but could not be fed  
Radio blasting silly little love songs  
We only listened for the beat  
Taking our chances  
Out there on the mean streets  
Hiding in the shadows from the heat  
We weren't lovers just brave strangers  
As we fought and we tumbled through the night  
We were players not arrangers  
As we jammed till the dawn's early light  
Swimming in the big lake  
Taking it easy  
Taking any comfort we could find  
Didn't need the real truth  
Didn't need the meaning  
Straight ahead ignoring every sign  
Every sign  
And oh I remember I know you do too  
Oh that one evening  
I know you do too  
Baby  
I know you remember it too  
The moon was high  
Moon was flying high  
We were hiding in the backwoods  
Hiding out in the backwoods  
With the moon flying high  
My hand was shaking  
And you took my hand  
And it went all right  
And it went all right  
It went all right  
So we walked out hardly speaking  
Disappearing in the night  
Saw each other a few times after  
But we never really got it right  
We weren't lovers just brave strangers  
As we rolled and we tumbled through the night  
We were players not arrangers  
And we jammed till the dawn's early light

It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle  
And now the young monsieur and madam have rung the chapel bell  
C'est la vie say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell  
  
They finished off an apartment with a two-room Roebuck sale  
The coolerator was jammed with tv dinners and ginger ale  
And when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well  
C'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell  
  
They had a hi-fi phono, boy did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records, all blues, rock, rhythm, and jazz  
But when the sun went down, the volume went down as well  
C'est la vie say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell  
  
They bought a souped-up jitney, it was a cherry red '53  
And drove it down to New Orleans to celebrate their anniversary  
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle  
C'est la vie say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell  
  
They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

Chances are you'll find me  
Somewhere on your road tonight,  
Seems I always end up drivin' by,  
  
Ever since I've known you  
It just seems you're on my way,  
All the rules of logic don't apply  
  
I long to see you in the night,  
Be with you till morning light...  
  
I remember clearly  
How you looked the night we met,  
I recall your laughter and your smile,  
I remember how you made me  
Feel so at ease,  
I remember your grace, your style...  
  
And now your all I long to see,  
You've come to mean so much to me...  
  
Chances are I'll see you,  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight.  
  
You'll be smilin' like the night we met,  
Chances are I'll hold you,  
And I'll offer all I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget,  
Baby your the best I've ever met...  
  
And I'll be dreamin' of the future,  
And hopin' you'll be by my side  
  
And in the morning I'll be longing,  
  
For the night...  
  
For the night...  
  
Chances are I'll see you,  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight...  
You'll be smilin' like the night we met...  
Chances are I'll hold you,  
And I'll offer all I have,  
You're the only one I can't forget...  
Baby your the best I've ever met.

Passed the old church on the edge of town  
Trailways bus was right on time  
Passed your uncle's store on main street  
His old truck was parked outside  
Everything seemed so much larger then  
This old town has hardly grown  
Has it really been ten long years  
Now you're finally comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You've been gone so very long  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
You left your hometown for the city lights  
You were young and you were strong  
Lots of traffic lots of sleepless nights  
Lots of dreams that all went wrong  
You'll just tell them what they want to hear  
How you took the place by storm  
You won't tell them how you lost it all  
You'll just say you're comin' home  
  
Comin' home  
You grew tired of being alone  
Comin' home  
You'll just say you're comin' home

Here I am, oh my time's rolling slowly by  
21 years old, waiting on my turn to die  
Every minute Lord, every minute seems like five  
And if it wasn't for the window,  
I'd wonder if the world outside was alive  
Yeah, smokin cigarettes, drinkin' coffee  
And waiting on my last meal, I try to pretend  
  
I try to pretend but this cell is much too real  
Oh, I should have left that chick alone  
I curse the day, I curse the day she was born, now  
Oh the old men they tell me  
They tell me love is akin to hate  
But before I die, I just gotta get it straight now  
  
Crush out my cigarette, throw away my coffee and scream  
Ahhhhhhh, I don't wanna die  
Oh, I don't wanna die  
  
Oh, it's too late they'll be comin' for me soon  
It's too late to pray, and anyway, God can't see this room  
I'm startin' to sweat now, It won't be long now  
I can see  
They're gonna put me in that chair  
They're gonna put me in that chair and that's how the end's gonna be  
Yeah, it's gettin cold, it's gettin colder  
And I'm startin' to scream, Ahh I don't wanna die  
Don't leave me here to die

Chicago Green she was the ice cube queen of blue  
  
She got a tip from Aunt Mary, said.(?somebody?) was  
In love with you  
  
  
She was so nieve,, famous for her childlike mind,  
  
I don't believe she ever opened her bedroom venetian blinds  
  
  
Already Eddie was unsteady on the levee  
Down Home  
  
  
Down Home  
  
Little Willy was Chicago's boyfriend, a local screw  
  
  
He done kicking trippy hippies in the head with his  
  
  
Hobnail shoes  
Already Eddie, pitching for pennies, rockin' for bennies,  
  
Wound up in the local hole, without a radio,  
  
And he wrote Aunt Mary said "Momma, it's getting hairy,Down Home."  
  
  
  
Well it was late in the morning when Chicago bailed  
Eddie on out  
  
  
Which tripped out Willie, oh man you should've heard  
  
Him shout..  
  
  
Their way home.  
  
Yeah they wandered off somewhere, they couldn't find  
  
Any road home  
You know I'd really like to take her but you know I  
  
Couldn't make her  
Down Home.  
  
  
Down Home, get it in now  
  
Down Home, in the morning

Evil Edna she wore sequins to the funeral  
Looked just like a gypsy  
  
Never shed a tear  
Everybody said she looked just like a hooker  
  
Everyone mistook her for the loser of the year  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Tell us we should live just so  
  
Enda did not know  
Ah Edna didn't care  
  
Two weeks later, Edna laughed at her confession  
  
Gave the nuns a chill  
Laughed just like a gypsy  
  
  
Everybody said she'd never be forgiven  
Everybody cursed her, said that she was ill  
  
  
Still the voices of the prophets  
Ah Edna didn't care  
Tell us we should live just so  
Oh she did not know  
  
  
Just the other day I heard some people talkin'  
Edna went out walkin' and she passed away  
  
No one knew exactly just what happened  
No one came to mourn her, we all stayed away  
  

Last night I saw you walking  
Past my bed late at night,  
And the moon shone  
Through your gown.  
Such a fine memory,  
I think I'm gonna take it with me.  
And later as you were sleeping,  
Sleeping next to me,  
I felt your hair on my skin.  
Such a fine memory,  
I know I'm gonna take it with me.  
I'm going to take it  
Far as I go.  
I'm going to take it  
Far as I go.  
And later as I was driving,  
And the sky was getting light,  
And the sun came  
Through the trees,  
I had a fine memory,  
Such a fine memory.

Who's gonna ride that chrome three wheeler  
Who's gonna make that first mistake  
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers  
All the way to fire lake  
Who wants to break the news about uncle Joe  
You remember uncle Joe  
He was the one afraid to cut the cake  
Who wants to tell poor aunt Sarah  
Joe's run off to fire lake  
Joe's run off to fire lake  
  
Who wants to brave those bronze beauties  
Lying in the sun  
With their long soft hair falling  
Flying as they run  
Oh they smile so shy  
And they flirt so well  
And they lay you down so fast  
Till you look straight up and say  
Oh lord  
Am I really here at last  
  
Who wants to play those eights and aces  
Who wants a raise  
Who needs a stake  
Who wants to take that long shot gamble  
And head out to fire lake  
Head out  
Who wants to go to fire lake  
And head out  
Who wants to go to fire lake  
Head out  
Out to fire lake  
Who's gonna do it

It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one  
  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, one, one  
It ain't me  
It ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son, son, son

I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'  
Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'  
Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over  
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further  
All the fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'  
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'  
  
Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher  
She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her  
We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'  
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'  
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up  
The cops came bustin' in and then we lit out in our pickup truck go  
  
Get out of Denver baby go go  
Get out of Denver better go  
Get out of Denver better go go  
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better  
Get out of Denver  
  
Well red lights were flashin' and the sirens were a-screamin'  
We had to pinch each other just to see if we was dreamin'  
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour  
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower  
  
The rain kept drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber  
We kept on drivin' till we ran into some fog cover  
We couldn't see a thing somehow we just kept on goin'  
We kept on drivin' all night long and then into the mornin'  
'Fore it finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at  
We're starin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat go  
  
Get out of Denver he said go go  
Get out of Denver better go  
Get out of Denver better go go  
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better  
Get out of Denver better go  
  
Oh better better better go  
Hey go  
Ah better better go go go go  
Cause you look just like a commie  
And you might just be a member better  
Get out of Denver better go!

Golden boy  
Take your place  
Among the stars  
  
Light your fire  
Cast your glow  
Near and far  
  
Mother's eyes  
Warm you when you sleep  
  
There's a tree  
By a brook  
In the glade  
  
There's a wave  
Off a cape  
Making way  
  
Galaxies  
Rush away from you  
  
I'll be there  
In the wind  
In your sails  
  
Through the clouds  
Through the fog  
Through the gates  
  
I'll be there  
Golden boy for you

This gravestone is peaceful and quiet  
She pulls up a chair and sits right by it  
The air around is gentle and warm  
The rose colored wreath is tattered and torn  
  
Tiny blades of grass are peeking through  
Drawing life from sunshine and dew  
Remembering his eyes when she lied  
Knowing she lives feeling she's died  
  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone my child  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da  
  
So every night after sunshine  
You'll find her there alone in her shrine  
Two forms appearing ghostly in rain  
One red marble the other blue pain  
  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone  
Where have all the good time gone my child  
Da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da da da

She's no good at being phony  
She never tells a good lie  
She knows just when to let me be  
She always knows when I'm too high  
She's never out in front of me  
Or way too for  
Too for behind  
She's always right beside me  
Right in the good place all the time  
She's so good for me  
So good for me  
She's so good for me  
  
Good for me yeah  
Oh, and when I call her at midnight  
Oh, the lady she knows just what to say  
She says the words I long to hear  
Oh yeah, 'couse that's her way  
She knows just what to say  
To make me want to stay 'cause that's her way  
  
She's good for me  
Oh, so good for me  
She's sure enough good for me yeah  
So good so good so good she's so good for me oh yeah  
She's so good for me  
Oh the lady  
She's so good for me  
Good for me

I've seen two time losers running everywhere  
Shouting and screamin', "I was never there!"  
With their hands in the air  
Hands in the air  
  
I've seen bad news messengers avoiding kings  
Cheating spouses twisting their rings  
With their hands in the air  
Oooh, got their hands in the air  
As guilty as the wind out on the sea  
Affecting who we are and who we'll be  
  
There's a desperation, a real despair  
Even the good people are starting to declare  
"I've got my hands in the air!"  
"Ah my hands are in the air!"  
  
They're surrendering, they're giving in  
They'll do anything not to go through this again  
They've got their hands in the air  
Ooh, their hands in the air  
  
And they're sinking in the quicksand like a stone  
Broken to the marrow of the bone, oh  
  
The dealers are dividing up their tips  
The gamblers, they're all cashin' in their chips  
  
There's a man in the middle of a parking lot  
Wondering which way he should go  
There's a star on the horizon  
Sinking low, low  
  
All you death wish addicts, you corrupters of truth  
You killers of the spirit, you marauders of youth  
Get your hands in the air  
I want to see your hands in the air  
  
If you're selling these lies, these impossible dreams  
You can keep on washin' but you'll never get clean  
Get your hands in the air  
Let me see your hands in the air

Ahh come on with me baby  
We're gonna have a good time  
Don't you ever listen to the radio  
When the big bad beat comes on  
I know you gotta dig it  
I know you can't stop it  
Cause the bottom comes on so strong  
  
Talkin 'bout (heavy music),  
Oh I got to have it yeah (heavy music),

Dancin to that heavy music (music) What I sing to the heavy music (music)

Don't you ever feel like goin' insane  
When the drums begin to pound  
Ain't there ever been a time in your life  
You couldn't believe what the band is puttin' down, about  
  
(repeat chorus)  
Yeah, alright, goin' in, goin in now  
Oh yeah I'm goin' in now  
Come on come on with me baby  
Come on come on with me baby  
Come on come on with me  
Goin' deeper

She's totally committed  
To major independence  
But she's a lady through and through  
She gives them quite a battle  
All that they can handle  
She'll bruise some  
She'll hurt some too  
But oh they love to watch her strut  
Oh they do respect her but  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Sometimes they'll want to leave her  
Just give up and leave her  
But they would never play that scene  
In spite of all her talking  
Once she starts in walking  
The lady will be all they ever dreamed  
Oh they'll love to watch her strut  
Oh they'll kill to make the cut  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Yeah love to watch her strut  
Watch her strut

I wasn't born lookin' back, I can't tell white from black  
Kesey next to me now darling, straighter than a railroad track  
I've been so high, my mind was dry  
  
I rent it out to farmers on the midnight ride  
That ain't all  
I ain't even got me a congressman I can call  
I seen 'em dumpin' garbage, in my rivers and lakes  
All right  
I seen 'em send up John Sinclair, you know  
Two joints is all it takes  
  
Then suddenly I was in a tree  
And dogs were barking up at me  
Can't you see  
I'm so damn apethetic, I can't believe I'm free  
  
As the senator he signs the bills you know  
  
And he's telling us which way we have to go  
  
Think it's time we got together and declared  
When you see them coming and you get so scared  
  
Rain is falling down, but you know I'm feeling fine  
I think I'll watch the tv set, let America steal my mind  
But you know I'm cool, Momma had a rule  
She didn't raise no fool to be true to someone else  
I'm gonna be myself  
I'm runnin' down that highway child  
  
Highway child  
Highway child  
  

She stood there bright as the sun  
On that California coast  
He was a Midwestern boy on his own  
She looked at him with those soft eyes  
So innocent and blue  
He knew right then he was too far from home  
He was too far from home  
She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach  
They watched the waves tumble over the sand  
They drove for miles and miles  
Up those twisting turning roads  
Higher and higher and higher they climbed  
  
And those Hollywood nights  
In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
In her diamonds and frills  
Oh those big city nights  
In those high rolling hills  
Above all the lights  
She had all of her skills  
  
He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good  
See some old friends, good for the soul  
She had been born with a face  
That would let her get her way  
He saw that face and he lost all control  
He had lost all control  
Night after night  
Day after day  
It went on and on  
Then came that morning he woke up alone  
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA  
Wondering if he could ever go home  
  
And those Hollywood nights  
In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
It was giving him chills  
In those big city nights  
In those high rolling hills  
Above all the lights  
With a passion that kills  
  
In those Hollywood nights  
In those Hollywood hills  
She was looking so right  
In her diamonds and frills  
Oh those big city nights  
In those high rolling hills  
Above all the lights  
She had all of her skills

Wally's getting' anxious thinkin' 'bout tonight  
Bruce is all spiffy lookin' wicked lookin' right  
Eddie's getting' spruced  
And donna's getting' loose  
They're passin' round the bottle  
And they're gettin' good and juiced  
B. G. 's winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club  
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
  
Someone bring the records  
Someone get the brew  
Someone get a house  
Buddy we'll know what to do  
Someone tell the ladies  
Someone make a deal  
If we can't find a house  
Then someone better find a field  
  
Grass is good as carpet  
Anyplace is fine  
Its time to get to rockin'  
Babe it's time to make it shine  
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'  
Dancin' till we drop  
It's time to get down and do the horizontal bop  
  
They're fillin' up the corners  
They're fillin' up the streets  
You can feel the tension  
You can almost feel the heat  
The music's gettin' louder  
The beat's gittin' fast  
Summers finally made it  
Yeah it's finally here at last  
  
The pony cars are cruisin' on woodward avenue  
Go and try to pass'em  
They'll smoke you if you do  
The whole town's shakin' from the bottom to the top  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
The busters from the country  
And the hitters from the shop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop  
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'  
Dancin' till we drop  
Everybody wants to do the horizontal bop

There's a house behind a house  
There's a dream behind a dream  
There's a heart outside a heart  
There's a hope behind a hope  
  
When two people know that it's time to go  
When do they give in  
At what point in time do they really find  
They must let it end  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin' at their hands  
As the walls keep closin' in  
As the days go on and on  
  
When two people see it can never be  
When do they give up  
When do they concede they must let it be  
Now they've had enough They've had enough  
  
Lonely faces everywhere  
Watch them starin' at their hands  
There's a house behind a house  
There's a dream behind a dream

Sometimes I get impatient  
Be she cools me without words  
And she comes so softly  
My hummingbird  
And have you heard  
I thought my life had ended  
But I found that it's just begun  
Cause she gets me where where I live  
I'd give her everything I've got to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh she's little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah she's little and she loves me  
It's my lucky day  
Hummingbird don't fly away  
When I'm feelin' wild and lonesome  
She knows just what to say  
She gives me so much understanding  
In her little way  
Lord I gotta say  
In my life I'm gonna love no other  
She's more than I deserve  
She gets me where where I live  
I'd give her everything that's mine to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh she's little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah she's little and she loves me  
It's my lucky day  
Hummingbird don't fly away

I was a rolling stone  
But now I've come back home  
I've given up that trail  
I feel no need to fail  
So take your midnight runs  
I'm hangin' up the guns  
I can't save you angelene  
  
This endless party scene  
This weekend warriors dream  
It's gotten stale for me  
It doesn't set me free  
You want a kindred soul  
Someone to say let's go  
I can't save you angelene  
  
You may find yourself out somewhere babe  
Talkin' loud tellin' ties  
Temptation's gonna get you girl  
No surprise no surprise  
  
I wanna get from here  
I wanna get myself clear  
I want the warm sun over me  
Enter a guilty plea  
Ah babe just walk away from me  
I can't save you angelene

My old friend Sirius is riding high tonight  
Shinin'down so bright on the harbor lights  
I wonder I wonder  
  
Who are these strangers on the street  
Seekin' out the heat with their eyes cast down millin' around  
I wonder I wonder  
I wonder sometimes I wonder  
  
There's a last boat comin' in ghosting on the wind  
The moon across the bay lighting his way  
I wonder It makes me wonder  
  
What's it like out there tonight far from the city lights  
Are your dreams the same  
I wonder it makes me wonder  
I wonder it makes me wonder

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady  
Would you marry me anyway?  
Would you have my baby?  
If I worked my hands in wood  
I wonder would you still love me?  
I say yes, I would, I'll put you above me  
That's what I want you to say  
And would you save my love from loneliness  
Would you save my love from sorrow, if you would  
I give you my onlyness, girl and all of my tomorrows  
If a tinker were my trade, would you still find me?  
Carrying the pots and the pans that I made  
Walking along the highway  
That long lonely highway  
If I was a carpenter, and you were a lady  
And I was just a carpenter  
Instead of a rock and roll star  
Just a carpenter, a carpenter, a carpenter  

It's a Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
It's a Mystery  
Lt's a wonder  
How we keep from  
Sinking under  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
All the nonsense  
Set before us  
Supposed to shock us  
But it bores us  
  
All the ennui  
All the replays  
All the rewrites  
All the "can't says"  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
Electron guns fire images  
They end in interstellar space  
Within the year  
  
And through it all  
We dance and starve and  
Burn and clear  
  
It's A Mystery  
How they con us  
How they sneak til  
They're upon us  
  
All the anchors  
With their helmets  
Getting ratings  
With their zealots  
  
All the pundits  
All the salesmen  
Setting snake oil  
To the nation  
  
All the specials  
Every rerun  
All the penguins  
Getting well-done  
  
It's A Mystery  
  
It's A Mystery  
How the heart beats  
How the sun shines  
How our eyes meet  
  
It's A Mystery  
It's a wonder  
How we ever  
Find each other  
  
It's A Mystery

Just about the time I think I've had it  
Everything I've planned has fallen through  
Just about the time the whole thing's crumblin' in  
And I can't hold back no matter what I do  
And just about the time I feel like screamin'  
And findin' me a wall to punch right through  
I look up and I just can't help smilin'  
It's you  
  
You're the only reason I'm still here, girl  
You're the only one who keeps me sane  
Somethin' 'bout the way you've learned to calm me down  
And see me through the anger and the pain  
And just about the time I'm standin' on the edge  
And searchin' for a light to see me through  
I look up and I can see it shinin'  
It's you  
  
I don't really claim to understand it  
I just know the way you make me feel  
No one has to tell me I'm a lucky man  
No one has to tell me that it's real  
  
And just about the time I think I've lost it  
I'm lookin' for a hole to crawl into  
I look up and I just can't believe it  
It's you  
It's you  
  
I look up  
And honey, it's you  
Gettin' me through  
Keepin' it new

Words and music by bob seger  
  
I was born at the break of dawning  
In the last days of the last great war  
My father was not in the fighting  
And my mother never had to mourn  
  
I was raised, raised and taught to hurry  
I've been hurrying and worrying all my days  
But now as I'm getting older  
I think I'm learning how to run the race  
And with you by my side, your heart close to mine,  
I've got time  
  
I used to wake up every morning  
And lie there far too long  
I had no reason for living  
Everything I did was wrong  
With you, and your faith in me,  
Oh, how you made my whole life shine  
And I've got time  
You, and your faith in me,  
Little girl, you made my whole life shine  
And I've got time  

He killed many a man  
And he roamed over the Scarsdale range  
Robbin' from the rich  
And givin' to the poor  
He was dark and cold and full of rage  
Oh yes he was, sing with me  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
And three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
  
It was on a Saturday night  
When Jesse was at home  
Talking to old railroad Jed  
Along come Robert Ford  
Like a thief in the night  
And he shot poor Jesse in the back  
  
Poor Jesse had a wife  
To mourn for his life  
Three children  
They were oh so brave  
But that dirty little coward  
He went and shot Mr. Howard  
Laid poor Jesse in his grave yeah  
He lays  
Six feet under the ground

Jody girl, Jody girl, spend your time today  
Watching clocks, spin the hours away  
Jody girl, you know the world is  
Going 'round all day  
Thinking back to the things you used to say  
  
Didn't they put you on a pedestal  
When first you met?  
Sure was some honeymoon  
Ain't it hard to forget?  
Whatever happened to that crazy boy  
With the love light in his eye?  
Used to bring you flowers every day  
  
Now you sit here, on a cloudy afternoon  
Watching the soap opera on the TV  
Your old man's working  
And your kids are out playing  
And you ain't feeling too free  
You keep thinking back,  
Thinking back to high school  
Those high school days  
All the wild, wild, wild good times you had  
All the boyfriends, boyfriends knocking at your door  
  
Jody girl, Jody girl, spend your time today  
Watching clocks spin the hours away  
Jody girl, you know the world is  
Goin' by all day  
Thinking back  
To before you promised to stay  
Didn't they put you on a pedestal  
When first you met?  
Sure was some honeymoon  
  
Ain't it hard to forget

Words and music by Bob Seger  
Be-side of "Like A Rock" and on the soundtrack to the movie "About Last Night"  
When the sun came up this morning  
And she smiled her smile for me  
I felt it for the first time  
Something deep inside of me  
So you can take your midnight ramblin' boys  
And you can keep your winding roads  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside  
Oh there's an easiness about her  
There's a softness in her way  
But she gets me through the hard times  
We get closer everyday  
I know I'll never be alone now boys  
Cause even if I'm far away  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside  
Yeah  
And I don't know what I did to deserve her  
But I'll tell you this my friend  
I'm never gonna lose her  
Never gonna lose her  
Cause every night  
She's livin' inside my heart now  
Livin' inside  
  

Well I wish I had a nickel for every time I fell  
And blamed somebody else  
I'd give a ton of money to the ones I've hurt  
And I'd still be sittin' pretty well  
I've spent years losin' touch of what's right and what's real  
Caught up in these missions of my own  
And you're tellin' me you think I've done so damn well  
While we're sittin' here a thousand miles from home  
There's a hole in your wisdom, a hole in your sky  
Two holes in your head where the light's supposed to get by  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
So many times I've seen chances disappear  
I hesitate and watch them slip away  
Like the time I fail to spend with the ones I love  
And it's gone as sure as yesterday  
All these users and fakers, big time takers  
Manipulating everyone they see  
I get caught up in their schemes and their useless dreams  
And the only one I have to blame is me  
I get turned 'round and twisted, pulled left and right  
I can see where I'm goin', but I can't see the light  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Take a different road  
And start again  
  
I can sit here, in the back half of my life  
And wonder when the other shoe will fall  
Or I can stand up, point myself home  
And see if I've learned anything at all  
Anything at all  
  
Mediocrity's easy, the good things take time  
The great need commitment, right down the line  
  
Time to lock and load  
Come in from the cold  
Pay these debts I owe  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Time to get control  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load  
Time to get control  
Time to search the soul  
And start again  
  
I've been down this road  
I've seen things get old  
Stand up, get bold  
And start it all again  
  
Time to lock and load

As the sand dunes of time march on  
The wind blows the storms to the shore  
Sadness and loneliness hand in hand  
Lord I feel no more  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
I'm lost in a world with love all around  
Standing there like a pillar of salt  
Don't know the day, my hair's turning grey  
Ooh is the tide coming to take my blues away  
  
Loneliness is a feeling  
Loneliness is a feeling  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
When she tells you your love was a sin  
You lie in your bed all alone  
And all the children come in to your heart  
Lord I feel no more  
Loneliness is a feeling  
  
Loneliness, loneliness  
Loneliness, loneliness  
Loneliness, loneliness  
Loneliness, loneliness

So lonely, I'm a lonely man from Gainesville  
(He ain't got nowhere to go), got nowhere to go  
Said I don't want doin' wrong over this land  
(Yes his blood is growin' cold), cold, gettin colder  
  
Yeah, I believe that all the people on the street  
Take the time, time to stare  
Not lonely in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere  
Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander aimlessly  
Lord it can't be  
I don't want it to be my destiny  
Lord, woman come an help me  
  
Oh I wish that I could find me a turkey  
(all he needs is good sweet love)  
Yeah gotta go quack quack  
Oh baby I would know in my heart I would be lucky  
(That's the only way to go)  
Yeah, be fine  
  
Yeah, I wanna tell you that all the people on that street  
They take the time to stare  
I can see in their eyes, for thinkin' that I'm nowhere  
Lord, I wasn't born, wasn't born to wander 'round aimlessly  
Can't be, can't be  
Don't want it to be my destiny Lord, take ahold of me  
  
Sure don't wanna be a lonely man

Politician 'bout to make his speech  
Signal for attention, please  
Then he shuffled his notes  
And wiped his sweating brow  
I looked at my friend next to me  
And we don't dare agree  
Before this is over  
We'll wish we woulda left right now  
'Cause it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it looks like he might throw in a little dancin', too  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy  
We got better things to listen to  
Lady from a church bizarre  
Was smiling from her head to her feet  
All the way down to her feet  
That she couldn't see  
She started speeking her piece  
I said "Stop, Wait a minute, please  
Before you start talkin'  
I wish you'd please listen to me."  
'Cause it sounds like a long song comin'  
And though some of the things you say might be true  
It still sounds like a long song comin'  
And baby, listen lady, I got better things to listen to  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it looks like you might throw in a little dancin', too  
Yes, it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy, I got better things to listen to  
Say, so it sounds like a long song comin'  
And it sounds like some just might be true  
Still it sounds like a long song comin'  
And buddy, listen buddy, I got better things to listen to  
And buddy, listen buddy, we got better things to listen to  
  

Well the big train keeps on rolling  
Rolling on down the track  
And the way she's moving buddy  
I don't believe she's a-coming back  
  
The fireman's smoking a big cigar  
Sipping Lafite Rothschild Bordeaux  
And the engineer's so happy  
He's just a-letting that whistle blow  
  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling on proud and fine  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
Down that long twin silver line  
  
Well she just blazed through Chicago  
Nonstop to L. A.  
And the way she's steaming buddy  
You better not get in her way  
She's got the finest fastest pulling twin diesels  
She's got ninety three cars in tow  
She's gonna be on time  
All the way down the line  
Come the rain hail sleet or snow  
  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling on right on time  
She keeps a-rolling  
She keeps a-rolling  
Down that long twin silver line  
Rolling on down the line  
And she just passed in Chicago  
Rolling into Kansas too  
Rolling into Denver  
Doing all she'll do  
And she hangs a big left in Salt Lake City  
  
Southwest to the Nevada line  
Rolling into California  
Right on time  
Rolling on down the line

You hit the street, you feel them staring  
You know they hate you you can feel their eyes a glarin'  
Because you're different, because you're free  
Because you're everything deep down they wish they could be  
[Chorus:]  
You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)  
Too many people lookin back  
You're lookin back (lookin back) they're lookin back (lookin back)  
Too many people lookin back  
They watch the news, see young men dying  
They watch them bleedin' and listen to them lyin'  
And if they're normal if they can see  
They just reach out and change the channel on the TV  
[Chorus]  
When they could vote, and end the war  
They're much too busy fittin' locks upon the back door  
Give you a foxhole, a place to hide  
Cause when the war come the cops'll be on their side  
[Chorus]  
  

Louise Lyrics  
Now Louise she is an outlaw, in the year of seventy one  
She's got Levi bells and long straight hair  
She's got a gun  
Her folks they didn't under-stand why she could'nt  
Get her homework done, mmm  
Her father is a preacher, her mother's an ex-nun  
  
Now Louise she likes to boogie, down at the old ballroom  
She's got a crazy hophead boyfriend, digs freon balloons  
They ride on his Harley from the morning till the late afternoon  
They get stoned in the evening, and make love beneath the moon  
  
Now the old folks who are listenin'  
Prob'ly think think this song's obscene  
Say your children aren't like that  
Say my words are way off theme  
Well Louise she's just an  
Average product of the American dream  
I concede she's kind of naive but  
After all she's only thirteen  
  
Ride on Louise, ride on, ride on

When you're down, and confused  
And you don't remember who you been talking to  
Concentration, slips away  
Because your baby, is so far away  
  
Well there's a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with  
  
Don't be angry, don't be sad  
When you sit down and think about  
All those good times that we've had  
There's a girl, right next to you  
And she's just waiting, for something to do  
  
Well there's a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
And if you can't be with the one you love  
Love the one you're with  
Love the one you're with  
  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
Do do doot, Do do doot  
  
Turn your heartache, right into joy  
She's a girl, and you're a boy  
Get it together and make it nice  
You ain't gonna need no more advice

There's a distant sound to the outward bound  
On a lonesome windy night  
A restless sigh as it fades away  
A longing at first light  
There's a sad resolve that it's all gone wrong  
Yet before you turn to go  
It comes to you  
It's really true  
It's your love that's last to know  
  
Well we take our time we're polite and kind  
To the strangers that we meet  
And the ones who share the ones who really care  
They don't seem to make us feel complete  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
We're all such worldly souls  
Till we find one day  
We've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know  
  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
We're all such worldly souls  
Then we find one day  
That we've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know  
Then we find one day  
That we've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know

I remember standing on the corner at midnight  
Trying to get my courage up  
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown  
I loved to watch her do her stuff  
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep  
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers  
I used to watch 'em through the glass  
Well I'd stand outside at closing time  
Just to watch her walk on past  
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet  
As she made her way alone down that empty street  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat  
I drift back in time and I find my feet  
Down on Mainstreet  
Down on Mainstreet

The big line moved one mile an hour  
So loud it really hurt  
The big line moved so loud  
It really hurt  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We filled conveyors  
We met production  
Foremen didn't waste words  
We met production  
Foremen didn't waste words  
We were young and proud  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
They were long and low and sleek and fast  
They were all you ever heard  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
Now the years have flown and the plants have changed  
And you're lucky if you work  
The big line moves but you're lucky if you work  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
They were long and low and sleek and fast  
They were classic in a word  
Back in '55  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were young and proud  
We were makin' thunderbirds  
We were young and sure  
We were makin' thunderbirds

Shaky Davey's got a twelve gauge in his hand  
It's sawed off to the limit  
He's got a vague plan  
There's this liquor store on Madison  
There's another one down on Washington square  
He's pretty sure no one's ever seen him  
Down around there  
  
The first one's bird shot the next four are double aught buck  
The last one's a slug just for good luck  
He's got his works in his pocket  
He wants to score as soon as he's done  
He can't wait to get straight to get long gone  
  
He puts on his long coat scribbles off a short note  
Sits himself down and waits for the sun to go down  
  
It's right around midnight and there's still too damn many people on this
street  
He's walked all the way from Battery Park he's got sweaty hands and burnin'
feet  
He's desperate for a fix  
His body's screamin' "Get me high"  
He bursts through the door and lets one fly  
  
Sunrise in the park and Davey's cold as stone  
He got some bad merchandise and he was all alone  
Two more unsolved mysteries a iot of paper pushed around  
Most folks are just wakin' up in this great big town

I'm gonna tell you a story 'bout Mary Lou  
You know the kind of woman make a fool of you  
She make a young man itch  
She man an old man faint  
The way she took my money was a crying shame  
Mary Lou she took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou she took my diamond ring  
Mary Lou she took the keys to my cadillac car  
Jumped in my kitty and drove off far  
  
Left me stranded in Kalamazoo  
Making her fortune off a fool like you  
She married a rich man  
Had a dozen kids  
Drove that cat until he flipped his lid  
  
Come back into town about a week ago  
Told me she was sorry that she hurt me so  
I had a fifty-five Ford and a two dollar bill  
The way she looked at that man gave me a chill  
Mary Lou

Maybe today  
Maybe today you'll find your love.  
Maybe tonight  
You'll find the one you're dreaming of.  
Maybe it's time  
Maybe today you're gonna find your way  
Maybe he's here  
Maybe she's here  
Maybe this is your day.  
Maybe today  
Maybe someone will touch your heart.  
Maybe tonight  
Maybe your life will find a start.  
Maybe tonight  
Just one more smile  
And you'll be on your way.  
Open your eyes  
Open your heart  
Maybe this is your day.  
Maybe today  
You'll never know until you try

They saw the lights on the horizon  
Out of the seas it came shinin'  
The buildings so high  
They seemed to touch the sky  
Miami, Oh Miami  
  
They felt the warm breezes blowing  
From off the strange new ocean  
They reached the end safe  
It was a new day  
Miami. Oh Miami  
  
Oh, it must've seemed  
Something from a dream  
Shinin' through the night  
All those city lights  
Staring at the shore  
Hungry, tired and worn  
Could it really be  
Were they really free  
  
And so they came  
A hundred thousand  
To find a way of life  
They could believe in  
Far away from home  
With nothing of their own  
To Miami, Oh Miami  
  
They saw the lights  
Miami

Words and music by greg allman  
I got to run to keep from hidin'  
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'  
I got one more silver dollar  
But I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I got only the clothes I'm wearin'  
And the road goes on forever  
I got one more silver dollar  
And I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I own all the clothes I'm wearin'  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharin'  
Got me one more silver dollar  
And I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Come on  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Midnight, midnight rider

Here come the mountain, Here come the hill  
Here come the valley and the Shoreline still  
I know 'em well, know well  
Mongrel, on the hard sell  
With a ?, hot assed, inkwell  
Lord, But I, I can't leave with the blues  
Through endless days, and endless nights  
Spare my creator, scream for my rights

Mongrel on the Hard sell, with a ?,  
Hot assed, Inkwell  
But I won't leave you with the blues no  
Come down to ? (Wah-doo-day)

I used to be a very carefree man,  
A loving man of the world.  
Yeah, I would still be except for the time  
When I met ya, little girl.  
Say, I've tried and I've tried but I just can't.  
You sure got a hold on me.  
Ah, your good, good lovin' is makin' me faint,  
Mama, please don't set me free.  
Because I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
Oh, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.  
(Need ya, need ya)  
You got that kinda air that drives me insane  
And sometime ya sure got me new.  
Ah, sometimes I feel like knockin' you down,  
But I would never pull that scene.  
Though I get tired, I know that you know  
That I'd never do you wrong.  
'Cause when it's late and I feel down, turn the lights on low  
And I will hold things in my soul.  
'Cause I need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah.

Words and music by bob seger  
There's the neon sky that I know so well  
There's the smoky room where I chose to dwell  
Though I hear your heart many miles away  
The neon sky tells me I must stay  
  
Through the windy field of another land  
I have seen your face, girl, I have held your hand  
Though I should be there, with you there today  
The neon sky knows that I must stay  
  
Cause the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been  
  
On a dusty stage, many years ago,  
I chose my road, still I hope you know  
That there'll come a day with the neon sky  
When we'll walk into the sun, you and I  
  
Yes so he calls, beckons unto me  
From the empty hall, from the galleries  
And so I must go, leave you here today  
Cause the neon sky orders me away  
Yes, the devil's red, but his money's green  
That's where I'm from, oh, that's where I've been  

Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, set 'em up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress babe, I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams  
Lost or thrown away  
Never miss the shuffle on an overflowin' day  
When love needs a transfusion  
Shoot it full of wine  
Fishin' for a good time  
Starts with throwin' in your line  
  
Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, set 'em up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress babe, I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky

I was a little too tall  
Could've used a few pounds  
Tight pants points hardly reknown  
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes  
And points all her own sitting way up high  
Way up firm and high  
  
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy  
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy  
Workin' on mysteries without any clues  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news  
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime  
In the sweet summertime  
  
We weren't in love oh no far from it  
We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit  
We were just young and restless and bored  
Living by the sword  
And we'd steal away every chance we could  
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods  
I used her she used me  
But neither one cared  
We were getting our share  
  
Workin' on our night moves  
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues  
Workin' on out night moves  
In the summertime  
And oh the wonder  
Felt the lightning  
And we waited on the thunder  
Waited on the thunder  
  
I woke last night to the sound of thunder  
How far off I sat and wondered  
Started humming a song from 1962  
Ain't it funny how the night moves  
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose  
Strange how the night moves  
With autumn closing in

She says she wants to see me  
She's tired of stayin in  
She says she wants some rockin'  
Shes got the right man  
I'm gonna take her ridin'  
Out past the edge of town  
Out where the wind's still racin' free on the heartland  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Can't wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Ooh, nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine - tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight  
  
I'm movin' in to action  
I'm shinin' up mt wheels  
I'm tryin' hard to think of the right things to say now  
The sun is slowly sinkin'  
Here comes a great big moon  
I'm startin' up my engine  
It won't be long now  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Can't wait for nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
  
I'll be there nine tonight  
Ooh, nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be my baby  
She might be mine - tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
Nine tonight  
She might be mine tonight

Headin' in or headin' out  
Standing on the shore  
Pause a moment to reflect  
Which trip costs you more  
Between the ever restless crowds  
  
And the silence of your room  
Spend an hour in no man's land  
You'll be leaving soon  
  
Victims come and victims go  
There's always lots to spare  
  
One victim lives the tragedy  
One victim stops to stare  
  
And still another walks on by  
Pretending not to see  
They're all out there in no man's land  
'Cause it's the safest place to be  
  
But sanctuary never comes  
Without some kind of risk  
Illusions without freedom  
  
Never quite add up to bliss  
The haunting and the haunted  
Play a game no one can win  
The spirits come at midnight  
  
And by dawn they're gone again  
And so it seems our destiny  
To search and never rest  
To ride that ever changing wave  
That never seems to crest  
To shiver in the darkest night  
Afraid to make a stand  
And then go back and do our time  
Out there in no man's land

Are you sorry when the lights begin to fade  
Are you sorry for the promises you made  
For the burden of the ones who had to fall  
When you didn't see the writing on the wall  
It was forty years ago and I was young  
And the jungle not the desert heard the guns  
Someone said they had a secret plan  
And the rest of us were told to understand  
Well I don't want this, no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
Tomorrow is the price for yesterday  
A billion waves won't wash the truth away  
Someday you'll be ordered to explain  
No one gets to walk between the rain  
And I don't want this, no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
No I don't want this no I don't want this  
I have had enough no more  
No more  

Kick off your shoes, throw away your blues  
You paid your dues, Noah  
  
Summer is here, why interfere  
Go drink a beer, Noah  
  
You must realize that you need something  
Resynthesize your own ego  
You must recognise that life's just a circle  
So let's go on with the show  
  
Hoist up your sail, go kill a whale  
Don't look so pale, Noah  
One two three four  
  
Now let's go on with the show  
  
Kennan was right, you're black and white  
You're left and right, Noah  
Remember old Cain, it's all in vein  
It's starting to rain, Noah

Just take those old records off the shelf  
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Don't try to take me to a disco  
You'll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
Ooh  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul ooh  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
Won't go to hear them play a tango  
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul  
There's only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll  
Call me a relic, call me what you will  
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill  
Today's music ain't got the same soul  
I like that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock and roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
With that old time rock 'n' roll  
  
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll.

When I was a little girl, I had a rag-doll  
The only doll I've ever owned.  
Now I love you just the way I love that rag-doll,  
But only now the love has grown.  
  
And it get's stronger everyway...  
And It get's deeper let me say...  
And It get's higher day by day...  
(corus)  
Ah, do I love you my oh my?  
River deep - Mountain High.  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  
And If I lost you would I cry?  
Oh, Baby.  
Baby. Baby. Baby.  
  
When you where a young boy did you have a puppy?  
That alway's followed you around.  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy.  
No I'll never let you down  
And it goes on and on, like a river flows,  
And it gets sweeter, heaven knows,  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows.  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And, I love you baby like a robin loves to sing.  
Oh I love you baby like a school boy loves his pie.  
Oh I love you honey rivers deep mountains high.

So you're a little bit older and a lot less bolder  
Than you used to be  
So you used to shake 'em down  
But now you stop and think about your dignity  
So now sweet sixteens turned thirty-one  
You get to feelin' weary when the work days done  
Well all you got to do is get up and into your kicks  
If you're in a fix  
Come back baby  
Rock and roll never forgets  
You better get yourself a partner  
Go down to the concert or the local bar  
Check the local newspapers  
Chances are you won't have to go too far  
Yeah the rafters will be ringing cause the beat's so strong  
The crowd will be swaying and singing along  
And all you got to do is get in into the mix  
If you need a fix  
Come back baby  
Rock and roll never forgets  
Oh the bands still playing it loud and lean  
Listen to the guitar player making it scream  
All you got to do is just make that scene tonight  
Heh tonight  
  
Well now sweet sixteens turned thirty-one  
Feel a little tired feeling under the gun  
Well all Chuck's children are out there playing his licks  
Get into your kicks  
Come back baby  
Rock 'n Roll never forgets  
Said you can come back baby  
Rock 'n Roll never forgets

Took a look down a westbound road right away I made my choice  
Headed out to my big two wheeler I was tired of my own voice  
Took a bead on the northern plains and just rolled that power on  
  
Twelve hours out of Mackinaw City stopped in a bar to have a brew  
Met a girl and we had a few drinks and I told her what I'd decided to do  
She looked out the window a long long moment then she looked into my eyes  
She didn't have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin'  
  
Roll roll me away won't you roll me away tonight  
I too am lost I feel double crossed  
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right  
We never even said a word we just walked out and got on that bike  
And we rolled  
And we rolled clean out of sight  
  
We rolled across the high plains  
Deep into the mountains  
Felt so good to me  
Finally feelin' free  
Somewhere along a high road  
The air began to turn cold  
She said she missed her home  
I headed on alone  
  
Stood alone on a mountain top starin' out at the Great Divide  
I could go east I could go west it was all up to me to decide  
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin' and my soul began to rise  
And pretty soon  
My heart was singin'  
  
Roll roll away I'm gonna roll me away tonight  
Gotta keep rollin' gotta keep ridin' keep searchin' till I find what's right  
And as the sunset faded I spoke to the faintest first starlight  
And I said next time  
Next time  
We'll get it right

She's quite the mediator  
A smoother operator you will never see  
She'll see you later  
And no one dares disobey her openly  
  
She knows music, I know music too you see  
She's got the power, the teen queen Rosalie  
  
Rosalie, Rosalie  
She's got the plastic  
Comes from all the corner's corners of the world  
So fantastic  
She's everybody's favorite little record girl  
  
She knows music, I know music too you see  
She's got the power, she's got the tower  
Rosalie, Rosalie  
  
From Chattanooga, to good old Bogalusa  
You can hear them fine  
She makes her choices  
And then you best be smilin' when it's choosin' time  
  
Knows music  
No music till you see  
She's got the power, got the tower, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie  
Knows music, knows music, knows music  
Rosalie, Rosalie

I need some wisdom  
I need some truth  
I need some beauty  
I need some proof  
  
And in the meantime  
I need a place to hide  
If I had you babe I'd be satisfied  
  
Went to the ocean  
Stood in the surf  
I felt the water  
I felt the earth  
I head the angels  
They couldn't be denied  
If I had you babe  
I'd be satisfied  
  
Who's gonna beleive me  
I'm a broken down dog  
But I can still snarl with the best  
The train is leavin  
We can catch it if we run  
We can leave it all behind  
This utter emptiness  
  
You are the reason  
That I was born  
You are the answer  
I'm lookin for  
All of the others  
Just stood around and lied  
If I had you babe  
I'd be satisfied  
  
Ooooh yeah  
Awwwh yeah  
Awwwh

I seen you walkin' every day on your way, school  
I seen you talkin' to the children  
I seen you talkin' to, ooh yeah  
School teacher, yeah  
In the boiler beneath the building  
And I'm so lonely, I'm lonely, yeah  
Go to your parties, goin' to your meeting  
You look so busy, are you busy? Yeah  
Na na na na na, school teacher  
The day goes on so fast, fast, fast  
School teacher, yeah

And you know somethin', I'd like to know ya, yeah

I'd like to know ya, I'd like to know ya, yeah  
Oh yeah, oh yeah na, na, na,  
School teacher please don't walk on past, past  
School teacher, yeah  
Where ya gonna go last?  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah  
  

Seen a lot of walls, seen a lot of halls  
Got a lot of calls, late at night  
Seen a lot of doors, seen a lot of floors  
Done a lot of chores, late at night  
So don't come in here walkin'  
So innocent and talkin'  
Tryin' to make conversation  
Cause I know and you know  
That I know what you're here for  
Don't tell me 'bout your father  
Your sister or your mother  
Your great big brother  
Not tonight  
Don't want to hear about your hang ups  
Don't want know your favorite movies  
Don't want to hear about other rock bands  
Not tonight  
So don't come in here walkin'  
So innocent and talkin'  
Tryin' to make conversation  
'Cause you know and I know  
That I know what you're here for  
Seen a lot of floors  
Seen a lot of doors  
Done a lot of chores  
Late at night  
  

No matter what you think you pull you'll find it's not enough  
No matter who you think you know you won't get through  
It's a given L.A. law  
Someone's faster on the draw  
No matter where you hide I'm comin' after you yeah  
  
No matter how the race is run it always ends the same  
Another room without a view awaits downtown  
You can shake me for a while  
Live it up in style  
No matter what you do I'm gonna take you down  
  
[Chorus]  
Shakedown  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
Everybody wants into the crowded line  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
You're busted  
Let down  
Your guard  
Honey, just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright  
Breakdown  
Takedown  
You're busted  
  
This is a town where everyone is reachin' for the top  
This is a place where second best will never do  
It's OK to want to shine  
But once you step across that line  
No matter where you hide I'm comin' after you  
  
[Chorus]

Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know what he wants  
You don't know if he cries at night  
You don't know if he don't  
Where nothing comes easy, old nightmares are real  
Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know how he feels  
  
But once inside a woman's heart  
A man must keep his head  
Heaven opens up the door  
Where angels fear to tread  
Some men go crazy, some men go slow  
Some men go just where they want  
Some men never go  
  
But, oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon  
  
Everywhere is all around  
Comfort in the crowd  
Stanger's faces all round  
Laughing right out loud  
Hey, watch where you're goin', step light on old toes  
Until you've been beside a man  
You don't know who he knows  
  
But, oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon  
Oh, blame it on midnight  
Ooh, shame on the moon

Sixteen years and she lets 'em show  
Little bitty queen dancin' on the floor  
High heeled shoes keep her right on time  
Body makes a little boy lose his mind  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Music's hot and the night is loud  
Rhythm from the band burnin' through the crowd  
Little sixteen she's goin' strong  
She loves to rock and roll it all night long  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddy's son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin' numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone it'll be alright  
  
Workin' hard tryin' to make it last  
She's too young to even have a past  
The only child of a mother who prayed  
That her daughter wouldn't never turn out this way  
And she knows  
She Can't Do Anything Wrong  
  
Every daddy's son wants a closer look  
Every boy want to try to set his hook  
She likes playin' numbers if it takes all night  
If she goes home alone it'll be alright  
  
Sixteen years and she lets 'em show  
Little bitty queen dancin' on the floor  
She knows She Can't Do Anything Wrong

Well, it's shinin' brightly  
It's lookin' pretty right  
From the early morning  
Till real real late at night  
It's lookin'pretty good today  
The dark clouds are rollin' away  
Oh and it's shinin' brightly  
And I think it's gonna be okay  
  
Well, it's startin' to feet good again  
You and me  
Startin'to feel real good lady  
Just the way it used to be  
Futures lookin' good at last  
Rough times are all in the post  
Oh and it's shinin' brightly  
And I think it's gonna last  
I think it's gonna last  
Oh yeah  
  
Well, it's shinin' brightly  
I don't think there's too much doubt  
This time baby  
I think we got it all worked out  
Lookin' pretty good today  
The dark clouds are rollin' away  
And it's shinin' brightly  
I think we're on our way  
Its a nice change  
Feeling pretty good at last  
Rough times are all in the post  
Oh, and it's shinin' brightly  
I think it's gonna last  
Oh, it's gonna be okay  
Okay

"Tell me quick" said Old Mcfee  
"What's this all have to do with me?"  
"I've spent all my time at sea a loner."  
  
"Is there something else I should know?"  
"Something hidden down below the level of your conversation?"  
We he turned away before the answer  
Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear  
It became to clear  
So it went as we put out  
I was left in constant doubt  
Everything I asked about seemed private  
  
The captain strolled the bridge one night  
I stopped him in the evening light  
To ask him would it be all right to join him  
  
But he stood there like some idol  
And he listened like some temple  
And then he turned away  
  
All along the fateful coast  
We moved silent like a ghost  
The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us  
The wind came building from the cold northwest  
And soon the waves began to crest  
Crashing cross the forward deck  
All hands lost  
  
I alone survived the sinking  
I alone possessed the tools  
On that ship of fools

It was a curious sight to me  
A castle older than a redwood tree  
Once lived in by royalty  
Who taxed and raped the land  
  
Mostly now it was stone and dust  
Long damp halls and smells of must  
Faded walls and ancient rust  
Built on shifting sand  
And I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To smash that sucker down  
  
It was a marvelous sight to see  
A redhead workin' in a brasserie  
Five foot nine built to a tee  
Eyes so blue and bright  
All the drunks were just circling round  
I drank water and held my ground  
Later on we did the town  
And we caught every sight  
  
Cause I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To follow her down  
Sightseein' freein' my soul  
Sightseein' leavin' my soul  
  
It was a magical sight to me  
And Yves Tanguy in a gallery  
The 30's looking back at me  
As if he really knew  
I marveled at the artistry  
Predating or technology  
The vision there for all to see  
Bold and strong and true  
  
And I wanted I wanted I wanted  
To take that painting home  
I wanted I wanted  
I wanted to take that vision home

Words and music by bob seger  
I woke up with this feeling  
There was something I wanted to say  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
Lately girl I've been dreamin'  
Dreamin' 'bout you all through the day  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
Hope the words will be right  
When I see you tonight,  
You'll know how I feel.  
I'm no longer alone,  
Think I've found me a home  
And I think it's real.  
  
I woke up with this feeling  
Haven't felt it for quite some time,  
So I wrote you a song.  
  
All these thoughts I've been dreaming  
Somehow I've got to make them right,  
Got to make them belong.  
Everytime that you're here  
Everytime that you're near  
Everything is real.  
I'm no longer alone,  
Think I've found me a home,  
And I think it's real,  
So I wrote you a song.  

Someday, I know I'll find that road  
And I, will pay back all I've owed  
Someday  
Somehow, I'll bear that heavy load  
  
I know, I've never been the best  
Never quite kept up with the rest  
  
But someday you'll see I've reached that crest  
Someday  
  
And then we'll smile  
And toast our glasses high  
And the world will know  
You and I  
Till then in spite of all I've done  
  
  
I'll keep on reachin for the sun  
And someday we'll be number one  
Someday  
  

Sometimes I move in chains  
But I never feel the pain  
I wish I could explain  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it goes so fast  
I try to make some moment last  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes  
  
I get this infernal need  
I'm losin' ground  
Gotta make up speed  
Right now  
Something's there just out of reach  
Something I'm not sure I need  
Something I just can't let be  
Touchin' something deep in me  
  
Sometimes burnin' bright  
In the dark heart of the night  
I think I see a light  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I hear the sound  
Of some night train leavin' town  
I want to chase it down  
Sometimes  
  
I want to catch that train  
I want to get on board  
I want to ride away to some distant shore  
Right now  
I want to leave behind this hopeless maze  
Of broken dreams and endless days  
I want to wake up some place far away  
I wanna wake up to a brand new day  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I move in chains  
But I never feel the pain  
I wish I could explain  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it goes so fast  
I try to make some moment last  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes  
  
I watch it slippin' past  
Sometimes

Somewhere tonight  
Someone's reachin' out to someone who's refusin'  
Someone's tired of all the reasons someone's using  
Someone doesn't understand  
  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's thinkin' back to someone who got closer  
Someone's realizin' something's really over  
Someone's thinkin' it's too late  
Someone's thinkin' it's too late  
  
There's a cold wind blowin' from the north  
And the summer birds are leavin'  
As the sun slips ever further south  
The lakes will soon be freezin'  
And the ice will claim the empty shores  
Where the one's in love went walkin'  
And the hard blue skies will shiver  
As the winter clouds come stalkin'  
  
And unless you find someone to hold  
Unless someone starts carin'  
Unless you find the warmth you need  
Unless someone starts sharin'  
When the long, dark nights come closin' in  
And the winter winds come howlin'  
You don't know if you'll make it  
Without someone you can count on  
  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's packin' up and someone's really leavin'  
  
Someone's not quite sad - only disbelievin'  
Someone's walkin' out the door  
Someone's walkin' out the door

I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
When I'm lonely still I know  
He'll forgive me yes it's so  
I've been lonely but not lonelier than Him  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
When I'm sorry I remember  
That he loves me  
And I'm better  
I've been sorry not sorryer than Him  
It doesn't matter if I'm wrong it doesn't matter if I'm right  
He's with me at the break of dawn  
He's every star that shines at night  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
When I'm happy skies are blue  
I forget him still it's true  
I've been happy but not happier than Him  
But not sorrier than Him  
But not lonelier than Him  
  
  

I'm headin' to Atlanta  
Leavin' on a Delta plane  
Uh huh, all right  
I'm headin' to Atlanta  
Leavin'on a Delta plane  
Uh huh, good good  
I'll carry my trenchcoat  
But I sure don't think it's gonna rain  
Ah ah, oh no  
The gold is in my pockets  
Caps and tabs are in my sleves  
Ah ha  
Gold is in my pockets  
Caps and tabs are in my sleeves  
Oh yeah  
Stand to make a thousand  
If I can just get past the thief  
Oh yeah, oh there they are, ohhh  
I'm a junk runner honey  
Hotter than the noonday sun  
Oh mercy  
I'm a junk runner honey  
Hotter than the noonday sun  
Oh yeah, come true  
If I don't make Orlando  
You know my runnin' days are done  

You always won every time you placed a bet  
You're still damn good  
No one's gotten to you yet  
Every time they were sure they had you caught  
You were quicker than they thought  
You'd just turn your back and walk  
  
You always said  
The cards would never do you wrong  
The trick you said  
Was never play the game too long  
A gambler's share  
The only risk that you would take  
The only loss you could forsake  
The only bluff you couldn't fake  
  
And you're still the same  
I caught up with you yesterday  
Moving game to game  
No one standing in your way  
Turning on the charm  
Long enough to get you by  
You're still the same  
You still aim high  
  
There you stood  
Everybody watched you play  
I just turned and walked away  
I had nothing left to say  
'Cause you're still the same  
You're still the same  
Moving game to game  
Some things never change  
You're still the same

The crowd without a face  
Begins to fill the space  
In the arena  
Flashlights at his feet  
The lion from the street  
Awaits the Christians  
Blinding flash of light  
A single strobe ignites the night  
  
The smoke begins to rise  
A sea of staring eyes  
Gaze on the sunburst  
His weapon at his side  
He flashes it with pride  
Before his legions  
Fires begin to rage  
And they engulf the stage  
All right  
Bring on the night  
  
He's in complete control  
He's stepping proud and bold  
And everything he touches  
Turns to gold  
He's got girls by the score  
He's got 'em screaming for more  
But when they get too close  
He bars the door  
  
He makes his great escape  
Leaves them in his wake  
Without a warning  
The ritual is done  
A night no longer young  
Fades into morning  
The sun begins to rise  
As he begins to close his eyes

She packed up her bags and she took off down the road  
Left me here stranded with the bills she owed  
She gave me a false address  
Took off with my American Express  
Sunspot Baby  
She sure had me way outguessed  
  
She left me here stranded like a dog out in the yard  
Charged up a fortune on my credit card  
She used my address and my name  
Man that was sure unkind  
Sunspot Baby  
She sure has a real good time  
  
I looked in Miami  
I looked in Negril  
The closest I came was a month old bill  
I checked the Bahamas and they said she was gone  
I can't understand why she did me so wrong  
  
But she packed up her bags  
And she took off down the road  
Said she was going to visit sister Flo  
She used my address and my name  
And man that was sure unkind  
Sunspot Baby  
I'm gonna catch up sometime  
Sure had a real good time

You Take A Chance on an airplane  
You Take A Chance when you cross the street  
You Take A Chance when you love somebody  
When you're standing near the heat  
  
You Take A Chance when you're honest  
You Take A Chance when you tell lies  
You Take A Chance when you trust somebody  
When you look 'em in the eyes  
  
Take A Chance on me

I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
You Take A Chance when you're indecisive  
You Take A Chance when you're aloof  
You Take A Chance when you judge somebody  
When you've really got no proof  
  
You Take A Chance when you refuse to hear  
You Take A Chance when you're unkind  
You Take A Chance when you refuse to grow up baby  
You end up left behind  
  
Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
You Take A Chance when you're ruthless  
You Take A Chance when you're cruel  
You Take A Chance when you make a vow babe  
To be nobody's fool  
  
You Take A Chance when you're distant  
You Take A Chance when you live inside  
You Take A Chance when someone loves you  
And you leave them with no pride  
  
Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me  
  
Oh Take A Chance on me  
Take A Chance on me  
I'm exactly what you see honey  
Take A Chance on me

Empty words, falling on ears  
Which have never heard  
Hollow lies, comin' from  
Lost, hung-up and lonely guys  
Through the night, make a sight  
Other rider looks so true  
Sinnin', spinnin' tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Piercing smile filling her face  
For a while  
Closin' door, leaving the heart open  
And wounded more  
Gone away, lonely day  
Turning grey with no clue  
Faking, making tales of Lucy Blue  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Restless night, longing for love  
Beneath the neon light  
Desperate hands reachin' for someone  
Who'll understand  
Stroll around through the town  
Lost and found when it's due  
Sellin', tellin' tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Yeah Lucy Blue, one or two  
Just for you, hey yeah  
Tales of Lucy Blue

Yeah hell yeah now I can hear the gypsy wind a howlin'  
Ain't got time to lean against your wall  
I gotta hit the road and keep on movin'  
I'm gonna roll and smoke and boogie and ball now  
Been abused, got my shoes, paid my dues, teachin' blues  
Yeah I'm goin' ridin' to the gates of freedom  
Cruisin till the sun she falls  
I'm gonna follow my god into Eden  
While I roll and smoke and boogie and ball  
Light my fuse, get to choose, teachin' blues  

The answer's in the question Will you be home late again Will you find the
courage When truth come closin' in When trust is almost broken Faith is hard
to find The answer's in the question Will you leave this all behind  
The heart's a lonely hunter It never quite feels safe The devil's in the
details The thrill is in the chase You rise and fall like water You try to
stay the same The only thing that's certain Is that everything will change How
will I be remembered Will my critics be unkind  
The answer's in the question You must leave this all behind

Winners, losers and small time misusers  
Do what they must on their own  
Lovers, dreamers and beautiful schemers  
All take the long way home  
Some have their reasons  
Some lose their way  
They all want so much to succeed  
How do you tell them apart  
The best of them leave with their hearts  
  
Now that it's summer  
I went to the river  
The water was never too cold  
Always together through all kinds of weather  
We took the long way home  
She was the best  
I ever knew  
Somehow she drifted away  
  
Now that I'm older  
The nights seems much colder  
I spend too much time alone  
Sometimes in summer  
I kept thinking of her  
And I'll take the long way home  
I'll still take the long way home

The other side of The Mountain  
Is where I want to be  
It's a far piece over The Mountain  
But I hope you'll go with me  
  
I grew up as a dreamer  
I found that dreams aren't free  
Now I want you here with me  
  
I've lived so long near the mountain  
It's almost part of me  
I want to have it behind me  
It blocks out all I can see  
It looms up dark and ancient  
Its shadow over me  
I want it behind me  
  
All that time, all that precious time  
It's gone from you and me  
We're givin' up this scene  
We're givin' up this scene  
  
Now some will say that we're destined  
Some will call it fate  
Me I call it obsession  
It's just like love and hate  
We're prisoners of our passion  
We all seem to find too late  
I hope it's not too late  
We're givin' up this scene  
Ah babe we're givin' up this scene  
  
We're gettin' out  
We're givin' up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah we're givin' up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah we're givin' up this scene

Words and music by fraser and rogers  
  
I went down to the center of town  
  
Beneath my feet was the burning ground  
  
Just stood on the corner as sexy as could be  
  
Said "hey good looking, walk away with me"  
  
I said "yeah, I'm your stealer,  
  
Come to steal your love."  
  
  
  
Sun was shining, the world was bright,  
  
I said, "tell me darling, where you gonna be tonight? "  
  
"goin' around the corner, where the music's loud.  
  
I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around."  
  
And I said "yeah, I'm your stealer,  
  
I come to steal your love."  
  
I come to  
  
I come to steal  
  
  
  
Goin' around the corner, where the music's loud.  
  
I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around.  
  
And I said "yeah, I'm your stealer  
  
I come to steal your love.  
  
I'm stealin'...let me steal now...come steal it...  
  
Come steal it...come steal it...

This old house was once for dancing,  
This old house once filled with joy.  
With it's beauty so entrancing,  
Every little girl and boy.  
Now it's halls are filled with darkness.  
Its rooms are dusty, cold.  
This old house is growing so old.  
  
Take a walk into the ballroom,  
Now it hardly looks the same.  
Now it's chandelier is shattered,  
Only stillness here remains.  
Long ago there was the laughter  
Through the stories that were told.  
This old house has grown so old.  
  
Carefull of the stairs,  
Don't sit on the broken chair.  
Peole passing by  
Used to pause out in the square.  
Now they go on by,  
No one even stops to stare.  
It's so all alone,  
No one cares.  
  
They'll tear down this house come morning,  
Build a new one in it's place.  
Put an end to all it's glory,  
Put an end to all it's grace.  
And the sun will set when evening comes,  
Stars will fill the sky -  
And stars will fill the sky.

Saw you walkin' on a backstreet honey  
Tryin' to slip away  
Did you find someone to take your money  
And did it make your day  
Take a lesson from someone who's been there  
There are lots of roads that lead you nowhere  
  
I can see it in your blank stare baby  
Someone's done you in  
Everybody hits the hard truth some time  
It's your time again  
So you're lonesome and the night's approachin'  
Honey this is where the tough get goin'  
  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Between memory and pain  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Between the freedom and the chain  
Welcome to the tightrope  
Stretched high above the street  
Welcome to the tightrope  
It's right beneath your feet  
  
Once you learn to balance truth and sorrow  
You can worry about the rest tomorrow  
  
Up there on the tightrope  
Oh it's a tightrope  
You're walkin' on a tightrope

Take away my inhibitions  
Take away my solitude  
Fire me up with your resistance  
Put me in the mood  
Storm the walls around this prison  
Leave the inmates  
Free the guards  
Deal me up another future  
From some brand new deck of cards  
Take the chip off of my shoulder  
Smooth out all the lines  
Take me out among the rustling pines  
Till it shines  
  
Like an echo down a canyon  
Never coming back as clear  
Lately I just judge the distance  
Not the words I hear  
I've been too long on these islands  
I've been far too long alone  
I've been too long without summer  
In this winter home  
Still if we can make the effort  
If we take the time  
Maybe we can leave this much behind  
Till it shines  
  
See the rich man lost and lonely  
Watch him as he dines  
Sitting there just testing all the wines  
Till it shines

They say the sun  
Is gonna grow someday  
It's gonna get a real close  
And burn us all up  
No more traffic in the street  
No more road rage  
No more pretending  
Things are real tough  
  
I can't promise you tomorrow  
No one has the right to lie  
You can beg and steal and borrow  
It won't save you from the sky  
  
Let me see a show of hands  
Tell me the truth now  
What happens if  
Nuetrinos have mass  
I can't tell you about tomorrow  
I'm as lost as yesterday  
In between your joy and sorrow  
I suggest you have your say  
Here's to the little things  
The sports section  
The weather chanel  
A good battery

And over in the teacher's home she waited by the phone  
For calls which never rang, and people who never sang  
Train man rambled dusty into town and made his daily round  
Train man and he comes in the night  
Brings her no love but he's right  
Yes he's right  
  
Through fog and misty morning dew, she'd seen his oily face  
And he had touched her heart, taken it apart  
  
Though he never stopped to speak a word his voice was all she heard  
Train man and he comes in the night  
  
Brings her no love but he's right  
  
Little girl you're a pretty little girl  
Yes he's right  
Won't you come with me a while  
Little girl in your frilly little world  
Won't you give me your sweet smile  
(first solo)  
  
If you come tonight bring someone  
If you come tonight bring someone  
Don't come alone  
  
If you come alone don't come  
Don't come  
Don't come  
(solo)  
Yes I know he's right  
  
Yes I know he's right  
Oh I know he's right  
fade...  
She held his hand and whispered soft  
  
I love you train man  
He just grumbled like engine as it rumbles  
And said someday  
Train man and he knows something's wrong and he's right  
Oh yes he's right  
  

Up with the sun, gone with the wind,  
She always said I was lazy.  
Leavin' my home, leavin' my friends,  
Runnin' when things get too crazy.  
Out on thr road, out 'neath the stars,  
Feelin' the breeze, passin' the cars.  
  
Women have come, women have gone,  
Everyone tryin' to cage me.  
Some were so sweet, I barely got free,  
Others, they only enraged me.  
Sometimes at night, I see their faces,  
I feel the traces they left on my soul.  
Those are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.  
  
Travelin' man, love when I can,  
Turn loose my hand 'cause I'm goin'.  
Travelin' man, catch if you can,  
But sooner or lare I'm goin'.  
Travelin' man, travelin' man, yes I am.  
  
Sometimes at night, I see their faces,  
I feel the traces they left on my soul.  
These are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.  
These are the memories that made me a wealthy soul.

All right, you guys feel funky tonight, ah yeah  
This is an old Memphis song, old Memphis song  
  
I used to smoke  
Five packs of cigarettes a day  
It was the hardest thing  
To put them away  
I drink four or five bottles of wine  
I kept a glass  
In my hand all the time  
Breaking those habits was hard to do  
But nothing compared to the changes  
You put me through  
  
Trying to live my life without you babe  
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Trying to forget the love we once shared  
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have  
  
All right, I said  
  
I had the worst reputation in town  
For chasing all the women around  
I thought changing my way of living  
Was hard to do  
But it's nothing compared to the changes  
That you put me through  
I've done everything I've tried to do  
But it's gonna take a miracle  
To get me over you  
  
Trying to live my life without you babe  
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Trying to forget the love we once shared  
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have

I will answer the wind  
I will leave with the tide  
I'll be out on the road  
Every chance I can ride  
  
No matter how far  
No matter how free  
I'll be alone  
If you'll wait for me  
  
There'll be times when I'll rise  
There'll be times when I'll fall  
There'll be times when it's best to say nothing at all  
  
Knowing you're right  
Letting it be  
I'll be around  
If you'll wait for me  
If you'll wait for me  
  
And I'll fight for the right to go over the hill  
If it'll only mean something to me  
I will not be persuaded  
I won't be still  
I'll find a way to be free  
  
In the cool of the night  
In the heat of the day  
If you're ever in doubt  
I'll be on my way  
Straight to your side  
I guarantee  
I'll be around  
If you'll wait for me  
If you'll wait for me

Out on those trails  
Out 'neath that sky  
Rivers of old  
Still rushing by  
  
Eagles still soar  
White mountains loom  
Down in those valleys  
West of the Moon  
  
West of the stars  
Far from the chase  
Far from the crowds  
Far from the pace  
  
Horses run free  
Winter comes soon  
Out by those mountains  
West of the Moon  
  
And everywhere  
Everywhere  
Wild things are free  
Free in the wind and the sun  
  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
As it should be  
Left on their own while they run  
  
Out by those mountains  
West of the Moon

I know it's late, I know you're weary  
I know your plans don't include me  
Still here we are, both of us lonely  
Longing for shelter from all that we see  
Why should we worry, no one will care girl  
Look at the stars so far away  
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?  
We've got tonight babe  
Why don't you stay?  
  
Deep in my soul I've been so lonely  
All of my hopes fading away  
I've longed for love like everyone else does  
I know I'll keep searching even after today  
So there it is girl, I've said it all now  
And here we are babe, what do you say?  
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?  
We've got tonight babe  
Why don't you stay?  
  
I know it's late, I know you're weary  
I know your plans don't include me  
Still here we are, both of us lonely  
Both of us lonely  
  
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?  
Let's make it last, let's find a way  
Turn out the light, come take my hand now  
We've got tonight babe  
Why don't you stay?  
Why don't you stay?

Which way you gonna go  
To the left or to the right  
Gonna go up gonna go down  
I ain't got no clue tonight  
  
Which way you gonna run  
To the east or to the west  
To the north to the south  
Which way you like the best  
  
You only do things Your Way  
Baby Your Way  
You only like things Your Way  
Baby Your Way  
  
Which Way You Gonna Turn  
When you find it's all wrong  
Which way you gonna turn  
When it all comes out wrong  
  
When you find you're not that strong  
Oh baby baby  
I hope you get along

Springtime of new years, the young thoughts see more dreams  
While you live on the wind, how lovely it all seems  
With moments yet unshared, and wishes incomplete  
The stars above your head, the world beneath your feet  
  
Suddenly your nights, begin to seem so long  
There's no one there to touch, when things start going wrong  
You finally realise, you've never loved at all  
And everywhere you look, you see the white wall  
  
Your father's been too far, your mother's been too near  
And now you're on your own, withdrawing in your fear  
Through long and sleepless nights, the foxes are running free  
You long to be with them, when the scare meets the sea  
  
You climb and then you fall, and then you try again  
You curse yourself aloud, for living so weird  
And took it to the ground, your eyes are filled with tears  
Imprisoned there you lay, in the autumn of your years

You can cry if you want to, you can rage at the night  
You can blame all your wounds on the workd if you like  
YOu can drink from the bottle no ice and no glass  
You can lie in the mornin' and say it's our last  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
You can tell yourself different but you won't stop there  
  
You can study the ancients, you can learn every fact  
You can follow the cycles that leave and come back  
How everything changes, it's been ever thus  
One day you're a comet the next day you're dust  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
There's always the future and you won't stop there  
  
Tyrants and kings do their usual things  
And you try to stay out of their way  
Follow the truth and you'll find what you need every day  
  
There's always tomorrow, always a chance  
You can stand in the spotlight and not have to dance  
You can find something solid,stronger than steel  
And it might touch your heart 'cause it just  
Might be real  
But you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
It's not in your nature and you won't stop there  
No you won't stop there, no you won't stop there  
There's always tomorrow so you won't stop there.

It looked like it  
It felt like it  
But in the end it was just a show  
With good acting  
Fine acting  
Too bad the sponsers had to go  
And you know who you are  
Poor production  
Poor direction  
All the beautiful sad cliche's  
The sound was bad  
I couldn't hear you  
But then what were we doing on the stage  
And you know who you are  
Oh yeah  
Tell me if it feels like the key  
Well it's easy too easy  
Cause when I saw you there  
With your eyes in the air  
Ahh  
Everything we done we done before  
Somehow it seemed to make a little more sense  
It was such a close call I think that's why I'm writing this at all  
I'd call out your name loud  
You really don't think it would make any sense  
Cause you know who you are  
  
  

Words and Music by Bob Seger  
  
A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight  
The sky is starlit and the time is right  
And still you're tellin' me you have to go  
Before you leave there's something you should know  
Yeah something you should know babe  
  
I've seen you smiling in the summer sun  
I've seen your long hair flying when you run  
I've rnade my mind up that it's meant to be  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
You're high above me now, you're wild and free ah but  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Some people say that love's a losin' game  
You start with fire but you lose the flame  
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone  
You end up cold and lonely on your own  
  
I'll take my chances babe I'ii risk it all  
I'll win your love or I'ii take the fall  
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
It's written down some where, it's got to be  
You're high above me flyin' wild and free  
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
  
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea  
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be  
Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me  
Somedaylady you'll accomp'ny me
