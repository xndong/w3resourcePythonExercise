There was a time I was one of a kind  
Lost in the world out of me myself and I  
Was lonely then like an alien  
I tried but I never figured it out  
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd  
Ooh that was then like an alien  
  
But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home  
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone  
  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
  
Crossed through the universe to get where you are  
Travel the night riding on a shooting star  
Was lonely then like an alien  
Had to get used to the world I was on  
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong  
Ooh That was then like an alien  
  
But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home  
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone  
  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
  
But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home  
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone  
  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
(Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone  
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone)

Repeat(fade to chorus)

I saw him standin' there  
In the parkin' lot  
He asked if I  
Came here a lot  
And this is how  
I responded  
  
[Chorus]  
I forgot my name  
I forgot my telephone number  
If he wanna see me  
He don't even know it  
I forgot my address  
Damsel in distress  
I forgot my boyfriend  
Was the one who had bought me this rock  
  
I get amnesia  
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou  
He's been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didn't know it was over  
'Till you came on over  
And told me that you just, just can't  
Forget about me  
  
I talk to my girls  
I can talk to my girls like crazy  
To anyone, I speak my mind  
I tell them mother don't phase me  
I'm not lazy  
But boy, lately  
When I see you, I stu-utter  
Watch you slip away like butterflies  
  
I saw you standin' there  
In the VIP on Friday  
We conversate up in my  
Fantasies like, every day  
But I'm a dud  
Whenever you approach  
Like yesterday when you just  
Came to say hello  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get amnesia  
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou  
He's been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didn't know it was over  
'Till you came on over  
And told me that you just, just can't  
Forget about me  
  
Me  
Me  
This is how I do  
  
I talk to most guys  
I can talk to most guys like crazy  
To anyone, I'll speak my mind  
I tell them mother don't phase me  
But you shake me  
Boy, you make me  
St-o-o-o-op and stutter  
When we touch, I melt like butter  
  
I saw you standin' there  
In the VIP on Saturday  
Now that I know you got a  
Thing for me, I should be straight  
Not the kinda girl who'll just let  
Any guy get close  
I like him so I'm gon' tell my guy  
He should just effin' go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get amnesia  
When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou  
He's been with me for several years  
I know this much is true  
Didn't know it was over  
'Till you came on over  
And told me that you just, just can't  
Forget about me  
  
Me  
Me  
This is how I do

Lying alone  
Touching my skin  
I'm falling under  
A girl like me  
And I can't hold it in  
It makes me wonder  
  
Is this for real?  
It's not what it seems  
You're like an angel  
I'm running now  
My feet off the ground  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
The feel of your hand  
As it touches my hair  
It makes me tremble  
Don't wanna let go  
Of the feelings we share  
So baby, go slow  
  
Our hearts beating fast  
And my body cries  
I want it to last,  
This burning inside  
We're getting deeper  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
You're drifting  
The sun comes up  
You're fading  
You seem so far  
I don't know  
If I'm awake  
Open my eyes  
And then we  
We kiss...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me  
Touch me  
Won't you hold me close?  
  
And then we kiss  
Your love comes alive on my lips  
I feel the rush  
Coming over me, over me  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss  
  
And then we kiss (x2)  
And when we touch  
This moment when everything's still  
I close my eyes  
And then we kiss

Everyday, I'm in a daze  
Looking for that someone  
And everyday, I sit and kneel and pray  
Oh, sweet love, can I get some?  
So why do you desert me, baby boy?  
I need your love right now!  
And if you desert me, baby boy  
Don't you leave me in your crowd  
  
Talking  
Hey baby, what time you gonna get home?  
Oh, really?  
[Sigh]  
Alright, well, I'll see you later, then  
Oh, wait  
Would you mind getting some...  
Yeah, when you come home  
Yeah, that's it  
I love you too  
Bye  
  
[Singing again]  
Some day when you see my face  
You will think that you have won  
And some day when it's all away  
Our love just begun  
So why did you desert me, baby boy?  
I thought that you, you were the one  
So if you preferred the other one  
She won't bring you the sun(son)

Oh baby, baby  
Oh baby, baby  
  
Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know  
That something wasn't right here  
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go  
And now you're out of sight, yeah  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
My loneliness is killing me (and I)  
I must confess I still believe (still believe)  
When I'm not with you I lose my mind  
Give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Oh baby, baby  
The reason I breathe is you  
Boy you got me blinded  
Oh pretty baby  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
It's not the way I planned it  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh baby, baby  
Yeah,  
  
Oh baby, baby how was I supposed to know  
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go  
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time

Laying here in your arms  
And you hold me tight, tight  
Tryin' not to watch the clock  
Tick, tickin' as the time goes by (by)  
And I know that you best be on your way  
But I'm wishin' I could make you stay  
Stay with me for a while  
  
Though  
You're near  
Still  
I want to make it clear  
Love  
I will always be around  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're leaving  
I'm waiting  
Forgive me  
I'm always missing you  
Before the goodbye  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I Feel It  
Already  
Forgive me  
I'm always missing you  
Before the goodbye  
  
Kinda hard for me to let you know  
I don't let my feelings show  
How much I will miss in you  
All the little things that make me weak  
Your eyes and the way you speak  
Without you baby I'm not me (I'm not me)  
  
Though  
You're near  
Still  
I want to make it clear  
Love  
I will always be around  
  
[Chorus 1]

Oh this is the night  
Its a beautiful night  
And we call it bella notte  
Look at the skys  
They have stars in their eyes  
On this lovely bella notte  
Side by side with your loved one  
You will find the enchanment here  
The night the night will weave its magical spell  
When the one you love is near, oh  
This is the night  
And the heavens all rise  
On this lovely bella notte

Sometimes I just loose my head  
Boy I am getting so mad

I'm a pretty, pretty rebel,  
I know you'll never find another girl like me!  
I want it on another level,  
No you'll never find a girl who rides like me!  
I called you on the phone and you're hiding, oh!  
I know you locked the door, boy let me in! Oh!  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!

And no one is ever gonna know,

That's the deal!  
I'm a black widow!

With my eight hands I can hold you,  
There's no way I will ever let you go!  
All your friends tried to warn you,  
Boy, you had to take a chance and now you know!  
Just another name crossed off the list, oh!  
And when it's over there's no goodbye kiss  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
That's the deal!  
I'm a black widow!  
I'm a black widow!  
  
No, there's no time for rescuing,  
Know you were just a fling, yeah.  
Now that the dark, is settling,  
You can go, you can go, you can,  
You can go, you can go!  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
That's the deal!

I'm a black widow!

Turn the lights out  
This shit is way too fucking bright  
Wanna poke my eyes out  
If you wanna mess with my eyesight  
Just let me get my head right  
Where the hell am I?  
Who are you?  
What'd we do  
Last night?  
Hey yeah yeah  
Who are you?  
What'd we do  
Last night?  
Hey yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't remember what I did last night  
Maybe I shouldn't have given in  
But I just couldn't fight  
Hope I didn't but I think I might've  
Everything, everything is still a blur  
Can't remember what I did last night  
Everything, everything is still a blur (did last night)  
Can't remember what I did last night  
Everything, everything is still a blur  
  
What's your name, man?  
Can you calmly hand me all my things?  
I think I need an aspirin  
Better yet, I need to get up outta here  
I gotta get my head right  
Where the hell am I?  
Who are you?  
What'd we do  
Last night?  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What happened last night?  
'Cause I don't, 'cause I don't remember  
What happened?

I am here to testify  
That you're the only one I belong to  
I don't know where to start  
It turned into an art  
Not to show the world that it was you  
Who made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
Know we're gonna get, gonna get get  
  
[Chorus]  
Bombastic Love  
So fantastic  
Where I'm completley yours and you are mine  
And It's gonna be exactly like in a movie  
When we fall in love for the first time  
  
Don't know why I feel so insecure  
I never understood what it stood for  
I gotta make sure that blidness won't stop me again  
I can't sit and wait anymore  
You made me realize not to compromise  
The fact that you and I should need  
I know were gonna get  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be bombastic love  
Everything is gonna be alright  
When I'm yours and you are mine  
It's gonna be fantastic love  
When I wake up everything is still the same  
And you don't even know my name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know we're gonna get  
  
[Chorus]

I'm sitting here alone up In my room  
Thinking about the times that we've been through (oh my love)  
I'm looking at a picture In my hand  
Trying my best to understand  
  
I really want to know what we did wrong  
With the love that felt so strong  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone  
I'd rather give It up then carry on (oh my love)  
'Cause livin In a dream of you and me  
Is not the way my life should be  
  
I don't want to cry a tear for you  
So forgive me If I do  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd give you my world  
I'd wait forever to be your girl  
Just call out my name (just call out my name)  
  
I will be there (and I will be there)  
Just to show you how much I care  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy

For whatever reason,  
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life  
You don't understand  
I'm so glad we're at the same place  
  
At the same time, it's over now  
I spotted you dancin'  
You made all the girls stare  
Those lips and your brown eyes (oooh)  
  
And the sexy hair  
I should shake my thing  
Make the world want you (giggle)  
Tell your boys you'll be back  
I want to see what you can do (uh)  
  
What would it take for you to just leave with me?  
Not tryin' to sound conceited but  
You and me were meant to be (yeah)  
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice Girl  
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world!  
  
Boys!  
Sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)  
Boys!  
To love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)  
  
Boys!  
And when a girl is with one (mmm, mmm)  
Boys!  
Then she's in control!  
  
Took the boy off the dance floor  
Screaming in his ear  
Musta' said somethin' bout me (what you say)  
'Cause he's lookin' over here  
You lookin' at me (giggle)  
With a sexy attitude  
But the way your boys movin' it (uh)  
It puts me in the mood  
Ow!  
  
What would it take for you to just leave with me?  
Not tryin' to sound conceited  
But you and me were meant to be  
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice Girl  
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world  
  
Boys!  
Sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)

To love her and to hold (I get nasty)  
Boys!  
And when a girl is with one (I get nasty)  
Boys!

It's so hot in here  
  
Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air.  
Oh boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there  
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated  
We can read eachother's minds.  
One love united  
Two bodies synchronizing  
Don't even need to touch me  
Baby, just  
  
Breathe on me, yeah, oh  
Baby just, breathe on me  
We don't need to touch, just  
Breathe, oh, yeah  
  
Oh, this is way beyond the physical (it's a way beyond the physical)  
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all  
Our imagination, taking us to places  
We have never been before  
Take me in, let it out  
Don't even need to touch me  
Baby, just  
  
Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby  
Just, breathe on me.  
We don't need to touch, just  
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me), oh baby  
Just, breathe (breathe) on (on) me (me)  
We don't need to touch  
Just breathe  
  
Monogamy is the way to go  
Just put your lips together and blow  
  
Breathe, breathe, oh  
  
Breathe on me (oh oh) oh  
Baby just, breathe on me (on me)  
We don't need to touch, just

Wise men say, only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay?  
Would it be a sin?  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
As a river flows  
Gently to the sea

Some things are meant to be  
  
Take my hand  
Take my whole life, too

I'm just a girl with a crush on you  
Don't care about money  
It doesn't give me half the thrill  
To the thought of you, honey  
So tell me that you want me still  
If only I could trade the fancy cars  
For a chance today, it's incomparable  
I might be sitting with the movie stars  
Everybody say that I have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
But I can't make you love me  
Is it my life or the things I do?  
Can't make you love me  
I'm just a girl with a crush on you  
  
I have been through changes, yeah  
But I'm still the girl you used to know  
It's made me no different  
So tell me why you had to go  
Oh baby, I will trade the fancy cars  
For a chance today, it's incomparable  
I might be sitting with the movie stars  
Everybody say that I just have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just the thought of being close to you  
It's incomparable  
Should be happy with the life I live  
And the things I do  
Seems like I have it all  
  
Can't make you, make you love me baby  
It's my life, what can I do?  
Can't make you love me, alright  
I'm just a girl with a crush on you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

Oh yes you know its true,  
You called me Cinderella,  
All you had to do was yell and I'd be there for you,  
  
Here I am, so try to forgive me,

There's only two types of people in the world  
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe  
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl  
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first  
I'm like the ringleader  
I call the shots (call the shots)  
I'm like a firecracker  
I make it hot  
When I put on a show  
  
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins  
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break  
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage  
Better be ready, hope ya feel the same  
  
[Chorus]  
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring  
Just like a circus  
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip  
Just like a circus  
Don't stand there watching me, follow me  
Show me what you can do  
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor  
Just like a circus  
  
There's only two types of guys out there,  
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared  
So baby I hope that you came prepared  
I run a tight ship so, beware  
I'm like the ringleader  
I call the shots  
I'm like a firecracker  
I make it hot  
When I put on a show  
  
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins  
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break  
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage  
Better be ready, hope that ya feel the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's go  
Let me see what you can do  
I'm runnin' this (like, like, like, like a circus)  
Yeah  
Like a what? (like, like, like, like a circus)  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Baby, I'm so into you  
You've got that something, what can I do  
Baby, you spin me around, oh  
The earth is movin, but I can't feel the ground  
Everytime you look at me  
My heart is jumpin, it's easy to see  
Loving you means so much more  
More than anything I ever felt before  
  
You drive me crazy  
I just can't sleep  
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep  
Crazy, but it feels alright  
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night  
  
Tell me, you're so into me  
That I'm the only one you will see  
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh  
That I'm not wastin  
My feelins on you  
Loving you means so much more  
More than anything I ever felt before  
  
You drive me crazy  
I just can't sleep  
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep  
Crazy, but it feels alright  
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night  
  
Crazy, I just can't sleep  
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep  
Crazy, but it feels alright  
Every day and every night  
  
You drive me crazy  
I just can't sleep  
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep  
Crazy, but it feels alright  
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night  
  
You drive me crazy  
I just can't sleep  
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep  
Crazy, but it feels alright  
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night  
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night

CREEP  
  
God I'm such a creep  
I'm having so much fun breaking up  
It's getting kind of wicked  
  
And there's no need to weep  
It's more like a relief - I can't stop  
Laughing and I'm thinking  
You're looking at a single in gold  
  
I'm just your worst freakin'nightmare girlfriend  
  
I am such a creep  
I am such a creepy kind  
Sorry but I do believe I'm just that type of girl  
I am such a creep  
( and I can't help it )  
I aint gonna waste my time  
And I do believe that boy just had to go  
God I'm such a creep!  
  
The grass is turning green  
The air is loosing weight - and the sun  
Is lighting up my bedroom  
  
My smile is kinda mean  
I feel like I'm a dove with a gun  
I'm looking in my phonebook  
And there's a lot of numbers to dial  
  
.....God I'm such a creep  
I'm having so much fun breaking up  
I'm laughin and I'm thinking  
You're looking at a single in gold

He is a hustler, he's no good at all  
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum  
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable  
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun  
I know you told me I should stay away  
I know you said he's just a dog astray  
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart  
And even I know this ain't smart  
  
But mama I'm in love with a criminal  
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical  
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright  
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy  
  
He is a villain by the devil's law  
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun  
That man's a snitch and unpredictable  
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none  
All I know, should've let go, but no  
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart  
And even I know this ain't smart  
  
But mama I'm in love with a criminal  
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical  
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright  
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love that guy  
  
And he's got my name,  
Tattooed on his arm his lucky charm  
So I guess it's okay he's with me  
And I hear people talk  
Trying to make remarks keep us apart  
But I don't even hear  
I don't care  
  
'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal  
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical  
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright  
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy  
  
Mama I'm in love with a criminal  
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical  
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright  
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy

Dear diary  
Today I saw a boy  
And I wondered if he noticed me  
He took my breath away  
Dear diary  
I can't get him off my mind  
And it scares me  
Cause I've never felt this way  
  
No one in this world  
Knows me better than you do  
So diary I'll confide in you  
  
Dear diary  
Today I saw a boy  
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me  
  
And I wondered  
Does he know what's in my heart  
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe  
  
Should I tell him how I feel  
Or would that scare him away  
Diary, tell me what to do  
Please tell me what to say  
  
Dear diary  
One touch of his hand  
Now I can't wait to see that boy again  
  
He smiled  
And I thought my heart could fly  
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?  
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends

Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Walking through time  
Looking for an answer  
How can it be this way?  
What have I done?  
I just can't help but wonder  
How everything could change  
  
[Bridge]  
'Cause you've turned my world around  
Since you came along, know  
After this love is found  
It seems like we can't go wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
(uh huh)  
(oh yeah)  
  
Some people search  
What seems to be a lifetime  
To find a love like this (oh yeah)  
And here we are  
With everything we've wished for  
I've never felt such bliss (oh no)  
  
Bridge:  
'Cause you've turned my world around  
Since you came along  
After this love is found  
It seems like we can't go wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There comes a chance  
In everyone's life  
And I believe it won't happen twice  
Now since I've felt the glory of love  
I want to spend forever  
And ever with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you)  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (I love you so)  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you, only you, oh oh)  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (oh oh, I want you in my life)  
Deep in my heart  
Deep in my heart  
  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
I want your love forever  
  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life

Do you feel this?  
I'm gonna feel this  
Are you ready?  
I don't think so  
  
Somebody give me my truck  
So I can ride on the clouds  
So I can turn up the pace...like  
  
Somebody pass my guitar  
So I can look like a star  
And spend the cash like  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
What you gonna do when the crowd goes "eoh"  
Why you standing on the wall?  
Music's starting everywhere!  
So why don't you just move along?  
  
Chorus:  
I see you looking at me  
Like I'm some kind of a freak  
Get up out of your seat  
Why don't you do something?  
  
I see you looking at me  
Like I got what you need  
Get up out of your seat  
Why don't you do something?  
  
Now you all in my grill  
Cause I say what I feel  
Only rock to what's real  
  
But I can't do that with you  
I'll be here with my crew  
You can roll if you want  
Don't be a bum bum!!!  
  
Pre chorus  
  
Chorus

And get you into space  
And do something!!!

Fuck!!!

[Chorus:]  
(Usher)  
  
Do you love me?

Do you love me?  
  
(Britney)  
  
Only when you sing  
  
(Usher)  
  
But I'm singing right now baby

But you still can't understand. It was over a long time. Get it round in your
head oooooh  
  
[Verse 2:]

It happened on a friday night. She came round with drinks and snacks

(Britney)  
  
I hate you  
I despise you  
I loved you  
You ruined it.  
Oooh  
  
(Chorus X 2)

If they told me it's over  
I wouldn't believe it  
Because you know we both care  
But we got to get over, over the mountain  
We can't keep standing, standing there  
Let's move on and be stronger  
Even though we can't go  
Let go, can't hold on  
When love's broken  
  
This is gonna be our last goodbye  
Our love is gone, but I'll survive  
Hide my tears and dry my eyes  
You don't need to see me cry  
Pack my bags, can't take no more  
Adios, I'm out the door  
Hide your tears and dry your eyes  
'Cause I don't want to see you cry  
  
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry  
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry  
Cry, cry  
  
In the beginning we were both crazy  
We were crazy in love  
But now that it's ending  
We're just crazy  
Because we love with no drugs  
Can't go on any longer  
Baby, we got to let it go  
Move on, can't hold on  
When love's broken  
  
This is gonna be our last goodbye  
Our love is gone, but I'll survive  
Hide my tears and dry my eyes  
You don't need to see me cry  
Pack my bags, can't take no more  
Adios, I'm out the door  
Hide your tears and dry your eyes  
'Cause I don't want to see you cry  
  
This is gonna be our last goodbye  
Our love is gone, but I'll survive  
Hide my tears and dry my eyes  
You don't need to see me cry  
Pack my bags, can't take no more  
Adios, I'm out the door  
Hide your tears and dry your eyes  
'Cause I don't want to see you cry  
  
Don't cry, don't cry, cry, cry  
Don't cry, cry, don't cry, don't cry  
Cry, cry

Don't go knock on my door  
Don't go knock on my door  
  
Time is up  
No more cheat n' lie  
No more tears to dry  
You and I, we're like so "bye-bye"  
Finally  
I am over you  
Totally unblue  
And I can hear myself saying  
I am better off without you  
Stronger than ever and I  
I'm tellin' you now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
Gotta stay away for sure  
You say you miss me like crazy now  
But I ain't buyin' that  
You better get off my back  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
  
I can see  
It's no mystery  
It's so clear to me  
What we had is all history  
It's ok  
I can sleep at night  
It will be alright  
I can hear myself saying  
I am better off without you Stronger than ever and I  
I'm tellin' you now  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
Do what you want  
As long as you don't come back  
Don't go knockin' on my door  
Gotta stay away for sure  
And now I ain't buyin' that  
You better get off my back  
  
[Repeat chorus]

Listen up  
  
You said that you would treat me right  
But now all we do is fight  
You said that you would love me long  
But oh boy you were wrong  
  
You should have known that I don't play  
So get outta my fucking way and

You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again  
  
You said that you would buy me rings  
But my love don't cost a thing  
You said that I'm the only girl  
But there's another in your world  
  
You should have known that I don't play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Don't hold it against me baby  
You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again

Boom boom

Boom boom

So get outta my fucking way and

You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again

My friends say you're so into me  
And that you need me desperately  
They say you say we're so complete  
  
But I need to hear it straight from you  
If you want me to believe it's true  
I've been waiting for so long it hurts  
I want to hear you say the words, please  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't, don't let me be the last to know  
Don't hold back, just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
Oh, if you love me so  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
Ooh  
  
Your body language says so much  
Yeah, I feel it in the way you touch  
But 'til you say the words it's not enough  
Come on and tell me you're in love, please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on baby, come on darling, ooh yeah  
Come on, let me be the one  
Come on now, oh yeah  
  
I need to hear you say  
You love me all the way  
And I don't want to wait another day  
I want to feel the way you feel  
Oh, come on  
  
Don't, just let me be the one  
Don't hold back, just let it go  
I need to hear you say  
You need me all the way  
So, baby, if you love me  
Don't let me be the last to know

One more game,  
It's time to play,  
Play with me  
  
(One more game)  
  
Just one more game,  
It's time to play,  
Come play my way  
  
I'm no more Mrs. Nice Girl,  
No playing home ground,  
I'm not the same girl,  
You never rocked my world,  
You used me,  
Tried to abuse me,  
The fame the life the fantasy,  
Now back to reality.  
  
(Your dramatic)  
  
The truth that lies can't hide,  
I'm not by your side  
I'll let you drownd in your drama  
Run to your mama,  
See if she can save you,  
When I'm not around you  
  
(So dramatic)  
  
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
Baby, fuck you,  
The things you did, and never thought I'd get a clue,  
Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you,  
Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
  
Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more,  
Do all those explicit things that I told you "No",  
Places you couldn't go,  
You know where I'm talking,  
You are too dramatic  
  
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were.  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
Aww, awww, awww, awww  
Aww, awww, awww, awww  
  
Come and play,  
You wanna play,  
Come play with me  
  
You're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
You're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over.  
Understand it's over.

Oh baby your so fine  
I really want you to be mine  
Under the moonlit sky  
I wish it was just you and I  
  
Chorus  
Do you believe in love, at first sight?  
Cos I do, I really really love you!  
Do you believe in love, at first sight?  
Cos I do... Ohhh... Mmm  
  
The very first time that we met,  
You sliped, into my heart,  
The very first time that we touched,  
I knew I loved you so much.  
  
Repeat chorus (twice)  
  
Ohhhhh.......(faded)

Notice me  
Take my hand  
Why are we  
Strangers when  
Our love is strong  
Why carry on without me  
  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
It's haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I make-believe  
That you are here  
It's the only way  
That I see clear  
What have I done  
You seem to move on easy  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time I try to fly I fall  
Without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And every time I see  
You in my dreams  
I see your face  
You're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I may have made it rain  
Please forgive me  
My weakness caused you pain  
And this song's my sorry  
  
At night I pray  
That soon your face will fade away  
  
[Chorus]

Just yesterday  
You were looking up to me  
And, You would ask me  
What I thought  
  
But now I'm sitting here  
All alone with my tears  
Lookin' at my life  
That I've bought  
  
Where did I go? (yeah)  
My eyes, they will show  
  
And little me  
Please forgive me  
I couldn't see  
You hurting inside  
... Little me...  
... Little me...  
No more into you  
Little me oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no  
No ways ii must confess oh no

I'm all alone in bed  
and I can't sleep, I'm feeling blue.  
I try to close my eyes  
but all I'm thinking of is you.  
Baby only you  
  
I cry my eyes out baby  
wondering what I have to do.  
I lookin' inside my heart  
and knows for sure this love is true!  
  
Day by day, heart to heart  
I hope that we will ever be together.  
Will it be me and you  
I dream that our love will last forever...  
  
Hold me tight in your arms  
I know we haven't straight this thing together.  
Walk with me  
hand in hand.  
I promise to be there forever.  
Forever.  
  
Day by day...  
  
Hold me tight..

"Never look back," we said  
How was I to know I'd miss you so?  
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind  
Where do I go?  
  
And you didn't hear  
All my joy through my tears  
All my hopes through my fears  
Did you now, still I miss you somehow  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
"Baby," I said,  
"Please stay. Give our love a chance for one more day"  
We could have worked things out  
Taking time is what love's all about  
  
But you put a dart through my dreams  
Through my heart  
And I'm back where I started again  
Never thought it would end  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
You promised yourself  
But to somebody else  
And you made it so perfectly clear  
Still I wish you were here now  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know  
You were my first love,  
You were my true love,  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love, I never knew love  
'Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
"Never look back," we said,  
How was I to know I'd miss you so?

You're gonna have to remove me  
Cause I ain't goin nowhere

There's a girl in the mirror  
I wonder who she is  
Sometimes I think I know her  
Sometimes I really wish I did  
  
There's a story in her eyes  
Lullabies and goodbyes  
When she's looking back at me  
I can tell her heart is broken easily  
  
'Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying out tonight  
And there's nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying 'cause of you  
And I wish there was something  
Something I could do  
  
If I could  
I would tell her  
Not to be afraid  
The pain that she's feeling  
  
The sense of loneliness will fade  
So dry your tears and rest assured  
Love will find you like before  
When she's looking back at me  
I know nothing really works that easily  
  
'Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying in tonight  
And there's nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying 'cause of you  
And I wish there was something  
I wish there was something  
Oh I wish there was something  
I could do  
  
I can't believe it's what I see  
That the girl in the mirror  
The girl in the mirror  
Is me  
  
I can't believe what I see (no....)  
(The girl in my mirror)  
The girl in my mirror is me  
Ohh... is me  
  
'Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying out tonight  
And there's nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying 'cause of you  
I wish there was something  
I wish there was something  
Oh I wish there was something  
I could do

Give me love  
  
Such a long time ago, I found you  
In the street with your friends  
Your friends were so strung out  
And I was taken in by your false blue eyes  
Your kiss feels like a drug, your touch feels like the sky  
  
What am I supposed to do with someone as screwed up as you  
What am I supposed to do, when my heart is stuck on you  
  
Give me love  
Give me all that you got  
Take me, forget the drugs  
  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Take me, forget the drugs  
  
I wanna come around today, but something is in my way  
I'm scared to be there, I don't know what I might see  
Demons make a fool of you, I know what you're going through  
But the night won't be long, tomorrow they'll be gone  
  
So what am I supposed to do with someone as lost as you  
So what am I supposed to do when my heart is stuck on you  
  
Give me love...

[Verse 1]  
All my life they told me bout a creature so hypnotic  
But I guess I never thought it was true (Yeah)  
And now that I've seen you I've turned into a believer  
Baby so much for what I thought I'd do (Yeah)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Since I tasted you I got a craving  
Shaking in the heat of the night  
Oh, yeah, baby you got me misbehaving

Something about ya, 'bout ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Eyes locked on your body, sexy features, so iconic  
And I just can't keep my fingers away (no)  
Your love got me faded  
Keep it going, let's get wasted  
Baby, so much for my poker face (oh)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]

Shaking in the heat of the night

In my dreams I wish that I could see  
A paperboy just hanging from a tree  
  
I don't care if you're nice to me  
We'll never meet again  
And everybody cares so much  
But I don't give a damn  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
  
Every night when I go back to bed  
My evil thoughts are spinning in my head  
  
I don't care if I'm right or wrong  
I don't care if you're mad  
Cause everybody cares so much  
But I don't give a damn  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
  
Solo  
  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
I couldn't care less if you do  
Have a nice day  
I wouldn't spend my time with you  
Have a nice day

I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful  
I feel it burning and I know I'm standing far too close  
I'm telling lies and if it shows I see that he don't care  
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here  
  
I got someone waiting at home  
He says he in love but lately I just don't know  
He don't see me or make me feel hot  
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that  
  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
I feel my body is in focus as he touches me  
And I should go but I can't overcome this chemistry  
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear  
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here  
  
I got someone waiting at home  
He says he in love but lately I just don't know  
He don't see me or make me feel hot  
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he don't know that  
  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing  
I see him staring at me, I see what he wants to be  
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing  
I gotta, I gotta go  
He don't know that  
  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose, about to lose, about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful

Heart  
I know I've been hard on you  
I'm sorry for the things I put you through  
Before you start to break on me  
Or ask for sympathy  
I need to make you see  
  
Oh heart  
I'm not sure it's been long enough  
To say what I feel is really love  
There is just one way to learn  
Sometimes we'll get hurt  
And right not it's our turn  
  
Give it time  
Help me through  
Heart we can do this together  
  
You're my strength  
You're my soul  
I need you now more than ever  
  
Heart  
All the hurt will soon be gone  
If you, if you'll just keep on being strong  
You will always be my friend  
So keep on hanging in  
And we'll find love again  
  
Give it time  
Help me through  
Heart we can do this together  
  
You're my strength  
You're my soul  
I need you now more than ever  
  
Heart  
I know I've been hard on you  
I'm sorry for the things I've put you through  
Please don't you break on me  
I need to make you see  
It wasn't meant to be  
'Cause you will always be my friend  
So keep on hanging in  
And we'll find love again

"So Amanda, whatcha guys do on your date last night?"  
"Oh he was so sweet. He took me to eat and brought me roses." (Aw..)  
"And then we went back to his house and watched movies."  
"You went back to his house?"  
  
"Did you guys kiss?"

I've waited all my life for you  
My favorite kiss  
Your perfect skin  
Your perfect smile  
  
Waking up and you're next to me  
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep  
Lay my head on your chest and drift away  
Dream of you and I'm almost half awake  
  
(The palest green I've ever seen  
The color of your eyes  
You've taken me so far away  
One look and you stop time)  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do I'm really  
Crazy about you  
When you're next to me  
  
It's just like heaven on earth  
You're heaven  
You're heaven on earth  
  
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want  
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you  
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth  
I'm in love with you  
  
Your breath  
Your face  
Your hands  
Your head  
You're sweet  
Your love  
Your tongue  
  
I'd move across the world for you  
Just tell me when  
Just tell me where  
I'll come to you  
  
Take me back to that place in time  
Images of you occupy my mind  
Far away but I feel you hear with me  
Dream of you and you're almost next to me  
  
(The palest green I've ever seen  
The color of your eyes  
You've taken me so far away  
One look and you stop time)  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do I'm really  
Crazy about you  
When you're next to me

So in love  
  
Fall off the edge of my mind  
I fall off the edge of my mind  
For you  
I fall off the edge of my mind

For you  
  
Fell in love with you and  
Everything that you are  
Nothing I can do I'm really

I fall off the edge of my mind  
(I'm so in love)  
When I just look at you  
I feel like I'm gonna jump into heaven  
(So in love)  
And you'll catch me  
Catch me if I jump  
Will you catch me?

I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too.  
And I need to do what I feel like doing.  
So let me go, and just listen.  
  
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl.  
Well did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world.  
  
Always saying little girl don't step into the club.  
Well I'm just tryin' to find out why 'cause dancing's what I love.  
  
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)  
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)  
Get it get it, get it get it (Oh)  
  
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy.  
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy.  
  
What's practical is logical. What the hell, who cares?  
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there.  
  
I'm a slave for you. I cannot hold it, I cannot control it.  
I'm a slave for you. I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it.  
  
Baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,  
(I just wanna dance next to you)  
To another time and place.  
Oh baby, don't you wanna, dance up on me,  
(Are you ready)  
Leaving behind my name, and age.

That life doesn't always go my way, yeah  
  
Feels like I'm caught in the middle  
That's when I realize

Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
There is no need to protect me  
It's time that I  
Learn to face up to this on my own

You want the truth  
Here it is  
  
Manufactured  
Is this hop pop industry  
I know  
Cause they tried to do it to me  
Don't you let them  
Take away your eyes  
Be who you are and stop the sweet talk of lies  
  
Bridge:  
And you never gonna see me lipsynch  
And you never gonna see me try to cheat  
Cause I'm not the one who wont break it down

Chorus:  
Tired of the clothes that look like me  
Tired of you people sayin "Britney"  
Tired of the pop that's a flop  
That should never be  
On tv and in your teen magazines  
Tired of the crap I take each day  
Tryin to do my song, tryin to do it my way  
Tired of the pop that's a flop  
That should never be  
On tv and in your teen magazines  
  
Shame  
It's the game you play for fame  
But give it some time  
You won't remember their names  
Some you will, some you won't  
Their the one hit wonder remedies  
Who cannot sing a note  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Yeah yeah 4x  
  
It's the same old game  
Over and over  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x

I am having such an influx of messages about the various  
Things wrong with the Britney lyrics, so instead of just pasting  
The whole lot in an email to me, will you please make the  
Area with the mistake clear so that I can easily rectify the  
Problem, otherwise I will consequently ignore your email.  
Thank you in advance for your co-operation.  
  
Also, in the subject of your email, pls specify which artist and  
Song the email is regarding, otherwise I wont read it until I  
Have dealt with ones that have done this.

Won't you just let me, let me be  
Think that you know me now but you don't  
Think that I-I can't stand on my own  
Ain't my philosophy  
Won't you just let me, let me be  
  
Trust in my instincts  
Trust that I know what's right  
These are the reasons that keep you up at night (at night)  
  
Tell me "Go slow"- This is my flow  
'Cause you don't know- know what I know  
Let me tell you how it feels  
Baby it's time that you see me for real  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trust that I know, this is my show  
Letting you know, Gotta go the way I go x2  
  
[Chorus: x2]

This is the story about Mona Lisa  
The Mona Lisa  
Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell  
About Mona Lisa and how she suddenly fell  
See everyone knew her, they knew her oh so well  
Now I am taking over to release her from her spell  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
She was taken under drowning in her sea  
Running like an angel, she was crying and could not see, oh no  
Now see everyone's watching as she starts to fall  
They want her to breakdown be a legend of her fall  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone, she's been gone, she's been gone  
Ladies does that make you cry?  
Mona Lisa's got to fly, nobody really dies  
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence right here  
God  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
That she's home, that she's home  
She's the original  
She's unforgettable  
She wants you to know  
She's been gone  
It's kind of incredible  
She's so unpredictable  
She wants you to know  
That she's home, that she's home, that she's home  

[Verse 1]  
Look in the mirror  
Who do I see?  
Who do I wanna be today?  
If you came for a show  
Which role should I take?  
Fading to grey  
So did we make a big mistake?  
True colors'll show  
Baby, just put me on display  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah  
Mood...  
  
[Verse 2]  
I have no secrets  
Cause there's a version of me  
That I don't know how to hide  
When you're making me glow  
With your fingers against my thighs  
(Glow)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah  
Mood...  
(Nothing on my body, but this mood ring, this mood ring)  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm in the palm of your hand  
My temperature is at your command  
By my demand, and now I'm falling for you  
I turn to golden from blue  
And you do too, ah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring (My love is a mood ring)  
Up and down emotions (Up and down emotions)  
All these mood swings (All these mood swings)  
You know how to read the touch of my skin (My skin)  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah (Yeah)  
Mood...  
(Hey, hey)

Early mornin'

Got a little messy  
Early morning

Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
  
Met a tall dude, kinda dark hair  
When he walked up somebody grabbed him  
But I liked him told him come here  
Kinda cool  
Baby, we can make plans  
Where ya live  
Do ya mama live there  
We can hook up at the hotel  
Hands down so I told him, let's go  
But have a next guess  
But you don't wanna know

Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
  
Oh, in love  
So I approached him  
We gotta give him his friends  
There's something 'bout him that shows  
So I said, what the hell, let's go  
Got up, got on the dance floor  
Hooked up with a guy named Joe  
When the music was fast and slow  
But have a next guess  
But you don't wanna know  
  
I was shaking my ass in the streets alone and  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'  
Bump, bump till the break of dawn  
And it don't stop till the early mornin'  
Passed out on the couch and yawnin'  
Just walked in and it's early mornin'

Tiny hands  
Yes that's you  
And all you show  
It's simply true  
I smell your breath  
It makes me cry  
I wonder how  
I've lived my life  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause without you  
How did I get through  
All of my days  
Without you  
Now living with you  
See everything true  
My baby it's you  
My baby, my baby, my baby  
  
With no words at all  
So tiny and small  
In love I fall so deep, so deep  
My precious love  
Sent from above  
My baby boo  
Gotta thank you, gotta thank you  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Oh yeah yeah...  
Last night I took a walk in the snow,  
Couples holdin hands, places to go,  
Seems like everyone but me is in love  
Santa can you hear me?  
I signed my letter that I sealed with kiss,  
I sent it off, it just said this:  
"i know exactly what I want this year"  
Santa can you hear me?  
I want my baby, baby  
I want someone to love me, someone to hold,  
Maybe maybe,  
He'll be all my own in a big red bow  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year  
And all I want is one thing,  
Tell me my true love is here  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
  
Yeahh...  
Christmas eve, I just can't sleep  
Would I be wrong for takin a peek  
'cause I heard that you're comin to town  
Santa can you hear me?  
I really hope that you're on your way  
With something special for me in your sleigh  
Oh please make my wish come true,  
Santa can you hear me?  
I want my baby, baby  
I want someone to love me, someone to hold  
Baby, baby, baby  
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year,  
All I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is here  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
  
I hope my letter reaches you in time, (oh yeah)  
Bring me love I can call all mine (oh yeah)  
'cause I have been so good this year, (oh oh)  
Can't be alone under the mistletoe,  
He's all I want in a big red bow.  
  
Santa can you hear me?  
I have been so good this year  
And all I want is one thing  
Tell me my true love is near  
He's all I want, just for me  
Underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here,  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
Ahh ahh ahh  
Oh santa, can you hear me...?  
Oh santa, well he's all I want  
Just for me, underneath my christmas tree  
I'll be waiting here,  
Santa that's my only wish this year  
Santa that's my only wish this year.

People can take everything away from you  
But they can never take away your truth  
But the question is, can you handle mine?  
  
They say I'm crazy  
I really don't care  
That's my prerogative  
They say I'm nasty  
But I don't give a damn  
Getting boys is how I live  
Some ask me questions  
Why am I so real?  
But they don't understand me  
I really don't know the deal  
About my sister  
Trying hard to make it right  
Not long ago  
Before I won this fight  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
It's my prerogative  
  
It's the way that I wanna live  
(It's my prerogative)  
But you can't tell me what to do  
  
Don't get me wrong  
I'm really not souped  
Ego trips is not my thing  
All these strange relationships  
Really gets me down  
I see nothing wrong  
Spreadin' myself around  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(That's my prerogative)  
  
It's the way that I wanna live  
(It's my prerogative)  
But you can't tell me what to do  
  
Why can't I live my life  
Without all of the things  
That people say?  
Oh  
  
(Oh)  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?  
(Tell me why)  
I don't need permission, make my own decisions  
(Oh)  
That's my prerogative  
(They said I'm crazy)  
  
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me  
Why don't they just let me live?

That's my prerogative

Grab a partner. ..  
And dance!  
  
Dance  
Dance  
  
I've had a feeling to fight for so long  
It kept going on like an awful song  
All my friends, they say "Just get over him"  
Up 'till now that's been so hard  
But see I been watching you  
I'd like you to teach me the way you move  
Been down for so long  
But now I'm up. ..  
And on the floor!  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Just grab somebody  
And move your body  
Don't gotta be naughty  
Just turn out the party  
If you're feeling somebody  
Gotta work your body  
Gotta twerk your body  
And they'll notice you  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is my jam, this is my song  
Gonna dance to my song all night long  
Gotta have some fun  
Dance until the sun  
There's people to be won  
Gonna have some fun  
This is my jam, this is my song  
Gonna dance to my song all night long  
Gotta have some fun  
Dance until the sun  
There's people to be won  
Gonna have some fun  
  
Now we've been dancing for a little bit  
But I'd like to get to know you  
You seem just right  
You're out of sight  
You're Mr. Right  
Let's talk some more  
  
(Repeat Pre-Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
You're Mr. Right  
You're outta sight  
You seem just right  
My emotions won't fight  
I wanted to party

I grabbed you!  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Pre-Chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
They'll notice you  
They'll notice you  
Don't pay no dues  
They'll notice you

I've been so... Been so blue  
Oh, is that all I was to you  
A pretty face with a name  
I guess that you can't explain  
How you went away...  
I hope you, you will find that special girl  
And you make her shine  
Baby, gave you heart and soul  
All you did was play a role...  
Baby boy now you are gone  
Oh, Mystic Man, tell me who are you today?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Do they know they're all being played?  
Oh Mystic Man  
Baby, tell me what is this?  
I'm out the door I can't take no more of your.... Shhhh(it)

I love you more than life  
I'd give you all I have  
You know, I need you next to me  
  
Like the touch of a star  
You came to my life  
Giving me happiness  
With the warmth of the sun  
You blessed me inside  
Giving me radiance  
  
Bridge  
Ooh you know it's true (you know it's true)  
My miracle is you  
  
Chorus  
I love you more than life  
I'd give you all I have  
You know, I need you next to me  
You always give me love  
You sent from up above  
You know, I need you next to me  
  
Like a rainbow of light  
You've opened my dreams  
Filling my emptiness  
When I'm deep in your arms  
I feel what love means  
Just with a simple kiss  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby  
You give me more than anybody can conceive  
So pure and special  
Your love is the key  
I will be sure to have you always next to me  
You've given me the reason- the reason to live  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
I love to see you smile  
I loved you all the while  
You know I need you next to me  
Yeah,  
  
Spoken: I need you next to me.

On a shameless night  
In a nameless place  
I thought that love was a hopeless case til I found you, til I found you  
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city  
The world's no love just pain and pity til I found you, til I found you  
  
And you don't know how you saved me  
And you don't know what you gave me  
And you don't know how you saved my life  
  
I can see the light  
I have flown away  
I have come alive  
I am blown away  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found, now that I found you  
I can live my life  
I believe in faith  
I have found myself  
I have lost the hate  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found you, now that I found you  
  
(Yeah)  
On a shameless night  
In a nameless place  
I thought that love was a hopeless case til I found you, til I found you  
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city  
The world's no love just pain and pity til I found you, til I found you  
  
And you don't know how you saved my life  
  
I can see the light  
I have flown away  
I have come alive  
I am blown away  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found you, now that I found you  
Yeah  
  
All my life  
I've waited for this day  
I've waited for you (For you)  
Now I adore you  
All my life  
I've waited for this day  
I've waited for you  
Now I adore you  
  
I can see the light  
I have flown away  
I have come alive  
I am blown away  
I have felt the love  
I can see the truth  
Now that I found you, now that I found you  
Yeah

Oh yeah...  
They say in this world,  
Love can't last forever,  
But I don't believe that's true.  
Cos the way that I feel when we're together,  
I know that's the way,  
I'll always feel for you.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
There'll come a day when the world stops turning,  
And stars will fall from the sky,  
But this feeling will last when the sun stops burning,  
All I wanna do is love you until the end of time.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop, never stop,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
It's gonna take more than a lifetime,  
To give you all the love I feel for you tonight.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop, never stop,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
From now until forever,  
That's how long I'll be true,  
I'll make you this vow,(oh yeah)  
And promise you now until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
Until forever,  
I'll never stop loving you.

The way you smile, the way you taste  
You know I have an appetite for sexy things  
All you do is look at me, it's a disgrace  
What's running through my mind is you,  
Up in my face  
yeah, yeah  
  
Your voice is like music to my ears,  
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears  
Take me high and just wipe away my fears,  
When you're with me  
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that i hear  
  
Ooh, ooh baby  
Touch me and i come alive  
I can feel you on my lips  
I can feel you deep inside  
Ooh, ooh baby  
In your arms I finally breathe  
Wrap me up in all your love  
That's the oxygen I need, yeah  
  
You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up with your love  
  
The more you move,  
The more I tense  
It's like you got me hypnotized  
I'm in a trance  
Your jersey fits  
It's right at home, between my hands  
And now I hope you know that I'm  
Your biggest fan  
yeah, yeah  
  
Your voice is like music to my ears,  
Whisper softly and the world just dissapears  
Take me high and just wipe away my fears,  
When you're with me  
Oh boy, it's my heartbeat that i hear  
  
Ooh, ooh baby  
Touch me and i come alive  
I can feel you on my lips  
I can feel you deep inside

You're fillin me up  
You're fillin me up with your love  
  
You got something that I really want and  
Come here, oh we don't even have to talk and

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I think I did it again  
I made you believe we're more than just friends  
Oh baby  
It might seem like a crush  
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious  
Cause to lose all my senses  
That is just so typically me  
Oh baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Oops! I did it again  
I played with your heart, got lost in the game  
Oh baby, baby  
Oops! You think I'm in love  
That I'm sent from above  
I'm not that innocent  
  
You see my problem is this  
I'm dreaming away  
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist  
I cry, watching the days  
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways  
But to lose all my senses  
That is just so typically me  
Baby, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
"All aboard"  
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"  
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?"  
"Yeah, yes it is"  
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"  
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"  
"Oh, you shouldn't have"  
  
Oops! I did it again to your heart  
Got lost in this game, oh baby  
Oops! You think that I'm sent from above  
I'm not that innocent

Let's, let's play pretend  
Like you're my friend  
And everything is O.K.  
  
Then we shall begin  
To put an end  
To all the games that we play  
  
My body's a temple  
I'll choose who worships it  
Let's keep it simple  
No need for a big deal  
  
So if you're ready  
Just call me on the phone  
I'll be here waiting  
No need to be alone  
  
Ouch, your heart, you're burning me up  
Please don't stop, you're making me blush  
Ouch, my God, you hit my spot  
I just can't get enough of you, of you, of you, of you  
  
So, say how you've you been  
How's your girlfriend  
It's funny you're here with me  
  
When you're still with her  
And I do prefer  
That we don't feel guilty

Breathe you out  
Breathe you in  
You keep coming back to tell me  
You're the one who could have been  
And my eyes see it all so clear  
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears  
I try to put it in the past  
Hold on to myself and don't look back  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna dream about  
All the things that never were  
Maybe I can live without  
When I'm out from under  
I don't wanna feel the pain  
What good would it do me now  
I'll get it all figured out  
When I'm out from under  
(From under, from under, from under, from under)  
  
So let me go  
Just let me fly away  
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper  
And much darker every day  
Watch me now and I'll be someone new  
My heart will be unbroken  
It will open up for everyone but you  
Even when I cross the line  
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And part of me still believes  
When you say you're gonna stick around  
And part of me still believes  
We can find a way to work it out  
But I know that we tried everything we could try  
So let's just say goodbye  
Forever  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
From under, from under, from under, from under.

[Chorus]  
Outrageous, when I move my body.  
Outrageous, when I'm at a party.  
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans.  
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene.  
Outrageous, my sex drive.  
Outrageous, my shopping spree.  
Outrageous, we on a world tour  
Outrageous, let's be it girl!  
  
Outrageous  
  
Sexy as I want to be.  
Got these fellas chasing me.  
It's 'bout time I hit the streets.  
All my girls still feelin' me  
  
B-girl ain't lost the beat.  
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet.  
Gotta keep going, no stopping me  
And if you don't like it then  
  
La la la la la la la  
  
Media over here  
Come through like a world premiere.  
Trench coat and my underwear  
Let's go with this freak show, it's?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Outrageous  
  
Ding ding ding  
Ding ding ding ding ding  
  
I'm about to bring the heat  
Locking down the industry  
All dressed up and glamorous  
Red carpet and cameras  
  
Take trips around the globe  
Rims on my Jeep, so nobody knows  
So hot that you're coming out your clothes  
I'm about to give it to ya  
  
Media over here  
Come through like a world premiere.  
Trench coat and my underwear  
Let's go with this freak show, it's?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Outrageous  
  
I just want to be happy  
In a place where love is free  
Can you take me there somebody?  
Oh, and when you mention my name  
Make you sure you know the truth  
Until I'm about to keep it forever  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I know you hear me on your radio  
Well here we go  
Please turn up your radio  
Wanna tell you somethin  
Hear me on your radio  
Well here wo go  
Please turn up your radio  
Wanna tell you somethin  
  
There was a time  
I used to think  
That love would never turn into reality  
I never thought  
I'd find the one  
But I tell I'm drawn to you a strength of none  
  
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are  
Your love is like a shooting star  
So they can try but they can't touch (touch)  
You gotta look up to us  
  
Cause your love is outta this world (oooh)  
And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first (oooh)  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you  
I keep sayin you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way  
I know this be a song about you  
Forever, everyday  
I know this be a song about you  
  
I'll be your moon  
I'll make it bright  
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light  
And just as far as the moon from the summer sun  
That's how long that I'll be here  
And it's because  
  
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are  
Your love is like a shooting star  
So they can try but they can't touch  
You gotta look up to us  
  
Cause your love is outta this world (oooh)  
And you bring me down to earth  
I love how you put me first (oooh)  
Make me feel my every word  
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you  
I keep sayin, you know this is about you  
It must be  
This is about you  
I never felt this way  
I know this be a song about you  
Forever, everyday  
I know this be a song about you  
  
In my sky  
We're the stars

You're all mine  
Hear my plan  
Understand  
I want you come into my mend, yeah

[Spoken]  
Do you like this?  
This place that I'm bringing you to?  
Because I do...  
Oh my God....  
  
[Verse 1]  
I know this place  
It's still a secret  
And I don't think you've ever been  
It's kinda hard  
To find the entrance  
You need some juice  
But you'll love it once you get in  
This special place it's in the basement  
You have to work your way around  
The place is hot and then it's pumping  
So are you ready to go down?  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's over to you now  
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)  
And it's over to you now  
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
If you behave  
You might be chosen  
Just read it far  
And it tells you how to get there  
And when you come  
You might be stunned  
So baby whatchu waiting for?  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's over to you now  
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)  
And it's over to you now  
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?  
So it's over to you now  
So it's over to you now (now, now, yeah)  
And it's over to you now  
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cause I do.

[Chorus]  
So it's over to you now

And it's over to you now  
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?  
So it's over to you now

And it's over to you now  
Can't you see what I'm thinking-king-king?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.....  
  
[Spoken]  
Oh my God

[Spoken]  
I need time (time)  
Love  
Joy (joy)  
I need space  
I need me  
(Action!)  
  
Say hello to the girl that I am!  
You're gonna have to see through my perspective  
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am  
And I don't want to be so damn protected  
  
There must be another way  
'Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God, I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I tell 'em what I like  
What I want  
And what I don't  
But every time I do I stand corrected  
  
Things that I've been told  
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize  
I'm Overprotected  
  
There must be another way  
'Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I need? time (love)  
I need? space  
(This is it, this is it)  
  
I don't need nobody  
Tellin me just what I want to  
What I what what I'm gonna  
(I need)  
  
Do about my destiny  
I Say No, No  
Nobody tell me just what what what I want to do, (do)  
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be  
Someone else but me  
  
(Action!)  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I don't need nobody  
Tellin' me just what I want to  
What I what what I'm gonna  
Do about my destiny  
  
I Say No, No  
Ain't nobody tell me just what I want to do, do  
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be  
Someone else but me  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected.

I can't let go of control  
I can't let go and not know  
Don't know the way you're heading me  
One day at a time is all I need  
There was a time without trust  
There was a time without love  
But it took you to show me  
I could handover the keys oh  
  
I'll let you lead the way now  
'Cause I want you to take the wheel  
I've never been a passenger though  
I never knew how good it would feel  
The road will twist and turn but  
I know that I am in good hands  
I've never been a passenger no  
But we'll see more without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map  
  
So let's take a walk and get lost  
Let's take a chance on finding us  
I wanna see the world with you  
Every step feels so brand new  
It's hard to jump with no net  
But I've jumped and got no regret  
My co-pilot yeah that's right  
Now I can just enjoy the ride  
  
I'll let you lead the way now  
'Cause I want you to take the wheel  
I've never been a passenger though  
I never knew how good it would feel  
The road will twist and turn but  
I know that I am in good hands  
I've never been a passenger no  
But we'll see more without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map  
  
I know we're finally falling  
'Cause I was giving you half now I'm all in  
My hands in the air while you're drivin'  
This is livin'  
This is livin'  
This is livin'  
Yeah  
  
I'll let you lead the way now  
'Cause I want you to take the wheel  
I've never been a passenger though  
I never knew how good it would feel  
The road will twist and turn but  
I know that I am in good hands  
I've never been a passenger no  
But we'll see more without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map  
Without a map

Are you ready for me?

There is no end to it  
No  
As far as I can see  
And we will not faultier

Yeah, we can share the dream  
  
Feel It  
Taste the victory  
Feet It burning  
Burning inside of me  
Right now

This is where we belong  
Making it happen now  
  
(Hey!)  
Nothing will stop us  
Won't pull us under  
It's gonna start.  
It's gonna start right now  
  
Share the dream

I just cannot go on like this  
I don't want it to last forever  
Got a feeling from your sweet kiss  
I don? T want us to stay together  
  
And you think  
I need you  
But you got it wrong babe  
And I know  
You want me  
To stay here forever  
(But you? Re so wrong)  
  
You took a piece of my heart  
You took a piece of me, to keep me safe  
You took a piece of my heart  
Now I want it back  
So give it back to me  
  
Now you just have to let me go  
Give me back what belongs to me now  
Cause I just have to let you know  
It? S all over for us now baby  
  
But I know  
You want me  
To stay here forever  
And you think I need you  
But you got it wrong babe  
(Oh, so wrong)  
  
You took a piece of my heart...

Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Would you rather I dim the lights  
Would you prefer, just like we were  
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)  
However may I pleasure you  
Fill with bubbles  
Warm you a bath  
Lay back relax  
Anything you ask  
Let me release the stress for you  
However may I pleasure you  
  
You're so perfect  
That I get nervous  
Tonight I'm at your service  
I'm so unselfish  
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life  
I'll spend forever breaking through  
Do whatever just to pleasure you  
  
Hey Britney, it's Don Phillip  
  
Any fantasy can occur  
Will be observed  
Just say the word  
I'll do it if you want me to  
Whatever just to pleasure you  
  
If you wanna get off from that  
Lay on your back  
I got the max  
Certainly I'll pull you through  
Whatever just to pleasure you  
  
You're so perfect  
That I get nervous  
Tonight I'm at your service  
I'm so unselfish  
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night

Do whatever just to pleasure you

Together  
No matter  
Whatever  
As long as you ask me too (what do you want me to do)  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life

I still see your coat hangin' on the door,  
Never let anybody put one there before  
My pillow's got your head printed on it  
Baby, of all the guys you were my favorite  
  
Don't ask, me why  
I just can't say goodbye  
No not, tonight

Like quicksand, like quicksand  
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand  
Like quicksand, baby like quicksand  
Baby because you and me are sinking like quicksand  
  
You came along I didn't know of love

But it is just my heart, it's pounding like before  
  
Wish I, could try  
But I just can't say goodbye  
No not, tonight  
No, I just can't say it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
'Cause the ground is breaking,  
I can feel it shaking  
Wish it was that easy,  
But it's not that easy  
Gotta hold my hands up,  
Gotta keep my head up  
Gotta keep on breathing,  
Baby even if we're sinking  
Even if we're sinking  
Baby even if we're sinking  
Even if we are sinking  
  
'Cause I just-just gotta-gotta hold (Hold)

Only got one life to live,  
We don't even need a piece of sand  
Only you and me,  
We need to hold on and hold on and...  
  
Only got one life to live,  
We don't even need a piece of sand  
Only you and me,  
We need to hold on and hold on and hold on  
And hold on  
And hold on, and hold on  
  
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on  
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on  
And hold on, and hold on, and hold on

Confidence is a must  
Cockiness is a plus  
Edginess is a rush

Yeah?  
I thought so  
  
No, nothing will stop it  
You can waste your time  
Yeah, you feel desire  
You made up your mind  
  
Pre - chorus:  
Feel it  
Taste the victory  
Feel it burning  
Burning inside of me  
  
Chorus:  
Right now (Hey!)  
I will be your champion  
This is where we belong  
Making it happen now! (Hey!)  
Nothing will stop us  
Won't pull us under  
It's gonna start right now!  
  
There is no end to this, no  
As far as I can see  
And we will not falter  
Yeah, we can share de dreams  
  
Pre - chorus

Chorus:  
Right now (Hey!)  
I will be your champion  
This is where we belong  
Making it happen now! (Hey!)  
Nothing will stop us  
Won't pull us under  
It's gonna start...  
  
Right now (Hey!)

Making it happen now! (Hey!)  
Nothing will stop us  
Won't pull us under  
It's gonna start...

Get up, get up, get up!  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Get up, get up, get up!  
  
Paparazzi flashin',  
You jump on the stage  
Sittin' in the crowd,  
And I'm watchin' (I'm watchin'),  
Baby  
  
Groupies in the back,  
You're under attack  
They're screamin' your name  
But I don't give a damn,  
'Cause I like it (I like it),  
I like it (I like it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Turn the spotlight on,  
Move a little, shred your guitar  
You're my dirty rock boy!  
Turn the mic way up,  
Sweat a little, ownin' the crowd  
You're my dirty rock boy!  
  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?  
Get up, get up, get up!  
Are you ready to roll, my rock boy?  
  
Finishin' your encore,  
And sippin' champagne  
(A rock star, rock star)  
You make me so hot!  
  
Body burnin' up the fever,  
Don't make me wait  
Meet me in your dressing room,  
I want it, want it, want it  
(I want it, I want it)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction,  
Play me like a guitar and get into action!  
The second that I saw you I could feel an attraction,  
Play me like a guitar and swing, swing, swing, swing!  
  
[Chorus:]

Put your ass on your shoulders and you ain't nobody  
Nobody really wanted get down and hang with you  
Cause you only hand around fake people that barely know you  
Love to kiss your ass and have to agree with you  
Take a look around when you are down by yourself  
And you will see who is standing next to you  
No one buy you up and change your number every time  
You were blind nobody gave a damn but you  
  
Chorus  
So why do you play that game  
You don't even know my name  
So who do you think you are  
You wanna be a rock star  
Get up on your own pro  
... Be alone  
By the time you hear this song  
You're gonna be a rock star  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
  
Say say  
Xo xo xo  
  
... Every minute of the day of the second of the hour  
You try to come back but is way too late  
How does it feel all alone on the throne  
And the crowd is gone and you are holding on  
So I saw you at the... With your head back with your shoulders down low  
Is funny cause you don't even know  
So more people they can't even recognize  
Don't have a clue  
  
Chorus  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
  
Say say  
I hate to break it to you  
But I am not thinking about you  
You are so wrapped up in your voice  
For your noise don't go ask on your boys... Been  
You talk so much but so what  
They just want you shut yourself up  
All my girl scream and shout  
If you got an xo give them...  
  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you  
Say my love not gonna give you  
Say... Got to milk you  
Say I never loved you
