To be the last to leave...  
The last to be gone  
Stolen from the ones  
Who held onto him  
To be the last in line  
From the ones that live on  
Silhouette of a dream  
Treasured by the ones  
Who held on to him  
Almost a breakdown  
Of our love affair...  
The stiletto cuts quick  
Like a whip through the air  
Long distance winners  
Will we survive the flight  
Not one of us runs  
From the firelight  
And I would love to believe  
I believe what you say  
But in the drama of the moment  
Oh well there is no easy way  
No-one ever leaves  
Everyone stays close 'til the fire fades  
To be the last to leave  
Well, what caused the fearsome  
Divorce in the night  
When there was no competition  
Well to survive, do it right  
And you can believe in the five  
To survive the distance  
Everyone fights...everyone fights....  
And the fire flies  
Well what happened to my feelings....  
There were angry words in the night  
Some call it our nightmare  
My five fireflies  
Oh like a sailing ship...  
But not one of us runs..  
OOooohhh -why...  
It's our love affair  
It cuts like a whip through the air  
And I would love to believe  
To believe what you say  
It's ok..........

I'm gonna catch the first train home  
I don't know what I come here for  
Yeah, first train home  
I don't know what I come here for  
'Cause for nine long years I couldn't even walk out of my door  
Here's what I say  
  
Break:  
  
I'm gonna catch the first train home  
I don't know what I come here for  
The first train, the first train home  
I don't know what I come here for  
'Cause for nine long years, I couldn't even walk out of my door

Well I try and I try  
You can't forget her  
Can't run, can't hide  
When you remember  
  
Nights that won't fade away  
Yea fade away  
Well I still go crazy  
When you hear her name  
  
Feels like you just left today  
And it drives you insane  
But you keep holding on  
Yeah holding on  
  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
  
Every night, every day  
That's where you still play  
In the back of my mind  
When I close my eyes  
  
You can still touch her  
And I fantasize  
She's still your lover  
When I wake up I see  
  
The only place you'll be  
I know where you'll be  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
Every night, every day  
That's where you still play  
  
In the back of my mind  
I remember your eyes burning bright  
Like we touched the summer sun  
I can see your shadow standing there  
  
On the streets where we used to run  
Remember  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
Every night, every day  
That's where you still play  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind  
You live all the time  
  
In the back of my mind  
In the back of my mind

I had another dream of you last night  
Sailing on a sea of blue  
You were grieving for someone else  
I was grieving for you  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
In between the shadow and the sun  
In between the black and blue  
From a window I heard your voice  
Telling me you were through  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
Miss fantasy  
I can see you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
And do you still tremble when I fall  
Will you still answer when I call  
Would you still love to linger up against the wall  
Everyone whispers when you go  
Into the silence of their love  
10, 000 voices crying over with the show  
  
Everybody saying shine your light  
Everybody knows it's true  
Your the queen of the underground  
Never leaving a clue  
  
Miss fantasy  
It may be you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
Miss fantasy  
I can see you don't remember me  
But I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you  
  
I remember you

Say you love me  
Say those three words and  
I will give my love to you  
My love is higher than a mission bell (how deep?)  
Deeper than a wishing well (how strong?)  
Stronger than a magic spell  
My love, for you  
  
It's wider than the widest sea (how long?)  
Longer than a memory (How sweet?)  
Sweeter than a honey tree  
My love, um, for you  
  
Give me your heart of gold  
Your heavenly magic touch  
To cherish have and hold  
I need your love so much  
  
Say you love me  
Say those three words and  
I will give my love to you  
My love is warmer than a day in spring (how bright?)  
Brighter than a diamond ring (how great?)  
Greater than a mighty king  
My love, for you  
  
Is taller than the tallest tree (how soft?)  
Softer than a summer breeze  
Oh I ask you please  
Give your love, your love  
Sweet love to me  
  
How high (um)  
How deep (um)  
How strong (um)  
How wide (um)  
How long (um)

Monday morning you sure look fine  
Friday I got travelin' on my mind  
First you love me, then you fade away  
I can't go on believin' this way  
I got nothing but love for you  
So tell me what you really want to do  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
  
I'll be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind  
Monday morning you look so fine  
Friday I got travelin' on my mind  
First you love me, then you say it's wrong  
I can't go on believing for long  
  
But you know it's true  
You only want me when I get over you  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
I'll be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind

All the saints and sinners  
They pay handsomely  
MSCAE they make the weapons  
And they run the prisons  
And they sell the justice  
'Cause being guilty is just good business  
Well, we're standing on the borderline  
Ain't no one here going to stop it now  
  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
  
Half-closed eyes and unconscious death  
Do you feel the ooze as your brain drains out  
From the pneumatic drills and sharpened knives?  
Blood in the sky, are you dead or alive?  
All the restless people and the bitter green  
Well, it takes this gold, make the spirit mean  
  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Murrow's turnin' over in his grave  
Ed Murrow had a child  
The damn thing went wild

I woke up one morning  
Waking with the rising sun  
Woke up one morning  
Awakin' with the rising sun, ahh  
Thought about my baby  
Did I just do what she done  
Well, I shoulda loved you more  
I know I didn't treat her right  
Oh, yes, I shoulda loved you more  
I know I didn't treat her right  
I know that a woman needs  
Rollin' every day and night  
Oh, yeah  
Break:  
Well, my heart beat like a hammer  
My eyes plumb full of tears  
Yes, my heart beat like a hammer  
My eyes plumb full of tears  
She's been gone about an hour  
But it seems like a thousand years  
Don't ever dog your woman  
You know you're gonna ruin yourself  
Don't ever dog your woman  
You know you're gonna ruin yourself  
Know that a woman she'll  
Run off with somebody else  
Oh, yeah

Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
Times I've wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
Times I've wondered  
Why it is a lonesome day  
I see you walking  
See you walking away  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do  
There's one thing that I know  
I'll never let you go  
Although the people say  
I shouldn't treat you this way  
Help me baby  
Help me take my blues away  
Wake up one morning  
Feel good one sunny day  
All I want from you  
Is more then I can do

Although the people say

How can my heart be filled with doubts of you  
When you can fill me with a love that's true  
But I can't help but sigh  
And sometimes wonder why  
What can I do  
  
I want to see you more and more each day  
I really need you, you're my only way  
You say it's alright now  
But still I wonder how  
What can I say  
  
I've dreamed a thousand dreams  
And cried so many tears  
'Cause when you're not in my heart it seems  
Like I've wasted all my years  
  
Someday together we will fly to the sun  
And then we'll think of all the things we've done  
Everyone will smile  
Happy all the while  
Now that we're one  
  
I've dreamed a thousand dreams

I'm out of my mind  
And it's only over you  
I'm out of my mind  
And it's only over you  
People think I'm crazy  
  
But they don't know  
Thought love had failed me  
But now, they're watching it grow  
Angel, please don't go  
I miss you when you're gone  
They say I'm a silly girl  
  
But I'm not a fool  
People say they know me  
But they don't see  
My heart's your future  
Your future is me  
Angel, please don't go  
I miss you when you're gone  
They say I'm a silly girl  
  
But I'm not a fool  
I'm out of my mind  
And it's only over you  
I'm out of my mind  
And it's only over you

You like a man with a future  
You like a woman with a past  
Well do you really believe that  
She said to faces in the crowd  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
And even if you did miss me  
You never let me know  
You prefer to be just a little bit  
In and out of love with me  
And not to scream and shout  
You prefer to be just a little bit  
In and out of agony  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
Come on now, let the sad winds blow down  
As the rain came, she refused to wear her coat  
But deep in her heart she knew, that the song must go on  
  
He says well I have forgotten you  
And your beautiful eyes  
We were off the wall  
We were mirrors of our former selves  
  
Well you could have said no  
You could have said well I just can't  
Whoa we were off the wall  
We were mirrors of each other  
Passing by  
  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else  
  
Well I was your paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Well I was you paper doll  
(yesterday I was fascinated by somebody else)  
Paper doll  
  
And it doesn't even matter  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)  
It was a real clear answer  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)  
I was fascinated by somebody else  
(I was fascinated by somebody else)

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldn't you love to love her?  
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover?  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
  
She is like a cat in the dark and then  
She is the darkness  
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when  
The sky is starless  
  
All your life you've never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?  
Will you ever win?  
Will you ever win?

Wait a minute baby  
Stay with me awhile  
Said you'd give me light  
But you never told me about the fire  
  
Drowning in the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now it's gone  
It doesn't matter what for  
When you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
And he was just like a great dark wing  
Within the wings of a storm  
I think I had met my match, he was singing  
And undoing, and undoing the laces  
Undoing the laces  
  
Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart  
Never change, never stop  
But now it's gone  
It doesn't matter what for  
But when you build your house  
Then call me home  
  
Hold on  
The night is coming and the starling flew for days  
I'd stay home at night, all the time  
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere  
Ask me and I'm there, yeah  
Ask me and I'm there, I care  
  
In the sea of love  
Where everyone would love to drown  
But now it's gone  
They say it doesn't matter anymore  
When you build your house  
Then please call me home  
  
Sara, you're the poet in my heart  
Never change, and don't you ever stop  
Now it's gone  
No it doesn't matter anymore  
When you build your house  
I'll come by

So you face yesterday  
Thinking on the days of old  
And the price that we paid  
For a love we couldn't hold  
  
I let you slip away  
There was nothing I could do  
That was so long ago, yeah  
Still I often think of you  
  
I fall down, I get up  
And I've always had to fight  
Everything that was wrong  
For the things that were right  
  
Now I finally found my way  
Now I know just what to do  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you  
  
It's so hard to find your way  
When the lies come around  
Still it happens everyday  
So don't let it get you down  
  
Just a time within a time  
Just a scheme within a scheme  
A little world within a world  
Yes, a dream, just a dream  
  
Now I finally found my way  
Now I know just what to do  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you  
  
Now I best be on my way  
Before the night turns blue  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
And now I say goodbye to you  
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah  
Now I say goodbye to you

Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,  
You know I'm falling, falling, falling, at your feet,  
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,  
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go.  
  
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,  
And there's not another living soul around,  
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,  
And you say that you love me.  
  
Have pity baby,  
Just when I thought it was over,  
Now you got me running, running, running for cover.  
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,  
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me.  
  
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,  
There's not another living soul around,  
You woo me until the sun comes up,  
And you say that you love me.  
  
Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away,  
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker, everyday,  
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,  
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me.  
  
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,  
There's not another living soul around,  
You woo me until the sun comes up,  
And you say that you love me.  
  
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,  
Yhere's not another living soul around,  
You woo me until the sun comes up,

Say that you love me

Someone has taken my place  
When times go bad  
When times go rough  
Won't you lay me down in tall grass  
And let me do my stuff  
  
I know I got nothin' on you  
I know there's nothing to do  
When times go bad  
And you can't get enough  
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass  
And let me do my stuff  
  
One thing I think you should know  
I ain't gonna miss you when you go  
Been down so long  
I've been tossed around enough  
Awh couldn't you just  
Let me go down and do my stuff  
  
I know you're hopin' to find  
Someone who's gonna give you piece of mind  
When times go bad  
When times go rough  
Won't you lay me down in tall grass  
And let me do my stuff

You are here and warm,  
But I could look away and you'd be gone.  
'Cause we live in a time,  
  
When meaning falls in splinters from our minds.  
And that's why I've traveled far,  
'Cause I come so together where you are.  
  
And all of the things that I said that I wanted  
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you  
Fourteen joys and a will to be married  
All of the things that you say are very  
  
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,  
Sentimental lady, gentle one.  
Sentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,  
Sentimental lady, gentle one.  
  
Now you are here today,  
But easily you might just slip away.  
  
'Cause we live in a time,  
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme.  
And that's why I've traveled far  
'Cause I come so together where you are.  
  
And all of the things that I said that I wanted

Now the wind  
That's blowing out of the southwest  
Is telling me, boy you better beware  
Here she comes, and they call her the sweet omega  
And you'll come to know the meaning of her stare  
Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride  
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes  
And although she'll bring you joy  
Don't you know she can destroy  
Oh lord she's changing me  
When you're down  
And you're headed for a bad night  
And you're seeing shapes of trouble in the stars  
She'll take your hand, cause they call her the sweet omega  
Then she'll take away the sadness in your heart  
Cause the only road that you'll ever need to ride  
Is the one that's rolling out, beyond her eyes  
And although she'll bring you joy  
Don't you know she can destroy  
Oh lord she's changing me

The only road you'll ever need to ride  
Oh, lord she's changing me...  

Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
It doesn't take much to please me  
My little child  
  
Shine me a light from your eyes dear  
Don't let me see a single tear  
Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
Soon you'll be a man  
My little one  
So have fun while you can  
Or there'll be none  
  
Everything's going fast around you  
There will be things to astound you  
You'll be a man in no time  
My little one  
  
So take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
It doesn't take much to please me  
My little child  
  
Shine me a light from your eyes dear  
Don't let me see a single tear  
Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
It doesn't take much to please me  
My little child  
  
Shine me a light from your eyes dear  
Don't let me see a single tear  
Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
Soon you'll be a man  
My little one  
So have fun while you can  
Or there'll be none  
  
Everything's going fast around you  
There will be things to astound you  
You'll be a man in no time  
My little one  
  
So take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
It doesn't take much to please me  
My little child  
  
Shine me a light from your eyes dear  
Don't let me see a single tear  
Take everything easy  
Show me a smile  
Ooh
