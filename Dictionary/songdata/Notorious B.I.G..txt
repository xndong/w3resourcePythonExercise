[Jamaican host]  
Ladies and Gentlemen  
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare... The band fanfare because... Ladies and
gentlemen... Sting has always gone ahead of itself.  
They have done it again and again and again.  
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten
thousand fire sides.  
And if you know... And if you enjoy hip-hop... If you want one of the coldest
brothaz out of North America... A brotha that gave you a song like  
Juicy...  
[Bigge] Uh-huh...  
[Jamaican Host]  
You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this  
"Who the heck is this  
Paging me in the morning  
At the crack of dawning"  
[Bigge] Yeauh!  
[Jamaican Host]  
Please welcome... For the first time... In Sting 96... Please welcome
(welcome... Welcome)  
The Notorious.... The Notorious... B. I. G... Aka bigge!

[Puffy background]  
What about ten years from now?  
  
[Biggie]  
Ten years from now, where do I want to be? I want to be...just livin' man,
just  
Living comfortably with my niggas man, in a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo  
You know I'm saying? I got my wife, just lounging with my wife you know I'm  
Saying?  
With my daughter, her daughter, you know just laid back, just chillin,  
You know I'm saying? Living all my niggas is living where I think I be? Ten  
Years  
I don't think I will see it for real dogg for real man, that shit ain't  
Promised man  
I don't think my luck is that good, I hope it is but if it ain't, so be it,
I'm  
Ready  
(your dead wrong)  
  
[B.I.G.chant]  
  
[Repeat til fade out]  
The weaker the strong,  
You got it going on,  
Your dead wrong....

(repeat 2X)  
The weak or the strong  
Who got it goin on  
You're Dead Wrong  
  
(Verse One)  
  
Relax and take note  
While I take totes of the marijuana smoke  
Throw you in choke  
Gun smoke gun smoke  
Biggie Smalls for mayor  
The rap slayer the hooker layer  
Muthafucka say your prayers  
(Hail Mary full of grace)  
Smack the bitch in her face  
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back  
Jab her if she act  
Funny wit the money  
Oh you got me mistakin honey  
I don't wanna rap ya  
I just want the paper  
The Visa capisha  
I'm out like the vapors  
Who's the one the call mister macho  
The head honcho  
Swift fist like camacho  
I got so  
Much style I should be down wit the stylistics  
Make up to break up  
Niggas need to wake up  
Smell the indonesia beat you to a ceasure  
Then fuck your mom hit them skins to amnesia  
She don't remember shit just the two hits  
Her hittin the floor and me hittin the clit  
Suckin on her tit  
Had the hooker beggin for the dick  
And your moms ain't ugly love my dick got rock quick  
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown  
I was humpin around and jumpin around  
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man  
She said B-I-G then I bust in her E-Y-E  
  
Yo Big your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
Your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
Your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
We gotta do things right  
  
(X2)  
The weak or the strong  
Who got it goin on  
You're dead wrong  
  
(Verse Two)  
  
The pain I inflict  
Like a convict  
????????????????? vigor  
Jump in my Acura Vigor after I stick ya  
Rip ya like razor straight up henny wit no chasa  
Watch me erase ya misplace ya  
Put ya in the back wit the derelects  
Yeah I pop plenty shit  
Chump i'm makin hits  
No time for that crack rockin shit  
Took you to another level  
Now i'm gettin crazy pates  
Gettin paid from the devil  
Another amatuer tryna damage the pedigree  
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E you know it's me  
Hoes I thought you knew i'm smooth as a baby's ass  
Smooth as Teddy Pentergras  
Smoke the grass get in ya ass  
The Brooklyn born teflon don  
Reckin shop  
Gettin props provin nobody drops  
Words as potent as the blunt smokin Bed Stuy bandit  
And niggas just can't understand it  
I bust a cap for my brothers in Nappmack,Comstock,and Clinton  
You know my shit is hittin  
Yeah ya'll the fly nigga Biggie Smalls  
Kickin flavor make a nigga dig up in they draws  
For the burn that catch your body  
I got styles like karate  
Jujitsu when I hit you  
Then I split you like a cantaloupe  
Hope you gotta rope to hang yourself  
I rhyme for self  
From Brooklyn where else  
Back like a Lexus coop i'll rip your troup  
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop  
What you think i'm stupid muthafucka  
My crew is mad deep  
I hope you niggas sleep  
  
(Chorus)

Intro: Jermaine Dupri  
  
B Side, B side, ha, check it  
So So Def... Bad Boy... Collaboration  
The Notorious big in the house  
We got Da Brat in the house  
And me, y'all know who I be  
Check it...  
  
I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to  
Funk for your trunk is what I provide you  
So slide through your hood with me in your deck  
Cause your correct way to get your groove on Flossin  
I paid the costs to be the boss as a kid  
Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with  
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again  
Back with the Big and my new-found friend  
  
[Da Brat]  
Sliding in from the front, never way behind  
Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine  
Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip  
Brat and Biggie Smalls...  
  
[Nortorious B. I. G.]  
Aw, shit!  
On top of all that, I'm so, so remarkable,  
Flow to make you motherfuckers know  
Ain't an mc coming close to touch  
Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so...  
  
Chorus (2x): Manuel Seal  
Lay on nite, light up the blunts  
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want  
  
[Notorious B. I. G.]  
I never knew, niggas had a clue  
On who was the king of the street  
More deep than a Range Rover jeep, guns under the seat  
And my nigga just came home from work, release  
Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air  
(Brat: nigga, pass that shit like you just don't care)  
Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs  
When I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist  
Nigga, no human being, Korean or European  
Be seein' what Big be seein', I leave 'em peein'  
In they draws, because Biggie Smalls  
Is far from weak -- Brat-tat-tat, please speak...  
(Brat: nigga, close your eyes, cause you already see  
The Notorious B-are-A-T)  
The raw combination, the destination,  
Number one tote a gun with no hestiation  
Live with the funkdafied cutie pie  
Gat by the thigh, the Smalls by her side  
If you fuck with her you got to fuck with me  
And we'll be rapping at your motherfuckin' eulogy, so...  
  
Chorus  
  
Jermaine Dupri:  
Brat-tat-tat-tat, please speak...  
  
[Da Brat]  
I got the funk in my pocket, shit stay locked down  
The nigga you know who represent them platinuim sounds  
Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy  
Didn't find nuthin but truth, in the hook B  
You're pledging to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die  
Jump in the Benz, took me a little ride  
Round the mountain, broke a left, hit Sosodef  
And told the nigga jd I was the one, fuck the rest  
We Funkdafied, kicking it live  
Robin Leach teach a nigga how to really survive  
Whether it be track or blunt, ain't no need to front  
Got what you need, and I take everything you ever wanted, nigga  
We comin' mass, his pimpin' ass, his glass is full of Moet  
The Rolex is bar-bayed, parkade, B to the are-A, T  
Rolling off slow on chrome 17's  
  
Chorus  
  
Outro: Jermaine Dupri  
Lay back, listen to the B-Side  
Slide, glide, do whatever you want  
Get out your lighters  
We be the rhyme writers  
Starters... From the heart of College Park,  
New York, Chicago... Wherever you wanna go

[BIG] Never a flaw

[Kim] Yaknow, feel me on this, huh, uhh  
  
Ladies and gents  
Your dopest host presents extravagence

Niggaz remain in awe, when I brought a Dillinger  
Throw it to ya jaw, uhh  
Never a flaw  
Never before, have you seen such magnificense  
in the black princess, yesss  
Flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggy  
Ask Biggie, keep a dedicated squad wit me  
Call us the Gabbana girls  
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us  
Trust, niggaz lust  
Without a bank account, I doubt we could swing that route  
Feel me out uhh, I'm used ta  
hangin wit boosters, in the best name brand  
with the in-sane clan, man listen  
My position is lieutenant  
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it  
Percent it, I send it back to ya greasy  
Freak it arabic style, sha-muck-daha-steesy  
To please me you got to be well off  
Bust a shell off, wit a tattoo that starts off  
  
Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.  
  
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja  
Sensimilla, can I feel ya  
All I wanna do is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby  
(repeat)  
  
Uhh, to my niggaz that trick a little  
To my bitches that suck dick a little  
While they niggaz lick the middle, I'm the Don y'all  
High driven Jean Paul Cartier wear  
Yeah, enough glorifyin  
Lyrically electrifyin, bitches by lyin  
bout the clothes they be buyin  
Some stores won't even let you whores in  
Til I begin to embarass that ass and get crass  
Kim surpass, all crews  
Bitches still drinkin booze  
I sip Cristal and Landcruise  
Recieve all the oohhs and the ahhhs, the jewels and the cars  
Slick nigga, I'm stickin you Baby Pah, uhh  
Yes indeed, flows first class and yours is coach  
like the bag, the Prada mama  
Jog five miles a day then I hit the sauna  
My girls rock Chanel and smoke mad marijuana  
  
Chorus  
  
Inhale this, clench your fist  
Then ya, feel the mist through the uterus  
Can ya, picture this  
Life without me, wake up you're having bad dreams  
cause ya fiend for a toke  
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats  
On the cell with the boat  
What you thought, we get caught and get bailed out  
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessey on the rocks  
is all we got as we sail out, entrepeneurs  
Cristal pourers, be glad we ain't takin yours  
Boring huh, I'm warnin ya  
Style waits for no bitch, a dream bitch  
when I fuck with scratch and sniff  
Now I stacks the shit, practice it  
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous  
So I can relax a bit, and get my toes licked  
The drugs nigga, a-hah hah hah!  
  
Chorus

R.I.P Big

It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Watch It)  
Cause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)  
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Weezy)  
  
Mad trees and bitches in dungarees  
The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees  
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze  
I'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's  
I sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall  
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball  
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right  
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life  
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife  
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork  
So be smart and play your own part  
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart  
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell  
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail  
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich  
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6  
  
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life  
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
  
[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]  
It's showdown time, throwdown time  
Same d-off, four pound time  
Clack Clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine  
Check it man, I'm wit whatever  
Goodness gracious the paper  
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?  
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me  
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see  
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down  
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now  
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred  
Keep it coming til I'm full on my stomach  
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my hase  
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays  
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga  
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?  
  
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?  
(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight  
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life  
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn  
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?

Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me  
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the  
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on  
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter  
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?  
  
It's all good baby baby  
  
It was all a dream  
I used to read Word Up magazine  
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine  
Hangin pictures on my wall  
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl  
I let my tape rock til my tape popped  
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock  
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack  
With the hat to match  
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha  
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far  
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight  
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade  
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner  
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner  
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri  
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)  
I'm blowin up like you thought I would  
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)  
It's all good (it's aaalll good)  
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
You know very well who you are  
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars  
You had a few, but not that many  
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty  
  
I made the change from a common thief  
To up close and personal with Robin Leach  
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day  
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way  
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy  
Girls used to diss me  
Now they write letters cause they miss me  
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff  
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff  
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast  
From the Mississippi down to the east coast  
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks  
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak  
Livin life without fear  
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears  
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool  
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school  
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood  
And it's still all good  
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis  
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this  
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa  
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur  
Phone bill about two G's flat  
No need to worry, my accountant handles that  
And my whole crew is lounging  
Celebrating every day, no more public housing  
Thinking back on my one-room shack  
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back  
And she loves to show me off, of course  
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source  
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us  
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us  
Birthdays was the worst days  
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay  
Uh, damn right I like the life I live  
Cause I went from negative to positive  
And it's all  
  
(It's all good)  
  
Aand if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Its Bad Boy bitch  
Scram Jones the Clipse B.I.G.  
Let's go  
  
Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions  
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring  
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito  
Hitting fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's  
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease  
Muah!, may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours  
Four-four, and fifty-four draw  
As my pilot, steers my Leer  
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear  
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying  
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying  
So don't you get suspicious  
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious  
As I leave my competition, respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style  
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all  
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)  
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)  
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you know where your going too  
Just a memoryeverybody dying  
When I throw my clip in the AK  
May you rest in peace  
Your nobody till somebody kills you  
Do you know where your goin too  
Just a memoryso you better pack a pistol  
Everybody dying, death controls y'all  
Your nobody till somebody kills you  
  
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows  
My back don't bend, see papi is my kinfolk  
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke  
Soul benefactor the Benz, he made the rims poke  
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie  
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy  
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses  
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing  
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow  
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa  
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing  
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)  
On the flip side, the steel I'm gripping  
You thought all the floss had me slipping?  
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing  
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad  
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar  
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car  
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage  
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop  
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue  
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof  
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof  
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable  
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table  
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle  
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able  
This here hughe the most foolish of blues  
When I tell my mom the price  
She damn near sent me to my room  
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S  
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Biggie Duets  
Born Again  
Life After Death  
Legacy lives on..and on, and on  
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG  
shit you ain't even here..  
Motherfuckers better step their game up..  
Greatest of all time, Greatest of all time!  
Motherfuckers

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns  
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons  
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan  
Its that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa  
You got ta, call me, Francis M.H. White  
In tank-light totes, tote iron  
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin  
Keep extra clips for extra shit  
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap  
The mo shady, "Tell em!", Frankie baby  
Ain't no telling where I may be  
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming  
With my man Capone, dumbing, fucking something  
You should know my steelo  
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show  
To orgies with hoes I never seen before  
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious  
Penis, before I squeeze and bust  
If the beef between us, we can settle it  
With the chrome and metal shit  
I make it hot, like a kettle get  
You're delicate, you better get, who sent ya?  
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure  
Biggie, "How are you gonna do it?"  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet  
Look how dark it get, when ya marked with death  
Should I start your breath should I let you die  
In fear you start to cry, ask why  
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick  
You cursed it, but rehearsed it  
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit  
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money  
Don't forget the publishing, I punish em, I'm done with them  
Son, I'm surprised you run with them  
I think they got cum in them, cause they, nothing but dicks  
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks  
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick  
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click  
Take trips to Cairo, laying with yo bitch  
I know you praying you was rich, fucking prick  
When I see ya I'ma  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door, waving the four-four  
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more  
  
This goes out for those that choose to use  
Disrespectful views on the King of NY  
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye  
Now ya Braille in it, stash that light shit, or scalin it  
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight  
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson  
Tote steel like Bronson, vigilante  
You want to get on son, you need to ask me  
Ain't no other king in this rap thing  
They siblings, nothing but my children  
One shot, they disappearing  
Its ill when, MC's used to be on cruddy shit  
Took home, Ready to Die, listened, studied shit  
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue  
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly  
Make the white shake, that's why my money never funny  
And you still recouping, stupid

... me and her sister had somethin goin on  
(Aiyyo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)  
I reach my peak, I can't speak  
Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak  
(Aiyyo c'mon nigga, cut that)  
I'm sick of niggaz lyin, I'm sick of bitches hawkin  
(Aiyyo, yoyo Big, aiyyo chill)  
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin  
  
(Aiyyo Big, aiyyo BIG!!)  
  
Damn... we was spose to rule the world baby  
We was unstoppable!  
The shit can't be over, no  
The shit can't be over man  
I know you hear me nigga  
I know you hear me  
You got too much livin to do  
Too much unfinished business  
It ain't over  
Live your life

[CHORUS]  
TIME, TIME FOR YOU TA DIE  
AS I KISS--YO--ASS--GOODNIGHT  
  
I make yo mouthpiece obese like De laRese  
When I release, you loose teeth like Little Cease  
Nigga please  
Blood floods yo dungarees  
And that's just a half of my warpath  
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater  
Than the average playa hater, and spectators  
Buy my CD twice  
They see me in the streets they be like yo he nice  
But that's on the low doe'  
Be the cats wit no dough, tried ta play me at my show  
I pull out 4-4's, and go up in they clothes  
Short-change niggas  
Snort-cane niggas  
Extortion came quicker  
Bought the Range' nigga  
Ya still tickle me  
I used ta be as strong as ripple, till Little Cease crippled me  
Now I play hard-like my girls nipples be  
The games sour like like a pickle be  
Ya'll know da rules  
Move from BK ta New Jerus  
Thinkin bout, all the planes we flew  
Bitches, we ran through  
Now da years new  
I lay my game flat  
I want my spot back, take two  
Muthafuckas mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious  
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous  
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina  
Slugs missed ya  
I ain't mad at'chya (we ain't mad at'chya)  
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothing  
Catch canes, come out frontin  
Smokin something  
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin  
I laced it wit the basic  
6 TV's, a system, knockin Mase shit, face it  
We hard ta hit  
Guard ya shit, for I stick you, for ya re-up  
Wipe the "P"  
Mix shots, "work ya seat up"  
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up  
LONG KISS  
  
[CHORUS X 2]  
UH-I flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin...  
Maniacs put my name in raps--"support them"

I smoke backwards, and Duchees  
Ya can't touch me  
Try ta rush me  
Slugs go, touchy-touchy  
Ya bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me  
Or beneath me, ya whole life ya live sneaky  
Now ya rest eternally, sleepy, ya burn when ya creep me  
Rest where the worms-n-the weak be  
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys  
Wit the holy ghost  
I put holes in most, you hold ya toast shakey  
Slip-n-tryin ta break me  
Look what'chyou made me do, brains blue  
My team in the Marine blew, six-coupe  
Skiid it out, weeded out, clean it out  
The block for distance is, given long kisses bitch  
  
[CHORUS X 2]  
Frank White the menacin, craw-craw's demenacin  
I got the lettuce in  
You turn green like cucumber skin got the new hummer in the summer when I was  
A new comer  
Then  
Drugs and mac-10's  
Hug from fake friends  
Make ends they hate'chyou, be broke girls won't date'chyou  
That's why I relate to, choke yo ass till ya face blue, make you  
Open the safe too

Distribute to kids who, take heart like Valentine, drink Valentine, all the

Heard through the grapevine, ya got fucked foe times  
Damn that three ta nine, fucked you up for real doe'

As you remorse we feel no  
  
[CHORUS X 6]

[Biggie mom]  
Lets say many times as i looked and soroow reflexes of my son (Biggie) i argue
sometimes and saltied i soroow thoughts and said "Well Done" i thoght of  
Him (Biggie) instinly and slighty ask why i tried formly and just can't say
goodbye i live with visions twin and twisted passion so cold and withored  
Thoghts batored shattered i dream dreams cherish memory's house friendships
and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son  
Love Is Everlasting

So you wanna be hardcore  
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps  
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal  
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin  
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some  
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some  
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy  
I get up in that ass like a wedgie  
Says who? Says me, the lyrical  
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"  
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me  
Just for niggaz actin shifty  
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker  
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor  
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is  
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates  
The funk baby  
  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
  
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches  
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches  
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches  
From stayin in my business, what is this? Relentless  
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not  
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot  
Don't mean I don't tote the glock  
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen  
Until we motherfuckin meet again  
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now  
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now  
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats  
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats  
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)  
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof  
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks  
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick  
The funk baby  
  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
  
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side  
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside  
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests  
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test  
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya  
High as a motherfuckin helicopter  
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor  
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina  
[What's Love, Got to Do]  
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew  
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns  
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons  
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life  
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes  
It's type simple and plain to maintain  
I add a little funk to the brain  
The funk baby  
  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"  
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"

You see I don't sweat  
These hoes I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos N' Jibos  
Bitches just like to play the Merigo (yer we know drop the scenario)  
It was me, D, the M-V-P, the blunts and brew things knockers and Wu-Tang,
M.E.T.H.  
O shit, look at those lips and hips on that bitch  
We hit the crib so I can drop my macadoshar shit like the blunt clip  
And recognize a pimp read Mr. speak the G's obsolete don't sleep bang the
skims in the week  
On the creep of the avenue I seen her on the block who she rappin to?  
That's my nigga D damn he got G now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me see  
  
[Chorus]  
Me casa, you casa,  
O I ain't lookin' for no wife  
I just wanna give dick to ya  
Hit the club, drink ass on ice but ya hit the pussy good,  
Am I doing the thing for you?  
Girl, show me how ya work that thing  
You make a motherfuckin' thug  
Wanna sing and baby, baby, can't you see  
We gonna fuck 'till 6 in the morning  
  
Now I play her far like a move player star  
She still sweatin' me hard because I'm a rap star  
I be cruisn up the block I be passin her  
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger  
And the only time I call to hang, is when me  
And deep blood is up scheming on the gang bang  
She shoulda used her intuition  
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position  
Listen she sayin' I dissed her cause I'm fuckin' her sister  
A message to the fellers that gets some piss uh  
But she started that fuckin' family  
She fucked ma man D so why she mad at me?  
Fuckin sister look better than you,  
Give head better than you, pussy, gets wetter than you  
So break the fuck out like a rash  
I glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass  
  
Red bones to lift ons dubies hip huggers to show off ya booty I'm hangin' with  
The best of them sleep  
If you want I'm a veteran when I show up to the club it's V-I-P  
I'll be dancin' in the club if it's B.I.G  
I'm not lookin' to find a wife, just someone to make a friend of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I roll up off rack and polla  
I'm so high when I walk in the club  
I see this chick that used to get the dick  
Now she freakin' on the floor makin' a nigger reminisce  
Oh I want her back in ma ride, back in ma ride  
I want no girlfriend  
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool,  
We can do this if you feelin' the same I do  
Come on girl, let's go to ma hotel  
Have a party all night in ma hotel  
Pop bubble smoke dope in ma hotel  
In 20 minutes girl  
Hit me on ma self  
  
[Chorus]

Niggas uh, bitches ha uh  
  
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop  
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa  
Gotcha, open off the words I say because  
"This type of shit it happens everyday"  
  
Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?  
What are you a idiot?  
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's  
Got mad guns up in the cabin  
'Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' shit  
I make it happen, you got your ass caught  
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport  
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya  
I blow up spots like little sisters  
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles  
Like Murray, my killings, be the most beautiful  
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, thick like Luke dancers  
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at  
The little one, pullin over in the Land Rover  
Playin' Big Willie style with a chauffeur, yaknahmean?  
Stack the green, read all between the lines  
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find  
  
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop  
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa  
Gotcha, open off the words I say because  
"This type of shit it happens everyday"  
  
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop  
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa  
Gotcha, open off the words I say because  
"This type of shit it happens everyday"  
  
(How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals  
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals  
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies  
Beatin' down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses  
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it  
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin' ya bastards  
Big Poppa never softenin'  
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin'  
Leave the fucker coughin' up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears  
Covered the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears  
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches  
She whippin' my ride, countin' my one's, thinkin' I'm richest  
Just the way players play, all day everyday  
I don't know what else to say  
I've been robbin' niggas since Run and them was singin' "Here We Go"  
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didn't know my flow,  
Detrimental to your health  
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun  
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10  
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin'  
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half  
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths  
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly  
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?  
  
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop  
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa  
Gotcha, open off the words I say because  
"This type of shit it happens everyday"  
  
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop  
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa  
Gotcha, open off the words I say because  
"This type of shit it happens everyday"  
  
I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs  
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs  
Nines in the stores, glocks in the bags  
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs  
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical  
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals  
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals  
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals  
I kick the reali' with my peeps all day  
325's roll by with the windows down halfway  
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy  
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin'' nigga Biggie  
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme  
'Cause they all in line screamin' one more time  
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop  
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up

Nineteen seventy somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date  
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape  
Out the skins in this world of fly girls  
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl  
Ten months in this gut what the fuck  
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck  
wild juvenile rippin' mics and shit  
New York New York ready for the likes of this uh  
Then came the worst date May 21st  
2:19, that's when my momma water burst  
No spouse in the house so she rode for self  
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help  
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck  
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step  
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy  
The doctor looked and said, "He's gonna be a Bad Boy"  
  
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream  
On the drug scene, fuck a football team  
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen  
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean  
I want to blow up, stack my dough up  
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up  
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself  
before I wreck myself, disrespect myself  
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it  
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it  
Rap was secondary, money was necessary  
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary  
C74-Mark 8 set me straight  
Not able to move behind the great steel gate  
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?  
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail  
  
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons  
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'  
Honey's is tantalizin', they freak all night  
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night  
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed  
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game  
And to my niggas livin' street life  
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest  
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'  
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'  
If I'm pimpin on The F with weed on my breath  
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec  
Respect to the Mac's and the Ac's  
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

[Chorus]  
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead  
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight  
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight  
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try  
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die  
  
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw up  
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up  
Choppin' rocks overnight  
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' ta turn into the black Frank White  
We had to grow dreads to change our description  
Two cops on the milk box missin'  
Show they toes you know they got stepped on  
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon  
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat  
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack  
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me  
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze  
Celebrate, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight  
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And still I'm havin' memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed  
As I laugh pushin' the gas when my glocks blast  
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart  
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts  
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes  
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches  
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me  
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me  
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do  
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'  
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me  
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state  
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate  
Ma main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped  
He screamed, "Thug Life" and emptied a clip  
Gots tired of runnin' from the police  
  
[Chorus]

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes  
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop  
Oops!  
I'm interrupted by a doorbell  
  
3:52, who the hell  
Is this?  
I gets up quick  
Cocks my shit  
  
Stop the dogs from barkin  
Then proceed to walkin  
Its a face that I seen before  
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor  
  
Check it  
I look deeper  
I see blood up on his sneakers  
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth  
  
So I dip  
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?  
He tells me see-Rock just got hit up at the beacon  
I opens up the door, pitiful  
  
Is he in critical?  
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal  
'Cause I'm a criminal  
Way before the rap shit  
  
Bust the gat shit  
Puff won't even know what happened,  
If it's done smoothly  
Silencers on the Uzi  
  
Stash in the hooptie  
My alibi, any cutie  
With a booty that don't fuck the Pop  
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man see-Rock  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Somebody's gotta die  
If I got, you gotta go  
Somebody's gotta die  
Let the gunshots blow  
Somebody's gotta die  
Nobody gotta know  
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid  
  
Fillin' clips he explained our situation  
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin  
Some kid named Jason  
In a highway station, raggin  
  
Was braggin  
About how much loot and crack he stackin  
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique  
Small crew  
  
'Round the time I was locked up with you  
True indeed  
But yo nigga let me proceed  
Don't fill them clips too high  
  
Give them bullets room to breathe  
Damn where was I?  
Yeah  
One night in town  
  
Blew the fuck up  
D-Rock went home  
And Jay got stuck the fuck up  
Hit 'em twice  
  
Got 'em right for the virgin white  
Pistol whipped his kids  
And taped up his wife  
He said "Yo Rock, set em up", no question  
  
Wet em up no less  
Than 50 shots in his direction  
How many shots?  
Man nigga, I seen mad holes  
  
What kinda gats?  
Hitch links, Cocks, and Calicoles  
But fuck that  
I know where all them niggas rest at  
  
In the buildin hustlin  
And they don't be strapped  
Supreme in black  
Is downstairs, the engine runnin  
  
Find a bag to put the guns in  
And see'mon if yo comin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down  
How its gonna go down  
Lay these niggas low-down  
Slow down  
  
Fuck all that plannin shit  
Run up in they cribs  
And make em catch the man n shit  
See niggas like you do ten year bids  
  
Miss the niggas they want  
And murder innocent kids  
Not I  
One niggas in my eye  
  
That's Jason  
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted  
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips  
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips  
  
Pass the chocolate  
Thai  
Sing ain't lie  
There's Jason with his back to me  
  
Talkin to his faculty  
I start to get a funny feelins  
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin  
Scream his name out  
  
Squeeze six knuckles shorter  
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter

I used to get feels on a bitch  
Now I throw shields on the dick  
To stop me from that HIV shit  
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling  
Playin the villian  
Prepare for this rap killin  
Biggie Smalls is the illest  
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered  
"What you talkin bout Willis?"  
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White  
is here to excite and  
throw dick to dykes  
Bitches I like em brainless  
Guns I like em stainless steel  
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel  
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty  
Don't tempt me [T-H-O-D Man]  
You don't want to fuck with Biggie  
  
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit  
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit  
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja  
Comin where you rest at, surrender  
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender  
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December  
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and  
From Method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin  
Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin  
Actin as if it can't happen  
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin  
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin  
So what cha want nigga, ya punk nigga  
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger  
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw  
Kickin down your god damn door [and it goes a lil somethin like this]  
  
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop  
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on  
  
Verse two, comin with that Olde E brew  
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.  
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew  
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh  
No question, I be comin down and shit  
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get  
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental  
I spark and they cells get warm  
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!  
Baby accept it, utmost respect it  
[Assume the position] Stop look and listen  
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens  
  
Welcome to my center  
Honies feel it deep in they placenta  
Cold as the pole in the winter  
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed  
And when my Mac unloads  
I'm guaranteed another video  
Ready to die, why I act that way?  
Pop Duke left Mom Duke  
The faggot took the back way  
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up  
I used to do stick-up  
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS  
Excuse me, flows just grow through me  
Like trees to branches  
Cliffs to avalanches  
It's the praying mantis  
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan  
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus  
  
[I got more glocks and techs than you]  
I make it hot [Nigga won't even stand next to you]  
Nigga touch me you better bust me  
tree times in the head  
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so  
  
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop  
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on  
  
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop  
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on

Hold up, shut this shit down  
It's goin' down baby, Funk Flex  
We about to black out to fuckin' Brooklyn, with my nigga Mister Cee  
cause you know how the fuck I get down!  
Big dog, pitbull status nigga!  
  
Yeah  
You're now enterin' the mode of the notorious Biggie Smalls  
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, representin'  
This one goin' out to Brooklyn, why all know what time it is  
It's goin' out to all the gangsters  
All the pimps and players, hoes and bitches  
why all know what time it is.. so this what I want why all to do  
I want why all to grab why all Dutch Masters  
and why all White Owls and why all Phillies, mmm!  
Get you a fat sack, a pint of Hennessey and lay back  
Gon' do this one for my man Mister Cee, representin' all day, everyday  
And all you other tape niggaz, and bootleggers, stay in the house  
Cause Brooklyn got this shit locked down  
So any time you're ready Mister Cee  
we gon' get hardcore on these homos  
  
Like I said before, Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, hardcore  
Uh, representin'  
Biggie Smalls in the house  
Uh, check it, huh  
  
Biggie Smalls is the wickedest  
Niggas say I'm pussy? I dare you to stick your dick in this  
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphillis  
Herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, gettin' rid of ya  
Got it locked like the penitentiary  
Niggas mention me for M.C. execution, who you choosin?  
The wack MC? Or the black fat MC?  
Jack Dempsey would start shakin'  
All it's takin, is some marijuana and I'm makin'  
MC's break fast like flapjacks and bacon  
Backspins to windmill, who's still the gin drinker  
Ill thinker - explodin when the paper hits the ink, uh  
Take your gangsta chronicles

Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves  
Gazelle shades, and corn braids  
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies  
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly  
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews  
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues  
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three  
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me  
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick  
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit  
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project  
Hallways, shootin dice all day  
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit  
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit  
So step away with your fist fight ways  
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though  
  
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three  
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery  
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it  
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it  
And I'm down with the shit too  
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu  
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin  
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin  
When you sleep on the street  
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep  
And we comin to the wake  
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake  
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us  
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us  
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain  
Damn, shit done changed  
  
If I wasn't in the rap game  
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game  
Because the streets is a short stop  
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot  
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums  
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from  
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major  
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers  
Goin outta town, blowin up  
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up  
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie  
But I gotta go identify the body  
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?  
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out  
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast  
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Don't you know, I'm the ultimate?  
To get this milk, you be fortunate  
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it  
People stop, when I'm walking in  
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten  
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again  
My steez is immaculate  
My paper stacking, keep tracking  
I'm macing, y'all slacking, reaction  
Make y'all dicks scream  
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures  
More bigger then Jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons  
Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke  
Thrillons, me won't give you none  
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me  
The ultimate rush, get high, baby  
Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke  
Three lines, me won't give you none  
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love  
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business  
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time  
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime  
What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around  
And stay around and get mad when I play around  
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse  
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt  
Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me  
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say  
Me and my friends, got your Benz  
Attracting mens, and spending dividence, blowing like the wind  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
So I guess, you think I'm slipping, 'cause I ain't flipping  
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping  
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping  
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?  
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme  
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine  
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar  
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall  
All I do all day is drink Tanguray  
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face  
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets  
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek  
Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?  
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?  
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers  
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger  
You'd better slow your role, baby  
You ain't got enough dough to pay me  
You know the pen number, just page me  
When you're real, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one  
Representing BK to the fullest  
Gats I pull it, bastards ducking when Big be bucking  
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking  
It ain't nothing, they know Big be handling  
With the mac in the Ac' door paneling  
Damagin MC's, oxygen they can't breathe  
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe  
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high  
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches  
Get smoked like dutches from the master  
Hate to blast you, but I have to, you see I smoke a lot  
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fucking polka dots  
Who rock the spot? Biggie  
You know how the weed go, unbelievable  
  
B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G  
Get it? Biggie  
Also known as the bon appetit  
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping  
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating  
Dumb rappers need teaching  
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that  
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now  
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted  
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways  
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day  
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway  
My forte causes Caucasians to say  
He sounds demented, car weed scented  
If I said it, I meant it  
Bite my tongue for no-one  
Call me evil, or unbelievable  
  
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes  
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?  
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear  
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me  
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream  
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut  
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill  
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer  
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver  
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi  
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC  
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil -- for you are with me  
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me  
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies  
You annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows  
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
  
Niggaz in my faction don't like askin questions  
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin  
Givin pleasure in the Benz-ito  
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's  
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats  
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets  
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease  
MWA, may you rest in peace  
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours  
Four-four, and fifty-four draw  
as my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear  
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear  
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin  
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin  
So don't you get suspicious  
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious  
As I leave my competition, respirator style  
Climb the ladder to success escalator style  
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death  
controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh  
I spit phrases that'll thrill you  
You're nobody til somebody kills you  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
Uhh, uhh  
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino  
Ask Nino, he know  
Green with envy, the green tempts me  
to make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese  
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty  
live happily, ever after in laughter  
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster  
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead  
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do  
but tear they ass to shreds, leave em in bloodshed  
Incidents like this I take trips  
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)  
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour  
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore  
Told me meet em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin  
buy me lavender and fuschia Gators  
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters  
Rich bitch shit, drinkin Cristal  
til they piss the shit, uhh  
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches  
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me  
Reminesce on dead friends too  
You're nobody til somebody kills you  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
Uhh, uhh  
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)  
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit  
You ain't worth spit, just a memory  
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range (I remember that)  
Silly cat, all suede in the rain  
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame  
before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane  
I can't recall his name (what was his name?) you mean that kid  
that nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?  
Gettin his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine  
A fuckin shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?  
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)  
You're nobody, til somebody, kills you  
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
