I grew up in a typical way  
So I keep trying to unwind  
Cause I'm agitated  
  
In this place so full of hate  
I keep trying to unwind  
You might think it's pretty obvious  
So tell me what I say, hey!  
I way born in a typical way  
So I keep trying to go back  
And I'm agitated  
  
In this world so full of pain  
I keep trying to go back  
You might think its pretty infantile  
So tell me what I know, hey!  
Day and night forever trading places  
Good and evil sleeping side by side  
In this world full of plenty of stuff  
You'd think there'd be enough love to go around, hey!  
I was picked in a random way  
To be a singing dancing fool  
And I'm agitated  
  
In this place going less than great  
I', just a singing dancing fool  
If you don't like what I keep talking about  
Then tell me what I say, hey!  
I'm agitated  
  
If you think you got it all worked out  
Then tell me what to know, ho!  
I'm agitated  
  
Tell me what I say  
Do the mashed potatoes  
Tell me what I say  
I'm feeling amputated  
Educated  
I'm agitated

I left home with a friend of mine  
Gone two years and I don't know why  
Now I'm happy all the time  
I can't think and I'm feelin' fine  
I got feelings but they don't show  
Don't ask me cause I don't know  
No no no no no  
All of you  
Think you've heard this all before  
Now your're gonna hear some more  
I know a place where dreams are crushed  
Hopes are smashed but that ain't much  
All you stupids anyway  
We're all gonna die some day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
All of us  
Me leave home with booji boy  
Teeth fall out of china doll  
Poo poo man got jiffy-snipped  
Bad girl launching - floppy tits  
Listen listen me no lie  
We like stuff what makes us cry  
Why why why why!!!!?  
All of us

Then come along with me  
Hold hands and watch the sunrise

But mutated

The first time I saw you  
I knew there would be no other  
That tingle told me  
We were meant for one another  
I'm calling you  
1-2-3  
Buttered beauties of the negroid north  
Spread your glossy tallow on me  
Oiled wonder of the midnight forest  
Toss down your web on me  
She's got me by the tether  
(sticking it out)  
In simultated leather  
(sticking it out)  
I think she broke my tether  
See'mon keep on comin' on now

Popeye's big punch knocks pluto cold  
Cartoon people don't go old  
Yosemite sam blows up his head  
But you and me wind up dead  
Dreamed I laid a toaster  
Daddy caught me in the act  
Can you take it?  
Beauty queens get bigger all the time  
Mamma is in a basket, crossed a double  
Yellow line  
Magazines and t.v. show us nice behinds  
All the kind of stuff nobody ever finds  
Headlines in the paper "killed by rock n' roll"  
Can you take it?

I gotta run away from dr surd.  
He's always on my tail.  
He's comin' so I better run  
'cause he would know I never fail.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.  
  
Surd won't leave me all by myself.  
He gives me such a fright.  
If I was followin' that surd,  
I'd do it like he did the other night.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.  
  
We didn't meet until half past four.  
I couldn't stand it anymore.  
I did get it.  
I did understand.  
Who was the bitch  
Holding his assistant's hand?  
I gotta run away from dr surd.  
(dr surd.)  
He's always on my tail.  
He's comin' so I better run  
(better run.)  
'cause he would know I never fail.  
  
(chorus)  
Oh my hell.  
It's dr surd.  
He thinks he is a big man.  
Let me tell you something, surd.  
Just catch me if you can.

Chango!  
Chango!  
The bear (? )  
I come up the river  
Like beat man  
I come up the river  
Like skoke man fly  
I come up the river  
To kill many people  
I come up the river  
With laser gun  
Dear uncle, dear uncle, dear uncle  
Dear uncle, dear uncle  
Your son just had intercourse  
With baggy breast  
Your son just had intercourse  
With death debbie  
My mommy didn't hold me when I was young  
She didn't give me breast  
And went insane  
My mommy didn't hold me when I was young  
She didn't give me breast  
And went insane  

All right, clockout!  
I got my coat  
I got my keys  
I got my head down to my lungs  
And move my feet  
Me, I got all the secretaries  
Down on their knees  
Look at 'em scoot  
They gonna clockout  
I got my money  
Tied up in stock  
I got my mammy  
Take my doggie for a walk  
Me, I got the biggest little business  
Down on the block  
Get ready, get set  
Cause we gonna clockout  
Down on all fours  
Cause we gonna, we gonna  
We gonna, we gonna clockout  
Take my advice  
Hear my decree  
I'm afraid the future's gonna be  
Maintenance free  
I got the big brush for your bowl  
Baby, can't you dig my plea  
Gonna gag  
Unless we clockout  
No, no, no

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
When nothing's funny it gets easy to laugh  
At the drop of the hat or a bomb  
When someone's screaming it's hard to ignore  
Like the shot of a gun, c'mon  
Let's run to a place somewhere  
The party never ends  
Let's run till there's no way  
To go on, c'mon  
Can't you hear the sirens blowing  
Can't you hear them call  
Can't you see the lasers probing  
Brighter than the sun, let's run  
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Let's run from a promise  
That could never be kept  
Let's run or it's sure to chase us down  
Well c'mon, let's run  
c'mon, let's run  
C'mon, let's run  
Can't you hear the sirens blowing  
Can't you hear them call  
Can't you see those lasers probing  
Brighter than the sun, well c'mon  
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
When no one's laughing you can bet they've been paid  
Not to find out what's going on  
When something's funny there's a feeling you get  
It's the grip of a threat, c'mon  
Let's run to a place somewhere  
The party never ends  
Let's run till there's no way  
To go on, c'mon  
Let's run from a promise  
That could never be kept  
Let's run or it's sure to chase us down  
Well c'mon, let's run  
c'mon, let's run  
C'mon, let's run  
C'mon, well let's run  

I, I owe owe you  
Absolutely nothing  
I, I know know you  
Positively disagree  
I've heard it said that all is fair  
In love and war so what's life for  
You watch it go out the window  
Stop and go back for more  
More!  
  
Go, go fight fight, punch  
Your way to happiness  
Go, go light light, or  
You'll never be a big success  
  
I heard it said that all is fair  
In love and war so what's life for  
The boy and girl  
Two separate worlds

Your way to happiness

Got a surprise from my honey  
Got a message from my girl  
When she picked up her pen from beside her bed  
And wrote me a scribbled note  
Said she'd be comin' back to see me  
She would be visiting real soon  
Gonna get up from her lone white bed  
And leave this cold white room  
  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooooh  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooooh  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooh  
  
We would once more live together  
Go out on a lovin' spree  
Just like before the accident  
My baby would look at me  
I saw her sweet face tremblin'  
As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful little boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise  
  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooooh  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooooh  
wah-oooo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-ooh  
  
Got a surprise from my honey

You know I can be found sitting home all alone  
If you can't come around at least please telephone  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well baby, if I made you mad something that I might have said  
Please just forget the past the future looks bright ahead  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't want no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Ah let's go to a preacher and let us say I do  
Then you'll know you have me and I'll know I got you  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't need no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Well I don't want no other lover  
Baby it's just you I'm dreaming of  

Don't rescue me  
I don't want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me  
You make me move  
Where I never been  
Lost in orbit  
All over you  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
Don't bring me back  
I beg to differ in fact  
You can question why  
But what good is that  
Don't rescue me I won't go back no I  
Don't rescue me  
I don't want to be  
Let you and me be  
Out of control  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me  
Just because I can't sleep at night  
Just because I hear your voice  
Just because I see your face  
Just because I want you  
You, you're the one  
Turn me inside out  
You, you're the one  
Make me scream and shout  
You, you're the one  
De-railroaded me  
You, you're the one  
Don't rescue me  

Every move I make  
Every rule I break  
Makes me want it more  
Every step I take  
Every new mistake  
Each revolving door  
Keeps me searching for you  
There's nowhere for you to hide  
'Cause a feelin's got me reelin'  
And I'm twisted up inside  
  
Don't you know I got a thing that looks for you  
Don't you know the way you make me feel about you  
Don't you know I got a place that waits for you  
Don't you know that I'm always thinking of you  
  
I got a rocket in my pocket  
But I don't know what to do  
Like a plug without a socket  
I'm just waitin' 'round for you  
  
Don't you know I got a thing for you  
Don't you know the way you make me feel about you  
Don't you know I got a thing that looks for you  
Don't you know that I'm always thinking of you  
  
I got a rocket in my pocket  
I don't know what to do  
Like a plug without a socket  
I'm just waitin' 'round for you

Don't you stop  
Don't you wonder why  
Life itself pops in  
And takes you by surprise  
  
Don't you try to run  
It gets you from behind  
Like a common cold  
It takes you for a ride  
  
Now is the time  
To call me doctor  
This is a serious case  
There's not much time  
Now call me doctor  
They love to watch him operate  
It comes and goes  
So call me doctor  
They need a special technique  
It grows and grows  
Now call me doctor  
Calling doctor, doctor Detroit  
  
Call me doctor (Call me doctor)  
No need to look  
He's not in the book  
The doctor's not an M.D.  
What he does this time he does for free  
  
Now is the time  
To call me doctor  
This is a serious case  
There's not much time  
Now call me doctor  
They love to watch him operate  
It comes and goes  
So call me doctor  
They need a special technique  
It grows and grows  
Now call me doctor  
Calling doctor, doctor Detroit

None of you would help me when i baked by bread  
Now all of you would help me eat it  
I can see that you are very well fed  
This indicates that you don't need it  
Enough said  
  
Stop and let me tell you what tomorrow holds for you  
Stop and let me tell you 'bout a plan i have for you  
  
Take all the leaders from around the world  
Put them together in a great big ring  
Televise it as the lowest show on earth  
And let them fight like hell to see who's king  
Gather up the pieces when the fight is done  
Then you'll find out living really can be fun  
  
You wanted a world you could figure out  
But something happened while you were asleep  
You wanted a good life you could brag about  
Too bad they took the parts you wanted to keep

We like explosions that leave you feeling good  
We like ideas that change the world for good  
  
There's nothing past the stop 'n' go  
There's nothing but the ebb and flow  
There's nothing like some in and out  
There's nothing more than what you know  
  
We like new places that jets can't take you to  
We do like music when it does what it should do  
  
Yes oh yeah  
Yes oh yeah  
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)  
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)  
  
We like explosions it's only right we should  
We like ideas we thought you understood  
We like new places until they're overrun  
We do like music, loud shots from the big spudgun

There it was  
Just like old faithful  
The eternal fountain of filthi  
I took a walk straight out of town  
But then I stopped and took my time for pleasure  
I was alone, I looked around  
I heard a voice 50 I buckled for safety  
And there it was down on the ground  
A pool of sound that showed my own reflection  
In a fountain of filth  
Eternal fountain of filth  
I tried to run I couldn't move  
Frozen solid while the thoughts of men  
Attacked me  
Out of my head the fountain shot  
And drowned me in a serum that I couldn't  
Put a stop to  
It was me myself and I locked in a struggle  
With the talking head below me  
In a fountain of filth  
Eternal fountain of filth  
I got a hunger that makes me say things  
I got a hunger that makes me do things  
I got a hunger that makes me want things  
I'm just a victim of filth  
Nowhere are we safe  
From the power of  
From the reach of  
From the appeal of  
The eternal fountain of filth  

Well my fraulein done told me  
When I was in goosesteps.  
She said I would gas them  
And now I'm a big man  
Filling up autos  
That beep at me often  
I drop what I'm doing  
And wait on them cheerfullv  
Some choose the big pump  
And other's the small  
It's a small small world  
And I hear 'dem autos call  
Well I'm a big time pumper  
And I pump'em full of my gas  
And if you give me static  
I'll tell ya blow it up your ass  
My station is pretty  
I keep it in top shape  
The customers dig me  
'cause I got the answers  
To all of their auto needs  
I fix 'em up often  
And relieve their tension  
'cause no one wants an auto  
That threatens to lose it  
The auto's come crawlin'  
Into my station  
They beep at me always  
I stop what I'm doing  
And greet them with smiles  
I call "fill 'er up?"  
They yell back "one dollar"  
I wipe all the dead bugs  
And dirt off their windshield  
And connect my big hose  
Up to their gas tank  
The gas hums as it enters  
And fulls up their empty tank  
I do two at a time now  
I've developed a technique  
My timing is very good  
If not always precise  
I give them a fair deal  
They drive off satisfied  
We need each other's business  
Without which we could not survive  
We like to trade money-  
Because it means honor,  
Not like those people  
Who are sick and can't touch it  
Because they're unhealthy,  
They leave me cold.  
I help who I can help  
And feel nothing for those who  
Don't come to my station  
For I'll only tow those who  
Show me their honor  
I can't help evervbody  
And I'm not my brother's keeper  
We huddle together  
And those who come to me  
We huddle together  
And despite the weather  
We find strength in our circle  
I'm very important  
To the big and the little guy  
We all need each other  
To keep ourselves going  
Their auto's all need me  
My pump's need their empty tanks and  
If the good lord is willing  
We shall be here to the end  
Pumping-each-other

A victim of collision on the open sea  
Nobody ever said that life was free  
Sank, swam, go down with the ship  
But use your freedom of choice  
  
I'll say it again in the land of the free  
Use your freedom of choice  
Your freedom of choice  
  
In ancient Rome  
There was a poem  
About a dog  
Who found two bones  
He picked at one  
He licked the other  
He went in circles  
He dropped dead  
  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom of choice!  
  
Then if you got it you don't want it  
Seems to be the rule of thumb  
Don't be tricked by what you see  
You got two ways to go  
  
I'll say it again in the land of the free  
Use your freedom of choice  
Freedom of choice  
  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom of choice  
  
In ancient Rome  
There was a poem  
About a dog  
Who found two bones  
He picked at one  
He licked the other  
He went in circles  
He dropped dead  
  
[Repeats]  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom from choice  
Is what you want

She sings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
It drips on down in a mist from above  
  
[Chorus]  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
  
You hear her calling everywhere you turn  
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn  
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue  
She's the real thing but you knew it all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at you with your mouth watering  
Look at you with your mind spinnin'  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just the girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She sings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
It drips on down in a mist from above  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at you with your mouth watering  
Look at you with your mind spinnin'  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just the girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl  
The girl you want  
She's just the girl, she's just the girl

I'm wound tight  
Hot-wired  
About to explode  
  
I'm seein' red  
All hopped up  
And ready to go  
  
I'm hurtin' and I'm searchin' for a place  
Where I can deliver  
  
I want to scoot so fast that my head snaps  
Back together  
It's OK, not OK, it's OK, not OK, it's ok  
It's OK, not OK, it's OK, not OK, it's ok  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
Go Monkey go  
MoJo JoJo  
  
Tell me tell me where to go  
Tell me tell me where to go  
  
There's nothing I can do  
To fix what's wrong with me!

Left home with a friend of mine  
Gone two years and I don't know why  
Now I'm happy all the time  
I can't think and I'm feelin' fine  
Girl put me in a situation  
  
Going through soft core mutation  
Think you heard this all before  
Now you're gonna hear some more  
I know a place where dreams get crushed  
Hopes are smashed but that ain't much  
Voluntary experimentation  
Going through soft core mutation  
I'm going under  
  
Down under where the lights are low  
To a place where all the mutants go  
Doing things I never did before  
Inside out and coming back for more  
Little girls with the four red lips  
Never knew it could be like this  
You put me in a situation  
Goin' through soft core mutation

Golden energy  
For the guy or gal  
Whose had a hard hard day  
Golden energy  
To help you meet the demands  
Of an energetic mate  
Or a red hot date  
Golden energy dripping down on you  
Golden energy  
Natural aphrodisiac  
Golden energy  
Working hard to keep you on full  
Pumping iron all the way  
Keeps you from being too  
Too tired  
  
Rootin bootin sure fired  
Golden energy meets all requirements  
Posts no bills  
Poots no guff  
Needs no prescriptions  
Golden energy handle if you care  
If you dare  
Help yourself to another share

Itchy, itchy goo  
Got me thinking of you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo  
Oh, baby, i love you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo  
It's all i want to do, whammo  
Itchy, itchy goo  
There's a pile next to you  
Itchy goo, itchy goo  
And it's turnin blue  
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo  
It's all i want to do, whammo  
You got me running in circles  
Like a pee-pee baby  
I'm so happy i just want to die  
Cause this baby love  
It comes from up above  
Move on over  
I want to get closer  
Move on over  
want to twaddle with you  
Move on over  
Satisfy my urges  
Please, please help  
I got the goo, goo itch  
You got me running in circles  
Like a big-big baby

So young so strong  
Ignorance is bliss  
Thin skin caught up again  
In a place like this  
  
Big people set the trap for you  
Using you-know-what for brains  
You're just another lab experiment  
And you're easy to replace  
  
Too much too soon  
Sensors overload  
Brought down, chased out of town  
Another dangerous road  
  
Simply a problem of biology  
It's a choice you never make  
The scene is set and you're subjected to  
A lethal dose of growing pains  
  
Think it through  
Logic must be made for fools  
Leave them now  
And be a has-been who never was  
They'll set you up with pains that grow

If you smell the smoke  
You don't need to be told  
What you got to do  
Yet there's a certain breed  
So very in between  
They'd rather take a vote  
Running short on time  
Still they can't decide  
But we already know  
That we are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
What is really mine  
Who's at the top of the pile  
Where does he draw the line  
Let them figure it out  
Go on and step across  
Just remind yourself  
That we are here to go  
When it grows too long  
The tail wags the dog  
The hand that bites gets fed  
Troubled multiply  
The crowd begins to cry  
For some common sense  
Let them all dig in  
When the odds are no win  
Head for the nearest door  
'cause we are here to go  
Go!  

Well, I'm a huboon baby  
I'm a cross between a human and an ape  
I'm all decked out  
I'm gonna hoot, I'm gonna root, I'm gonna rape  
  
People look at me and laugh and make fun of my face  
I laugh right back  
I don't want to be part of the human race  
I did it to myself  
Now somebody's gonna be sorry  
  
Well, I'm a huboon baby  
Gonna mess around with all you fools  
I'm all pumped up, gonna romp, bone and stomp  
I'm gonna rule  
  
I had the operation  
Nothing else left to do  
Well lookit here, I've been hurt  
Gonna hurt you  
  
Now, somebody's gonna be sorry  
Like all you wankers and you slime  
And you right-wing pinheads  
Who make screwing a big crime  
You titty-twisted up my life  
And pissed on all my dreams  
You made me hate myself  
Now come on shoot me  
Set me free  
  
I did it to myself  
Now somebody's gonna be sorry  
  
Well, I'm a huboon baby  
I'll grow up to be the president  
I'm upside-in, I'm really tweaked  
I'm really freaked, I'm really bent  
Big town mommas better hurry  
Hide your little girls  
I'll jump their bones  
I'll sniff 'em out 'round the world

Sittin' after supper  
Watched the f.b.i.  
Asked for the cigarette  
I got no reply  
Then you dropped your culottes  
Revealing rubber underpants  
Sweat was forming in my shoes  
But you ended our romance  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes  
Last Monday morning  
Minus 20 degrees  
Walked to unemployment  
On my knees  
Dogs in the ocean  
Figs in the sea well come on baby  
And wakka-wakka-wakka with me  
Bought a kodak brownie  
Developed film at home  
Took some shots of sister  
Pants were full of loam  
Took a couple back views  
Took some up front  
Three tries wallet size  
I was lookin' at that cunt  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes.

I desire I desire  
I pledge allegiance to the thought  
That your love is all that matters  
And your gestures have the power  
To bring the whole world to its knees  
  
Don't let me torment you  
Don't let me bring you down  
Don't ever let me hurt you  
Don't let me fail because  
  
I desire your attention  
I desire your perfect love  
I desire nothing more (than this)  
  
To give you happiness  
Could become a lifetime goal  
A smile I might bring you  
Is more important than world peace  
  
I pledge allegiance to the fact  
That you're wise to walk away  
For nothing is more dangerous  
Than desire when it's wrong

I need a chick to suck my dick  
I need a dog to lick my hog  
I need a cat to stroke my bat  
I'm pukin and shitin' and dyin' of thirst  
I ain't got no field to plow  
There's no hole for my pole  
I'd fuck a mink stole  
I need a woman who understands  
There's nothing more spiritual  
Than dog style love  
And when i find her  
I'm going to get down on my knees  
I'm going to eat her  
'Cause she's the moon

Hell is where you put me  
And hell is where you're going to  
Until the next life  
I say this twisted prayer for you  
May the torment you put out  
Come back around twice multiplied.  
Even though you let me go  
I've got to let you know  
I'd cry if you died.  
  
The past is where you see me  
The past is what will bring you down  
Destiny a moon eclipsed  
In the shadows all is darkness now  
May the evil in your heart  
Be your one and only friend for life  
You pretend I don't exist  
I have to let you know  
I'd cry if you died  
Somewhere special  
Voices form words  
  
And the words have meaning  
So I reach out for someone new  
And I wonder  
  
Will it ever be alright  
(then I hear you secret radio  
Signaling that its time to go)  
Hell is where you put me  
And hell is where well meet again  
I will be waiting  
  
To repeat a scene that never ends  
Molten pools of mockery  
Reflect a million sleepless nights  
Even though you acted low  
I've got to let you know  
I'd cry if you died

Listen comrade, I don't care  
How long you want to grow your hair  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Tell ya lady have you heard the news  
You can burn your wig and burn your shoes  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
'Cause there's something bigger than meets the eye  
Something important and it's waiting for you  
  
Oh, Yeah!  
Woah, Yeah!  
Knock it off, pal  
I heard this story before  
  
Tell me something new  
That's what I came here for  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
'Cause there's a train pulling into the station  
  
And it's headed for a new destination  
And I tell you my friend  
You better count me in  
Listen comrade, I don't care  
  
If you ever change your underwear  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Oh, No  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Uh-Huh  
  
Well, Ahhh  
Yeah, Ahhh

Baby, baby, baby hurt me bad  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby made me cry  
Baby, I want to die  
  
Somebody tell me where she's hiding out  
I gotta find that cheatin' gal  
Can't go, can't go, can't go sleep at night  
Can't sleep, can't sleep  
It's not right  
  
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight, makes me rise  
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo  
  
Baby, baby, baby please come back  
Baby, baby  
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight, makes me rise  
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you  
All the time  
  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
It's so unfair that you're so happy when I'm hurtin' inside  
  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo

I know I let you tell me what to do  
You were confident you know best  
Now things aren't working like you want them to  
Your confidence is what I detest  
You got me lookin' up high  
You got me searchin' down low  
You got me I know you know  
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth  
You told me people like to suffer  
You told me that's the way it is  
You said that things were getting better  
You said I should expect all this  
You think it's funny  
But what I say is true  
The reason that I live like this  
Is all because of you  
There is a thought that keeps me thinking  
Like a stone inside my shoe  
It is a vision reoccurring  
A dirty window I can see you through

They tell us that  
We lost our tails  
Evolving up  
From little snails  
I say it's all  
Just wind in sails  
  
Are we not men  
We are Devo  
Are we not men  
D-E-V-O  
Are we not pins  
We are Devo  
  
Monkey men all  
In business suits  
Teacher and critics  
All dance the poot  
  
Are we not men  
We are Devo  
Are we not men  
D-E-V-O  
Are we not pins  
We are Devo  
  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
  
Okay lets go

Someone said that  
No one knows what  
Goes on inside  
Someone in love  
Strange as it seems  
It makes them do things  
In their right minds  
Would never think of  
People get away with things  
They don't deserve  
A jurisdiction of love  
Enoughs not enough  
When love gets rough  
The jurisdiction of love  
Off their walls  
Just like Niagara Falls  
Logical thought  
Is no comfort  
It only makes the  
Matter seem worse  
Might equals right  
In connubial fight  
The jurisdiction of love  
Love equals war  
I don't like it no more  
The jurisdiction of love  
Someone said that  
No one knows what  
Goes on inside  
Someone in love  
People get away with things  
They don't deserve  
A jurisdiction of love  
When love turns the crank  
It demands Carte Blanche  
The jurisdiction of love  
Might equals right  
In connubial fight  
The jurisdiction of love  
Love equals war  
I don't like it no more  
The jurisdiction of love  

I saw you coming  
I called your name  
You couldn't hear me  
You walked on by  
  
Something's changed  
Everything's rearranged  
You didn't see me  
You didn't answer  
  
I was invisible to your cause  
I tried to tell you  
I was your friend  
You just kept walking  
Like it was the end  
  
Let's talk  
Tell me all about it  
Let's talk  
What could it hurt now?  
Let's talk  
Won't you tell me what is wrong, yeah?  
Let's talk  
We can work it out, somehow  
  
I saw you coming  
You wore a wig  
I wanted to laugh  
But you looked so serious  
  
I say let's talk  
And you just walk  
  
How was I  
To approach you?  
You really left no room  
  
Run out in the crowd  
If you really want to,  
But why not try  
For something new?

Love without anger  
He picked up the phone and took the call  
A long distance voice just started to bawl  
I don't care if you feel small  
  
Love without anger isn't love at all  
Why can't you have your cake and eat it too  
Why believe in things that make it tough on you  
Why scream and cry when you know it's through  
Why fall in love when there's better things to do  
Barbie and ken in a great big fight  
  
Seems ken forgot to make it home one night  
You know what you are seeing simply can't be right  
Looks like love's bark is worse than its bite  
  
He was young and in love  
So he just couldn't see  
And it compelled him to ask  
Are you kidding me?  
You must be kidding me!  
  
Love without teardrops isn't the same  
He asked to be counted out of her game  
She thought it him who was so insane  
Love is what it does by any other name

If you ever had a clue  
You never acted like you knew  
When you took away the reasons  
And you chopped my heart in two  
Once you start to doubt  
  
When you don't know what it's about  
It's time to read the warning signs  
Of a man turned inside out  
For a guy needs a good reason  
Something to prod him on  
When you chopped me up like liver  
It all started going wrong  
So I bought a fiberglass helmet  
Some goggles to match  
  
I'm a human bullet baby  
And you haven't seen the last  
Of a man turned inside out  
I'm a man turned inside out  
So I got myself a position  
And I'm working my way up  
Took a three way lucky number  
Now I'm heading for the top

This is the boy who burns the books  
This is the way he always looks  
This is the boy who smashed his car  
This is the boy who went too far  
  
Washed his eyes with yellow soap  
He stole his daddy's microscope  
All alone or in a crowd  
Never say his name aloud  
  
Now he wants to know your unit's name  
Where you go and whence you came  
He's the mecha-mania boy  
This is the boy who never goes slow  
  
He is the one who destroys his young  
(Oh no everybody got a new way to go)  
All alone or on the telephone  
He knows the time you spend at home  
  
(Oh no never say I didn't tell you so)  
Washed his hands of his daddy's fate  
He put himself in an alternate state  
In a crowd or all alone  
  
No one's laughing anymore

I feel a hot wind on my shoulder  
And the touch of a world that is older  
I turn the switch and check the number  
I leave it on when in bed I slumber  
I hear the rhythms of the music  
I buy the product and never use it  
I hear the talking of the dj  
Can't understand just what does he say?  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
I dial it in and tune the station  
They talk about the you. S. Inflation  
I understand just a little  
No comprende, it's a riddle  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
I wish I was in Tijuana  
Eating barbequed iguana  
I'd take requests on the telephone  
I'm on a wavelength far from home  
I feel a hot wind on my shoulder  
I dial it in from south of the border  
I hear the talking of the dj  
Can't understand just what does he say?  
  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
I'm on a mexican radio  
  
Radio radio...  
What does he say?

Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
Happier than you and me  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
And it determined what he could see  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
One chromosome too many  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
And it determined what he could see  
  
And he wore a hat  
And he had a job  
And he brought home the bacon  
So that no one knew  
  
He was a mongoloid  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
His friends were unaware  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
Nobody even cared  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
One chromosome too many  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
And it determined what he could see  
  
And he wore a hat  
And he had a job  
And he brought home the bacon  
So that no one knew  
  
He was a mongoloid  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
Happier than you and me  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
And it determined what he could see  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
One chromosome too many  
  
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid  
And it determined what he could see  
  
And he wore a hat  
And he had a job  
And he brought home the bacon  
So that no one knew  
  
He was a mongoloid  
He was a mongoloid

Walk me out in the morning dew my friend  
Walk me out in the morning dew today  
Can't walk you out in the morning dew my friend  
Can't walk you out in the morning dew today  
  
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning  
I thought I heard a baby cry today  
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning  
You didn't hear no baby cry today  
  
Where have all the people gone this morning  
Where have all the people gone today  
You'll never find no people here this morning  
You didn't need those people anyway  
  
I thought I heard a young male call this morning  
I thought I heard a young male call today  
You didn't hear no young girl call this morning  
You didn't hear no young girl call today  
  
And now I can't walk you out in the morning dew my friend  
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Three cheers!  
They're yellin' again  
Three cheers!  
They'll be at it to the end  
  
So drink some big beers and go crazy tonight  
They're all dressed up and they'll be gettin' it tonight  
Big swingers in double knits tonight  
Big babies gonna get in a fight  
Actin' crazy, bustin' up the chairs  
Doubled over gettin' sick on the stairs  
  
They know the limits 'cause they cross them every night  
The dull sensations as it turns real hot  
Why, the guys in the back with their heads on the floor  
Surrounded by their buddies, they're all hollerin' for more  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
It's Mr. B's ballroom  
  
Party time, turn the music up loud  
Party time, lose your head in the crowd  
Yellin',, laughin' tryin' hard to act smart  
Put 'em under pressure and you watch them fall apart  
  
Freeze! Come on out of there  
Freeze! You ain't goin' nowhere  
Freeze! Put your hands on your head  
Freeze!  
It's Mr. B's ballroom  
  
[Repeats]  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
It's Mr. B's ballroom

Greetings beautiful mutants  
And how may we be of service?  
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated  
Checking in with the many factions  
  
Of devolutionary humans  
Who have waited so faithfully this past year  
While Devo gathered its strength  
For the next offensive  
  
As many of you can see  
The road ahead is filled with danger  
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear  
But the human mind itself  
  
Or lack of it on this planet  
It's time to go beyond the normal thing  
It's time to do the super thing  
It's time for Devo  
  
There is no question about it  
The spud boys are ready with  
New songs, new films and new approaches  
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans  
  
Lies, lies, lies  
That's all we get  
From those who pretend to know but don't  
But once again Devo attempts  
  
To cut through the mental grease and grime  
With techniques of positive mutation  
Designed to protect you  
From the ninnies and the twits  
  
Remember, no one knows  
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions  
That help point us all in the right direction  
To go forward, move ahead  
  
And give the past the slip  
It's time to seek out new traditions  
We know where the old one's took us  
And now we are all here together  
  
So let's go take in the full measure  
Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit  
The vinyl record and cassette tape  
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings  
  
Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'  
To purchase, it is not like spending money  
But rather, it is an investment in the future  
In a blow against the empire  
  
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated saying  
'Bombs away'

it was a day like this and my house burnt down  
and the walls were thin and they crashed to the ground  
it was a day like this and my life unwound  
you could've struck me a line and that's okay now  
we could always put it together again  
you could've told me a lie, and a lie so thin, so thin  
now everything's clear  
day after day and the life goes on  
and I try to see the good in everyone  
if I ever find myself here again  
I'll give everything

One dumb thing  
Is how it starts  
One dumb thing  
Is all it takes  
One dumb thing  
Leads to another  
One dumb thing  
Is how it started  
One dumb thing  
Is all he said  
One dumb thing  
Led to another  
Now it's over 'cause of  
One dumb thing  
A glance, a stance  
A broken romance  
A disconnected telephone  
What's behind it?  
How to define it?  
Makes the world go around  
and around  
and around  
One dumb thing  
Is how it started  
One dumb thing  
Is all she did  
One dumb thing  
Led to another  
One dumb thing  
Is the beginning  
One dumb thing  
It never ends  
One dumb thing  
Goes right on making  
More and more of  
One dumb thing

She's out of sync  
And everyone around her  
Knows that something is wrong  
She's out of sync  
She's got all the symptoms  
Of a girl who skipped a beat  
She's out of sync  
A piece of ancient history  
She's a walking mirage  
  
She's out of sync  
She entered through the exit  
And never stopped to think  
She's out of sync she's a half  
Step behind  
She's out of luck her body split from  
Her mind  
She's out of orbit she'll never connect  
She'll run out of time before she accepts  
She's out of sync  
  
She's out of sync (sync)  
She's out of sync (sync)  
She's out of sync  
  
Everybody senses  
There s a distance to keep  
She's out of sync  
And totally committed  
To living in a dark age  
She's out of sync  
Constantly undoing  
What's already been done  
She's out of sync  
Trapped in a silent movie  
And she's on the brink  
She's out of focus  
She's a warp in time  
She's discontinued  
A break in the line

Let me be a part of you  
Even for an hour or two  
Besides whatever else you do  
Let me be a part of you  
  
I could be your one who knows  
I'm a one, a chance to grow  
Reason why: I want you to  
Let me be a part of you  
  
Its worth the risk, so say you will  
Let me be the one who waits until  
Your dark demand needs to be filled  
So let me be a part of you  
Just because I want you to  
Something happens when you do  
So let me be a part of you  
  
Its worth the risk, so say you will  
Let me be the one who waits until  
Your dark demand needs to be filled

Patterns all around you  
Patterns everywhere  
Patterns of behavior  
Sometimes seem unfair  
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?  
  
Patterns unfamiliar  
Patterns lead you through (to)  
Patterns of discovery  
Tracing out the clues  
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?  
Stuck in your mind  
  
In this land where stability is hard to find  
You can rearrange the patterns so unkind  
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries  
Old patterns never die they just go on and on  
  
Patterns multiplying  
Re-direct our view  
Endless variations  
Make it all seem new

Peek-a-boo!  
I can see you  
And I know what you do  
So put your hands on your face  
And cover up your eyes  
Don't look until I signal  
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo!  
The way that we weren't is what we'll become  
So please pay attention while I show you some  
Of what's about to happen  
Peek-a-boo!  
I know what you do  
Cause I do it too  
Laugh if you want to or say you don't care  
If you cannot see it you think it's not there  
It doesn't work that way

You better watch out  
I'm tellin' you why  
Just when you least expect it  
Just when you feel at ease  
That's when you get selected  
That's when they'll come you'll see  
So many stray transmissions  
There's nothing you can do  
So many liquid rhythms  
They'd fill a swimming pool  
Beamed from the highest mountain  
Nowhere left for you to go  
They'll take you even higher  
Than you've ever been before  
But there's no need to worry  
First you'll dip into a dream  
And in your mind it's comin'  
Like so many bright ideas  
It's all about the happen  
It's way beyond fantastic  
It's useless to resist it  
When you're finally hit with  
Pink jazz trancers  
Jazz trance for you  
Wait just for a minute  
Lay down here next to me  
Jazz trance for you  
No need for you to hurry  
Turn on the cable TV  
Jazz trance for you  
Let's close our eyes together  
Now can't you see how good  
It's gonna be...

Pink pussycat  
Where are you  
Pink pussycat  
I'm looking for you  
Pink pussycat  
Meow, meow, meow  
Pink pussycat  
Pink pussycat  
Pink pussycat  
Where you hiding puss  
Pink pussycat  
I'm coming after you  
Pink pussycat  
  
I'm gonna make you meow-meow  
Pink pussycat  
I see you in the car now  
Pink pussycat  
I've got you in the back seat  
Pink pussycat  
I want to touch your fur now  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna make you dance now  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna stand your fur on end  
  
Pink pussycat  
Pink pussycat  
Pink pussycat  
Where you hiding puss  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna catch You  
Pink pussycat  
Meow, meow. meow  
Pink pussycat  
I'll sleep beside you  
Pink pussycat  
I'll lick you clean  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna mess you up  
  
Pink pussycat  
I'm a dog  
Pink pussycat  
Bow wow wow  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna chase you  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna catch you  
Pink pussycat  
I'm gonna bite you  
Pink pussycat  
I'll tear your little ears off  
Pink pussycat  
Meow, meow, meow  
Pink pussycat  
Pink pussycat  
I'm so soft  
I'm so soft

Pity you  
You're telling me you've got a problem  
A nervous sort of contraction  
A mindless kind of reaction  
You never get no satisfaction  
Here's to you  
  
I know you really got a problem  
A nasty kind of reflection  
A dangerous sort of destruction  
That makes it difficult  
Makes it hard to reach  
Takes it all away  
From what you had in mind  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
A nervous kind of distraction  
A nasty sort of contraction  
But there's some big fat point  
That you seem to be missing  
And it's driving you to destruction  
But it doesn't seem  
To stop you in the least  
Or halt this obsession got you  
  
Going on back  
Week after week  
Day after day  
Hour after hour  
From where you came  
For more of the same

Who are you and who am I  
Except a couple of people  
Wasting lots of time  
Worrying about the future  
Forever asking why  
Some people go on living  
While others die before their time  
Yet there's never been a reason  
Whatever is is right  
If only just because  
Its much too big a fight  
Like the painter who is way ahead  
Or worse still far behind  
You only punch yourself out  
When you start swinging blind  
These are the things too often gone unsaid  
These are the things that keep  
You better off than dead  
These are the things that keep running through your head  
  
These are the things too often gone unsaid  
Who are you and who am I  
Except a couple of people  
With nothing else to do  
But follow vain obsessions  
Making gestures towards the truth  
While trying to ignore it  
When its convenient to  
The symbols we believe in  
Sometimes turn inside out  
Reshaping each dimension  
Were so sure about  
Dreams get so frustrated  
Fantasies turn pranks  
A simple ounce of common sense  
Is money in the bank.

I heard a girl in a dress  
Say her face was a mess  
I heard there's no reason why  
I heard that now's the time to buy  
  
On planet earth  
I'll probably stay  
On planet earth  
It's a place to live your life  
  
Where pleasure follows pain  
People go insane  
Fly around in planes  
Pray that it won't rain  
Drive around in cars  
Get drunk in local bars  
Dream of being stars  
Well I lived all my life on planet earth  
  
I saw a girl lose all control  
When she lost her new mink stole  
I saw her try to catch a man  
Things I couldn't understand  
  
On planet earth  
I'll probably stay  
On planet earth  
It's a place to live your life  
  
Where pleasure follows pain  
People go insane  
Fly around in planes  
Pray that it won't rain  
Drive around in cars  
Get drunk in local bars  
Dream of being stars  
Well I lived all my life on planet earth  
  
I saw a man on a stage  
Scream put me back in my cage  
I saw him hang by his tie  
I saw enough to make me cry  
On planet earth  
On planet earth  
  
I lived all my life on planet earth  
I lived all my life on planet earth  
On planet earth

Love comes in spurts  
And love is all around us  
Love is what it does  
Sometimes it hurts  
Does that strike you rather strangely, does it ever love?  
Please, please, please  
No need to be so cruel  
Please, please, please  
Don't treat me like a fool  
  
Love comes in spurts  
Sometimes it gets to be too much to rise above  
  
Please, please, please  
No need to be so cruel  
Please, please, please  
Don't treat me like a fool  
If you love me  
You would leave me  
Leave me time to be alone  
Please believe me  
That would leave me  
Time to love you  
Does that strike you funny, love?  
Be-bop-a-lua  
Be-bop-a-lua she's my ? baby  
  
When it's over  
Promise me that you'll go  
When it's over  
Promise you'll let me know  
When it's over promise me that you'll go  
Just because what it was becomes another empty cup of memories

If I had a hammer  
I'd wake up all my neighbors  
Pounding out a rhythm  
All about you  
If I had a pencil  
I'd push me some paper  
I'd build a skyscraper  
To get close to you  
If I had a lasso  
I'd said out the window  
And land on an island  
Next to you  
If I had a hot rod  
I'd fasten up my seat belt  
And break the speed limit  
Gettin' to you  
But I ain't got a hammer  
And I ain't got a pencil  
And I ain't got a lasso  
So I'm doing it the hard way  
Like a post post-modern man  
If I had a credit card  
I'd clear me a pathway  
Through the deepest jungle  
Right to your door  
If I had a camera  
I'd snap away my fingers  
And collect up the pictures  
Of you, of course  
But I ain't got a hot rod  
And I ain't got a credit card  
No chance for a camera  
So I'm doing it the hard way  
Like a post post-modern man  
Well I ain't go a hammer  
And I ain't got a lasso  
No chance for a camera  
So I'm doing it the hard way

Long time no sugar  
And it's starting to hurt  
Something's flattening my cola  
Something's wrong with my brew  
Something's rotten in idaho  
And I don't know what to do  
Going going gone with the red eye distress  
Going going gone on the red eye express  
Only go around once  
Gotta quench that thirst  
Gotta grab that gusto  
Gotta get there first

I can't get no, satisfaction  
I can't get me no, satisfaction  
And I try, and I try, and I try try-try-try-try-try try  
I can't get no, I can't get me no  
When I'm riding in my car  
And a man comes on the radio  
He's tellin' me more and more  
About some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
I can't get no, uh no no no  
Hey hey hey, that's what I say  
  
I can't get no, satisfaction  
I can't get me no, girly action  
  
And I try, and I try, and I try, try, try, try try, I can't get no, I can't
get me no  
  
When I'm watchin' my tv  
And a man comes on to tell me  
How white my shirts could me  
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke  
The same cigarettes as me  
I can't get no, no, no no  
Hey, hey hey, that's what I say  
  
And when I'm flying around the world  
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' that  
And I'm trying to make some girl  
Tells me baby, baby, baby, baby, byby, baby, baby, better come back later next
week  
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak  
  
I can't get no

You know I live a life of danger  
For the FBI  
Keeping tabs on our nation  
On the land, on the sea, in the sky  
But every single night  
Before I go to bed  
I get down on my knees  
And thank God  
I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
They've given me a number  
But they've taken 'way my name  
I got one hell of a job to perform  
For the U. S. of A.  
Got the responsibility  
Of our nation's top security  
But every night and day  
I salute the flag and say  
Thank you, Jesus  
'Cause I'm, I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
You know they got me doin' this  
Doin' that  
And a little bit of something else  
Fighting cavities of evil  
Safe-guarding America's health  
But not an afternoon pass  
I don't get up off my ass  
Thank you God  
'Cause I'm, I'm a secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
Secret agent man  
  
'Cause I'm a secret agent man

Remember luv  
Sexi luv  
Its a breath of fresh air  
On a day when the sun isn't shining  
It's like a rose that grows  
Through the concrete in the middle  
Of a parking deck  
Remember luv  
Sexi luv  
  
A smile as wide as a semi  
Burning bright as the lights on a highway  
Its the city that never sleeps  
Where I wander like a tourist  
With my camera in hand  
Remember luv  
Its all around you  
So let your sexi feelings grow  
Luv  
Sexi luv

Shout shout  
I'm shoutin' about the world outside  
I'm shoutin' because you just can't hide  
I'm shoutin' from the plain honest truth  
I'm shoutin' there's so much we could do  
Shout i'm shoutin' shoutin' shoutin'  
  
I'm shoutin' because it's hard to believe  
I'm shoutin' it's so easy to see  
I'm shoutin' we're waitin' for a reply  
I'm shoutin' for the very last time  
  
Shout well baby this one's for you  
Shout for everything that you do  
Shout until the battle is won  
Shout we'll live to fight on and on  
  
And when you add it all together  
And when you roll it in a ball  
And when you watch another pyramid  
  
As it's about to fall  
Remember you were there  
Remember if you care  
All those who held their ground  
When it all came down  
Said shout shout  
Shout it out

Shrivel-up  
Well it's a god-given fact (that  
You can't go back)  
It's a god-given law that  
You're gonna lose your maw  
It's a god-given fact you gotta  
Buy 'em by the sack  
It's a god-given law that  
You're gonna get small  
May be just another rap but  
You're running out of sap  
Well you better take the rap  
Dying under daddy's cap  
It's at the top of the list  
That you can't get pissed  
It's rule number one living right isn't fun  
Time-tested and true you  
Gotta pooty poo-poo

Got a nervous kind of feeling  
Got a painful yellow headache  
Every picture in every magazine's turned real  
Every face looks out and screams at me too real  
Cold sweat on my collar  
Dripping to my boots  
The waves of nauseous pain  
Sets off the pressure pad alarms  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta painful swelling brain  
Banging in my head  
Gotta painful swelling brain  
And i called off sick  
Gotta swelling itching pain  
Got me pulling out my hair  
Gotta swelling itching pain  
Clutching at my brain  
Got me laying on the floor  
Think i left my senses  
Seems like endless torture  
Got me pulling out my hair  
Driving me up the wall  
Dripping out my eyes ears nose and mouth  
Imploding my thoughts  
Blasting holes in the front lawn now  
Going outta my skull  
Burning up my thoughts  
Tearing me apart

My baby took our love  
And then she rolled it up  
Rolled it up a hill  
Like a ball of snow  
Like a snowball grows  
Until it gets too big  
Until she lost control  
And it rolled back down [Repeat: x3]  
  
She took a tiny bit  
And rolled it up again  
Slower than before  
She went a step too far  
She had to let it go  
I saw it go straight down  
My baby turned around  
Started up again [Repeat: x3]  
  
Eyes were made for looking'  
Hands were made for holdin'  
Hearts were made for lovin'  
Lips were made for kissin'  
Legs were made for walkin'  
Tracks were made to follow  
That's what I'm gonna do  
  
Two tracks  
In the snow  
Two tracks  
Up that hill  
My heart broke  
When my baby left  
Two tracks behind

If you obey society's rules  
You will be society's fools  
You'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were fools  
You never wanted to listen in school  
Now your mind won't go where you want to take it  
You got a ride but you're not gonna make it  
You'll never catch up!  
Dad, pass the catsup!  
Clean that mess up! Listen up!  
If you obey society's fools  
You'll be society's tools  
And you'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
You thought your mom and dad were queer  
You always wanted egg in your beer  
Now your dog won't go  
When you try to make it  
He's got a bone but he's not gonna shake it  
If you take society's tools  
You will make society's rules  
Which you'll obey and then disobey  
You'll disobey but then you'll obey  
That's all for now  
That's all we know  
This is the end

Soft things  
You want soft things  
You need soft things  
You'll get soft things  
You register a motion  
You get a helpful hint  
There's a certain way it shivers when she shakes  
Her mind seemed so chaotic  
Her posture was erotic  
And her voice was exotic  
I acted so neurotic  
I thought it idiotic  
Her dance was so technotic  
She became hypnotic  
And now I'm calling out for soft things  
Something soft when times get hard  
And now I'm calling out for soft things  
When something calls you you'll know what to do  
You find a longer wavelength  
You hear a deeper note  
It's a buried treasure that she doesn't hide

Some things never change  
Hang your head  
I saw the news today o boy  
A thousand stories that we've seen before  
Small minds play at some big time games  
And everybody else pays  
Make no mistake they're on the take  
They like to keep it that way  
Some things never change  
I saw the light today o boy  
It come on flashing bright in red and blue  
The man steps in with a terminal grin  
Blue skies turn to grey  
Young men die and children cry  
Why is it always the same  
  
Life must be eaten  
Or at least bitten into  
To get past the surface  
The moment of truth  
You know when its right  
Its sweet deep inside  
Its real and its better  
That some things don't change  
  
I saw the news today o boy  
A thousand pictures of the lies we live  
Small minds play at some big time games  
And everybody else pays  
They're on the take and they don't give breaks  
They like to take it away  
Some things never change  
Hang your head

Pretty little mongo  
Everybody wants her toilet  
Same old story  
She won't let nobody near it  
  
The way she teases them  
It's such a shame  
She's got all the huboons  
Crying out her name  
  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
She's got em howling  
She's got em growling  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
  
She's got em going clean out of their minds  
Soo bawls soo bawls  
There ain't a man in town who wouldn't  
Have her for his daughter  
  
Theys all trade their brains for  
One taste of her toilet water  
1-2-3-4 tell the people what she wore  
They're all trying hard to call her up  
  
But her phone's been disconnected  
Since she sold her butt

Space girls are as cold as ice  
They'll kiss you once and kiss you twice  
You'll shiver and shake and then turn blue  
Next you got the space girl blues  
I want your mechanism  
Give me your mechanism  
Space girls always smoke for taste  
Swallow butts and leave no waste  
Sado-maso is the rule  
You want them they don't want you  
Just to show that they don't care  
They'll bite your face and burn the hair  
The sun comes up the moon boo-hoos  
Next you got the spacegirl blues  
I need your mechanism  
Destroy your mechanism  
Destroy it!!  

I'm speed racer and I drive real fast  
He's speed racer and he drives real fast  
I drive real fast, I'm gonna last  
  
I'm a big pirate and I like to steal  
He's a big pirate and he likes to steal  
I like to steal and I like to kill  
  
Go, go, go speed racer  
I'm a barbie doll, but I got brains  
She's a barbie doll, but she's got brains  
I've got brains and I like sex  
Lots of brains and she likes sex  
  
I'm your doctor and here's the bill  
He's your doctor and here's the bill  
Doctor steel and here's the bill  
He likes to steal, so here's your bill

Intersecting love lines  
Drew us closer every day  
Always kept your distance  
When you felt my presence near you  
Love keeps on rolling over  
  
Fly in retreat  
I would follow without shame  
A stupid spud staggering to the flame  
To be had and re-had  
Be a victim of the pain  
Now it's strange, it's so strange  
It's a strange pursuit  
It's a strange pursuit  
It's a strange pursuit  
  
I come running like a fat-boy  
In lead shoes  
But like a fat-boy  
Huff puffing after you  
It's hopeless to hope for  
The one thing that I'm wanting  
'Cause it's strange  
It's so very strange  
  
It's a strange pursuit  
Darling, I'm dazzled  
But you know I'm too Frazzled  
It's a strange pursuit  
Makin' my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
It's a strange pursuit  
  
You know it's getting tough  
When you're getting real rough  
It's a strange pursuit  
Darling, I'm dazzled  
But you know I'm too frazzled  
It's a strange pursuit  
Makin' my mind up  
While it lies in little pieces  
It s a strange pursuit

When you hear would should coulda  
Gotta think mighta been in spite of  
Low down tired of being a fighter  
Turn around put it all behind you  
Caught in a trap and you can't walk out  
It's in your mind so you can't walk out  
Now don't get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well you're gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
When you hear maybe baby someday  
Gotta say when do I get it my way  
Freeze-dried waitin' for the big day  
Get wise take another freeway  
Caught in a trap and you can't walk out  
It's in your mind so you can't walk out  
Just when you think you've got it beat  
It sets you up and knocks you down  
Try to blow it off or trade it in  
You'll wind up in the lost and found  
And then you're stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Well you're gonna get stuck  
Stuck in a loop again  
Maybe random maybe a scam  
Fate lays waste to the greatest plans  
That's life  
Talk about karma moan about sin  
Just don't get stuck in that loop again  
'Cause that's life

Got a surprise from my honey  
Got a message from my girl  
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed  
And wrote me a scribbled note  
  
Said she'd be coming back to see me  
That she would be visiting real soon  
Gonna get up from her long white bed  
And leave this cold white room  
  
We would once more live together  
Go out on a lovin' spree  
Just like before the accident  
My baby would look at me  
  
I saw her sweet face trembling  
As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise  
  
Got a surprise from my honey  
Got a message from my girl  
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed  
And wrote me a scribbled note  
  
I saw her sweet face trembling  
As she tried to open her eyes  
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy  
The day my baby gave me a surprise

I found a girl with a pretty face  
I tied a rope around her waist  
I know when she's in and when  
She goes out  
Well there ain't nothing to guess about  
She covers her ears when i play my guitar  
She runs away but not very far  
Just push a button - retractable cord  
I pull her back when i get bored  
One word from her and she'd be free  
But she's exactly where she wants to be  
Magnetic Madonna she glows in the night  
Reciprocal pull, i flow to her light  
Woman i am bound to you  
But what do i want to do?  
Woman what do i want?

With a mind that's satisfied, with a mind that's satisfied  
That big ice cream cone in the sky floats right on by  
The satisfied mind never needs more, it never forgets whatever it's for  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind that's satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind that's satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave, an ice cold drink is a major find  
In the long dead end of winter, frozen lovers dream of fire  
With a mind that's satisfied, with a mind that's satisfied  
Lucky ones learn that love is blind, they don't deny  
The satisfied mind never needs more, never regrets and never keeps score  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind that's satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind that's satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave, an ice cold drink is a major find  
Simple fact you can depend on, bits and pieces of desire  
With a mind that's satisfied, that big ice cream cone floats on by  
With a mind that's satisfied, lucky ones learn that love is blind  
With a mind that's satisfied, the satisfied mind is satisfied  
The satisfied mind is satisfied, the satisfied mind is satisfied  

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
A real nice guy with a na na na na nasty side  
In trouble  
He tried to hide from himself  
Good gawd sad man  
Couldn't face up to the yin and the yang  
Everybody  
  
All of us got a shadow  
Who knows what lurks in the hearts of men  
The shadow knows  
We become what we do, not what we pretend  
  
Between the intention and the expression  
Between the emotion and the response  
Falls the shadow  
  
Guitar  
Sometimes I fail to follow through  
On things that I want to do  
And other times I find myself doing the very things I hate  
  
Reverend Jimmy and Tammy Belle  
Big time pumpers with a story to sell  
Wait a minute  
Their finger's pointing at you  
Pay attention, listen up  
Don't try to deny it or cover it up  
Everybody  
All of us got a shadow

Let the word go forth  
Let the word go forth  
From this time and place  
  
Good evening my fellow citizens  
I'm speaking tonight in a spirit of hope  
In the human spirit, the human spirit  
  
Lee harvey oswald  
Oh, no  
Jack ruby  
Oswald and ruby  
Oh, no  
  
To friend and foe alike  
Oswald and ruby  
  
My god, have you heard  
The president is dead  
  
Oswald and ruby  
They do not imprison spirits  
Oswald and ruby  
They do not imprison spirits  
The president is dead  
  
Well, I know where that 3rd shot came from  
The grassy knoll  
Behind the picket fence  
  
The energy, the faith, the function  
Which we bring to this endeavor  
We'll fight our country and all who serve it  
And the glow from that fire  
Can truly light the world  
  
History will record the facts  
I didn't shoot anybody  
  
Lee harvey oswald  
Why should anybody serve?  
Why should anybody serve?  
Jack harvey oswald  
  
We have learned in times past  
The spirit of one moment or place  
Can be gone in the next

Today what does it take to do the super thing  
I'll tell you what it takes a very simple thing  
Iron nerves like the pilot of a jumbo jet  
Or a girl on the go who hasn't got there yet  
  
Magnetic trumpets blowing  
Synthetic saxophone  
The evidence kept growing  
From below  
  
Hidden motivations  
Buried in the past  
Still gives us strength  
For the super thing  
  
The red alarm a rude surprise every time it rings  
Means it's time to go beyond the normal thing  
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right  
The super thing the thing that makes you bigger than life  
Won't you tell me what it takes  
To do the super thing  
  
Signals start to travel from a distant place  
Lights go out electro shock then pleasure pain  
Sensations unfamiliar can make you sick  
It's a superhuman thing and it does the trick

We're through being cool  
Eliminate the ninnies and the twits  
Going to bang some heads  
Going to beat some butts  
Time to show those evil spuds what's what  
If you live in a small town  
You might meet a dozen or two  
Young alien types who step out  
And dare to declare  
Spank the pank who try to drive you nuts  
Time to clean some house  
Be a man or a mouse  
Waste those who make it tough to get around  
If you live in a big place  
Many factions underground  
Chase down mister hinky dink  
So no trace can be found  
Put the tape on erase  
Rearrange a face  
We always liked Picasso anyway  
Mash 'em

She was walking all alone  
Down the street, in the alley  
Her name was Sally  
I never touched her  
  
She never saw it  
When she was hit by space junk  
She was [?] by space junk  
She was [?] by space junk  
  
In New York, Miami Beach  
Heavy metal fell in Cuba  
Angola, Saudi Arabia  
On Christmas Eve said Nomad  
  
A Soviet sputnik hit Africa  
India, in Venezuela, in Texas, Kansas  
It's falling fast Peru too  
It keeps coming, it keeps coming, it keeps coming  
  
And now, I'm mad about space junk  
I'm all burned out about space junk  
Ooh, walk and talk about space junk  
It smashed my baby's head, space junk  
And now my Sally's dead, space junk

When love takes a back seat to life  
When a man runs away from his wife  
That's when you know he's in the world  
When a guy tries to round up his mate  
But she's gone and it's gettin' too late  
That's when you know he lost his girl  
so it happens all the time  
don't get low just stand in line  
take your turn now make your move  
and crush that doubt with a ton o' love  
When woman takes a back seat to man  
She has to tell him where to go if she can  
And she decides to wear his ring  
Find a girl with the face of a clock  
Her hands move forward till you can't stop  
She comes from above with a ton o' love

It was a thing I had to do  
It was a message from below  
It was a messy situation  
It was desire for a girl  
  
I'm not a wanker or a banker  
I'm not afraid to take a risk  
It is the thing females ask for  
When they convey the opposite  
  
Before I die  
Before I die  
Before I die  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
If I have to lie  
  
It was a thing I had to do  
It was a message from below  
It was a messy situation  
It was a triumph of the will  
  
Before I die  
Before I die  
Before I die  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
I'll get another piece of pie  
If I have to lie  
  
When the well cries out for water  
It is a need that must be filled  
It goes beyond the laws of nature  
It takes a triumph of the will

Since you came around  
Wigglin' under my skin  
I've been lost in the lost 'n found  
Feeling like a helpless pin  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
You fluttered on down  
As graceful as can be  
Then you stuck in the needle  
And sucked my blood  
It was the loveage that came over me  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
I'm always bugged over you  
Now I'm hopelessly entangled  
In the web of love you dangled  
Helpless like a worm watch me twist and squirm  
Your love has left me strangled  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl, I don't know what to do  
You got me bug bug bug bug bugged  
Girl, I'm all bugged out over you  
You got me bug bug bug bug  
Now I'm hopelessly entangled  
In the web of love you dangled  
Should have trusted sick fear  
Now you stepped out on my tail  
Your love has left me strangled  
You got me bug bug bug bug

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
  
Got an urge, got a surge and it's outta control  
Got an urge I want to purge  
'Cause I'm losing control  
  
Uncontrollable urge I want to tell you all about it  
Got an uncontrollable urge let me, scream and shout it!  
  
(He's got an uncontrollable urge)  
I've got an uncontrollable urge  
(He's got an uncontrollable urge)  
I've got an uncontrollable  
  
It's got style, it's got class  
So strong, I can't let it pass I gotta tell you all about it  
I gotta scream and shout it!  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
  
Got an urge, got a surge and it's outta control now!  
Got an urge I want to purge 'cause I'm losing con-trol  
Uncontrollable urge I want to tell you all about it  
Got an uncontrollable urge let me, scream and shout it!  
  
That's right!  
  
(He's got an uncontrollable urge)  
I've got an uncontrollable urge  
(He's got an uncontrollable urge)  
I've got an uncontrollable  
  
It's got style, it's got class  
So strong, I can't let it pass I gotta tell you all about it

Pressure, pushing down on me  
Pressing down on you, no man ask for  
Under pressure, that burns a building down  
Splits a family in two  
Puts people on streets  
  
Bah, bah... ...  
  
That's okay  
It's the terror of knowing  
What this world is about  
Watching some good friends  
Screaming 'Let me out'  
Pray tomorrow takes me higher  
Pressure on people, people on streets  
  
Okay, Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor  
These are the days it never rains but it pours  
People on streets  
People on streets  
  
It's the terror of knowing  
What this world is about,  
Watching some good friends  
Screaming 'Let me out'  
Pray tomorrow takes me higher  
Pressure on people, people on streets  
  
Turned away from it all, like a blind man  
Sat on a fence but it don't work  
Keep coming up with love  
But it's so slashed and torn  
Why why why?  
Love love love love  
  
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking  
Can't we give ourselves one more chance  
Why can't we give love one more chance  
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love  
  
Cause love's such an old fashioned word  
And love dares you to care  
For the people on the edge of the night  
And love dares you to change our way of  
Caring about ourselves  
  
This is our last dance (x2)  
This is ourselves  
Under pressure  
Under pressure  
Pressure

I used to plan and plot  
And try to live correct  
Lately I do a lot  
Of things that don't make sense  
Now I must do what I must  
Now why do you think that a man  
Jumps out of the frying pan  
Into the fire when he can  
Find a way not to get burned?  
I must do what I must do  
And I do though I know better  
I must do what I must do  
(Even though he's gonna get it)  
Below the sky above  
Beyond what's good and true  
Some thing as loud as love  
Calls out I can't refuse  
I must do what I must do  
And I do though I know better  
I must do what I must do  
(Even though he might regret it)  

If I had a tiny microphone  
Hidden in my heart  
It would amplify my love for you  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
If I had a little view master  
Stuck inside my brain  
It would snap the pictures all of you.  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
If I had a telegraph  
Tapping in my brain  
It would tap the Morse code "I love you."  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
What'd I say?  
Everyday!  
  
The words get stuck in my throat (repeating)
