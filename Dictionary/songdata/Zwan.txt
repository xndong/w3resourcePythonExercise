northern star  
am i frightened  
where can i go to rest  
i can't sleep  
and i'm still fighting  
wait, don't breathe  
  
the time destroys a man  
a child who understands  
that anyone who desires  
is not my kind  
not my truth  
  
fade away, it's all we do  
fade away from the truth  
desires  
fade away  
desires  
fade away  
desires  
  
and northern star  
please enlighten  
the lost prayers of my soul  
childhood dreams  
of death and titans  
we were meant to be free  
  
to give ourselves away  
so please don't be afraid  
of anyone who desires  
they're not my kind  
not my truth  
  
fade away, it's all we do  
fade away from the truth  
desires  
fade away  
desires  
fade away  
desires  
fade away  
desires  
  
'cause anyone who desires  
is not my kind  
i have no use for you  
  

come in  
make yourself at home  
i'm a bit late  
hate to make you wait  
  
but heart songs  
are still on my mind  
there's never the time  
to write down these lines  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
come on  
let's hit the road  
i'm up to my tricks  
i know they seem cold  
  
but heart songs  
are all that i am  
i use the same words  
to say the same things  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
no less
