The urge to take you grows more strong  
For time had made me wait too long  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twenty-five o'clock - that's when you're going to be mine  
Twenty-five o'clock, we'll be together till the end of time  
At twenty-five o'clock  
  
The ticking seconds - hear them call  
My spell of hours will make you fall  
Each timer that I break  
Will halt the flowing sands  
Each timer that I break  
Will put you in my hands  
At twenty-five o'clock - that's when you're going to be mine  
Twenty-five o'clock, we'll be together till the end of time  
At twenty-five o'clock  
  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just adding to my power  
Each watch I smash apart  
Just bringing near the hour  
Of twenty-five o'clock

Soldiers, workers, slaves and farmers,  
Nurses, queens and drones.  
Wish they'd leave my head tonight,  
Let me rest my bones.  
  
(Ziggedy zig zag just look at 'em. Ziggedy zag, hey hey)  
  
A billion feet sound just like a billion drums.  
A bed is creaking as the messiah comes.  
The cars are crashing and the bacon is hacked.  
The coffin's lowered and the lunches get packed.  
Still segregating 'cause we insects are too proud.  
Doesn't matter what colour of cat you are there's no dogs allowed.  
  
And the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  
The stars are laughing at us,  
As we crawl on and on across this antheap.  
  
War planes go over but no wages go 'round.  
A sign goes up to say hey we're twin towned.  
The dough is rising but no bread will be baked.  
The fur is genuine but the orgasm's faked.  
We're spending millions to learn to speak porpoise,  
When human loneliness is still a deafening noise.  
  
And the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  
The stars are laughing at us,  
As we crawl on and on across this antheap.  
  
Soldiers, workers, slaves and farmers,  
Nurses, queens and drones.  
Wish they'd leave my head tonight,  
And let me rest my bones.  
  
And all the world's babies are crying still.  
While all the police cars harmonize with power drills.  
As jets and kettles form a chord with screeching gulls.  
Accompanied by truncheons keeping time on human skulls.  
  
And the screaming sky won't let me sleep.  
The stars are laughing at us,  
As we crawl on and on past lovers who'll leap.  
On and on past widows who'll weep.  
On and on no more than skin deep.  
On and on across this antheap.

Do something for me, boys  
If I should die at sea, boys  
Write a little note, boys  
Set it off afloat, saying  
  
Bless you, bless you, all of you pretty girls  
Village and city girls by the quayside  
Bless you, bless you, all of you pretty girls  
Watching and waiting by the sea  
  
Bless you, bless you, all of you pretty girls  
Quiet or witty girls by the quayside  
Bless you, bless you, all of you pretty girls  
Watching and waiting by the sea  
  
I think about your pale arms waving  
When I see the caps upon the green  
And the rocking roller-coaster ocean  
Think about you every night when I'm fathoms asleep  
And in my dreams  
We are rocking in a similar motion  
  
I think about the salt sea rolling  
Down in pearly tears upon your cheeks  
Just like the day the harbor pulled away  
I think about your warm white sheets unfolding  
The more I have to drink  
The more that I can think to say

Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.  
  
Don't want demolition,  
Don't want your compensation,  
It's not just bricks and mortar,  
We are lambs to slaughter.  
  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.  
  
Must we live in fear,  
From those who shed no tears?  
Our one and only shelter,  
Your games, your helter skelter.  
  
Motorways and office blocks,  
They're standing on the spot  
Where stood a home,  
Crushing on the memories of people,  
Who have since turned to stone.  
(Ahh)  
They've turned to stone,  
(Ahh)  
They've turned to stone.  
  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Save us from the ball and chain,  
Oh yeah,  
The diggers and the tower cranes,  
The diggers and the tower cranes.

Do you know what noise awakes you  
Every morning from your bed  
A-coming from the farthest hillside  
A-coming from inside your head  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
[Chorus:]  
Louder than tanks on the highway  
Louder than bombers in flight  
Louder than noises of hatred  
Dancing us from darkest night is the rhythm of love  
Powered on the the beating of hearts  
  
And did you know you had this power?  
Drumming on it always stays  
Never try to use it badly  
Tunes of good are all it plays  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can visit  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For a heart without love is a song with no words  
And a tune to which no-one is listening  
So your heart must give love and you'll find that  
You shine like rain on the leaves you'll be glistening  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
Louder than thoughts of dictators  
Louder than rattling swords  
Louder than loading of rifles  
Louder than screaming warlords  
  
[Chorus]

Beatown  
I spoke to your boss this morning  
He asked why you weren't home?  
I said sir they left without warning  
You won't even get them on the telephone  
  
They're in Beatown, it's a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown, beatown  
  
I spoke to your owner this lunchtime  
He asked why you weren't home?  
I said they thought it was hunchtime  
You won't even see them standing on their own  
  
Beatown, it's a capital city and all roads lead to  
Beatown, beatown  
  
He says he wants his money back sir  
He says you're all communists sir  
I said they beat you fair and square sir  
They use the head, and not the fist  
  
Beatown, beatown

Blue overall  
Overall the rooftops blue birds fly apart  
Blue overall  
Overall the bones that cage this stupid heart  
Got blues drawing crosses on my front door  
Blues a'bringing buckets 'round the back  
Blues trying to push me from me white fence  
And tar me a darker bluey black  
For all this time  
I really thought you loved me  
For all this time  
You only rubber gloved me  
Blue overall  
Overall my anvil gives no further sparks  
Blue overall  
Overall my fears swim hammer headed sharks  
Got blues drinking beer out in the kitchen  
Blue dog is barking to be fed  
Got blues spilling wine upon me heartrug  
They're holding a party in my head  
For all this time  
I really thought you loved me  
For all this time  
You merely went and shoved me  
I tried to lose myself in labour  
The more I push the mirth  
I'm giving birth to a baby's turning  
Blue overall  
Feeling blue overall  
All over I'm turning blue

Boarded up  
Yeah, we're boarded up  
Nailed up shut  
Yeah, we're boarded up  
  
Music venue has had its day  
Death watch beetle band moved in to play  
Groups don't come down from London way  
  
Cause we're boarded up  
Yeah, we're nailed up shut  
Two-by-four-ded up  
Yeah, we're boarded up

Books are burning  
In the main square, and I saw there  
The first eating the text  
Books are burning  
In the still air  
And you know where they burn books  
People are next  
I believe the printed word should be forgiven  
Doesn't matter what it said  
Wisdom hotline from the dead back to the living  
Key to the larder for your heart and head  
Books are burning  
In our own town, watch us turn 'round  
And cast our glances elsewhere  
Books are burning  
In the playground  
Smell of burnt book is not unlike human hair  
I believe the printed word is more than sacred  
Beyond the gauge of good or bad  
The human right to let your soul fly free and naked  
Above the violence of the fearful and sad  
The church of matches  
Anoints in ignorance with gasoline  
The church of matches  
Grows fat by breathing in the smoke of dreams  
It's quite obscene  
Books are burning  
More each day now, and I pray now  
You boys will tire of these games  
Books are burning  
I hope somehow, this will allow  
A phoenix up from the flames

Well, let me tell you about my girlie  
She goes by the name of sleepy shirley  
She become a real life wiro  
Since she learned how to do the cairo  
And she go  
  
Up up down down  
Up up down down  
  
She pours out the sand on the kitchen floor  
Then we start to camel through the living room door  
She was cool to me, but now her heart's afiro  
Since she learned how to do the cairo  
And she go

I'm floating over strange land,  
It's a soulless, sequined, showbiz moon.  
I'm floating over strange land,  
And then stranger still, there's no balloon.  
But I'm getting higher,  
Wafted up by fame's fickle fire 'til the...  
  
Chalkhills and children,  
Anchor my feet.  
Chalkhills and children,  
Bringing me back to earth,  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street.  
(Even I never know where I go when my eyes are closed.)  
  
I'm skating over thin ice,  
Upon blunted blades of metal soft.  
I'm skating over thin ice,  
While some nonesuch net holds me aloft.  
But I'm getting higher,  
Lifted up on lucks' circus wire 'til the...  
  
Chalkhills and children,  
Anchor my feet.  
Chalkhills and children,  
Bringing me back to earth,  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street.  
  
Even I never know where I go when my eyes are closed.  
Even I never spied that the scenes were posed.  
Even I never knew this is what I'd be.  
Even eyes never mean that you're sure to see.  
  
Still I'm getting higher,  
Rolling up on three empty tyres, 'til the...  
  
Chalkhills and children,  
Anchor my feet.  
Chalkhills and children,  
Bringing me back to earth,  
Eternally and ever Ermine Street.  
  
I'm soaring over hushed crowds,  
The reluctant cannonball it seems.  
I'm soaring over hushed crowds,  
I'm propelled up here by long dead dreams.  
  
Still I'm getting higher,  
Icarus regrets and retires puzzled.  
  
Chalkhills and children,  
Anchor my feet.  
Chalkhills and children,  
Oddly complete.  
(Even I never know where I go when my eyes are all closed.)  
  
Here I go again.

Breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning around  
I'll breathe 'em in until my head goes spinning 'round  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
Want to worship at the church of women

I ask myself should I put my finger to the left, no  
I ask myself should I put my finger to the right, no  
I say it really doesn't matter where I put my finger  
Someone else will come along and move it  
And it's always been the same  
It's just a complicated game  
  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the left, no  
A little girl asked me should she part her hair upon the right, no  
I said it doesn't really matter where you part your hair

A little boy asked me should he put his vote upon the right, no  
I say it really doesn't matter where you put your vote

And it's always been the same  
It's just a complicated game  
  
They wanted Tom  
They wanted Joe  
To dress 'em up and stick 'em out on show  
They were arrows in a very bad aim  
It's just a complicated game

I put on a fake smile  
And start the evening show  
The public is laughing  
I guess by now they know  
So climb from your high horse  
And pull this freak show down  
Dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown  
You said I was the master of all I surveyed  
But now I'm sweeping up  
The last in line in your circus parade  
Children are clapping  
As I fall to the floor  
My heart torn and broken  
And they just scream for more  
If I'm not the sole fool  
Who pulls his trousers down  
Then dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown  
You tread the high wire  
Between truth and lies  
Your safety net just walked out  
Much to your surprise  
Strike up the band love  
And let the show begin  
For this is the last time  
I'm painting on a grin  
If I'm not the sole fool  
Who pulls his trousers down  
Then dear Madam Barnum  
I resign as clown

We can plant a seed  
And watch it grow  
Food enough to fill a table  
Running water down an overflow  
Eat as much as we are able  
But would the fruit turn ripe  
If the rains had never been?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Lord deliver us from the elements  
We at your mercy and your reverence  
Oh Lord deliver us from the elements  
We've no defense we are impotent  
  
You can travel far to distant lands  
Some so hot no man could bear  
You can conquer peaks with winds of sand  
Where Mother Nature didn't care  
Would not our world turn cold  
If the sun refused to shine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when the world grows old  
And we know more than our brains can hold  
Nature will be law  
Well we're as helpless now as we've ever been before  
Would not our world turn cold  
If the sun refused to shine  
  
[Chorus]

Cast away on a desert island  
Me and poor Crusoe are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
With my umbrella I go walking  
Through all the sands on a building site  
Across the shopping malls and motorways  
Birds from Heathrow fill the  
Night with people flying to escape  
Friday comforts me and says it's pay day  
Cast away on a desert island...  
The game and coconuts is plentiful  
You pick 'em right off of a supermarket shelf  
And all the man-eaters are parked away  
Down in garages  
While their selfish owners drinking to escape  
Lord of flies with cocktails in his conch shell  
Don't rescue me, no  
This is my home sweet home dear  
Don't rescue me, no  
I am far from alone here  
Cast away on a desert island  
Me and one nation are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
Cast away on a desert island

The bar is crowded and bright  
But inside I feel empty and decaying  
The smoky air full of music and words  
It's our record that is playing  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
The night is warm and the pavement  
Below is a river of young lovers  
  
A radio drifting in makes me hide  
With my heart beneath the covers  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
You gave no indication  
This was happening to us  
  
You showed no hesitation  
As you quickly waved  
From your seat on the bus  
That pulled away  
  
Disque Bleu is all that I hear  
Songs that we loved now make me cry  
Disque Bleu brings only a tear  
You were singing good  
  
But you were singing your good-byes  
To me tonight  
You gave no indication  
This was happening to us  
  
You showed no hesitation  
As you quickly waved  
From your seat on the bus  
That pulled away

Man acting like a farmer and,  
He's treated the woman like a poor cow,  
We got to treat you better from now,  
But man is just a baby and,  
He's needing your milk of kindness.  
I vow to drink as much as you will allow.  
  
All the way through history,  
Man, machine, no mystery,  
All the way through history,  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex.  
  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it,  
Down in the cockpit,  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it.  
  
Queen wants the castle,  
Back from the rascal,  
Queen wants the castle.  
  
The girl tribe are growing up and,  
Filling the world full with a new soul,  
To get so far they payed a high toll.  
Try not to make,  
The same mistakes,  
As man has done, or you'll fall in that hole,  
And you will see us changing our role.  
  
All the way through history,  
Man, machine, no mystery,  
All the way through history,  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex.  
  
Down in the cockpit,

Down in the cockpit,

Queen wants the castle.

It frightens me when you come to mind  
The day you dropped in the shopping line  
And my heart beats faster when I think of all the signs, all the signs  
When they carried you out your mouth was open wide  
The cat went astray and the dog did pine for days and days  
And I felt so guilty when we played you up  
When you were ill, so ill  
What sticks in my mind is the sweet jar  
On the sideboard. And your multicolored tea cozy  
What sticks in my mind is the dew-drop hanging off your nose  
Shriveled up and blue  
And I'm getting older, too  
But I don't want to die like you  
Don't want to die like you, don't want to die like you

I've been praying all the week through  
At home, at work and on the bus  
I've been praying I can keep you  
And to earn enough for us  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
  
Found a house that won't repair itself  
With it's windows cracking  
And a roof held together with holes  
Just because we're on the bottom of the ladder  
We shouldn't be sadder  
Than others like us  
Who have goals for the betterment of life  
Glad that you want to be my wife, but honest  
I've been praying all the week through  
At home at work and on the bus  
I've been praying I can keep you  
And to earn enough for us  
  
So you're saying that we're going to be three  
Now, a father's what I'll be  
Don't get me wrong, I'm so proud  
But the belt's already tight  
I'll get another job at night, but honest  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
Just because we're at the bottom of the ladder  
We shouldn't be sadder  
Than others like us  
Who have goals for the betterment of life  
Glad that you want to be my wife, but honest  
  
I can take humiliation  
And hurtful comments from the boss  
I'm just praying by the weekend  
I can earn enough for us  
I can earn enough for us

Gold sun rolls around  
Chocolate nipple brown  
Tumble from your arms  
Like the ground your breasts swell  
Land awake from sleep  
Hares will kick and leap  
Flowers climb erect  
Smiling from the moist kiss of her rainbow mouth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stage left  
Enter Easter and she's dressed in yellow yolk  
Stage right  
Now the son has died, the father can be born  
Stand up  
If we'd all breathe in and blow away the smoke  
New life  
We'd applaud a new life  
  
Odin mounts the tree  
Bleeds for you and me  
Splashing on the lamb  
Gamboling with spring's step  
Buds will laugh and burst  
Racing to be first  
Turning all the soil  
As the promptress fingers through her spinning script  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easter, in her bonnet  
Easter, in her hair  
Easter, are the ribbons  
She tied everywhere

People rushing round with no time to spare.  
I'm so dizzy,  
I'm neither here nor there.  
In this traffic jam,  
I just want to shout,  
Let me off o' this English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the the horns go 'beep! beep!'  
All the people follow like sheep,  
I'm full of light and sound,  
Making my head go round, round.  
  
Everyone is cursing under their breath,  
I'm a passenger,  
I feel close to death,  
Hopeless situation,  
I have no doubt.  
Stop the madness, English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the cars go 'brum! brum!'  
And in my ears I feel a hum,  
The neons blind my eyes,  
All those tempers rise, rise.  
  
Cars and buses go,  
Puffing out their smoke,  
Roll my window down,  
I begin to choke.  
I have had enough,  
I just want to get out.  
Let me off o' this English roundabout.  
  
English roundabout.

I am the fly on the wall,  
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer.  
I just came flying through your door,  
You didn't notice that your number had been called.  
  
I see the mother who's beating the babe,  
I see the money,  
The pennies you save,  
Stored on computers,  
From birth to the grave.  
  
The fly on the wall,  
He's seeing it all.  
  
I am the fly upon the wall,  
You're in the index of the files that stand so tall.  
Although your health is rather poor,  
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure.  
  
I know your income,  
Your daily crust,  
I know your pleasures,  
Your passion,  
Your lust,  
I know when you're living and I know when you're dust.  
  
The fly on the wall,  
He's seeing it all.  
  
One is born and one will die, it's all understood  
The bit that's in the middle doesn't count  
  
I am the fly on the wall,  
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer.  
I just came flying through your door,  
You didn't notice that your number had been called.  
  
I see the mother who's beating the babe,  
I see the money,  
The pennies you save,  
Stored on computers,  
From birth to the grave.  
  
The fly on the wall,  
He's seeing it all. I am the fly  
  
I am the fly upon the wall,  
You're in the index of the files that stand so tall.  
Although your health is rather poor,  
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure.  
  
I know your income,  
Your daily crust,  
I know your pleasures,  
Your passion,  
Your lust,  
I know when you're living and I know when you're dust.  
  
The fly on the wall,  
He's seeing it all.

Tending my fruit, tending my fruit  
Ah you've got to have a hobby  
A man must have a shed to keep him sane  
  
Spraying my buds, spraying my buds  
Got to keep away diseases  
I mix the poisons and the wife don't complain  
  
Some people say  
That I am out of my tree  
Or just a strawberry fool  
Someday they'll see  
'Til then I'll blow you a raspberry  
'cause apples and pears are me  
  
So I'm tending my fruit  
And I don't give a hoot  
'Cause it keeps me sane, it keeps me sane  
  
Some people say  
That I am out of my tree  
Or just a strawberry fool  
Someday they'll see  
'Til then I'll blow you a raspberry  
'Cause apples and pears are me  
  
So I'm tending my fruit, tending my fruit  
Ah you've got to have a hobby  
A man must have a shed to keep him sane  
To keep him sane, to keep him sane, to keep him sane  
  
Oh the wife can't complain  
To keep him sane, to keep him sane, yeah keeps him sane  
Yeah to keep him sane, to keep him sane, yeah it keeps him sane

Funk pop a roll beats up my soul  
Oozing like napalm from the speakers and grill  
Of your radio  
Into the mouths of babes  
And across the backs of its willing slaves  
  
Funk pop a roll consumes you whole  
Gulping in your opium so copiously from a disco  
Everything you eat is waste  
But swallowing is easy when it has no taste  
  
They can fix you rabbits up  
With your musical feed  
They can fix you rabbits up  
Big money selling you stuff that you do not need  
  
Funk pop a roll for fish in shoals  
Music by the yard for the children they keep  
Like poseable dolls  
The young to them are mistakes  
Who only want bread but they're force-fed cake  
  
Funk pop a roll the only goal  
The music business is a hammer to keep  
You pegs in your holes  
But please don't listen to me  
I've already been poisoned by this industry!  
  
Funk pop a roll beats up my soul

Kid,  
Stay and snip your cord off,  
Talk and let your mind loose,  
Can't all think like Chekov,  
But you'll be o.k.  
  
Kid,  
Is this your first time here?  
Some can't stand the beauty,  
So they cut off one ear,  
But you'll be o.k.  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights.  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
This is your life and you spend it all.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
Just don't hurt nobody,  
And the big reward's here,  
In the garden of earthly delights.  
  
Kid,  
Pick up with another,  
Some will even drop you,  
But hearts are built like rubber,  
So you'll be alright.  
  
Kid,  
Swallow but believe us,  
You won't die of boredom,  
Should you have to leave us,  
It'll be alright.  
  
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights.  
Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
This is your life and you spend it all.  
This is your life and you do what you want to do,  
Just don't hurt nobody,  
'less of course they ask you,  
In the garden of earthly delights.

Generals and Majors ah ah  
They're never too far  
From battlefields so glorious  
Out in a world of their own  
They'll never come down  
Till once again victorious  
  
Generals and Majors always  
Seem so unhappy 'less they got a war  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
Like never before are tired of being actionless.  
  
Calling Generals and Majors  
Generals and Majors everywhere  
Calling Generals and Majors  
Your World War III is drawing near  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
They're never too far  
Away from men who made the grade  
Out in a world of their own  
They'll never come down  
Until the battle's lost or made  
  
Generals and Majors ah ah  
Like never before, are tired of being in the shade

Looks as if you're dropping mirrors by the gross  
Looks as if your nine lives have left town  
When you paint in grey and drear  
Eldorado won't appear  
To run his sword through all the fears that pull you down  
  
And it's okay, for the setting sun  
Will colour everything around you gold  
And it's okay, for the setting sun  
Will colour everything around you gold  
  
Looks as if you need a lighthouse in your dark  
Looks as if I'm now your native guide  
When the fog is drawing in  
Snarling dragons break to grin  
And trample over all the things that pull you down  
  
And it's okay...  
  
And all those pebbles in your shoes are precious stones  
And all the skeletons in closets  
Merely piles of harmless bones  
  
...And it's okay, as the setting sun  
Will colour everything around you gold  
Even though it's brown, you'll  
See your old brick town go gold

Hey goosey goosey  
I believe it's for having fun  
Hey goosey goosey  
I believe it's for everyone.  
  
One red morning  
With no warning  
Life comes crashing in  
To wake you early with its golden din.  
  
One blue evening  
Cruelly leaving  
It goes breezing out  
The very second that you figure it out  
What it's all for.  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
Everybody has an inner eye  
Everybody has a magic carpet  
Seems a shame if you don't let it fly  
Tell you why  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Some bright daytime  
Worker's playtime  
You get country-bound  
Pick your girl up  
Throw your oil-can down  
  
Some dark nighttime  
Final frighttime  
As the reaper knocks  
The wisdom of the ancients in a box  
But it's too late  
  
Everybody has a magic lantern  
  
Hey goosey goosey  
  
Yes I do  
  
Goosey goosey gander  
Wither do you wander?

Laying on the grass my heart it flares like fire  
The way you slap my face just fills me with desire  
You play hard to get  
'Cause you're teacher's pet  
But when the boats have gone  
We'll take a tumble excuse for a fumble  
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass  
If you fancy we can buy an ice-cream cone  
Your mate has gone  
She didn't want to be alone  
I will pounce on you  
Just us and the cuckoos  
You are helpless now  
Over and over we flatten the clover  
Shocked me too the things we used to do on grass  
It would shock you too the things we used to do on grass  
Grass, grass.  
Things we did on grass

Great fire burning  
You supplied the spark  
Fores burning spreading through the ark  
Animals are panicking  
I'm animal and panicking  
  
Your glance a match on the tinder wood  
You never spoke but I understood  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
[Chorus:]  
Great fire burning through  
Great fire burning through my house  
Great fire burning through my house and heart  
  
Great fire burning  
All because of you  
Fires burning spreading through the zoo  
Animals are panicking  
I'm animal and panicking  
  
No round of drinks can extinguish this  
Feeling of love and engulfing bliss  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been in love before  
But it's never been as hot as this  
Smoke curling round the door  
Memories of old loves crack and blister  
Mister fireman bet you couldn't put me out if you tried  
  
Your glance a match on the tinder wood  
You never spoke but I understood  
Bring water  
Eyes bring water  
  
[Chorus]

Please to bend down for the one called the Greenman  
He wants to make you his bride  
Please to bend down for the one called the Greenman  
Forever to him you're tied  
  
And you know for a million years he has been your lover  
He'll be a million more  
And you know for a million years he has been your lover  
Down through the skin to the core  
  
Heed the Greenman  
Heed the Greenman  
  
Please to dance round for the one called the Greenman  
He wants to make you his child  
Please to dance round for the one called the Greenman  
Dressed in the fruits of the wild  
  
And you know for a million years he has been your father  
He'll be a million more  
And you know for a million years he has been your father  
Run to his arms at the door  
  
Lay your head, lay your head, lay your head, lay your head on the Greenman  
Lay your head, lay your head with mine  
Lay your head, lay your head, lay your head, lay your head on the Greenman  
Build a bed out of oak and pine  
  
See the Greenman blow his kiss from high church wall  
And unknowing church will amplify his call  

When We're laying in bed  
And We're laying in love  
You and the blackness  
Fit me like a velvet glove  
That's why I go crazy  
When you flick on your lamp  
I'm dreaming  
  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
Hang on to the night  
I don't want to see  
That dawn light  
Burn your window  
  
When we're feeling drunk  
In a city park  
Put away that torch  
I'm changed in the dark

Have you got Miss Fortune, she's the daughter of rich parents,  
All she does is cry. One four-letter word is all she wants  
But you can't buy love so there's no supply.  
  
Will you take young Master Charge, the boy who's living well  
Beyond his father's means. (Happy families.) See his mother  
Kill herself with work to keep her dandy in the latest jeans.  
(Happy families.)  
  
Happy families is a kid's game. Happy families is your main  
Aim. It starts out with a dealing in the middle of the night,  
And ends up with a full house if you play your cards out  
Right. Mum says Dad is cheating, you should see the grown-ups  
Fight for happy families, the game that's sure to please.  
  
Have you got young Master Race the bigot son who, like his dad,  
Is fooled with fear. (Happy families.) Not so much a sun,  
More of a stormtrooper, to burn the books when Dad's not here.  
(Happy families.)  
  
Happy families is a kid's game. Happy families is your main  
Aim. You start out with your first cub and you think that  
Life's a song. You'll end up with a wolfpack if you lay your  
Cards out wrong. Dad says Mom is cheating, you can see the  
Children long for happy families, the game that's sure to please.  
  
Have you got Miss Carriage, she's the girl who wants a baby  
That she cannot find. (Happy families.) Strange, the ones  
Who want to win the race are usually the ones who fall behind.

See the flowers round the altar  
See the peaches in tins 'neath the headmaster's chair  
Harvest festival  
  
See the two who've been chosen  
See them walk hand in hand to the front of the hall  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
See the children with baskets  
See their hair cut like corn neatly combed in their rows  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs  
The longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
What a year when the exams and crops all failed  
Of course you passed but you were never seen again  
We all grew and we got screwed and cut and nailed  
Then out of nowhere invitation in gold pen  
  
See the flowers round the altar  
See that you too got married and I wish you well  
  
Harvest festival  
Harvest festival  
What was best of all was the  
Longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs  
The longing look you gave me  
That longing look  
More than enough to keep me fed all year  
  
Harvest festival

Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was stars,  
'Til you had a notion to leave,  
Beauty marks turned to scars,  
Bet you had a laugh up your sleeve.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love.  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
All is wrong like north gone south,  
There's a bad taste in my mouth.  
  
Everything was gold,  
'Til you thought you were above me,  
Soldier turns to rogue,  
Pretty turns to pretty ugly.  
  
Congratulations love, love, love, love,  
You made a fool of me and physics.  
  
And I'm feeling cheated,  
And I'm feeling used,  
And what's even worse is,  
You just look amused.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass,  
Since your hammer struck my heart,  
This world, a hell of trees and grass.  
Since your hammer struck my heart.  
  
Heaven is paved with broken glass.

Oh heli Oh heli  
I'm crouching here with a telescope in hand  
Looking across our lego land  
I really think it's about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think its about time that she came down  
  
And I object to all the air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
The air male that she pick up  
  
When she's up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter - copter  
She's landing on the town  
It's about time that I stopped her - stopped her  
When she's up there twirling round  
Just like a helicopter - copter  
Oh heli - Oh heli  
  
Now she's away from convent she's gone wild  
Grown from a nice young lady to a child  
I really think its about time that she came down  
She a laughing giggly whirlybird  
She got to be obscene to be obheard  
I really think it's about time that she came down

To vote for President Kill instead...

Hold me my daddy,  
I never felt lower than dirt on the floor.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
I never felt like crying oceans before.  
  
If this means war, why are we in it?  
Might've fired off a couple of rounds, I didn't mean to begin it.  
If these are the bullets that every father and son must chew,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
Hold me my daddy,  
It hurts me to see grown men fighting this way.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
The young and the old dog aren't having their day.  
  
This civil war, why are we in it?  
There's nobody on this flat earth, would ever want to win it.  
If these are the hot coals that every father and son walks through,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
And if you agree we can make amends.  
All this squabbling I've hated.  
In another time and another place where our history bends,  
We could've been the best of friends and not merely related.  
  
Well these are the right words to say,  
They're difficult but still true,  
Well then hold me my daddy,  
I forgot to say I love you.  
  
(Hold him. Tight. Hold him like he was a baby.)

Holly up on Poppy  
Canter never stop  
She has escaped from the world  
Where they bake beautiful girls  
Holly up on Poppy  
Trotting to the top  
She talks and banners unfurl  
Their secrets crayoned in swirls  
Everyday I  
Have to pluck up  
Courage to look her in the eyes  
The eyes of storms  
Anyway I  
Love to watch her  
Ride and play the alchemy  
That love performed  
Laughing  
Holly up on Poppy...  
Everytime I  
Look at my watch  
I'm reminded we are poor  
In hours per day  
Every second  
Spent with her  
's a bulging wallet overstuffed  
With angels pay  
Laughter!

An alchemy, human alchemy  
We stole them from their freedom to be sold  
To turn their skins of black into the skins  
Of brightest gold  
An alchemy, human alchemy  
  
We stoked the fires of trade with human coals  
And made our purses from the flailed skins of  
Purest souls  
An alchemy, human alchemy  
  
Other lands became a larder full of all the good things  
All we had to do was go and take  
Blood the colour rain that grew our wicked harvest  
Black the colour icing on our cake  
An alchemy, human alchemy  
  
We stole their babes and mothers, chiefs and braves  
Although we held the whip, you knew we were  
The real slaves  
To alchemy, human alchemy  
  
Alchemy, human alchemy

Humble Daisy  
Form a chain to hold all battleships in check  
Humble Daisy  
Knit a ladder down to nature's sunken wreck  
Ragged rug unbound  
Tangle trip the lovers  
Royal barge aground  
Brighter than all of the others on the window sill  
I'll sing about you if nobody else will  
Humble Daisy  
Cast the milk and coins of morning's cash about  
Humble Daisy  
I fell down to heaven as you picked me out  
We'll look up together  
Browsing through some old sky  
Sipping in the weather  
You've got me dizzy, the fly that climbed the sugar hill  
I'll lay upon you 'till somebody else will  
Humble Daisy  
We'll look up together

I am the audience  
There's no doubt, no consequence  
I could make the morning papers  
If I use my capers  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected, as the audience...  
  
Oh I...am the audience  
No doubt, no consequence  
Cause I'm the audience  
  
Let's be the audience  
I might lose my patience  
Polite applause excepted  
To the ones selected  
I am the audience  
Breakdown the pretence  
No longer be silent  
Let's turn to violence  
  
I am the audience

I bought myself a liarbird  
He came with free drinks just to blur  
The lies falling out like rain  
On an average English summer's afternoon  
  
I bought myself a new notebook  
Sharpened my guitar and went to look  
If this biz was just as bongo as the liarbird made out  
  
All he would say  
Is 'I can make you famous'  
All he would say  
All he would say  
'Just like a household name' is  
All he would say  
  
Methinks world is for you  
Made of what you believe  
If it's false or if it's true  
You can read it in your bible  
Or on the back of this record sleeve  
  
I bought myself a liarbird  
Things got more and more absurd  
It changed to a cuckoo  
And expanded filling up with all I gave  
  
I bought myself a big mistake  
He grew too greedy, bough will break  
And then we will find that liarbirds  
Are really flightless on their own  
  
All he would say  
Is 'I can make you famous'  
All he would say  
All he would say  
'Just like a household name' is  
All he would say  
  
Methinks world is for you  
There's no handing it back  
If it's false or it's true  
You can read it in your prayer book  
Or on the side of a cornflake pack  
  
I gave away a liarbird  
A couple less drinks and now I've heard  
The truth shining out like sun  
On an average English winter's afternoon

And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
  
I own this river, I own this town  
All of its climbers and its wino's sliding down  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
'Til the gutter shines like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
I've got all morning, I've got all year  
It's down in my pocket with the daylight folded there  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
Taken with rain  
How I'd wash her hair like the swirling sky  
Like the swirling sky  
  
And when I say I can't own her  
I don't mean to buy her  
It's nothing at all to do with money  
I simply want her in my arms forever more.  
Is that an odd request?  
Is that something so funny?  
  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
Yes there's more chance of that coming true  
  
But I can't own her and I never will  
No I can't own her and that's a bitter pill  
  
So I can't own her (Of all the things you've got the thing you want the most
is her)  
And I never will (And she's the one thing that you just can't have)  
No I can't own her (Of all the things you've got the thing you want the most
is her)  
And that's a bitter pill (And she's the one thing that you just can't have)  
  
Taken with rain  
Which I swallow down with the swirling sky  
With the swirling sky  
  
But I can't own her  
And I may as well wish for the moon in hand  
No I can't own her  
Yes there's more chance of that coming true

I'd like That if we could cycle down some lane  
I'd like that if we could ride into the rain  
No macs, getting wet  
I'd be your Albert if you'd be Victoria, hah hah  
We'd laugh because each drop would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower  
  
I'd like that  
  
I'd like that (What would you like?) if we could lay before my fire  
I'd like that (What would you like?) if you could slide me from this wire  
Toasting fork, I'll be done  
I wouldn't hector if you'd be Helen of Troy, oh boy  
We'd laugh because each flame would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower  
  
I'd Like that  
  
I'd smile so much my face would crack in two  
And you could fix it with your kissing glue  
I'd like that  
Yes, I'd like that  
  
I'd like that (what would you like?) if we could float away in bed  
I'd like that (what would you like?) if I could row your heart and head  
With you laid on one arm  
I'd be your Nelson if you'd be my Hamilton, what fun  
We'd laugh because each stroke would make me grow up  
Really high, really high like a really high thing  
Say, a sunflower (repeats)  
  
Say a sunflower I became  
I'd be growing in your lane

Ha Ha Ha  
Ho Ho Ho  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
Has no bones  
To hurt your throat  
Good and sweet  
Nice to eat  
If you like it  
Just repeat  
  
I'll set myself on fire  
I'll set myself on fire  
I'll set myself on fire  
Oh strike my hand  
On a stone Joan  
God knows this is yuk  
Do it all in unison  
Ha ha ha  
Ho ho ho  
  
We have the pool  
Ah - no that's cruel  
Why do you take me for  
A fool?  
Try the rails  
It's just not me  
No no no  
No - Siree

Well, would you want me, in your afternoons  
If I seduced ya, in your Mills and Boons  
Well, I'll be the master if you'll be the mate  
But don't you get those headaches  
In another life  
  
I'll bring your milk tray, from a parachute  
I'll play the Hollywood hunk, you can dye your roots  
Or I'll be your Burton if you'll be my Liz  
And there might be flying pigs  
In another life  
  
That's how we're built, love  
Don't let it wilt, love  
I'll take your flat feet  
Well, if you'll take my habits, it all works out in the end  
Ah, but in another life  
  
I'll be the stranger, in your horoscope  
The cheeky builder, calling with his quote  
Or maybe a Chippendale, on girls' night out  
Make mine the biggest pouch  
In another life  
  
That's how we're built, love  
Don't let it wilt, love  
I'll take your mood swings  
Well, if you'll take my hobbies, it all works out in the end  
Ah, but in another life  
  
Well, I'll be your Burton if you'll be my Liz  
There might be flying pigs  
In another life  
And you'd give up the cigs  
In another life  
And beer tastes good in tins  
Test matches we might win  
And your mother buys her gin

Boom goes my heart  
Dancing around your daisies  
Church bells will start  
Sat on you reading your ages  
I drift away  
In loving memory of a name  
  
Covered in moss  
You may have died for your country  
Forgotten not lost  
You're laid to rest where you're wanted  
I stare awhile  
In loving memory of a name  
  
England can never repay you  
You gave your life to be buried alongside  
The place you loved  
The sermons attended when you were young  
Still echo round these churchyard walls  
  
Heroes and rogues  
Together surrounded by nature  
Lump in my throat  
Sat in the land of your maker  
I drift away  
In loving memory of a name

It's snowing angels, on my front porch  
Take a broom and sweep one in  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I can't deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me one  
  
It's snowing angels  
By my window  
Take a net and fish one in  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though I got no money  
This bear won't be hibernating  
Or I'd miss the sight of all the honey strolling by  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me one  
  
I'm such a lucky guy, such a lucky guy  
Even though my shoes have broken  
I can't deny my toes  
The right to fresh air  
And the joy of poking through  
It's snowing angels  
Hope I'll catch me  
Hope I'll catch me  
Hope I'll catch me one

There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release  
  
Oh, my head is spinning like the world and it's filled with beasts I've seen,  
Let me put my bag down and I'll tell you it all right from the start,  
Like the scarlet woman who would pick on the boys she thought were green,  
And the two faced man who made a hobby of breaking his wife's heart.  
  
Seems the more I travel,  
From the foam to gravel,  
As the nets unravel,  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release  
  
I was in a land where men force women to hide their facial features,  
And here in the west it's just the same but they're using make-up veils.  
I've seen acts of every shade of terrible crime from man-like creatures,  
And I've had the breath of liars blowing me off course in my sails.  
  
Seems the more I travel,  
From the foam to gravel,  
As the nets unravel,  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.  
  
I have watched the manimals go by  
Buying shoes, buying sweets, buying knives.  
I have watched the manimals and cried  
Buying time, buying ends to other peoples lives.  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.

Scared of love, love and swimming pools  
Falling in you said was for fools  
  
But when you're standing on the edge  
You won't hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life you're dreaming through  
And there is no glue to hold you down, so go ahead and...  
Go ahead and jump  
  
Scared of love, love and aeroplanes  
Falling out I said takes no brains  
  
But if your flight is going rough  
Your soul will lead you to the nearest exit  
Jump, jump...  
While you're waiting  
Time is grinning  
Clocks and watches laughing at your indecision  
While you're waiting  
Worlds are spinning  
Find another heart and drive into collision  
Knowing this can you tell me you're...  
  
Scared of love, love and swimming pools  
Stubbornness, I say is for mules  
  
But if you're standing on the edge  
You won't hear me because your blood is singing  
  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to do  
This is real life you're dreaming through  
And there'll be no wake up  
Jump jump go ahead and jump jump  
If it's what your heart is wanting to say  
This is really your lucky day  
And there is no glue to hold you down, so go ahead and...  
Go ahead and jump

Everyone's creeping up to the money god,  
Putting tongues where they didn't ought to be.  
On stepping stones of human hearts and souls,  
Into the land of "nothing for free."  
  
Well the way that we're living,  
Is all take and no giving,  
There's nothing to believe in,  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,  
To be king for a day.  
  
Everyone's licking up to the new king pin,  
Trying to get way up with a smile.  
Sing for your supper boy and jump to a finger click,  
Ain't my way of living in style.  
  
Cause the ladder gets longer,  
And ambition gets stronger,  
I can't satisfy the hunger,  
That bad old moon has got you in its sway,  
To be king for a day.  
  
You're only here once so you got to get it right.  
(No time to fuss and fight.)  
Cause life don't mean much if measured out with someone else's plight.  
(In time you'll see the light.)  
  
Cause the way that we're living,  
Is all take and no giving,  
There's nothing to believe in,  
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way,  
To be king for a day.

Knights in shining karma  
Tend your flame  
And with love for armor  
They'll remain  
  
Ever by your bed  
Guarding, still sleeping  
Shield your soul from this rain  
Knights in shining karma will remain  
  
Jealous winter sun...  
Cold as vichyssoise  
Steals your smile for fuel  
They'll ignite with braziers  
Of warming stars  
  
Knights in shining karma  
Wash your feet  
And with spotless dharma come complete  
  
Ever by your sink drying  
Up tea tears  
Shield your soul from this heat  
Knights in shining karma come complete  
  
Swollen summer moon  
Hot as boiling air  
Poach your dreams to ash  
They'll bring sips from restful slumbers  
Cooling keg  
  
Jealous winter sun

She's a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her huge eyes  
And streams of diamonds shoot out  
'Til we're wading waist deep in her brilliant love  
  
She's a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her red mouth  
And gold word ribbons rope and rodeo  
The dark clouds in bouquet above  
  
For how long will this dark age last?  
For how long must we wait to learn?  
Across the black and fossil ocean vast  
I spy love and she doth brightly burn  
Love sure lives in the right house  
  
She's a little lighthouse when she  
Opens up her huge mind and  
Thoughts descending spears of crystal  
Build a Jacob's ladder up to love  
  
She's a little lighthouse  
When she opens up her red dress  
Show skin of rubber marble  
Lit by knowledge and the fireflies above  
  
And can others see this splendid beam?  
Or do they navigate in dark?  
If you ever want to dock your dream  
Well you'll need love to guide your fragile ark  
  
Love sure keeps a bright house  
She's a little lighthouse

Living through another Cuba  
It's 1961 again and we are piggy in the middle  
While war is polishing his drum and peace plays second fiddle  
  
Russia and America are at each other's throats  
But don't you cry  
Just on your knees and pray, and while you're  
Down there, kiss your arse goodbye  
  
We're the bulldog on the fence  
While others play their tennis overhead  
It's hardly love all and somebody might  
Wind up red or dead  
Pour some oil on the water quick  
It doesn't really matter where from  
He love me, he loves me not  
He's pulling fins from an atom bomb  
  
This phenomenon happens every twenty years or so  
If they're not careful your watch won't be the  
Only thing with a radioactive glow  
I'll stick my fingers in my ears  
And hope they make it up before too late  
If we get through this lot alright  
They're due for replay, 1998

See the lovers all gone crazy  
Looking for romance it seems  
Many sleepless nights will follow  
Some may lose but some succeed  
  
Love at first sight  
What they want is...  
Love at first sight  
  
Make a play of lust intention  
Only just one thing in mind  
Make a slip could be forever  
Wedding bells, the shotgun kind  
  
Love at first sight  
What they want is...  
Love at first sight  
  
Mouse takes the bait  
So soon as he leaves his seat  
There's no escape, very soon their eyes will meet  
  
Love at first sight etc.  
  
Take your partner to surrender  
Then your misdemeanor's done  
Sacrifice of maidenhood  
But little boys must have their fun  
  
Love at first sight.

High climbs the summer sun  
High stands the corn  
And tonight when my work is done  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in  
Shilling for the fellow who milks the herd  
Shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping  
How can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?  
  
Deep under winter snow  
Deep lay the lambs  
And tonight by the full moon's glow  
Flask of wine on my feather bedding  
We will drink and prepare for wedding  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People think that I'm no good  
Painting pictures carving wood  
Be a rich man if I could  
But the only job I do well is here on the farm  
On the farm  
And it's breaking my back  
  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]

Nigel just needs this helping hand  
We're only making plans for Nigel  
He has his future in a British steel  
We're only making plans for Nigel

Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are pulling kites and pushing tress  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Me and the wind are feeling freer than air should ever be  
Should ever be should ever be should ever  
  
And when you lured me into your syrup  
All I could think of was what a lovely way for me to go  
I never really realised that  
  
Just like the struggling summer flies that  
I was drowning no matter how sweet or how slow  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you cracked the whip  
While you cracked the whip  
  
I danced imprisoned in your drumbeat  
Your tune of spring had me whirling like a mad march  
Merry hare  
It never really came to mind that  
  
The strings of your instrument were strangling me  
Inside their snare  
  
Have I been such a fool  
Have I been sitting on your stool  
While you held the hoop  
While you held the hoop  
  
Now that I'm out and I'm shouting in doorways  
Freed from a love more like murder  
I should be singing but in liberation  
Feel like a ship with no rudder  
  
Me and the wind are celebrating your loss  
Have I been such a fool

Programmes of violence,  
As entertainment,  
Brings the disease into your room.  
We know the germ,  
Which is man-made in metal,  
Is really a key to your own tomb.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
Children will want them,  
Mothers supply them,  
As long as your killers are heroes.  
And all the media  
Will fiddle while Rome burns,  
Acting like modern-time Neros.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
I'm speaking to the Justice League of America.  
The you S of A,  
Hey you,  
Yes you in particular!  
When it comes to the judgement day and you're standing at the gates with your
weaponry,  
You dead go down on one knee,  
Clasp your hands in prayer and start quoting me,  
'cause we say...  
Our father we've managed to contain the epidemic in one place, now,  
Let's hope they shoot themselves instead of others,  
Help to civilize the race now.  
We've trapped the cause of the plague,  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
If we listen quietly we can hear them shooting from grave to grave.  
You ought to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.

Higher.  
  
I'm a king, yes, I'm a head of state.  
But I'm the kitchen boy who'll wash your dirty plate.  
I had no message and the message was,  
We're all Jesus, Buddha, and the Wizard of Oz.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll be lifting humanity higher.  
Higher.  
  
I'm all religious figures rolled into one,  
Gaddafy Duck propelled from Jimmy Swaggart's tommy gun.  
Don't promise rainbows with some golden pot,  
In fact what I can offer I know you've already got.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.  
Higher!  
  
And you know it's true.  
We should chase superstition and fear from our hearts,  
If we're going to survive and take levels of sanity higher.  
Kick it up...higher.  
  
I'm merely a man,  
And I bring nothing but love for you.  
I'm merely a man,  
And I want nothing that you can't do.  
  
And you know it's true.  
That with logic and love we'll have power enough,  
To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher.

From pools of xylophone clear  
From caves of memory  
I saw the children at heart  
That we once used to be  
Borne on foaming seahorse herd  
Compose with trumpeting shell  
From lines across their hands  
A song as new as new moon  
As old as all the sands  
Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild  
Lost that child 'til mermaid  
Smiled  
  
Summoned by drum rolling surf  
As laughing fish compel  
The young boy woken in me  
By clanging diving bell  
Breakers pillow fight the shore  
She wriggles free in the tide  
I'm locked in adult land  
Back in the mirror she slides  
Waving with comb in hand  
I was lucky to remain beguiled  
Grown to child since mermaid  
Smiled

I'm twelve o'clock,  
All daylight hours,  
I'll warm your bed,  
I'll grow your flowers.  
Like I'm a miniature sun.  
This ball ignited when she told me I was her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I'm king up here like a miniature sun.  
  
No life comes close,  
I'm rising higher,  
On holiday,  
On ball of fire,  
You made a miniature sun.  
There's no more shadows in this world she says I'm her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I radiate like a miniature sun.  
  
Now everything looks right today,  
A billion watts of bright today.  
And I'm a blazing kite today.  
I think I'll float around her house,  
And tell her exactly how she makes me glow.  
But then the other man leaving merely doffs his hat,  
And I'm the last to know.  
  
Now everything looks wrong today.  
An out of tune sung song today.  
I've grown from big King Kong today,  
Right down to miniature...  
  
Don't come too close,  
I'll burn your arm,  
I'll bleach your hair,  
Dustbowl your farm,  
I'll blind your eyes,  
You blinded mine,  
I'll spin with rage,  
All summertime,  
You made a miniature sun.  
Just take a look up in the nightsky, I'm not the only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that vain little boy that I was.  
I'm all to blame now,  
Look out below here I come!  
  
Man crashing down like a miniature sun

(Colin Moulding)  
  
Fine art never moved my soul  
No vintage wine designer clothes  
But my world shakes for me  
My bird sings sweetly  
A different kind of tinsel  
Decorates my tree  
Yes my bird performs  
A thousand Cheshire cats  
Grin inside of me  
Yes my bird performs  
There she goes  
Shakespeare's sonnets leave me cold  
The drama stage and the high brow prose  
But my world shakes for me  
My bird sings sweetly  
The brightest fireworks  
Are lighting up my sky  
Yes my bird performs  
The cage is open  
But she's no desire to fly  
'Cause my bird performs  
There she goes  
And you keep saying what you got  
You keep saying what you got  
Look out!

All of Paris giggles with flags  
Laughing lions leap up from the page  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
Barcelona, nuclear festive, wire women  
  
Wriggle from life's cage  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks like it's all a party  
Packed with my paint heroes  
  
Like it's all a party  
Packed with Rousseau  
Miro, Miro, on my wall  
I love you the most of all  
In Port Lligat, liked his Gala  
Waxed antenna, brushes up a storm  
  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
Catalonia's atom caveman  
  
Cracks his whipline tipped in purest form  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks good from where you paint from  
My the world looks good from where you are  
My the world looks like it's all a party  
  
Packed with my paint heroes  
Like it's all a party  
Packed with Dali  
Miro, Miro, on my wall  
I love you the most of all

I dunno wot she got  
I dunno wot she got  
I dunno what she got but it seems to have a grip upon me  
No telling where she learn the things she do to me  
And I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her  
  
(wanna) take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
Take it out on her  
With my weapon  
  
She's so exacting that she tells me when I go wrong  
She doesn't value the attention she receives  
She says I'm taking all the time but I'm not returning  
(that's right)  
  
'Do this' but she won't do that  
Lying beside me like a parcel of fat  
Hot love - cold sweat - feel her beneath me want to crush her to death  
She tries to justify the people who despise me  
She puts her finger on things she knows will hurt  
And I can't defend myself till we turn the lights off then  
  
I dunno wot she got - my weapon  
My stinking weapon

Hey - what you going to do now  
You're standing there and wondering how  
You've got to make some noise  
Just like one of the girls  
Or even one of the boys  
  
When you do it  
It ain't no disgrace  
I can see it written all across your face  
Neon shuffle and shuffle into outer dpace  
I said - neon shuffle is a dance for the human race  
I said - neon shuffle is gonna pull you outta your place  
  
You - you put your hands together  
Better make up a storm  
Or some electricky weather  
Now that the power's stop  
Can you click your heels  
Can you finger pop  
  
Neon shuffle  
  
Neon shuffle it's going to do it to me  
Neon shuffle it's going to do it to you  
Neon shuffle it's going to do it with red  
Neon shuffle it's going to do it with blue  
Neon shuffle it's going to run you right through  
Neon shuffle with a stick of bamboo

We need a new broom  
To sweep it all clean  
We need a beat boom  
We need a new scheme  
Break all the deadlocks  
And spill all the beer  
Mr Ditko was right  
Mr A so near  
Break out the paints and the brushes  
And spill out your hearts  
No amount of soft soap  
Can ever give you a fresh start  
We are walking on a tight rope  
We can slip beyond religion  
The answer's in your cranium  
And not on independent television

There is no language in our lungs  
To tell the world just how we feel  
No bridge of thought  
No mental link  
No letting out just what you think  
There is no language in our lungs  
There is no muscle in our tongues  
To tell the world what's in our hearts  
No, we're leaving nothing  
Just chiseled stones  
No chance to speak before we're bones  
There is no muscle in our tongues  
I thought I had the whole world in my mouth  
I thought I could say what I wanted to say  
For a second that thought became a sword in my hand  
I could slay any problem that would stand in my way  
I felt just like a crusader  
Lion-heart, a Holy Land invader  
But nobody can say what they really mean to say, and  
The impotency of speech came up and hit me that day, and  
I would have made this instrumental  
But the words got in the way  
There is no language in our...  
There is no language in our lungs  
To tell the world what's in our hearts  
No, we're leaving nothing behind  
Just chiseled stones  
No chance to speak before we're bones  
There is no language in our lungs

Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old (eight years old)  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say?  
That when you work you're still at play (still at play)  
Oh Officer Blue  
I really love the things you do  
It's magical  
People in a human zoo  
Officer Blue  
Cast a shadow on the wall  
But by torchlight even mice look tall (they don't fall)  
Officer Blue  
In a blaze of human form  
And your stripes and badges to conform (you conform)  
Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old (eight years old)  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say?  
That when you work you're still at play (still you play)

I got so much to say  
But I'm afraid it'll come out wrong.  
I'm not akin to the Eighties thing,  
Where you look after number one.  
  
But I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm scared what might happen.  
I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm one of the millions.  
Who never seem to do anything.  
(He never seems to do anything.)  
I never seem to do anything.  
(He never seems to do anything.)  
  
And everytime I get the urge,  
To strike out on my own,  
Insecurity wraps me up,  
It's cold outside the fold.  
  
So I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm scared what might happen.  
I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm the man who merely threatens.  
Who's always saying what he's gonna do.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
I'm always saying what I'm gonna do.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
  
I'm running steady,  
Oh so steady.  
So safe and sound,  
I could drown.  
  
I've had my fill of living,  
In my cosy armchair land,  
But all my schemes come to a humiliating end.  
  
So I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm scared what might happen.  
I won't rock the boat,  
Cause I'm one of the millions,  
Who's always saying what he's gonna do.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
I'm always saying what I'm gonna do.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
No I won't rock no boats.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
Kiss goodbye to my hopes.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
I won't rock no boats.  
(He's always saying what he's gonna do.)  
Life is easy when you're being kept afloat.  
I won't rock no boats.

She has six swans singing in her sauna  
So she can't hear what's going on  
No she can't hear what's going on  
In the outside world  
In the outside world  
In the outside  
Bad black and white men  
Standing in their pigpen  
Selling guns to simpletons  
To shoot 'em in the abdomen  
And she's not interested in that  
And she's not interested in that  
She has six swans singing in her sauna  
Outside - world - outside  
  
She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside  
So she can't hear what's going on  
No she can't hear what's going on  
In the outside world  
In the outside world  
In the outside  
Bad brown and yellow men  
Splitting on their fellow men  
Drape her in a newspaper  
And stab her with a poison pen  
She's not interested in that  
She's not interested in that  
She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside  
Outside - world - outside  
  
You can keep your animals  
All the noise and the din  
Just make a little space for me  
I'm coming in

Poor skeleton steps out,  
Dressed up in bad blood,  
Bad brains, bad thoughts, and others deeds.  
  
Poor skeleton no doubt,  
One of these days,  
You can cast aside your human, be free.  
  
When the cities run with blood,  
And you drink our health in mud,  
"All flesh be gone."  
Save your dry and joyous shout,  
For the day poor skeleton steps out.  
  
Poor skeleton steps out,  
Sprung from his life sentence,  
Deep inside some muscle mask.  
  
Poor skeleton devout,  
Propping up truck drivers,  
Filmstars, thieves or queens, your brave task.  
  
When technology is rust,  
And you write your book in dust,  
"All flesh be gone."  
  
Can't buy tickets from a tout,  
For the day poor skeleton steps out.  
  
Poor skeleton steps out,  
Liberated from sex organs,  
And brown, black, white skin.  
  
Poor skeleton you lout,  
Don't you think that we might,  
Like to have been asked to join in?  
  
For good skeletons are we,  
And we're dying to be free,  
"All flesh be gone."  
  
I will scream or sulk and pout,  
Until my poor skeleton steps out.  
  
Better watch out, here comes bony boy.

Pulsing pulsing,  
There's a beat in his arm still.  
Pulsing pulsing,  
Like the throb of an anthill.  
Pulsing pulsing,  
No death in the rain.  
I've been washing my hands,  
In the stuff I wash my brains.  
I'm pulsing.  
You're pulsing.  
Who's pulsing?.  
What's pulsing?.  
Pulsing pulsing,  
There's a lump in his throat still.  
Pulsing pulsing,  
At the site of a crash throw.  
Pulsing pulsing,  
No push in the vein.  
I've been washing my hands,  
In the stuff I wash my brains.

Gather 'round!  
Punch and Judy,  
Did it truly,  
And were married in a haste,  
In love, maybe,  
Using the baby,  
As a kind of romance paste,  
She's grown fatter,  
Her hair cut shorter,  
Looks much older than nineteen,  
He's a drinker,  
Not a thinker,  
Baby spoiled his could-have-been.  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
'Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy.  
Punch and Judy,  
In a semi,  
On a brand new council plot,  
Sunday lunchtime,  
Beer-for-Punch time,  
While his dinner's far from hot,  
She grows tired,  
Cab is hired,  
She goes round to see her friend,  
He comes back late,  
Fool is irate,  
We will see his temper bend.  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy,  
In a quandary,  
She's walked out, and he is mad.  
Now he's grown up,  
Can't smash home up,  
Retribution must be had.  
Punch and Judy,  
Had a baby,  
Who brought them to married bliss.  
Mr Punch,,  
Has drunken hunch,  
That he must punish kid for this  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
This must be make-believe,  
'Cause who do we know, dear, who acts like that?  
Punch and Judy

Did you think you knew the game?  
Did you think that fame and fortune's  
All that I had in my head?  
Bang you're dead  
It's not a game I'm gonna play with you  
  
Did you think I'm high and dry?  
Did you think I'd hide from the  
Tentacles of the deaf dumb and blind  
Their poison inks behind me  
At the bottom of the sea  
And your criticism doesn't worry me  
And I'll sing  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Get out  
Did you think you'd tie me up  
Did you think that I would  
Help but dance for your piece of paper  
They'll tame you and set you  
To licking all the foes  
Zap! pow!  
  
Did you think that I don't feel  
Did you think that I'd simply heal up  
After each ego beating  
We can't go on meeting  
This once in every year  
And in the meantime if we all stand up  
And cheer him up here  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
They all took their money out  
And they laid it down, down  
On the bright colored manes  
They all took their money out  
But they laid it down, down  
On the different names to ours  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact that  
No one bet him  
  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Ride on over all remorse  
Ra ra for red rocking horse  
Who won the course  
Despite the fact

There's a message up in China  
That they getting in Japan  
Bouncing off an ocean liner  
Make em shake em in Siam  
All the kids are complaining  
That there's nowhere to go  
All the kids are complaining  
That the songs are too slow  
All I'm saying is you're deaf  
To the fact that there's...  
Radios in motion  
Atmosphere to ocean  
Radios in motion  
Gets you out of your red white and blues  
When we move then so do you'se  
There's a message in Milwaukee  
That they're getting in Moscow  
Everybody walkie talkie  
Everybody learning how  
All the kids are complaining (etc...)

In this secret time, invading on our privacy  
Unknowing we mime, we play for the ministry  
The can film you in bed  
Or when you take a bath  
They can tape every cry  
They can tape every laugh  
They can turn you around so you won't know what's  
  
Real by reel  
Busy little bees recording everything you feel  
On real by reel  
Documented down like rats  
They're catching up on every squeal  
On real by reel  
Real by reel by real by  
  
In this hidden time, ignorance may help you to cope  
Rehearsing for crimes, and sex just in government cinemascope  
The can film you at work  
Or when they let you play  
They can tape what you think  
They can tape what you say  
They can't blur your I.D. so you won't know what's  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Knowing that your lenses peep  
Now I eat my daily bread  
And into the tape spool I'll be fed

You better watch your tape boys  
It's the tint that angers the beast  
Got their sails in the sunset  
They've already got the east  
  
Red red red  
Don't you let them make you  
Don't let them make you see...red  
  
You better watch your lead boys  
It's already in your veins  
Did you ever see the colour  
Iron turns when it rains  
  
It's not a gross infatuation  
It's not a fear, it's not a crush  
It's not any special nation  
But even now they make me blush

Red brick dream  
Windows scream  
As the rusting north star shines above  
And drops it's iron beams  
Crashing down upon the rooves of swindon town  
  
I heard the engine's dying breath  
Castles and kings all starved to death  
I dropped the coronation cup  
Sshh, please don't wake them up from  
Red brick dream  
  
Red brick dream  
Buttons gleam  
By the light of the furnace pouring  
Molten memories  
Splashing down upon the rooves of swindon town  
  
The men of muscle piston rods  
Who forged the horses of the gods  
The made the town a set of chains  
And sleeping it remains in  
Red brick dream

Reign of blows  
Reign of blows  
Reign of blows cascading down upon your shoulders  
Far too many men dressed up as soldiers  
The lamb is brought to the ground  
Under the weight of the Crown  
A crown of thorns and dark deeds  
The swastika and the hammer and symbol  
Are sickles that reap only weeds  
  
Reign of blows  
Reign of blows  
Reign of blows precedes a storm of revolution  
People have no place in their solution  
So torture raises its head  
Decked out in blue, white, and red  
And iron maidens will slam  
And by the half light of burning republics  
Joe Stalin looks just like Uncle Sam  
  
Reign of blows  
Reign of blows  
Reign of blows has washed away the corpse of Abel,  
Cain is now the king in every Babel  
I just don't care who you are  
When death draws up in his car  
And talks in terrorist tones  
Remember violence is only a vote for the  
Black Queen to take back the throne  
  
Reign of blows

It's in the order of their hedgerows  
It's in the way their curtains open and close  
It's in the look they give you down their nose  
All part of decency's jigsaw I suppose  
  
Heard the neighbor slam his car door  
Don't he realize this is respectable street  
What d'you think he bought that car for  
Cause he realize this is respectable street  
  
Now they talk about abortion  
In cosmopolitan proportions to their daughters  
As they speak of contraception  
And immaculate receptions on their portable  
Sony entertainment centers.  
  
Now she speaks about diseases  
And which sex position pleases best her old man  
Avon lady fills the creases  
When she manages to squeeze in past the caravans  
That never move from their front gardens.  
  
It's in the order of their hedgerows  
It's in the way their curtains open and close  
It's in the look they give you down their nose  
All part of decency's jigsaw I suppose  
Sunday church and they look fetching  
Saturday night saw him retching over our fence  
Bang the wall for me to turn down  
I can see them with their stern frown  
As they dispense the kind of look that says  
They're perfect.

Hey!  
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus  
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus  
Take a packet of seeds  
Take yourself out to play  
I want to see River of Orchids where we had a motorway  
  
Push your car from the road  
Push your car from the road  
  
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle  
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle  
It's all in your back yard  
You've the whole world at your feet  
I said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete  
  
Push your car from the road  
Push your car from the road  
  
River of Orchids winding our way  
Want to walk into London on my hands one day  
River of Orchids the road overgrows  
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham beggar rose  
  
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle  
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle  
It's all in your back yard  
You've the whole world at your feet  
I said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete  
  
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil  
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil  
Take a packet of seeds  
Get yourself out to play  
I want to see River of Orchids where we had a motorway  
  
Push your car  
It's all in your back yard  
Push your car  
Take a packet of seeds  
  
River of Orchids winding my way  
Want to walk into London on my hands one day  
River of Orchids the road overgrows  
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose  
River of Orchids  
I heard the Dandelions  
River of Orchids  
Just like a mad dog  
River of Orchids  
I had a dream  
River of Orchids  
I heard the Dandelions

Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways,  
(Please come home)  
Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways  
(Please come home)  
  
Daddy hit you in a temper,  
But he's sorry now,  
(Please come home)  
Just a quarrel had with mummy,  
Just a family row  
(Please come home)  
  
You caught mum chasing dad with a knife,  
(Don't cry, don't cry)  
You ran away to escape from the fights,  
(Don't cry, don't cry)  
Now you're lost in a maze of neon light,  
And she's worried,  
He's worried  
She's worried, oh...  
  
Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways,  
(Please come home)  
Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways  
(Please come home)  
  
Pacing street-lamps on the highway,  
Haystack for your bed  
(Please come home)  
In the morning we will find you,  
In papers to be read  
(Please come home)  
  
You heard screams from  
The warmth of your bed  
(Don't cry, don't cry)  
You slumbered on without being fed  
(Don't cry, don't cry)  
Now there's no more tears to be shed,  
And she's sorry,  
He's sorry,  
He's sorry, oh...  
  
Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways,  
(Please come home)  
Oh run-a, oh run-a, oh runaways

Fire they cried  
So evil must die  
And yields are good  
So men pull back hoods and smile  
The scapegoat blood spilled  
Spittled and grilled it crackled and spat  
And children grew fat on the meat  
Change must be earned  
Sacrificial bonfire must burn  
Burn up the old  
Ring in the new, burn up the old, ring in the new  
Assembled on high  
Silhouette against the sky  
The smoke prayed and pranced  
And sparks did their dance in the wind  
Disguises wore thin with less and less skin  
And the clothes that were draped  
Was all that told man from ape  
Change must be earned  
Sacrificial bonfire must reign  
Reign over good  
Banish the bad, reign over good, banish the bad

Hope you enjoyed your flight,  
In one of our new straw aeroplanes,  
You'll find things here are just like what you're used to.  
There's lots of waste and razor wire,  
And no one gives a damn about the land,  
We just stand around and stare like you folks do.  
  
For we ain't got no brains,  
And we ain't got no hearts,  
It's just that wild old wind that tears us all apart.  
We're the scarecrow people,  
Have we got lots in common with you.  
And if you don't start living well,  
You're all gonna wind up scarecrow people too.  
  
Hope you enjoyed your meal,  
It's only gas and chemicals,  
We thought that you'd prefer something not nature made.  
Now while you're here can you advise us,  
On a war we'd like to start,  
Against some scarecrows over there, a different shade?  
  
For we ain't got no brains,  
And we ain't got no hearts,  
It's just that wild old wind that tears us all apart.  
We're the scarecrow people,  
Have we got lots in common with you.  
And if you don't start living well,  
You're all gonna wind up scarecrow people too.  
  
We don't have no tears here,  
No one hopes or cares or fears here,  
For the old, the sick, the poor and them what taint you.  
We thought we'd base our civilization upon yours,  
'Cause you're the smartest animals on earth, now ain't you?  
  
We don't have no love here,  
There's no need to rise above here,  
No one wants to write a book or try to paint thee.  
We thought we'd base our civilization upon yours,  
'Cause we're all dead from our necks up, now ain't we?  
  
And we ain't got no brains,  
And we ain't got no hearts,  
It's just that wild old wind that tears us all apart.  
We're the scarecrow people,  
Have we got lots in common with you.  
And if you don't start living well,  
You're all gonna wind up scarecrow people too.  
  
And I ain't got no brains,  
And I ain't got no heart,  
It's just them other humans tear my soul apart.  
I'm a scarecrow person,  
Have I got quite some message for you.  
For if we don't start learning well,  
we're all gonna wind up scarecrow people too!

I look out of my window at night  
I see the stars and I'm filled with fright  
I got a feeling someone's looking  
It ain't the aliens at the foot of my bed  
It's more the ale inside my head  
I got a feeling something's cooking  
Science friction burns my fingers  
Electricity still lingers  
Hey put away that ray, how do you martians say  
I love you  
I read my comics from front to back  
I'll be ready for any attack  
I got a feeling someone's looking

Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man,  
Putting end to evil doers games.  
Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man,  
Maybe you are in his book of names.  
Maybe you are in his book of names.  
  
So be kind and helpful to your mother,  
Just think twice before you try and steal.  
When he cuts with sticky silver snippers,  
You may find that some wounds never heal.  
  
All self made bad boys,  
If you refuse to believe he exist,  
You won't be frightened when you find out,  
You're on his list.  
You're on his list.  
You're on his list.  
  
So be good and never poison people,  
Just think twice before the deed is done.  
When you wake up guilty in the morning,  
You may find important pieces gone.

It's raining on the beach  
She inches close but out of reach  
The waves look painted on  
Seagulls screaming  
  
The sea is warship grey  
It whispers 'Fool!' then slides away  
Black coastline slumbers on  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
  
And all the flags that flap on the pier  
Spell why on earth do you want  
The fog hides much but one thing is clear  
She's nearer  
  
Dead deck chairs under shrouds  
And life belts gape like minstrel mouths  
Her hair still smells of salt  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her  
He who hesitates is lost  
  
If you want her, you should tell her  
Take her by the hand If you hesitate  
If you wait, November wins her November will win her  
She returns to sand So get ahold of the girl  
  
I say I like your coat  
Her thank-you tugs my heart afloat  
I nearly didn't hear for  
Seagulls screaming kiss her, kiss her  
  
He who hesitates is lost

Hey hey,the clouds are whey,  
There's straw for the donkeys  
And the innocents can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely.  
  
My my, sun is pie  
There's fodder for the cannons  
And the guilty ones can all sleep safely  
All sleep safely.  
  
And all the world is football shaped,  
It's just for me to kick in space  
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste  
And I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and  
The church bells softly chime...  
  
Hey hey, night fights day,  
There's food for the thinkers  
And the innocents can all live slowly  
All live slowly  
My, my the sky will cry  
Jewels for the thirsty and the guilty ones can  
All die slowly all die slowly.  
And all the world is biscuit shaped,  
It's just for me to feed my face  
And I can see,hear, smell, touch, taste  
And I've got one, two,three, four, five sense working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...  
  
And birds might fall from black skies  
And bullies might give you black eyes  
And buses might skid on black ice  
But to me it's very very beautiful (England's glory!)  
Beautiful (a striking beauty!)  
And all the world is football - shaped,  
It's just for me to kick in space  
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste -  
And I've got one,two,three,four,five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one,two,three, four,five senses working overtime  
Try to tell the difference 'tween the goods and crimes,  
Dirt or treasure and there's  
One, two, three, four,five senses working overtime  
Trying to take this all in,  
I've got one, two, three, four, five senses working overtime  
Trying to taste the difference 'tween the lemons and limes  
The pain and the pleasure and the church bells softly chime...

Here he come again  
Dress in all that skin  
Like he was still human being  
  
Look at he long ears  
And he big brown eyes  
And with them truth he is seeing  
  
Isn't it a shame you kicked that girl  
Isn't it a shame she kicked you back, jackass  
  
She really shake you donkey up  
She really make you donkey up  
She really shake you donkey up, quite a packet  
  
How she carry you  
Over thick and thin ice  
You still dug you spurs in  
Now you forced to walk  
Laden down with shame  
It's not just you back that's hurting  
  
Now children saddle him for riding  
Pick a fight with love and she will  
Tan your hide in  
  
She really shake you donkey up  
She really shake you donkey up  
  
Shake you donkey!

Awful plastic boots that come above her ankle  
Dayglo mini skirts just like a pop art spangle  
Digs vanilla fudge buys lipstick by the pound  
Gets that 'English' look resembles Kath McGowan  
Have you seen her hair it's a style from heaven  
Ah! she's nowhere she thinking this is 1967?  
She's so square she's nowhere  
She's so square she's nowhere  
Take her to a disco and screaming Lord Sutch it!  
Everyone must look but nobody must touch  
What about her car? E type is the latest  
How about the Yardbirds? Jeff Beck is the greatest!!  
Have you seen her hair it's a style from heaven  
Ah! she's nowhere she thinking this is 1967?  
She's so square  
She's nowhere  
She's so square  
She's nowhere

I'm living in my smokeless zone  
My house is not a happy home  
I got to do something 'for I kick the bucket  
I'm living in this smokeless zone  
  
I clean my dusty window sills  
Everything I grow it kills  
I don't want to stay in this street any longer  
Living in this smokeless zone  
  
Englands green, once so pleasant land  
Living on a time bomb yeah  
The whole damn place is going to turn to sand  
Bah bah  
  
I cough upon my wheezy chest  
My penicillin does its best  
There's only one cure for an unhealthy body  
Get out of this smokeless zone

In my heart, in my heart  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
I've got some lovely in my head, in my head  
Where the lions, wear the right eye,  
Where the jems [unverified] roar, there be lovely  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my bed, in my bed  
Where the ocean wears the shore down  
Where's the on switch?  
There be lovely laying waiting naked for you  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar

In my yard, in my yard  
There be inchworm, there be footlong  
There be yardstick stir, some lovely  
Laying waiting naked for you  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my field, in my field  
There be green grass, there be big sky  
There be blue birds come and nest there

We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
We can play every day  
We can play at being lovers  
We can play every day  
We can play on my brown guitar  
  
You want some lovely, I got some lovely  
In my heart, in my heart for you

I'm like a spinning top  
Going round and around  
Well I don't know what's up  
And I sure don't know what's down  
Now watch me - I'm like a spinning top  
Can't tell day from night  
Well I don't know what's wrong  
And I sure don't know what's right  
Now watch me  
  
It started when I heard your song of love  
Pouring down like honey from above  
I started to spin  
I started to move  
Just like a needle  
That's sticking in the same old groove  
  
I'm like a spinning top  
  
I like it so much I'm never going to stop

I'm standing, standing in for Joe  
  
Joe called round to ask me, Would I do a favor?  
While he's gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company, she gets so restless  
Would I keep her safe and sound?  
  
Softly, softly in the night  
Why, you can guess the rest...  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
I'm standing - in for Joe  
  
Joe said we've been friends so long  
That I would be the one he would trust with his life  
And now those words roll 'round my brain  
As darkness falls, as I turn out his bedroom light  
  
Who could resist her tender charms?  
So the story goes...  
This actor he plays all the parts  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
I'm standing - in for Joe  
  
Love is like a river,  
You cannot stop its flow... Mmm hmm  
  
Joe called round to ask me, Would I do a favor?  
While he's gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company, she gets so restless  
Would I check that she's safe and sound?  
  
Softly, softly in the night  
Why, you can guess the rest...  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
Standing in for Joe  
  
I'm standing in for Joe - Oh yeah  
I'm standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
  
Standing in for Joe - Just standing in for Joe, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Until he gets back home, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her insane, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her safe and sound, yeah  
  
Standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Almost full time, which is nice, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Because she gets so restless  
Standing in for Joe - Always so restless  
  
Standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her safe and sound, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - I'm standing in for Joe, yeah...

The first time I saw you standing in the water  
You must have been all of a thousand feet tall  
Nearly naked - unashamed like Herod's daughter  
Your love was so big  
It made New York look small  
  
You've been the subject of so many dreams  
Since I climbed your torso  
Oh!  
My Statue of Liberty  
Boo boo  
Impaled on your hair  
What do you do  
Do do to me  
Boo boo  
  
I leaned right over to kiss your stony book  
A little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt  
A billion lovers with their cameras  
Snap to look and in my fantasy  
I sail beneath your skirt

I'm stupidly happy  
Everything's fine  
I'm stupidly happy  
My heart pumping wine  
I'm stupidly happy  
With idiot grin  
I'm stupidly happy  
You won't catch me in  
  
All the birds of the air call your name as they land on my kitchen roof  
All the fish in the sea do the same if you need extra proof  
  
I'm stupidly happy  
My vision is skewed  
I'm stupidly happy  
I'm coming unscrewed  
  
And if the Devil walks up dressed in any disguise  
I take him by the collars look him in the eye  
I'm stupidly happy  
Now you're my defense  
I'm stupidly happy  
It's all making sense  
  
I'm stupidly happy  
I roll like a train  
I'm stupidly happy  
With you in my brain  
  
All the lights of the cars in the town form the strings of a big guitar  
I'm a giant to play you a tune for wherever you are  
I'm stupidly happy  
Are the words to that song,  
I'm stupidly happy  
And nothing is wrong  
And should the Devil walk up with his business card out  
I'll tear it to confetti with a grin and shout,  
"I'm stupidly happy"  
All of the time  
I'm stupidly happy  
Now you're mine

Drowning here in summer's cauldron  
Under mats of flower lava  
Please don't pull me out this is how I would want to go  
Breathing in the boiling butter  
Fruit of sweating golden Inca  
Please don't heed my shout  
I'll relax in the undertow  
  
When Miss Moon lays down  
And Sir Sun stands up  
Me I'm found floating round and round  
Like a bug in brandy  
In this big bronze cup  
Drowning here in summer's cauldron  
  
Trees are dancing drunk with nectar  
Grass is waving underwater  
Please don't pull me out this is how I would want to go  
Insect bomber Buddhist droning  
Copper chord of August's organ  
Please don't heed my shout  
I'll relax in the undertow  
  
When Miss Moon lays down  
In her hilltop bed  
And Sir Sun stands up  
Raise his regal head  
Me I'm found floating round and round  
Like a bug in brandy  
In this big bronze cup  
Drowning here in summer's cauldron

In the car park  
In the lamplight  
Go for a walk  
Clock him shiv-fight  
Sodium-a-shine on  
All the faces white now  
And he got his Docs on  
Bottle out all right now  
  
As you might say  
Him super-tuff  
  
In the corner  
In the cold rain  
Sting like iodine  
In my brain  
Fist you til you fall down  
Hit him back make him mad  
Really hard. Really fast  
Have you ever been had?  
('cause he's having you now)  
  
Super-tuff  
But also tender

Living in a rabbit tunnel  
Keep the doggy in her kennel  
Mustn't let her see the world  
Oh, no!  
Don't treat her like that  
Oh, no!  
Don't treat her like that  
Leaving after mom and daddy  
Carry home just like a cat, he  
Mustn't let them see your kill  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
You won't shoot this bird down  
Shout it clear for all to hear  
We're going to take this town  
(Turn and done bridge give the orders)  
(Keeping lunch in perfect orders)  
Mustn't let them know their minds  
(Turning on too early music)  
(Bring up on each other that they)  
Mustn't let them over the lines  
It's time she stopped being your ornament  
It's time she put it in the past for permanent  
You can't hold her if she wants to roam around  
Around around around around  
You can't hold her dreamin', keep her gagged and bound  
Gagged and bound  
We're going  
We're going to  
We're going to take  
We're going to take this  
We're going to take this

Happy I'm floating  
Around on my feet now  
You make me go dizzy  
I'm weak at the knees  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Well you say I'm faking  
And I say don't worry  
The way that I bubble  
There's something in the make  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall  
  
Right, the chemistry is right  
This boy has reached his height  
The feeling just goes on and on...  
From strength to strength  
I'm ten feet long  
  
I feel like I'm walking  
Round ten feet tall

Go and speak to your niece (do this do that)  
Kiss your aunt on the cheek  
Don't talk back, now run along  
It's gone eight, say goodnight  
That's the way that it's done  
Boy and girl, girl and boy  
This is how you do it and  
Who am I to reason why  
Wear a shirt, wear a tie  
You look smart in a suit  
Use your fork in the left  
Straighten up shoulders back  
This is the way that it's done

That wave  
Pulled me into your eyes  
Through the greeney grey pebbles  
And countless cathedrals arriving  
That wave  
Lift me into your mouth  
Turning spires and spittle of pearls  
To perplex the young diver  
I flew down to the bottom of the sea  
Where I questioned the fishes all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love  
That wave  
Carried me through your hair  
Up from suffocate seaweed  
The perfumed cushions cascading  
That wave  
Pushed me into your skin  
Where I bathed in the promises  
Giddy with planets parading  
I swam down to the bottom of the sky  
Where I questioned the blue birds all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love  
That wave!  
That wave  
Pulled me right overboard  
Into permanent morgasm  
Emotional action painting  
I flew down to the bottom of the sea  
Where I questioned the fishes all about it  
I was in heaven  
Address cloud eleven  
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love

The disappointed  
All shuffle round in circles  
Their placards look the same  
With a picture and a name  
Of the ones who broke their hearts  
The disappointed  
All congregate at my house  
Their voices sob with grief  
That they want to be chief  
Of the tribe with broken hearts  
Once, I had no sympathy  
For those destroyed and thrown away by love  
Seems, your ring upon my finger  
Signifies that I've become the spokesman of...  
The disappointed  
Will bear me on their shoulders  
To a secret shadow land  
Where a somber marching band  
Plays a tune for broken hearts  
And day grows darker now  
Everywhere, everywhere  
The disappointed  
Are coming in their millions  
They're spilling from the bus  
At a monument to us  
Made of bits of broken heart  
The disappointed  
Are growing every second  
They blot the sun to black  
At the bottom of the pack  
I'm the king of broken hearts
