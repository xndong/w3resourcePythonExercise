Hurray I awake from yesterday  
Alive but the war is here to stay  
So my love catherina and me  
Decide to take our last walk thru the noise to the sea  
Not to die but to be reborn  
Away from the lands so battred and torn  
Forever forever  
Oh say can you see it's really such A mess  
Every inch of earth is A fighting nest  
Giant pencil and lipstick-Tube shaped things  
Continue to rain and cause screamin' pain  
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red  
As our feet find the sand  
And the sea is straight ahead  
Straight up ahead  
Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today  
Well it's too bad  
The machine that we built  
Would never save us that's what they say  
That's why they ain't comin' with us today  
And they also said it's impossible  
For A man to live and breathe undrerwater  
Forever was A main complaint  
Yeah and they also threw this in my face they said  
Anyway you know good and well  
It would be beyond the will of god  
And the grace of the king  
Grace of the king  
Yeah  
Ooo  
So my darling and I make love in the sand  
To salute the last moment ever on dry land  
Our machine it has done its work played its part well  
Without A scratch on our body when we bid it farewell  
Starfish and giant foams greet us with A smile  
Before our heads go under we take our last look at the killing noise  
Of the out of style  
The out of style out of style oh yeah  
Oooo  
So down and down and down and down we go  
Hurry my darlin' we mustn't be late  
For the show  
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so my dear  
Right this way smiles A mermaid  
I can hear atlantis full of cheer  
Atlantis full of cheer  
I can hear atlantis full of cheer  
Oh yeah

  
'Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. over'  
'I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun. over'  
'You mean it's the earth? over.'  
Positive. it is know to have some form of intelligent species. over'  
'I think we should take a look.'  
Strange beautiful grass of green  
With your majestic silken seas  
Your mysterious mountains  
I wish to see closer  
May I land my kinky machine  
Although your world wonders me  
With you majestic superior cackling hen  
Your people I do not understand  
So to you I wish to put and end  
And you'll never hear surf music again

Etc.

Angel came down from heaven yesterday  
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday,  
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea  
And then she spread her wings high over me  
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow  
  
And I said "fly on my sweet angel,  
Fly on through the sky,  
Fly on my sweet angel,  
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"  
  
Sure enough this morning came on to me  
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise  
And my angel she said unto me  
"Today is the day for you to rise,  
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,  
You're gonna rise"  
And she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said "fly on my sweet angel,  
Fly on through the sky,  
Fly on my sweet angel,  
Forever I will be by your side"

If you can just get your mind together  
Then come on across to me  
We'll hold hands an' then we'll watch the sun rise from the bottom of the sea  
But first  
  
Are you experienced?  
Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
I know, I know  
You'll probably scream n' cry  
That your little world won't let you go  
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove that  
You're made out of gold and -a can't be sold  
  
So-er, are you experienced?  
Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
Ah, let me prove it to you  
Trumpets and violins, I can hear in the distance  
I think they're calling our names  
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will  
If you just take hold of my hand  
Ah! But are you experienced?  
Have you ever been experienced?  
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful...

Here I come to save the day  
  
A little boy inside a dream just the other day  
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away  
A hand came out and happened to pin that bag on his chest  
It said get out there man and a do your best  
  
And he's called the astro man  
And he's flyin' higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever could  
  
Oh, they call him cosmic nut  
And he's twice as dense as Donald Duck  
And he'll try his best to screw you up  
The rest of your mind  
Oh, look out, my guitars  
  
Astro man, flyin' across the sky  
Two times higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever, ever could  
Ever could  
  
There he goes, there he goes  
Where he stops, no one knows  
There he goes, there he goes, uh  
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind  
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind  
Astro man will leave it in pieces  
Have you put our trouble behind him  
Make you fly around in pieces  
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind  
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind  
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Ooo-hoo  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Blow out the rest of of your mind

Well I'm up here in this womb  
I'm lookin' all around  
Hmm mm mm  
Well I'm lookin' out my belly button window  
And I see a whole lot of frowns  
And I'm wonderin' if they don't want me, around  
  
What seems to be the fuss out there  
Just what seems to be the hang  
Cause you know if you don't want me this time around  
Yeah, I'll be glad to go back to spirit land  
And even take a longer rest  
Before a comin' down the shoot again  
Man I sure remember the last time, baby  
They were still talkin' about me then  
So if you don't want me now  
Make up your mind  
Where or when  
Make up your mind  
If you don't want me now  
Give or take  
You only got two-hundred days  
Cause I ain't comin' down this way too much more, again  
  
You know they got pills for ills, and thrills, and even spills  
But I think your just a little too late  
So I'm comin' down into this world daddy  
Regardless of love and hate  
I'm gonna sit up in your bed mamma  
And just a grin right in your face  
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates  
Ha, and say I hope I'm not too late  
  
If there's any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
If there's any questions make up your mind  
Give or take  
You got only two-hundred days  
  
And I'm lookin' out my belly button window  
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns  
And I won't live if they don't want me, around

Black is gold is pure  
And true kings of this earth.  
  
1.  
  
So I say it's up to us to straighten  
Out this mess...  
We got to go through hell...  
And then that's the last of this  
Miserable test...  
  
2.  
  
Black must be bold  
Because it's gold and true  
Kings of this world...  
So let them go to the moon.  
Yes let them go to mars.  
Because deep down inside  
They're really from the stars.  
  
3.  
  
That's why they don't want  
Us to mix... Just the way  
The word of God had said.  
So let them go to saturn... That's  
Where they'll learn instead.  
Because black and white  
Together is right...  
And white by itself is  
An egotistic elf.  
  
4.  
  
So they show you how to  
Kill... And if you don't  
They will.  
What do they know about  
Happiness...  
How can they about life...  
They just got lost in space.  
So when they landed,  
Atlantis cried.  
  
So if they're so alone try  
To make them feel at home.  
So let them fetch you fire wood.  
And let them nibble on the bone.  
So invent a word called love.  
And then they blame our mistakes on god.  
Don't you know how lonely they must be.  
So many light years from home.  
Hey soulful people I'm calling.  
Don't be no more slaves.  
Because God will protect us  
When it comes to doomsday.  
Realize before it's too late...  
That no one on earth will escape.  
We are the kings of earth.  
And axis gonna put them slaves...  
They killed so many worlds before.  
But they will pass sentence upon themselves...  
When the earth opens up... Will  
They be saved from our hell.  
  
I feel the truth of life.  
We better all realize...  
People like me and you  
We feel so bad, don't know  
What to do... They keep us  
High low on drugs.  
And they got us making their rugs...  
As we go dripping blood.  
But the sun knows as  
The wind blows and the  
Fire grows towards the  
Far shores and the water  
Foams to make steamed  
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...  
Black is gold is the kings of this world.  
We all better get our places  
Before God tells us to our  
Face we are... Past the human race.  
Let's pray that we all agree  
We got to straighten out the family tree.  
Life is for you and me togather.  
That's the way it was meant to be.  
White man watch your mouth  
Because our drums, they face the south.  
And you can't kill the god  
That kept you alive between  
The poles of the north and south.  
You better adjust your place  
In this world... Before your  
Hair, it starts to curl... And the  
Yellow, red, and black of this  
World will tear your ass and soul apart.  
  
Where is he coming from?  
From heaven where 1, 000, 000  
Worlds are one.  
Where is he going to?  
He's going to make contact  
With the living and the dead...  
Here comes black gold...  
Gather round young and old...  
He's going to be felt by the  
Timid and the bold...  
Within a wink of an eye,  
  
With the wink of an eye  
Egos swell, bust and die...  
Kingdoms fall and cry...  
With the wink of an eye...  
With the wink of an eye  
A new born baby cries...  
And a 100 soldiers die with  
The wink of an eye.

Peoples, peoples, peoples  
You know what it means to be left alone  
Peoples, peoples, people  
You know what it means to be left alone  
Yeah  
Lord it happened to day  
Lord not even a call on my telephone  
Understandin'  
Lord a little love in the world is all I need  
A little love and understanding baby  
It's all in the world I need  
Lose of love  
A misunderstanding of a no good woman  
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed  
All right  
  
Every mornin'  
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me  
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me  
The birds sang the love song  
My baby's caused my heart to bleed

Anger, he smiles,  
Towering in shiny metallic purple armour  
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him  
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground  
  
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,  
They quietly understand  
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,  
But wonder why the fight is on  
But they're all bold as love, yes, they're all bold as love  
Yeah, they're all bold as love  
Just ask the axis  
  
My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war,  
And ribbons of euphoria  
Orange is young, full of daring,  
But very unsteady for the first go round  
My yellow in this case is not so mellow  
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me  
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh,  
Giving my life to a rainbow like you  
But, I'm, I'm bold as love, yeah, I'm bold as love  
Yeah, yeah  
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)  
I'm bold as love  
Just ask the axis (he knows everything)  
  
Yeah,  
  
Yeah,  
Yeah!

The morning is dead  
And the day is, too  
There's not much left here to lead me  
But the velvet moon  
All my loneliness I have felt today  
It's a little more than enough  
To make a man throw himself away  
  
And I continue  
To burn the midnight lamp  
Alone  
  
Now the smiling portrait of you  
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall  
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all  
It's just the ever falling dust  
That makes it so hard for me to see  
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor  
Facing coldly towards the door  
  
I continue  
To burn the midnight lamp  
Lord, alone  
  
Loneliness is such a drag  
  
So here I sit to pace  
That same old fire place  
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion  
Goin' through my mind  
And soon enough time will tell,  
About the circus in the wishing well  
And someone who will buy and sell for me  
Someone to toll my bell  
  
And I continue  
To burn the some old lamp  
Lord, alone  
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?  
So lonely  
Gotta blow my mind  
Lonely

BURNING OF THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
  
THE MORNING IS DEAD  
AND THE DAY IS TOO  
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT HERE TO GREET ME  
BUT THE VELVET MOON  
ALL MY LONELINESS  
I HAVE FELT TODAY  
IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN ENOUGH  
TO MAKE A MAN THROW HIMSELF AWAY  
AND I CONTINUE  
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALONE  
  
NOW THE SMILING PORTRAIT OF YOU  
IS STLL HANGIN' ON MY FROWNING WALL  
IT REALLY DOESN'T REALLY DOESN'T BOTHER ME, TOO MUCH AT ALL  
IT'S JUST THE, UH, EVER FALLING DUST  
THAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR ME TO SEE  
THAT FORGOTTEN EAR-RING LAYING ON THE FLOOR  
FACING COLDLY TOWARD THE DOOR  
AND I CONTINUE  
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALL ALONE  
  
BURN  
LONELY LONELY, YEAH  
LONELY LONELY LONELY  
LONELINESS IS SUCH A, DRAG  
  
SO HERE I SIT TO FACE  
THAT SAME OLD FIRE PLACE  
GETTIN' READY FOR THE SAME OLD EXPLOSION  
GOIN' THROUGH MY MIND  
AND SOON ENOUGH TIME WILL TELL  
ABOUT THE CIRCUS AND THE WISHINGWELL  
AND SOMEONE WHO WILL BUY AND SELL FOR ME  
SOMEONE WHO WILL TOLL MY BELL  
AND I CONTINUE TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT LAMP  
ALONE  
  
DARLIN' DO YOU HEAR ME CALLIN' YOU  
SO LONELY  
LONELY!

(Bob Dylan)  
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back  
I'm sure that he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
Can you please crawl out your window?  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you?  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Can you see me? Begging you on my knees  
Wo yeah  
Can you see? Me baby  
Baby please don't leave  
Yeah if you can see me doing that  
You can see in the future of A thousand years  
  
Can you hear me?  
Cryin' all over town  
Yeah babe  
Can you hear me baby?  
Crying cause you put me down  
What's with ya  
If you can hear me doing that  
You can hear A freight train coming from A thousand miles  
  
Ah yeah  
Can you hear me?  
Singing this song to you  
Ah you better open up your ears  
Can you see me baby?  
Singing this song to you  
Aw shucks  
If you can hear me sing  
You better come home like you supposed to do  
  
Can you see me?  
Hey hey  
I don't believe you can see me  
Wo yeah  
Can you hear me baby?  
I don't believe you can  
You can't see me

Down the street you can hear her scream  
"YOU'RE A DISGRACE"  
As she slams the door in his drunken face  
And now he stands outside  
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool  
  
He cries "oh girl, you must be mad  
What happened to the seet love you and me had"  
Against the door he leans and starts A scene  
And his tears fall and burn the garden green  
  
And so castles made of sand,  
Fall in the sea eventually  
  
A little indian brave who before he was ten  
Played war games in the woods with his indian friends  
And he built A dream that when he grew up  
He would be A fearless warrior indian chief  
  
Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow  
He would sing his first war song  
And fight his first battle but something went wrong  
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
  
And so castles made of sand  
Melts into the sea eventually  
  
There was A young girl whose heart was A frown  
Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak A sound  
And she wished and prayed she would stop living  
So she decided to die  
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore  
And to her legs she smiled  
"YOU WON'T HURT ME NO MORE"  
But then A sight she'd never seen made her jump and say  
"LOOK A GOLDEN WINGED SHIP IS PASSING MY WAY"  
And it really didn't have to stop  
It just kept on going  
  
And so castles made of sand  
Slips into the sea eventually

Hey!

You jump in front of my car when you, you know all the time that  
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive.  
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain.  
You say you just want me to take you for a ride.  
  
You're just like crosstown traffic, so hard to get through to you.  
Crosstown traffic, I don't need to run over you.  
Crosstown traffic, all you do is slow me down  
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town.  
  
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run,  
Tire tracks all across your back, uh-huh, I can see you had your fun.  
But a darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead.  
  
You're just like Crosstown traffic, so hard to get through to you.  
Crosstown traffic, I don't need to run over you.  
Crosstown traffic, all you do is slow me down  
And I got better things on the other side of town.  
  
Yeah now crosstown traffic, look out, look out, baby, let me through.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out, look out, look out.  
Crosstown traffic yeah, look out, watch that street.

As I looked into my crystal ball...  
There was formed a tragedy.  
Oh but there's nothing to worry about...  
It was just a flash from my memory.  
Well it seems that the holiday wheel...,  
You know, the one that was between earth  
And the moon...well any way, there was  
2,000,000 killed...bodies floating in the  
Afternoon...  
  
Explosions, 1,000 or more, announcing  
Tidal waves and hurricanes...  
And down on earth we lost 3 continents.  
Their fiery soul snuffed out by  
Nature's ice and rains...  
  
And pieces of my life...floating,  
Still soaring through space...  
But my sons and their wives  
Landed on mars to start another race...  
  
As I gazed upon my crystal ball,  
There formed a cloud of jealousy.  
But there's nothing to feel sad about...  
By this time, it's due for only history.  
Well, it seems that the chambers of the  
Gods were being emptied for good.  
Why would such heavenly beings want  
To desert earth ?  
But as I watched I understood.  
  
As the clouds turned to a jealous  
Green, which was concieved in the heart  
Of man...the people didn't respect  
The help of the gods. instead they turned against  
Immortal man. as they tried to defy, they  
Died, into the wicked pits of hell.  
  
Diana wept a tear after we made love  
And said: "my earthly darling, I must bid  
You farewell...the fate of your mud brothers ...  
As pieces of my life...floating,  
Still soaring in space...  
She could have been my wife  
But her time, I didn't dare wish  
To waste.  
  
As I stared into my crystal ball,  
There was formed a tearing of hearts.  
Ego armies marched antly onto view  
Only to be blown apart.  
  
As the sun whispered it's secret  
Through space...to men thinking the false pride  
Opposite...telling them that it was  
Such a disgrace to think that men were  
The ruler of it. well you know  
How the story goes...the sun they thought  
Was their circling slave...  
Round and round and round the  
Table she goes. some carried  
The thought right to their grave...  
And I smell the scorch of the  
Burnt out minds...who searched  
For the hurting truth of space. and the  
Dizziness they felt inside...  
Reflected off the spinning  
Slave pebble earth...  
  
As fragments of my life...  
Some floating, some soaring in space  
Collections of my soul  
Will turn complete only as time will age.  
  
As my tears drop on my crystal ball,  
Magnifies the reflections of christ.  
As I blink, his angels take him away.  
What he said, man tries to self  
?help from god. as reward, he  
Wipes our blood from his eyes...  
And the cross that he would  
Use for his throne represents  
Not life but death. is this the way  
All heroes go ? ...carrying the first necklace  
Of death...  
His preaching the belief  
Of eternal happiness to rest.  
Or were his angels just ufos  
Vapor trails lead from  
Another light year land...  
Or was it really tomorrow's  
Awakening day dream...blemished  
By the smudgy finger prints of man...  
  
And slivers of my life...floating,  
Still soaring in space...  
And spirits of bee hives  
Even they find a resting place.  
  
As I wander through my crystal ball,  
I suddenly ride upon the waves of sound.  
I see platforms of launching  
Pads even before the first blade of  
Grass turned brown.  
  
And I taste their tunnels through  
The sky...as the axis turns in it's womb.  
Frozen flowers and animals try to  
Hold positions they had before  
Their morning bloomed...  
And I follow the last rocket up  
To the libraries of the moon's meadows.

Yeah,  
Um ah um ah  
  
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out  
I got a good reason, for taken the easy way out now  
She was a day tripper

Oh, help me in my weakness  
I heard the drifter say  
As they carried him from the court room  
And were taking him away  
Well, my trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long  
And I still do not know  
What is was that I've done wrong  
  
Well the judge he cast his robe aside  
A tear came to his eye  
Well you fail to understand, he said  
Why must you even try  
Outside the crowd was stirring  
You could hear it from the door  
Inside the judge was stepping down  
While the jury cried for more, more, more  
Cried for more, cried for more  
  
Hey you better leave that boy's soul alone  
  
Oh stop that passing the jury  
Grab me a tendon and me a nurse  
Oh, the trial was bad enough  
Yes, but this is ten times worse  
Just then bolt of lightning  
Showed the court house out of shape  
And while everybody knelt to pray  
The drifter made his escape  
The drifter did his escape  
Yeah  
So long

Well, I see hands and attesting faces  
Reachin' up but not quite touching the promised land  
Well, I taste tears and a whole lot of previous years wasted

He dreams about and humpin' A machine gun instead or it could be  
Could be A cat maybe tryin' to fall in love with that girl baby,  
But A little bit too scared. That's where the problems come from  
Sometimes isn't it? I meen the cat is really insecure A little bit  
So the call girls groupies and they call girls this. And they call  
Passive people hippies and bla bla, woof, woof, all down the line  
That's because their not in love man that's what's happening. That's  
The other half of A man, is woman. And we'd like to play A thing called  
Izabella, and don't you ever forget it. "

Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,  
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well,  
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell.  
  
Go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.  
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,  
Playing to the music that the drivers made.  
People passing by they'd stop and say  
Oh my that little country boy could play  
  
Go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
His mama told him "someday you will be a man,  
"And you will be the leader of a big old band.  
"All kinds a people coming from miles around  
"To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down  
"Maybe someday your name will be in lights  
"Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."  
  
Go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Go, Johnny go, go  
Johnny B. Goode

No one knows where she comes from  
Maybe she's a devil in disguise  
I can tell by looking in her eyes  
  
Little miss Strange

Little miss Strange came into my parlor  
I don't know just what to ask her

Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light

Scared little Annie  
Clean out of her mind

Look over yonder here come the blues

Wearing a blue armored coat  
You're sittin' here with your violins  
Hittin' wrong notes

Well, he's knockin' on my door  
How my house is tumblin' down  
Now don't you come no closer  
The path is keepin' me bolder  
Wait by my door baby

Hey hey hey...  
  
Hey!

After all the Jacks are in their boxes  
And the CLOWNS HAVE ALL gone to bed  
You can hear happiness STAGGERING on down the street  
Footprints dressed in red  
And the wind whispers Mary  
  
A broom is drearly sweeping  
Of the broken pieces of yesterdays life  
Somewhere a queen is weeping  
Somewhere a king has no wife  
And the wind it cries Mary  
  
THE TRAFFIC lights they a turn blue tomorrow  
And shine the emptiness down on my bed  
The tiny island sags down the street  
Cause the life that lives is dead  
And the wind screams Mary.  
  
Will the wind every remember  
The names it has blown in the past  
And with this crush it's old age and it's wisdom  
It whisper no this will be the last  
And the wind cries Mary.

May I whisper in your ear  
From my heart so you'll clearly hear...  
There are people so dear...  
They're like children...  
Naked in a cold world...  
Beautiful children  
In an old world...  
  
May I take you away  
From the evils of today  
To the dreams of tomorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no sorrow.  
You know that heaven...  
Has no tomorrow.  
  
Hear the sound of the magic drums...  
Hearts are beating for the sun...  
Sending evil on the run...  
Now watch the wind...  
  
Look over yonder...  
Here comes some news...  
Coming down like lightning...  
Straight for me and you.  
People of destruction  
Your time is out of date...  
People who's living crooked,  
Better start getting straight.  
  
I've been through some changes,  
A whole lot of re-arranges...  
Been through some ups and downs,  
And whole lot of turn arounds.  
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...  
1, 000 times ago and maybe 1, 000  
Times more.  
  
She said she comes from ice land...  
I told her I was from the west.  
She took me to the snow capped mountains...  
And then she put me through the test...  
We walked across the glacier,  
The horses stayed behind...  
And as we laid between the  
Frozen vallies we kissed  
For the very first time.  
And now we're stuck together.  
  
It was too long ago.  
But it seems like... Years ago...  
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.  
Lately things seem a little colder...  
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder.  
  
Forget of my name  
Remember it only as a hand shake,  
Introduction to my belief which is god.  
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,  
Music, sound  
Hynotic if you choose  
But truth and life  
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises  
Which I intend to erase.  
Which I will erase without hint of reward  
As I am only a messenger  
And you a sheep in process of evolution  
Almost at death with yourself  
And on the staircase of birth.  
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family...

Waterfall  
Nothing can harm me at all  
my worries seem so very small  
with my waterfall  
  
I can see my rainbow calling me yeah  
through the misty breeze of my waterfall  
  
Some people say day-Dreaming is

Let me get my key ahum  
  
Well I'm looking through Harlem  
My stomach squealed just a little more  
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints  
Pulls up to my soap-box door  
Now a lady with a pearl-handled necktie  
Tied to the driver's fence  
Breathes in my face  
Bourbon and coke possessed words  
Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell  
Or was it just an accident?  
You know how I felt then  
And so a...  
  
Before I could ask was it the east or west side?  
My feet they howled in pain  
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep  
But not as deep in my mind as the rain  
And as they pulled away I could see her words  
Stagger and fallin' on my muddy tent  
Well I picked them up brushed them off  
To see what they said  
And you wouldn't believe  
'Come around to my room with the tooth in the middle  
And bring along the bottle and a president'  
  
And-eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby  
Especially when your only friend  
Talks sees looks and feels like you  
And you do just the same as him  
Gets very lonely out this road baby  
Yeah hmm yeah  
  
Got more to say  
  
Well I'm riding through L.A. ha  
On a bicycle built for fools  
And I seen one of my old buddies  
And he say 'you don't look the way you usually do'  
I say ' well some people look like a coin-box'  
He say 'look like you ain't got no coins to spare'  
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this  
I just picked up my pride form underneath the pay phone  
And combed this breath right out of my hair  
And sometimes it's not so easy  
Especially when your only friend  
Talks sees looks and feels like you  
And you do just the same as him  
  
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail  
And I'm on my way straight home to you  
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror  
To make sure my friend's here with me too  
And you know good well I don't drink coffee  
So you fill my cup full of sand  
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom  
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge  
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on  
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge  
And I thought you were my friend too  
Man, my shadow comes in line before you  
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy  
Specially when your only friend  
Talks, looks, sees, and feels like you  
And you do the same just like him  
  
Lord it's so lonely here hmm yeah  
Yeah!  
Pass me that bottle over there  
Yeah yeah o.k.

While the sun kissed the mountains blue  
And eleven moons played across rainbows  
Above me and you.  
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us.

She walks with a bell clock round her neck  
So the hippies think she's in with time, time  
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck  
Branches attack me from her neck  
  
She's so fine  
She's so very very fine  
  
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes  
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind, mind  
Morning sign sounds just like a lock  
All these signs are always a stock  
  
She' s so fine  
She's so very very fine  
  
When I veer I get so near  
But so far far far away  
Listen to me today

The ground was hard underneath, her her  
  
She's so fine

Oh uh  
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces  
Reachin' up and not quite touchin' the promised land  
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper sayin'  
Oh, Lord, please give us a helpin' hand  
Yeah yeah  
  
Way down in the background  
I can see frustrated souls of cities burnin'  
And all across the water, baby  
I see weapons barkin' out the sting of death  
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumpin' themselves  
Laughin' they sayin'  
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess  
  
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink  
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor  
But as far as I know, they may even try  
To wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me  
Brother sell me, and don't worry about lookin' at the score  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

By the dawns early light  
What so proudly we hailed  
At the twilights last gleaming?  
Who's broad striped and bright stars  
Through the perilous fight  
O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket's red glare!  
The bombs bursting in air!  
Gave proof through the night  
That our flag was still there  
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave  
O'er the land of the free  
And the home of the brave?

500,000 halos ...  
Outshined the mud and history.  
We washed and drank in  
God's tears of joy,  
And for once...and for everyone...  
The truth was not a mystery--  
  
Love called to all...music is magic.  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--  
  
We came together...danced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Space--music is magic...  
Magic is life...  
Love as never loved before...  
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife.
