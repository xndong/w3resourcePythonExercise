Yeah it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
  
Well I got the call soon as the day hit night  
As soon as the headlights lit up the Westside  
I stopped the car and came outside  
Cause I know that tone  
I remember the first time  
We wished upon parallel lines  
Waiting for a friend to call  
And say they're still alive  
I've given everyone I know  
A good reason to go  
I was surprised you stuck around  
Long enough to figure out  
  
That it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
  
And now all my loves that come back to haunt me  
My regrets and texts sent to taunt me  
I never claimed to be more than a one-night stand  
And now I've given everyone I know  
A good reason to go  
But I came back with the belief  
That everyone I love is gonna leave me  
  
And it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
  
And I know, oh no,  
You've fallen from the sun  
Crashing through the clouds  
I see you burning out  
And I know, oh no,  
That I put up a front  
But maybe, just this once,  
Let me keep this one  
  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright  
Yeah, it's all alright  
I guess it's all alright  
I got nothing left inside of my chest,  
But it's all alright

Never in all of my life  
Have I seen eyes as empty as these streets of my city  
On a Saturday night,  
All the green of your eyes says "Go, leave it all behind."  
  
But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come.  
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue.  
  
And I feel alive.  
  
We met up once we'd settled the sun  
Between the heat and the work week  
The fear is we could use some sleep  
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds  
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight.  
  
I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was.  
I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block  
That asks if I've had enough, and aloud I say "I've had too much,"  
When the truth is, I'm just getting started.  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement  
And I feel alive.  
  
One of us sings, and one of us drinks,  
And one of us has nothing at all.  
So he calls us all sheep  
I'm the Little Bo Peep of the bunch.  
(I take their tales and I'm ready to go)  
The he swears he's gotta take this call  
Man, I get scared he's gonna leave us too soon.  
  
We were the get rich quick kids,  
We never got it right  
So we settled for the center of town  
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight  
Got the blond one staring me down.  
And I really wanna take a swing  
I can't help but remember James Dean  
See we are part of the few who agree  
That hey, he lived life fast  
But he died.  
He died.  
He died.  
  
Me, I'm gonna live forever.  
  
Now all the barlights are blinking in time  
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement  
And for the first time  
In a long time  
I feel alive

As I walk through the streets of my new city  
My back feeling much better, I suppose  
I've reclaimed the use of my imagination  
For better or for worse, I've yet to know  
But I always knew you'd be the one to understand me,  
I guess that's why it took so long to get things right.  
Suddenly I'm lost  
On my street  
On my block  
  
Oh why, Oh why  
Oh why haven't you been there for me?  
Can't you see, I'm losing my mind this time?  
This time I think it's for real, I can see  
  
All the tree tops turning red  
The beggars near bodegas grin at me  
I think they want something  
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe  
  
And be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes.  
Be calm.  
  
I'm scared that everyone is out to get me.  
"These days before you speak to me you pause."  
"I always see you looking out your window."  
"After all, you lost your band, you left your mom."  
Now every single crack, every penny that I pass,  
Says I should either leave or pick it up  
But with every single buck I've made  
I'm saddled with bad luck that came  
  
The moment I was baptized  
Or when I found out one day I'm gonna die  
If only I could find my people or my place in life  
A when they come a'carolin'  
So loud, so bright, the theremin  
Will lead us to a chorus  
Where we'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes:  
  
Oh be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.  
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive  
And everything's wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm.  
  
I don't remember much that night,  
Just walking, thinking fondly of you  
Thinking how the worst is yet to come  
When from that street corner came a song  
And I can't remember the man,  
The panhandler or his melody.  
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change I'd given thee.  
  
Oh be calm.  
Be calm.  
I know you feel like you are breaking down.  
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes,  
Be calm.  
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times.  
You hate your pulse because it still thinks you're alive  
And everything's wrong  
It just gets so hard sometimes  
Be calm.  
Be calm.

Well I woke to the sound of silence the cries  
Were cutting like knives in a fist fight  
And I found you with a bottle of wine  
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July  
  
You swore and said we are not  
We are not shining stars  
This I know  
I never said we are  
  
Though I've never been through hell like that  
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back  
  
If you're lost and alone  
Or you're sinking like a stone  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground  
Carry on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
  
So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night  
At a bar off seventy five  
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die  
All our neighbors and wives  
  
But I like to think  
I can cheat it all  
To make up for the times, I've been cheated on  
And it's nice to know  
When I was left for dead  
I was found and now I don't roam these streets  
I am not the ghost you want of me  
  
If you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone,  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and  
Carry on  
  
Woah my head is on fire  
But my legs are fine  
After all they are mine  
Lay your clothes down on the floor  
Close the door  
Hold the phone  
Show me how  
No one's ever gonna stop us now  
  
'Cause we are  
We are shining stars  
We are invincible  
We are who we are  
On our darkest day  
When we're miles away  
So we'll come, we will find our way home  
  
If you're lost and alone  
Or you're sinking like a stone  
Carry on  
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and  
Carry on  
  
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)  
(No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now)  
(No one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop , no one's ever gonna stop)  
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)

[Brendon]  
It's getting late, and I  
Cannot seem to find my way home tonight  
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole  
Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone  
What would my head be like  
If not for my shoulders  
Or without your smile  
May it follow you forever  
May it never leave you  
To sleep in the stone,  
May we stay lost on our way home  
  
[Brendon]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Nate]  
If I should die tonight  
May I first just say I'm sorry  
For I, never felt like anybody  
I am a man of many hats although I  
Never mastered anything  
When I am ten feet tall  
I've never felt much smaller, since the fall  
Nobody seems to know my name  
So don't leave me to sleep all alone  
May we stay lost on our way home?  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon]  
Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
It could leave, it could leave, come the morning  
  
[Nate]  
Celebrate the night  
It's the fall before the climb  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
Shall we sing, shall we sing, 'til the morning  
  
[Brendon]  
If I fall forward, you fall flat  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
And if the sun should lift me up  
Would you come back? C'mon!  
  
[Music interlude]  
  
[Brendon]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon and Nate]  
So c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me  
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities  
  
[Brendon screams] yeah yeah yeah!  
  
[Brendon]  
It's getting late and I, cannot seem to find my way home tonight.

I set all my regrets on fire  
Cause I know I'll never take the time  
To unpack my missteps and call all of our friends  
I figure they would take your side  
  
I make the bed, just not that well  
Your name comes up a lot  
When I talk to my mom  
Oh, I think she can tell  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
So maybe I should put up a fight  
I'll call them back and borrow a box knife  
So I can learn to live with all the stupid shit I've been doing since ninety
nine  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
But I'm waiting for the day you come back and say  
"Hey, maybe I should change my mind"  
  
I drink a lot  
I'm not sure if that's new  
But these days when I wake up from a night I forgot  
I just wish that it never came true  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more clever  
  
I knew there would come a day when all was said and done (And I know I could
be more clever)  
Everything I was is everything but gone (And I know I could be more strong)  
All my big mistakes are bouncing off your wall (And I know I could be more
clever)  
The bottles never break, the sorrow never comes (And I know I could be more
clever)  
So come on let me in, I will be the sun (And I know I could be more clever)  
I will wake you up, I am who [?](And I know I could be more strong)  
Just open up your heart, open up your heart, open up your heart (And I know I
could be more clever)  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now I'm causing a scene, but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no, what have I done?  
There's no one to keep me warm  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh

How fast can a heart shatter  
Before you're walking on splinters?  
Your head aches just to feel what it knows  
Please leave a light on when you go  
  
How can you fix something  
That you can't touch without hurting?  
The lesson you've learned is leaving you dumb  
Please leave a light on when it's done  
  
Standing high above the flood line  
Watching all your belongings go by  
  
How can you see the ending  
When you're lost at the beginning?  
The day hides all that the night left behind  
Please turn a light on when it dies

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring-ting-tingling too,  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo",  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're riding along with a song  
Of a wintry wonderland.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy,  
And comfy cozy are we,  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be,  
Let's take that road before us,  
And sing a chorus or two,  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
There's a birthday party  
At the home of Farmer Gray,  
It'll be the perfect ending to a perfect day,  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop,  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop.  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy,  
When they pass around the coffee  
And the pumpkin pie,  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By Currier and Ives,  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember through all our lives!  
  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two,  
As you one can see, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.  
  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two,  
As you one can see, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you

Growing old is getting old  
I often find myself here thinking  
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking  
And it's crazy here without you  
I used to think this all was ours  
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way  
Say it's all up in the stars  
  
Some nights I rule the world  
With bar lights and pretty girls  
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom  
Oh god, I miss her so much  
  
And there are people on the street  
They're coming up to me  
They're telling me that they like what I do now  
And so I tried my best when I took the fall  
To get right back up, back in your arms  
If you're out here why do I miss you so much  
  
I feel like I had it all  
Back before I lost it all  
Now I just wait for you to talk to me  
But you won't even look at me, baby  
  
And I'd be saying that you  
You're always holding on to stars  
I think they're better from afar  
Cause no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and me  
Well, I have faded in the dark  
So don't you ever kiss me  
Don't you wish on me  
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?  
Oh, come on girl  
  
I just need a helping hand  
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow  
It never came true  
It came true  
It never came true  
  
Oh, and you  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
'Cause no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and you (you)  
You're always holding on to stars  
I think they're better from afar  
Because no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and me  
I have faded in the dark  
So don't you ever kiss me  
Don't you wish on me  
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?  
No one's gonna save us  
No one's gonna save me now  
  
No, no, no  
No, no, no  
No one's gonna save us  
Who we are, who we are  
Who you are, who you are  
Who you are, who you are  
Who you are, who you are  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars

It's how we do it, our feet in the sand.  
It's how we do it, our heads in our hands.  
It's how we do it, I'm not looking for a reason to go.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, but never before.  
  
I know,  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
It's how we do it.  
It's how we do it, if I lose you I'm losing control.  
So snap your fingers, pull the trigger cause I figure we're better as gold.  
It's how we do it, I'm a satellite looking for a signal to space.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, let's do it again.  
  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up,  
No I've never been better than when falling apart.  
  
I, Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive,  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
For all that I know, it's gonna come back, tenfold.  
For all that I know, it's gonna come back, tenfold.  
  
But Darlin', Oh no, I don't think that we'll make it out alive.  
  
Darlin', Oh no, we won't make it, out alive.  
Now I'm lying, with each passing day.  
  
So if you're coming, then come quick 'cause, I'm scared.  
I'm floating away.  
  
  
It's how we do it, for the first time, I don't need a reason to go.  
It's how we do it, we did it, we done it, let's do it some more.  
  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
I'm gonna make sure the money is right.  
Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
  
  
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up,  
No I've never been better than when falling apart.  
I, Know we can do it, if we do it all night.  
You put the keys in the car and drive,  
You put the keys in the car and drive.  
You put the keys in the car...  
  
And drive!

Give me a second I,  
I need to get my story straight  
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State  
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar  
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and  
  
I know I gave it to you months ago  
I know you're trying to forget  
But between the drinks and subtle things  
The holes in my apologies, you know  
I'm trying hard to take it back  
So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down, I'll carry you home  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Now I know that I'm not  
All that you got, I guess that I, I just thought  
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart  
But our friends are back  
So let's raise a tab  
'Cause I found someone to carry me home  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)  
  
The world is on my side  
I have no reason to run  
So will someone come and carry me home tonight  
The angels never arrived  
But I can hear the choir  
So will someone come and carry me home  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight, we are young  
So let's set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down  
I'll carry you home tonight

I got enough on my mind  
That when she pulls me by the hair,  
She hasn't much to hold onto.  
She keeping count on her hand:  
One, two, three days that I've been sleeping on my side.  
  
I finish kissing my death,  
So now I head back up the steps  
Thinking about where I've been.  
I mean the sun was never like this.  
  
I wanna feel with the seasons.  
I guess it makes sense.  
'Cause my life's become as vapid as  
A night out in Los Angeles,  
And I just wanna stay in bed  
  
and hold you like I used to.  
You know that I am home.  
So, darling, if you love me,  
Would you let me know?  
  
Or go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong.  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
  
She got enough on her mind  
That she feel no sorrow.  
I let my fate fill the air,  
So now she rolling down the window.  
Never been one to hold on  
But I need a last breath.  
So I ask if she remembers when  
She used to come and visit me.  
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong.  
  
Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
  
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much.  
  
I'll move back down  
To this western town.  
When they find me out,  
Make no mistake about it.  
  
I'll move back down  
To this western town.  
When they find me out,  
Make no mistake about it.  
  
I'll move back down  
To this western town.  
  
Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
  
Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  
  
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much.  
I'll move back down
