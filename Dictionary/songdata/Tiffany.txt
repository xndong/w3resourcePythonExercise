Back in the groove now  
I'm so glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
Want your love forever  
  
Couldn't sleep at night  
I'd hold my pillow so tight  
I was wondering why  
When all I wanted was my guy  
Just when I thought that I'd lose my baby  
He came to save me  
Every tear that I cry  
Everyday that went by  
Will be no more  
  
Back in the groove now  
I'm so glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
I couldn't eat  
Without your love, I was so weak  
But now that you're here, my darlin'  
I have no fear  
  
Just when I thought that I'd lose my baby  
He came to save me, yeah  
Everyday that went by  
Every tear that I cry  
Will be no more  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
All the guys in the world  
Couldn't take me away  
From being his girl  
I'm so crazy 'bout you baby  
A broken heart will be no more  
  
I just wanted to say  
That I'm so glad that we're back together again  
And the only other thing I have to say  
That I want your love forever  
I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever  
  
Back in the groove now  
So glad we're back together  
Back in the groove now  
And I want your love forever

(J. Brooks)  
Oh Betty  
You know I loved you so  
I'm shattered  
It hurt so much to see you go  
Give me your heart, I'll keep it beating  
And your blood will spill no more  
Oh I want to love you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
Oh Betty  
Don't tell heaven where you've been  
Don't you know that needing love is not a sin  
Give me your soul, I'll be it's keeper  
And the words I speak will be yours  
Oh I try to hate you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
And the leaves are starting to fall from the trees again  
And I remember when  
And autumn wind sang a song of a sin  
But I wasn't ready  
Oh Betty  
Oh Betty  
Don't tell heaven where you've been  
Didn't you know that needing love is not a sin  
Give me your heart, I'll keep it beating  
And your blood will spill no more  
Oh I want to love you Betty  
But I can't  
'Cause you closed the greatest of doors  
You closed the greatest of doors  
  

(J. Brooks, T. Feehan)  
You should know that my smile was leading to this  
It's all in this letter  
Strange how your wings ache like a son of a bitch  
Just when you're, just when you're finally better  
(fly away)  
Butterfly  
Someone like you just better watch where you step  
People have been known to bleed  
See how my words read like a kick in the head  
Sometimes that's just what you need  
(fly away)  
Butterfly  
Butterfly  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Don't you know that my smile was misleading  
I have outgrown my cocoon  
By the time that you read what you're reading  
I will have flown to the moon  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away  
Fly away my butterfly  
Fly away...  
You should know that my smile was leading to this  
  

You took me wrong just because we kissed  
And now I don't know how to say goodbye  
I know it's wrong when you're holding me like this  
Still won't you stay, let me love you for awhile  
You know I'm not that strong when I see you smile  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight, just for tonight  
You look at me and you don't understand  
You know I'm not the one that could feel your dreams  
I can't believe that this is how I am  
Still won't you stay, let me love you for awhile  
You know I'm not that strong when I see you smile  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight  
I love the way you watch me  
I love you the way we move  
But in my heart I know  
I'll never be in love with you  
Can't you see  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight, just for tonight  
  

Yes, yes there's a new world dawning  
Get dressed, quit dreaming you're falling  
Take notes and I'll tell you when you got it right  
No, no you can leave your attitude  
You're the only one it seems to matter to Count votes and you'll see it in a  
Brand new light  
Why can't you be a man about it  
Let me turn you into someone new  
I'm screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Baby, baby we're a perfect pairing  
Walk in the room and they can't stop staring  
I've gotten used to it, I've gotten used to you  
You'll never, never land another like me  
I think you're clever, please don't try to fight me  
Take notes and I'll tell you when you got it right  
Why can't you be a man about it  
Let me turn you onto something new  
I'm screaming in a fan  
I doubt that any of my words will make it through  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening  
Why can't you be a man about it  
(There's a new world dawning)  
We're swimming in a painted fountain  
(There's a new world dawning)  
This is your christening  
Find out what you been missing and  
I promise it'll make you fell better  
This is your christening  
The audience is listening...  
  

Everyone Get Down  
Rock your body  
Work your body  
Rock it all night long  
Doesn't matter where you're from  
You gotta keep it goin strong  
On the beaches of Ibizia  
They got it goin on  
And they lose their mind every time  
They hear this song  
From Miami to Havannah  
From the streets of LA to the Kasbah  
Down in Mexico out to Tokyo  
All over the world there's a party  
I think it's time we get one started  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
You're getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how it's flowin through me  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
You're getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how it flows  
Rock your body  
Work your body  
Rock it all night long  
Enjoy it while it's underground  
It won't be there for long  
Simplify and amplify  
And unify us all  
Let yourself lose control  
When you hear this call  
From Miami to Havannah  
From the streets of LA to the Kasbah  
Down in Mexico out to Tokyo  
All over the world there's a party  
I think it's time we get one started  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
You're getting closer to me  
Check my sound and  
How it's flowin through me  
Everyone get down  
Move up now  
You're getting closer to me  
Check my sound  
And how it flows...  
  

If there was no tomorrow  
Then tonight would never end  
If we could freeze  
The hands of time  
I would stay here in your arms  
And not go back again  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever  
  
I've never felt this close to love  
Lyin' here face to face  
Far beneath the silver skies  
There's no one around  
To chase this night away  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever  
  
The world is ours tonight  
As long as we just believe  
The feelings that we hold inside  
Are in every heart that beats  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever

Fly  
When I was young  
I never had no rules  
I could do anything  
As long as I believed  
It's been a long time  
I made it through the rain  
You brought back everything  
And I have found my wings  
I can fly again  
I found my heart  
Waiting with you  
A love that's true  
I feel so alive  
I can fly again  
No letting go  
It's where I belong  
A love that's strong  
For all of my life  
Remember the times  
I looked for brighter days  
Hoping that things would change  
And turn it all around  
Now that you're here  
I can see everything  
Ride on the joy you bring  
And lift me off the ground  
I can fly again  
I found my heart  
Waiting with you  
A love that's true  
I feel so alive  
I can fly again  
No letting go  
It's where I belong  
A love that's strong  
For all of my life  
Repeat chorus (2x)  
  

Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
It's just so extra-ordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
It's all so fascinating  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And that's alright with me  
And that's alright to feel what you're feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I don't mind, I don't need no reason  
If it's good enough for you it's good enough for me  
And if I told you I could see what you can't see  
Would you say it's my imagination?  
'Cause what is real is only your reality  
It needs no explanation  
All that I need is what I see or rather what I feel  
You believe what you wanna believe  
And that's alright with me  
And that's alright to feel what you're feeling  
You know it makes no difference to me  
And I don't mind, I don't need no reason  
If it's good enough for you it's good enough for me  
Sometimes it's hard  
To know which way to go  
Just when you think you won't figure it out  
You'll know  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
It's just so extra-ordinary  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
It's all so fascinating  
Sometimes I like to sit and watch the clouds for hours  
Standing in the pouring rain just because it's raining  
All that I want is what I see or rather what I feel  
Rather what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel?  
All that I want is what I feel  
Do you feel like I feel?  
Do you feel like I feel?  
Do you feel like I feel?

No, I'm not making that promise again  
Nothing can change my mind  
Nothing at all  
'cause love has a way of comin' undone  
'till I'm all alone with my heart  
And here I'll stay  
And I always thought I'd see you again  
Oh how it hurts, every time you've crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been,  
But I always thought I'd see you again  
Now there's no reason to run for the phone  
No need to hold my breath  
Hopin' it's you  
Each time I see someone we used to know  
Or go some place we used to go  
It's not the same  
'cause I always thought I'd see you again  
'oh how it hurts every time  
You've crossed my heart since then  
Gonna give up all it takes  
To hold what might have been cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Love doesn't come when you need love  
It's not always there when you fall  
Try as you may, you got nothin' to say  
Nothing at all  
I always thought I'd see you again  
Oh how it hurts every time  
You've crossed my heart again  
Gotta give it all it takes  
To hold what might have been  
Cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Cause I always thought I'd see you again  
Again  
Again  

Children behave  
That's what they say when we're together  
And watch how you play  
They don't understand  
And so we're  
  
[Chorus:]  
Running just as fast as we can  
Holdin' on to one another's hand  
Tryin' to get away into the night  
And then you put your arms around me  
And we tumble to the ground  
And then you say  
  
I think we're alone now  
There doesn't seem to be anyone around  
I think we're alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound  
  
Look at the way  
We gotta hide what we're doin'  
'cause what would they say  
If they ever knew  
And so we're  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
I think we're alone now  
There doesn't seem to be anyone around  
I think we're alone now  
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I will not breakdown  
(Tim Feehan, Joe Brooks, Gene Black)  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me  
Can't see nothing but a violent solution  
In this war of confusion in me  
I should run from you but I never would be free  
I will not breakdown (will you break down)  
I will not stand still (are you standing still)  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
Time was  
We could have a conversation without confrontation and tears  
Time was  
I wouldn't have to reminisce at all  
This time I'm gonna make a move,  
I'm gonna make an uphill climb  
That's what I've been waiting for  
Bad luck, I guess I'm not a bird in your cage no more  
I will not breakdown (will you break down)  
I will not stadn still (are you standing still)  
I will not fall to pieces on the floor  
Just like you want me to  
There's nothing left for me  
Can't you understand it  
But something left us here just standing in the burning ashes  
There's nothing left for me  
It's not the way I planned it  
But something left us here just buried in our circumstances  
Time was  
You could start a revolution with this disillusion I feel  
Time was  
You would never make a fool of me  
  

People say that you're no good for me  
People say it constantly  
I hear it said so much I repeat it in my sleep  
  
Maybe I am just a fool for you  
Maybe you're no angel too  
But all that talk is cheap  
When I'm alone with you  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
Not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
All the world is crazy anyway  
What's it matter what they say  
If I'm the one that's wrong  
Then let in be my mistake  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
You wouldn't be with me tonight if I didn't feel I was right  
What will it matter anyhow a hundred years from now  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you

(Tiffany, J. Brooks)  
Scarlet red  
Drips from my veins  
What's wrong with me  
That I imagine such things  
And if only for a moment  
Let there be peace  
And how can I  
Live with this pain  
I don't have the strength  
To conquer this shame  
And if only for a moment  
Let there be peace  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only  
Tell me why  
I'm left here alone  
I search for your voice  
But I should've known  
That if only for a moment  
You'd be with me  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only I could change the way  
You were torn away from me  
I would never let you go  
I'd burn away the plans we made  
Pretending to believe  
That I am not afraid  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
And tell me did you know  
That I still won't let it go  
And just maybe you're still flying free  
If only  
  
  

Wake up, wake up....  
Turn on the water  
Close the door  
I won't let you tear me down  
Just another moment  
When the sound of your voice  
Cuts me to the ground  
Locked in here just to make  
Myself feel better  
Look in the mirror  
And tell myself that I'm okay  
I know it doesn't matter  
Whatever I do  
It's always second best  
I gotta free my mind  
Exactly what you wanted  
You opened me up  
The secrets I confessed  
Wake up, wake up  
I'm not here just to  
Make you feel better  
Stroke your ego  
Live happy ever after  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
Anymore  
So many times  
I wanted to go  
But I just lost my way  
Watching you unravelling  
The last piece of thread  
That held me into place  
I don't care if you hear a word  
I'm saying  
I can only hear  
The voices screaming in my head  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
And I'm sick of dreaming pain  
Tossing and turning all night and waking wide up  
Now I'm really looking at the door should've made this move before  
I can't take this anymore  
I don't want no more nightmares in the night  
No not tonight  
I already seen the light  
I gotta free my mind  
And wake up, wake up  
I'm not sleeping  
And I ain't dreaming  
And I ain't fooled anymore  
Wake up  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
Go to wake up  
I done beat your game  
But I'm not even sleeping no more, I'm not even tired  
I'm not sleeping  
Just to wake up on the floor  
I'm not sleeping  
Anymore  

Somebody's got me looking for you

Who can it be  
  
Are you alone now, I know she's with him  
Are you at home now, i'd like to come in  
  
Johnny's got the inside moves

Johnny's got the inside moves  
Johnny's got the inside moves  
On me  
  
No matter how hard I try  
I can't get her out of your eye  
I don't know what you see in her  
  
Somebody's got me crying for you  
Somebody's got me crying for you  
Who can it be  
  
Are you alone now, I know she's with him  
Are you at home now, I'd like to come in  
  
Johnny's got the inside moves  
Johnny's got the inside moves  
On me

Let me teach you  
What Love has taught me  
Let me please you  
The kama sutra way  
Come and teach me  
What love has taught you  
Come and please me  
The kama sutra way  
It's crazy  
How I can tell you understand  
Givin my love a second chance  
I've broken trust that we once had  
I need you  
It's doesn't matter what's done before  
I know it's time for me to close that door  
I always knew that you'd be back for more  
Move your body baby with me  
Kama sutra baby with me  
Move you body baby with me  
Kama sutra baby with me  
Hold you hands out to me  
Out to me  
Hold you hands out to me  
Out to me  
Hold you hands out to me  
Out to me  
you like it  
The imagination so wild and new  
You doing things you said you couldn't do  
Holding positions til we both get it through  
now I like it  
My imagination so wild and new  
I'm doing things I never thought I could do  
Holding positions til we both get it through  
how you love me  
Pleasing my body baby as you want  
It's the beginning dance into the dawn  
Love's a bridge and it's time to jump  
  
  

Am I in or am I out  
Don't pretend that you don't know what I'm talking about  
In your eyes I can see a reflection of someone it's clearly not me and you  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more  
Make a wish now baby and I'll try to make it come true  
But I feel this time I'll be losing you  
Butterfly, I'm gonna letcha go  
I know I've done the same thing ten times before and you...  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more.  
And you ...  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more.  
Butterfly, I'm gonna letcha go  
I know I've done the same thing ten times before and you  

You keep me hanging like a kid on a corner  
Just because you think you can  
Don't be so certain that I'll always be there  
Just because I've always been  
People change  
And I've been changing  
Don't you notice after all this time?  
  
I'm not gonna be just another kid  
On a corner  
Hiding my heart  
Saving my love any longer  
I'm not gonna be just a kid  
On a corner  
  
You should know by now that  
Everything changes  
Even start fall from the sky  
So if your nights all seem a little  
Bit colder  
Just remember so do mine  
Once I tried  
Now I'm through trying  
You still don't know me after all this time  
  
I'm not gonna be just a kid on a corner  
Hiding my heart  
Saving my love any longer  
I'm going to be just another kid  
On a corner  
  
Looking down the street  
Out across the night  
It took some time to see

(ronan o'hanlon)  
He said everything is wrong  
I said nothing bad can last for long  
This time I'll bring you to your kneesoh it's just like hope  
It bites the dust but I believe  
I'm in the photograph  
That hangs up on a shelf  
And when the lights are low  
I feel just like monroe  
And I shine like an angel  
For the devil in him  
And the chains that surround him  
Will disappear  
But the light shines on me  
But the light shines on me  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
You make me glad to be here  
I don't wanna go  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
Don't let the light shine on me  
There was a game we played  
To pass the time away  
And when the lights were low  
I'd undress like bardot  
For the love of a stranger  
With a dangerous side  
And the more that I gave him  
The more he'd desire  
So I got up to leave  
And he said after me  
I know where you're going  
I know  
Well  
So I got up to leave  
And he said after me  
I know where you're going  
I know  
Well  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
You make me glad to be here  
I don't wanna go  
I kiss the ground I stand on  
I move around in circles  
Don't let the light shine on me  
Shine on me  
Don't let the light  
No  
Shine on me  

We're off to the right start  
Put your hand on my heart  
Feel it beat with sweet intention  
Don't tell me 'sit tight'  
I'm too excited tonight  
Every touch takes me to heaven  
Got so much love inside, you know we're gonna make it  
Come here and turn the key, unlock all this ecstasy  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair  
High as a kite now  
I've got perfect sight now  
I can see beyond forever  
It's gonna be just you and me boy  
Every day a new joy  
Loving more than we can measure  
So many dreams out there  
I know where we can find them  
Can't wait a minute more  
You're all I've been waiting for  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair  
Dancing together this dance that lasts forever  
Never been so in love  
Eyes bright and open, a thousand new emotions  
Raining down from above  
Let's start a life affair  
We have no time to spare  
To show how much we care  
Come on now let's start a life affair  
You know I'll be right there  
We make the perfect pair  

(harold beaty)  
Baby like a symphony  
That's how love should be  
Like a haunting melody  
Haunting my memory  
Ooh  
One day loneliness will bring  
You and I together again  
No doubt in my mind  
I know it's just a matter of time  
You were my first love  
And that your heart will always remember  
You'll be my last love  
Oh I'm yours, I'm yours  
Till the first of forever  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
So if your new love  
Calls another name in her sleep  
That's one of the symptoms  
That your hold on her is growing weak  
So don't torture your heart  
By paying for one more heartache  
You're only human  
You're entitled to more than one mistake  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Baby like a symphony  
That's how love should be  
Like a haunting melody  
Haunting my memory  
Ooh  
One day loneliness will bring  
You and I together again  
No doubt in my mind  
I know it's just a matter of time  
You were my first love  
And that your heart will always remember  
You'll be my last love  
Oh I'm yours, I'm yours  
Till the first of forever  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together again  
Loneliness will bring you and I together, together again  

Na na na  
You're in my head  
I can't believe I ever let you go  
But here you are  
You're with me everywhere I go  
Like a song  
I can't stop singin when the music ends  
Na na na  
I know exactly how it goes  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
I'm in so deep  
I can't believe that this is happening  
I feel the rush  
Whenever you are close to me  
In all my life  
I never thought I'd hear a song so sweet  
And I will never  
Ever lose this melody  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Now I found you  
I won't never ever let you go  
We'll be together  
Now for all eternity  
When I need you  
I just close my eyes and there you are  
I breathe the words  
And hear a simple melody  
And it goes  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet  
Na na na na na  
Your voice is haunting me  
Na na na na na  
Why won't it let me be  
Na na na na na  
I hear you in my dreams  
Nothing sounds so sweet...

All I want is written on my face  
You'e bound to find something  
And all your words that held me into place  
Were nothing but lies  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I can't see  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Don't mind me  
You know me inside out  
That's the way that you left me  
And you won't find me  
Begging for a chance  
To have you burn me again.  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
But I can't see  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Another time I might have watched the things I said  
Another place you might have left me here for dead  
Another time...  
Somebody...  
Open my eyes for a little while little while  
Make me forget all the things I see  
Til then til then don't know what I'll see  
Til then til then don't care what I'll see  
I'll stand and stare until I go blind  
Will you open my eyes?  
Open my eyes.  
  

[Chorus]  
Our love I could never live without it  
Our love call my name and I'll be there  
Our love no one here could ever doubt it  
Our love your heart our love  
  
Time has said that when we're together  
There won't be a never to keep us apart  
I believe this love will grow stronger  
Our days will grow longer  
Your love's in my heart  
There were times when I thought that we would never be  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Now I know that it's real  
The way that I feel  
And baby I want to say that you make my life a joy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I know that we'll be together  
Forever and ever 'till the end of time  
Here's a love that burns like a fire  
Yet filled with desire  
And sweeter than wine  
Could it be that we are living in a fantasy  
Some say it can't be true  
Now I just can't conceal  
All this passion the thrill  
Come let me show me that I love you  
It's true I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My love and your love  
I said together not without it  
Not anyone could ever doubt it  
Said our love together forever and ever  
In love the sky I fly above  
And I can't fly without our love

Have you ever been kicked to the curb  
When the party finally ends  
Just when I thought that you left me for dead  
You dust me off again  
  
Maybe you thought you could throw me away  
Like a shoe that doesn't fit  
But you've created your Frankenstein  
And now you've gotta live with it  
And here I am  
  
Thought I'd turn and walk away  
Guess this ain't your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
I'm here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you don't believe it  
You've done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
Who cares if you hate my dog  
Maybe I'll get another  
Just to piss you off  
  
I don't mind tying up the phone  
And sleepin' in real late  
Haven't you noticed me fillin' the fridge  
With all the foods you hate  
And here I am  
Thought I'd turn and walk away  
Guess this ain't your lucky day  
  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
I'm here to put you through hell  
Too bad if you don't believe it  
You've done it to yourself  
Too bad if you think I'm leavin'  
Who cares if you hate my dog

You said goodbye  
And broke this heart inside of me  
Teardrops fell  
Like hours to eternity  
The room was silent  
As some forgotten melody  
Your words of steel  
Still echo in my memory  
  
Promises made, promises broken  
Promises made, promises broken  
  
I thought we had a chance  
To really make it last  
Now the future looks to me  
Like some unwelcome guest  
I'll be alright  
As soon as I get over you  
But this time it won't be  
Such an easy thing to do  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken  
  
Caught up in the sorrow  
Tangled in dreams  
In the lonely hours  
Of silent screams  
In the heart of the darkness  
I break down  
I feel the spirit of you  
All around  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken  
Promises made are  
Promises broken

(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)  
(Sexual, sexual, irresistible)  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
It's time to make my move  
Somethin' good  
Is goin' on  
A phenomenon  
I'm not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe it's physical but I don't care  
This time I'm letting go  
So turn the lights down low  
I'm gonna move it slow  
And I won't let go  
We're gonna ride it, ride it  
Keep it goin' on  
Til the break of dawn  
Baby all night long  
We're gonna ride it, ride it  
No doubt about it  
I can't deny  
The way you make me feel  
Let's not imagine  
It's no dream  
It's somethin' real  
I never thought that love could be so sexual  
But now I'm here with you and I'm not scared  
To let my feelings show  
Repeat chorus  
I thought about it  
Me and you  
It's time to make my move  
Somethin' good  
Is goin' on  
A phenomenon  
I'm not that kind of girl to be so sexual  
Maybe it's physical but I don't care  
I'm not letting go  
Repeat chorus  
  
  
  

There she goes with a smile on her face  
Riding right next to you  
Goin' out to all those places  
You used to take me to  
  
Wearin' your jacket like it was her own  
I used to wear it so well  
Why on earth did I let you go  
If I hadn't I'd be with you still  
  
Call it jealousy, call me a fool  
But it's more than my eyes want to see  
  
'Cause it should've been me  
With you tonight  
It should've been me  
There by your side  
Seein' you both is hard to believe  
'Cause it should've been me  
  
Flashin' that ring in everyone's face  
The one I gave back last week  
I wonder if you're tellin' her things  
You used to whisper to me  
  
To say it's over don't work anymore  
'Cause it's more than my heart wants to feel  
  
It should've been me  
With you tonight  
It should've been me  
There by your side  
Seein' you both is hard to believe  
'Cause it should've been me  
  
She looks so satisfied  
So close to you that I  
Can't help but wonder why  
I said goodbye last night  
As tears drop from my eyes

(Tiffany, T. Feehan, G. Black)  
I got a feeling  
Everything's gonna be alright  
And I still find my way  
And I heard  
It's always darkest before the storm  
So come on let it rain  
Everything was different when I was seventeen  
The world was so much brighter  
Now I finally found the truth  
Of what they hid for me  
That world was so much kinder  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
I believe  
That we were meant to learn from our mistakes  
And stumble along the way  
Now I know  
That people are gonna grap what they can take  
Then just turn away  
Everybody's searching  
But no one really knows the truth  
The world is upside down  
What it's all about right now  
Will soon turn to gray  
Their promises have faded  
Silence  
Silence  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
All my little merry friends  
Have turned their backs on me  
Excuse me if I'm jaded  
I'm so tired of people telling me  
How it should be  
Their promises have faded  
Silence  
Silence  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
Silence  
  
  

Baby take the long way home  
Don't stop at every light  
The wind is blowing you right through me tonight  
I'm somewhere in the ozone  
And I can hardly breathe  
Perfume and leather baby  
It's you and me together baby  
What good is living in paradise  
If you don't let yourself go once or twice  
Nobody's giving me better advice  
Show what you're feeling  
You wouldn't be stealing  
  
[Chorus]  
Smother me with those eyes Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes, yeah  
Promise me they don't lie they don't lie  
They don't lie  
Smother me with those eyes Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes, yeah  
Cover me once or twice Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
We fell into it baby  
This mood is like a dream  
The night we've waited for so long it seems  
Has come, to make us crazy, and we got  
No place to hide  
Heroes and virgins baby  
Life gets so urgent baby  
Being your friend has been very nice  
But I don't want to be after tonight  
The moon is giving us its perfect light  
The radio's beating  
And the words keep repeating  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby I'll stay devoted to you dedicated  
Next to you I just want to be with you baby  
Maybe I'll stay devoted to you dedicated  
Next to you I just want to be with you baby

These arms of mine they are lonely  
Lonely and feeling blue, these arms of mine  
They are yearning, yearning from wanting you  
And if you would let them hold you  
Oh, how grateful I will be  
These arms of mine they are burning  
Burning from wanting you, these arms of mine  
They are wanting, wanting to hold you  
And if you would let them hold you  
Oh, how grateful I will be  
Come on now, baby  
Come on, come on baby, now  
Just be my little woman, just be my lover  
Oh, I need your warmth  
I need your loving arms to hold me tight  

Written by tiffany and nancy bryan  
I've been down many roads  
Sometimes life can be unkind  
I didn't wonder where I'd go  
Didn't know what I might find  
What you got was not expected  
And when you feel that time is running out on you  
Chorus:  
The winding road that takes me home  
I'm going there someday I know  
The winding road that takes me home to you  
Is there beneath the shadows  
The winding road  
Memories of the love we had  
Never fade away  
Tears of joy for the promises  
That will come again someday  
When you walked out it was unexpected  
I'm trying to find my way back to you  
Chorus  
The winding road  
The truth can leave you breathless  
And the truth can set you free  
I've got all these questions  
Living inside of me, inside of me  
Chorusx2  
The winding road  
The winding road  
The winding road  

Sky rise so haunting on the other side of the street  
Two thin white lines between where you are and where you should be  
I know sometimes when you fly you think you're larger than life  
But then you come crashing down and you're asleep on the ground  
A king without his crown  
Chorus:  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
Anymore, not ever  
This park is an island in a sea of despair  
In the heart of the city of angels who aren't even there  
I see you praying for hope while you keep worshipping dope  
The devil right by your side and I see death in your eyes  
Will you live or do you have the will to die  
CHORUS  
Doo, doo, doo, doo  
I want to do things before they become  
The things I should have done in my life  
CHORUS  
We don't belong down here  
You don't belong down here  
You don't belong and we don't belong  
We don't belong down here  
We don't belong down here  
We don't belong  
No one belongs down here anymore  
Not ever
