Follow me, I'll lead the way, your fears will soon overtake  
Hide your infinite tears inside, it seeks your smallest break  
Screaming as if nothing helps, you press on to survive  
Playing out the fantasies of a force that keeps you alive  
  
He'll have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
He'll satisfy your every need  
You'll never be the same  
  
Take my hand, I'll show you how,  
You've just one life to live  
The road you're on goes straight to hell,  
Your life is yours to give  
His fantasies of all of you are much too great to see  
This world your living is so unreal, perfected just for me  
  
He'll have you down on your knees  
You play his fatal game  
He'll satisfy your every need  
You'll never be the same

Waiting the hour destined to die  
Here on the table of hell  
A figure in white unknown by man  
Approaching the altar of death  
High priest awaiting dagger in hand  
Spilling the pure virgin blood  
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death  
Answer his every command  
  
Death will come easy just close your eyes  
Dream of the friends you'll see  
Heavenly failure losing again  
Move on to a new form of life  
  
Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned  
Confronting the evil you dread  
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul  
Soon you will meet the undead  
  
Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned  
Confronting the evil you dread  
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul  
Soon you will meet the undead  
  
Enter to the realm of Satan!  
  
Blood turning black, the change has begun  
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell  
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform  
Eyes dripping blood realization of death  
Transforming of five toes to two  
Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan  
  
A gift of powers disposed upon you  
Use them when you feel the need  
Master the forces and powers of Satan  
Controlling the creature's instinct  
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky  
Learn to resist the temptation  
Watching the angels sift through the heavens  
Endlessly searching for salvation

With our callous minds we infect  
Other ways of life no regrets  
Like a masochist we instigate  
While the rest of the world must tolerate  
  
Americon, it's all about the mother fucking oil  
Regardless of the flag upon it's soil  
In a blood bath we pad our fucking greed  
This precious hunt may take maintain liberty  
  
Americon, so here we live in a land of deceit  
That imprison the minds of the weak  
No immunity for swaying the odds  
From this resistant strain Americon  
  
Americon, some feel the need to play God  
No immunity for swaying the odds  
From this resilient plague Americon  
  
With our poison minds we infest  
Other ways of life we ingest  
In a blood bath we steal you dignity  
This precious hunt it may take liberty  
  
Americon

Awakened I have become  
Light now slips away  
Manipulate your mind  
Darkness is my slave  
  
Taste the sins of Hell  
The blood that I so crave  
The last thing that you see  
Is the hunger in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood sucking creatures of the night  
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light  
Cries screaming out every fright  
Eagerly awaiting plight  
Apparitions from the pits of Hell  
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell  
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep  
Addicted to your blood  
At dawn they sleep  
  
Unveil the hidden coffin  
Lift the lid of terror  
Feel the deadly cold  
Freeze you from inside  
  
Perceiving your intentions  
To slay the phantom form  
Raise the stake in malice  
You cannot plunge it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Beware the image unseen  
Stalks your soul  
Your corpse's redeem  
  
Eternal damnation you just reward  
A servant of our Lord  
By your accord  
  
Admonish of the cruciform  
Impalement  
Immortality's scorned  
  
Rise hold fast your faith  
To lie dormant  
Is certain Death  
  
(Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror  
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite  
Linked together by one trait  
The Hell-filled need to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)  
  
Emerging from their Hellish tomb  
Taking flight amidst the night  
The evening skies are raining Death  
  
Swooping down from shadowed skies  
Taking simple human form  
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  
  
Lock their jaws into your veins  
Satanic soldiers strike their prey  
Leaving corpses waiting for the change  
  
Blood dripping from the jaws of Death  
Not enough to satisfy  
They must drain your soul of life

It's the feel of your blood  
As it flows smoothly down my skin  
Intoxicating my soul  
Immortality, seducing me  
  
Burning in your own hell, which now binds you to me infinitely  
Spirits of angels don't weep for you enticing me  
Vanity, blood  
Left for you to drink  
  
Eternity waits for you  
Vanity, blood  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you to drink  
  
Frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins  
Are you insane?  
At your mercy they suffered while you sat there painless  
Vile and shameless  
  
Crowned you are now for the merciless sins  
It's the end  
Your beauty through order is where blood flows through you  
Where it begins  
  
Vanity, blood  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you  
Vanity blood  
  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you to drink  
Young life striped down of all it's dignity  
Sliced flesh pours out it's youthfulness  
  
My lust will never be fully quenched  
Your screams tell me that you're not prepared to die  
  
Creature from hell why can't you see the things I see?  
Mirror tells me that you were always meant for me  
You are my sacrifice  
Blood is the deficit  
  
Biting the flesh, face my sick prelude  
Now meet your frozen death  
God did not do this  
Heated iron bar I will insert inside your cunt  
  
Mistress of cruelty, a name that will not die  
You are my sacrifice  
Blood is the deficit  
Bathing in blood, your heart, your soul, your god  
  
It all belongs to me  
God belongs to me  
It all belongs to me  
  
Murder is my birthright the bloodline proves aristocracy  
Walled in, left for dead, your actions show no hypocrisy  
My birthright, is murder  
Birthright, murder  
  
Birthright, murder

Cursed  
Black magic night  
We've been struck down  
Down in this Hell  
Spells surround me day and night  
Stricken by the force of evil light  
The force of evil light  
  
Cast  
Under his spell  
Blinding my eyes  
Twisting my mind  
Fight to resist the evil inside  
Captive of a force of Satan's might  
A force of Satan's might  
  
Fighting the curse  
Break it I must  
Laughing in sorrow  
Crying in lust  
  
My strength slips fast  
Soon I must fall  
Victim of fortune  
My sources grow small  
Life slips away  
As demons come forth  
Death takes my hand  
And captures my soul

Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you it's my conviction  
That sets me apart from the rest  
  
I live for competition  
Your cynicism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
Setting the standard that all will follow  
  
I live it every day  
Don't know another way  
  
Within my eyes there's devastation and fury  
You can't understand  
In my fight  
Win by attrition I bring it with all that I fucking am  
  
You never dealt with such rejection  
Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal  
You've never seen so much aggression  
I am the scream to your fucking silence  
  
I live it every day  
Don't know another way  
  
Attitude is my addiction  
I live life with no regret  
Unlike you it's my affliction  
That creates the template of all that I am  
  
You know and I know  
No matter what you say  
You'll be beaten today  
Like every other day  
  
Something about you  
Keeps you from letting go  
Of lame obsessions  
Built up inside you  
Forget the guesswork  
You're starting at the source  
Gazing into my eyes  
You'll see there's no remorse  
'Cause this is my war  
All day and every day  
It's all about the conflict  
Yeah!  
  
Bring on the competition  
Your pessimism only makes me stronger  
I am the culmination  
The fucking standard that all will follow  
  
I live it everyday  
Don't know another way

Fear is just interpretation  
Feeds my motivation  
Our time together is  
A bloodbath of serenity  
Plead no more  
There's no confusing the finale  
Excitation  
My rancid passion is electrified  
  
Accept this  
My religion of torture  
I can't see any purity  
Just imperfection and obscenity  
My blood soaked hands devise  
Your slow methodic demise  
Asphyxiate the world  
It's blind without me  
  
Catatonic  
Catatonic  
I'm numb in priceless solitude  
Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near  
  
Visions of decapitation  
My mental masturbation  
I try to resurrect  
Your consciousness, your intellect  
Once so pure  
Your pain excites and it tests me  
Excitation  
The empty stare emitting from your eyes  
  
Embrace it  
My religion of torture  
All I see are the impurities  
The imperfections and obscenities  
  
Accept it  
The religion of torture  
Excitation  
The rancid passion coming from your eyes  
  
My blood soaked hands devise  
Your slow methodic demise  
Asphyxiate the world  
It's blind without me  
  
Catatonic  
Catatonic  
I'm numb in priceless solitude  
Exterminating all the voiceless multitudes  
I can't stop because it's so hypnotic  
Catatonic

Frantic minds are terrified  
Life lies in a grave  
Silent death rides high above  
On the wings of revelation  
Multi death from chemicals  
Arrogance has won  
Annihilation must be swift  
Destroy without destruction  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare  
  
Artificial fucking peace  
Line up in a death row  
Generals in their slow defeat  
Diminished from this hell  
Banished from the dying world  
The lords of hell await  
Dogs of war are helpless prey  
To immortality  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare!!!  
  
Fuck it up!  
  
Liquidate  
The torture kills the troops that try to fight  
Terminate  
Human pesticide bring days of doom  
Mist falls  
The deadly gas that brings them to their knees  
Sacrifice  
Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell  
  
Mummified regions lying in dust  
Fall victim to this game  
Petrified corpses bathing in rust  
Taken without being blamed  
Falsified spirits farther they fall  
Soon they will join us in hell  
See the sky burning the gates are ablaze  
Satan awaits eager to merge  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare  
  
Warfare!

Can't explain the other side  
Answers lost before their eyes  
Violence surges from inside  
A state of mind that never dies  
Born into a chosen way  
Life that doesn't fit today  
To die a painful death it seems  
Is better than your misery  
Contemplating rearranging  
Changing all your ways of thinking  
  
Everyday your life seems like  
It's pushed into a hole  
Acting out another's needs  
To rule a soul eternally  
Adjusting to another set  
Of values takes its toll  
Growing in a lunacy  
That plays on your stupidity  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Born without a brain  
Helpless in your name  
All you do is pray  
Living is your pain  
  
Mentality so small you can't  
Accept another side  
Your point of view a memory  
Because it doesn't mean a thing  
The resurrections waiting for  
A world without a sin  
The temples all will crumble  
While awaiting for it to begin  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Losing is your way  
Mental destiny  
I can see your strain  
You don't want to be saved  
  
Can't you see no validity  
Must control silencing of souls  
Show decay spreading through your brain  
Devastate the deviant will dominate  
  
Can't you see there's no validity  
Your way is not the only way  
Slow decay is spreading through your brain  
Don't you see the power of the enemy  
Tyranny total supremacy  
Control the silencing of souls  
Slavery within the entity  
Devastate, dominate  
  
Can't explain the reason why  
Someone would rather live than die  
If dying is the only way  
Top end a life of mental sins  
All your life he's been the cause  
A man impaled onto a cross  
Pure religious holocaust  
If religion dies it's not my boss  
  
Perception always biased  
Feeding off a fallacy  
Your systematic way of life  
Decided for you every night  
Intentional conflicting words  
Avoid solidity  
Blinded by the holy light  
That constantly consumes your mind  
  
Circle of beliefs  
Secrets never keep  
Living in a lie  
Right before your eyes  
Burning in my wake  
Souls are free to take  
Your following a fake  
Everyone awake

Body that rests before me,  
With every dying breath,  
Spellbound and gagged,  
I commence your flesh to dirt.  
  
Body that lay before me,  
In everlasting death.  
Entombed in abscess,  
To rot and lie stinking in the earth.  
  
Empty altar awaits its victim  
Stained glass windows black.  
Candles burn the midnight oil,  
Incense fills the night.  
  
Observing trance awaking state  
Lying still unknowing.  
Reciting the passages of time  
Prepare for the impaling.  
  
Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,  
A power of the mind.  
Death shines on the air of silence,  
A ritual of endless time.  
  
Purged of your dead body,  
Sacrificed of your life.  
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire  
Enter the kingdom of desire.

I need no redefine  
All the things I hate today  
Politics that fail  
From a president derailed  
I hate the shit economy  
I might as well be sodomy  
I know that in the end  
I'm expected to pretend  
  
But I can't relate  
To your verbal idiocy  
No one's in control  
When the government's the enemy  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Is anarchy  
  
Actions of hostility  
Breeds conformity  
Annihilation will begin  
Extermination from within  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Insanity  
  
I need no redefine  
How I see the world today  
Seems that all the war  
Didn't even up the score  
It's only mind pollution  
There is no resolution  
Still I know that in the end  
I'm expected to pretend  
That I can't think for myself  
Blame it all on someone else  
Half-hearted smile  
While you look the other way  
I can't relate  
To your verbal idiocy  
No one's in control  
When the government's the enemy  
  
So light the fuse  
Impose your views  
Consfearacy  
Complacency  
Is your demise

Night will come and I will follow  
For my victims, no tomorrow  
Make it fast, your time of sorrow  
On his trail, I'll make you follow  
  
Quarters for the criminally insane  
The sentence read for life I must remain  
The path I chose has led me to my grave  
To try again I'd have no other way  
  
Quarters for the criminally insane  
Escape for me has fast become a game  
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace  
Endangered species end the human race  
  
Branded in pain  
Marked criminally insane  
Locked away and kept restrained  
Disapprobation, but what have I done  
I have yet only just begun  
To take your fuckin' lives!  
  
(Night will come and I will follow  
For my victims, no tomorrow  
Make it fast, your time of sorrow  
On his trail, I'll make you follow)

Eyes upon me  
Watching me in my perpetual sleep  
Dreams deceive me  
My future depends on a mindless dream  
I've fallen from promises  
Damned to take risks on my own  
The masterful science that freezes your  
Mind and your soul  
The wretched dream is realized  
The human race is to be crystallized  
  
Thoughts of laughter  
Filling the head of the master in charge.  
Worlds of wonder  
Is this a cure or a painless death  
I'll fight and resist  
Till they all see the end that is near  
The doctors the lawyers and G-men  
Are living in fear  
Living my life with one distant hope  
A cure that will kill my invincible foe

Devious to those unknown  
He walks below the land  
Alluring victims to their death  
Perish to the sand  
  
Master of the blackened arts  
Living his decree  
Thrives amongst the Seven Gates  
Searching for the keys  
  
[Chorus]  
I have seen the darkened depths of Hell  
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell  
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity  
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly  
  
Chants of evil incantation  
Fill the murky night  
Free the Devil's knights of Hell  
Unleash their growing spite  
  
Directing power forcibly  
The fire of Hell is cast  
Resurrect from crypts of Death  
A demon from the past  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cringe with fear  
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell  
Death will come searching for  
Your mere soul  
Still you are eager to seek your fate  
All that lie here are remains of Death  
  
Grinding bones, screaming skulls  
Broken by the lapse of time  
Decay to powder, ashes to dust  
Diminishing, disintegrating  
Man's soul and mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Empty space tracks throughout  
I make my claim  
  
Darkness covers the world  
My Kingdom, my Domain

Oppression is the holy law  
In God I distrust  
Italic monuments will fall  
Like ashes to dust  
It's war and creed the master plan  
The battle's where it all began  
It's propaganda shouts despair  
And sends this virus everywhere  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
The pestilence of Jesus Christ  
There never was a sacrifice  
No man who hung the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
I've made my choice  
666!  
  
Carussa Green's a pedophile  
No praying for the priest  
Confession finds a lonely child  
Now preys on the weak  
You think your soul can still be saved  
I think you're fucking miles away  
Scream out loud, here's where you begin  
Forgive me Father for I have sinned!  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
The target's fucking Jesus Christ  
The one I'd love to sacrifice  
I'd nail him to the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
I've made my choice  
666!  
  
Jesus is pain  
Jesus is gore  
Jesus is the blood that is spilled in war  
He's everything  
He's all things dead  
He's pulling down the trigger pointed at your head!  
The fear your shoulded to the front  
Revelation, Revolution,  
I see through your cracked illusion!  
  
The war on terror just drags along  
My holy god it's growing strong  
It's propaganda shouts despair  
And sends this virus everywhere  
  
Religion is hate  
Religion is fear  
Religion is war  
Religion is rape  
Religion is obscene  
Religion is a whore  
  
There is no fucking Jesus Christ  
There never was a sacrifice  
No man upon the crucifix  
Beware the call for purity  
Infections their facility  
I've made my choice  
666!

Mankind in his insatiable search for divine  
Knowledge has discarded all biblical teachings  
  
Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression of  
Knowledge  
All structures of religion have collapsed  
  
Life prays for death  
In the wake of the horror of these revelations  
  
It was never imagined how graphic the reality that would  
Be known as the end  
Of creation  
Would manifest itself  
  
We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced  
Back to one single event  
  
We hold these truths to be painfully self-evident  
All men are not created equal  
Only the strong will prosper  
Only the strong will conquer  
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized  
God Hates Us All

Swerving through the street  
Drunk as fuck  
Searching for a open store  
I think I'm out of luck  
Maybe I'll find a mad mother on patrol  
  
Hit her car  
Smash it up  
Pull her out  
Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down  
  
Can't find any beer  
It's way past two  
There's just one thing  
We can do  
  
Hit her car  
Smash it up  
Pull her out  
Beat her up  
Take her money  
Run her down  
Drive her face out of town  
  
Drunk drivers against mad mothers

Death's pointed at your head  
Your mind on the trigger pull it  
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story  
Scene of your rage  
Death is not strange  
Blood on the walls  
You stand alone satisfied  
  
I'll wake the silence in you  
I'll shoot the violence through you  
  
Terrified by the thought that you are all alone  
Paralyzed by the fact that you are not alone  
You're losing your mind, I'm losing control  
You're losing your mind, as I bury your world  
  
I'll wake the silence in you  
I'll shoot the violence through you  
  
I can't remember yet someone always seems to die  
You are the reason why I became the chosen one  
I've got the right  
God makes no sense  
I've got the right  
I feel my back against the wall  
  
Death's pointed at your head  
Your mind on the trigger pull it  
Bludgeon bodies give up their muted horror story  
  
Scene of my rage  
Scene of my rage  
Death is your name  
You're facing your grave  
  
I taste your tears caress your face  
I watch you lie insane  
Dying for love  
Praying to die  
  
I want what's inside you  
Dressed in your blood  
You wear it well  
Dying because I care  
  
Your eyes are wide but you can't see  
Rotting my lust away  
I'll shoot the violence through you  
And wake the part that's dead  
I hate the silence in you  
I want what's in your head

No one could ever doubt my rapture  
As you too will soon discover  
No one will ever cross my love  
Deadly consequence will rise above  
  
Lying all alone  
Visions of erotic bliss  
Feel your warmth from inside your skin  
A fever I can not resist  
  
Desire I would kill for you  
Right or wrong I'd do anything  
True and pure the intensity  
Every time death is next to me  
  
Lying all alone  
Visions of erotic bliss  
Feel your warmth from inside your skin  
A fever I can not resist  
  
Anxiously feeling grotesque  
Up against your flesh  
Forbidden fantasies  
Uncontrollable heat  
  
Find yourself all alone and dead  
Visions of corroding bliss  
Feel the warmth from inside your skin  
A sensation I can't resist

I embrace the darkness within  
Forever serve beneath its hand  
Horrid thoughts that surface to me  
Ceremony bloods command  
I will live through this forever  
I have done the things you grieve  
As you kneel before its evil  
Death is here deep inside your  
  
Skinned alive now naked  
Terrorized no humanity  
Seek salvation from an mia god  
Empty vessels chanting for your death  
  
Walk the streets beneath the shadows  
Searching for a cryptic bride  
Eat alive the conscience I hate  
Without pain I watch you die  
I will live through this forever  
I have done the things you grieve  
As you kneel before its evil  
My face is the last you'll see  
  
Soaked in blood the mask you wear  
Haunting cries the dead scream for me  
Staring eyes invoke no guilt  
I can taste your mind your lifeless  
  
Face the dead and dying  
Feel your life drain  
Through your soul  
Seek salvation from an M-I-A god  
Empty vessels chanting for the dead  
  
Death is yours  
Your veins have dried  
Staring eyes of glass now empty  
Still you speak with lips so cold  
In my head I hear you cry  
  
God is dead can't save me  
Taking lives with impunity  
Resurrection of a deviant Christ  
Feeding hate to capacity - deviance

Live by the sword and help to contain  
The helpless minds of you all  
Die by my hand in pools of blood  
Clutch yourself as you fall  
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims  
Children slaughtered in vain  
Raping the maids, in which they serve  
Only the words of the Lord  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword  
  
Satan watches all of us  
Smiles as some do his bidding  
Try to escape the grasp of my hand  
And your life will no longer exist  
Hear our cry, save us from  
The Hell in which we live  
We turn our heads toward the sky  
And listen for the steel  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword  
  
Watch as flowers decay  
On the cryptic life that died  
The wisdom of the wizards  
Is only a nurtured lie  
Black knights of Hell's domain  
Walk upon the dead  
Satan's sits upon  
The blood on which he feeds  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword

Drones since the dawn of time  
Compelled to live your sheltered lives  
Not once has anyone ever seen  
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy  
I'll instigate I'll free your mind  
I'll show you what I've known all this time  
  
God hates us all, god hates us all  
You know it's true god hates this place  
You know it's true he hates this race  
  
Homicide-suicide  
Hate heals, you should try it sometime  
Strive for peace with acts of war  
The beauty of death we all adore  
I have no faith distracting me  
I know why your prayers will never be answered  
  
God hates us all, god hates us all  
He fuckin' hates me  
  
Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark  
Global chaos feeding on hysteria  
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game  
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high  
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time  
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies  
  
I never said I wanted to be god's disciple  
I'll never be the one to blindly follow  
  
Man made virus infecting the world  
Self-destruct human time bomb  
What if there is no god would you think the fuckin' same  
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith  
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say  
I got my own philosophy  
  
I hate everyone equally  
You can't tear that out of me  
No segregation separation  
Just me in my world of enemies  
  
I never said I wanted to be god's disciple  
I'll never be the one to blindly follow  
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple  
  
I reject this fuckin' race  
I despise this fuckin' place

War!!!  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
[Chorus]  
War!!!  
I don't want your war  
War!!!  
We don't need your war  
We don't need your war  
War!!!  
  
Military beasts starvin' countries  
Drama brings you to your knees  
Spill your blood to save humanity  
Dyin' for the food we feed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our government is fucked  
Sure to bring us down  
The media incites civil unrest  
Hatred can bring you down  
  
Injustice drives you crazy  
It drive l.a. insane  
In this generation  
Hatred is the name  
  
[Chorus]  
War!!!  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Bastard magic should make you cry  
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Police can make me under stress  
While all L.A.'s a fuckin' mess  
Don't patronize my fuckin' ass  
Some heads will get crashed  
  
L.A. '92  
  
Billy's got himself a gun  
He's goin' to fuckin' war  
He won't revert to sticks and stones  
Just bullet holes and broken bones  
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos  
Don't give a fuck!  
  
Covert body knock ya down  
No weight support so taken down  
The juk-jock, a lock in a cell  
We ain't got shit, now had enough  
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos  
Don't give a fuck!  
  
Disorder!!! [Repeat x8]

This fucking country's lost its grip  
Subconscious hold begins to slip  
The scales of justice tend to tip  
  
The legal system has no spine  
It's corroding from inside  
Slap your hand you'll do no time  
  
Reality on vacation  
All across a blinded nation  
Mentality under sedation  
  
Anyone can be set free  
On a technicality  
Explain the law again to me  
  
Here in 1994  
Things are different than before  
Violence is what we adore  
  
Invitation to the game  
Guns and blades and media fame  
Every day more of the same  
  
Murder, mayhem, anarchy  
Now are all done legally  
Mastermind your killing spree  
  
Unafraid of punishment  
With a passive government  
There's nothing for you to regret  
  
Nothing to regret  
  
Unimposing policy  
No enforcing ministry  
Gaping with judicial flaws  
Watching a fading nation crawl  
  
Clashing with the public's frame  
I'm the one that's place in fame  
Legislature sets the stage  
Social slaves caught in my rage  
  
Administrative anarchy there's nothing  
You can do to me  
The world around you drifting to a  
Continental tomb you see  
Violence is my passion  
I will never be contained  
Living with aggression and its  
Everlasting reign

Awaken  
In a web like hell  
How did "I reach this place  
Why are they haunting me  
I cannot look at God's face  
  
Paralyzing  
Brilliant light  
Trying to run  
Want to scream but cannot speak  
I cannot look at God's face  
  
Blind my eyes I can't see  
What is being done to me  
In my mind only pain  
All the memories are drained  
  
Victimized  
Specimen  
Deathless torture  
Void with no mercy  
Black shroud binds those who see  
  
Violated  
Naked before you I stand  
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone  
God's piercing through my soul  
  
Segments of my life  
Morbid pieces of reality  
Twisted personality  
Many faces yet faceless  
Familiar things give way to strange  
No mercy no reason but pain  
  
Fatal  
Subconscious control  
Threshold of pain unfolds  
Transfixed martyr saving race  
Who am I to judge thy grace  
  
Awaken  
In a web like hell  
How did I reach this place  
Why are they haunting me  
I cannot look at God's face

Breeding fast in poverty  
Infectious driving dormant seed  
Inside your carcass start to mate  
Left in charge to dominate  
Waiting to unfold  
Raging uncontrolled  
Adapt a potency  
Death machine, infest my corpse to be  
  
Unyielding kings of agony  
Test your body chemistry  
Pulmonary overthrow  
Possession of your inner throne  
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike  
Flood your veins commit slow death  
Deteriorate your makers met  
  
Perpetual demise  
On a fast decline  
Killing tendency  
Epidemic, permanent disease  
  
Incapacitate, fall into your fate  
Pain results in screams, bleed internally  
Years will pass before it can be cured

Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell  
No one can stop us tonight  
We take on the world with hatred inside  
Mayhem the reason we fight  
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost  
Then we return from the dead  
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength  
We conquer then move on ahead  
  
[Chorus]  
Evil  
My words defy  
Evil  
Has no disguise  
Evil  
Will take your soul  
Evil  
My wrath unfolds  
  
Satan our master in evil mayhem  
Guides us with every first step  
Our axes are growing with power and fury  
Soon there'll be nothingness left  
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on  
Evil is at our command  
We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls  
Consuming all that we can  
  
[Chorus]

Crisis feeds the lunacy  
All fear the new machine  
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime  
  
It's laid to rest without a contest  
All hail the new incompetence  
Masking you see what to believe  
A drone in the world of anarchy  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Castrate society  
Fictional reality  
  
Insecurity afraid of things you cannot see  
Words become the image of the enemy  
  
You can't dissect what was correct  
Vengeance based on how things were said  
Can't see your side conflicts with mine  
Frustrations lead to complete demise  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Every trial conspiracy  
Compassion is the enemy  
Paralyze, criticize  
Breaking through the wall of lies  
  
Suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse  
Everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse  
  
Screams in my head precede your death  
Can't hold the rage when the truth is shed  
Blind lead the bind line after line  
In a world too shallow to defy  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Castrate society  
Fictional reality

Metal and men clash once more to the end  
Warriors above with the power to kill descend  
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die  
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise  
  
[Chorus]  
Prepare for attack  
Your body will burn  
Endless war  
There's no return  
Prepare for attack  
Death will arrive  
Your orders are clear  
No way to hide  
Fight till death  
  
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes  
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape  
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave  
There is no future no [fucking] world to [be] save[d].  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[To reign in Hell]  
  
Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man  
Reign of death what is the final command  
Scepters of hate are dropped upon the Earth  
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth  
  
[Chorus]  
[Fight till death [Repeat x 3]]

Endure the pain  
You know my name  
I am your soul insane  
  
I am no one  
No one who cares  
I am your soul despair  
  
Your fear deceives  
Vulnerability  
Leaving an easy prey  
  
Consume your mind  
A power so divine  
Will take you and rape you blind  
  
Gemini master of demise  
Your death is my salvation  
To a kingdom mine  
My lord is my light  
The master of darkness  
Your death is my salvation  
To a kingdom mine  
  
You look at me with eyes of fate  
And see the graphic truth  
  
Your ignorance cannot shield you  
From your naked abuse  
Numbing of your moral sense  
Facing reality  
That life is unconditional  
And death is only the beginning  
  
The pain will never end...  
  
Walking slow, breathing heavy  
You could see death sweat  
How it shined  
An argument out of control in my mind  
  
I am here for the sole purpose of your death  
Walking slow breathing heavy  
You can see death sweat.  
  
I am here for the sole purpose of death  
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise  
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart  
Reflections of my soul  
Reflections of the dark

Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.  
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.  
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,  
Not content with wars we never won.  
  
Memories can't ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn.  
Rise ghosts of war.  
  
Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.  
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.  
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny  
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.  
  
[Memories can't ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn.  
Rise ghosts of war.]  
  
I deal in pain.  
All life I drain.  
I dominate.  
I seal your fate.  
  
I deal in pain.  
All life I drain.  
Memories can't ignore,  
Rise ghost of war.

God Send Death  
On your back look on to me  
You'll see genocide  
Face from death more than insane  
Profane pleading cries  
Watch you die inside watch you die  
  
God send death end misery  
Preach no love of ministry  
Pray for sin a shattered faith  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out to die  
  
Death is over due  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Putrid blood flows through my veins  
To thrive on demise  
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain  
Touching you inside  
Bleed you fucking dry  
Bleed on me  
  
Death's design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures flesh from bone  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out  
To die  
  
Death is overdue  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You taste your death in hand  
Your fingers bleed in vain  
Your scream-in your grave  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You pierce your throat and hands  
You've gone insane with pain  
Your blind screaming for your god  
Pathetic god  
  
Death's design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures  
Drown your mind in pain

What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you  
Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return  
  
Take your written rules, you join the other fools  
Turn to something new, now it's killing you  
First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm  
Disillusioning, you push the needle in  
From life you escape, reality's that way  
Colours in your mind satisfy your time  
  
You're having a good time  
But that won't last  
You make a fool of things  
You're living too fast  
Go on and destroy yourself  
Don't bottle it in  
You need someone to help you  
To put the needle in, yeah  
  
Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green  
Your eyes no longer see life's reality  
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin  
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin  
  
Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground  
Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave  
It's too late to turn, you don't want to learn  
Price of life it's high, now you're gonna die!

Fear runs wild in the veins of the world  
The hate turns the skies jet black  
Death is assured in future plans  
Why live if there's nothing there  
  
Specters of doom await the moment  
The mallet is sure and precise  
Cover the crypts of all mankind  
With cloven hove begone  
  
[Chorus]  
Sadistic minds  
Delay the death  
Of twisted life  
Malicious world  
  
The crippled youth try in dismay  
To sabotage the carcass Earth  
All new life must perish below  
Existence now is futile  
  
Decrepit breath, vile in its stench  
A world in decay  
Transgressor is as one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Convulsions take the world in hand  
Paralysis destroys  
Nobody's out there to save us  
Brutal seizure now we die

I stab you right between the eyes  
You awaken from the lies  
I said it ever since the inception  
Where the masters of deception  
I'm a godless heretic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
That's why it's become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Like a storm that devastates  
Religious power instigate  
Take religion to my confession  
There is no filter on my aggression  
With a blister open wide  
To keep the massacre alive  
I got cold devastation  
With my moral imperfection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Religious death, I instigate  
From what the bible demonstrates  
Does it document creation  
Of this hopeless infliction  
Of a godless heretic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
Not a god-fearing lunatic  
That's why it's become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane, my life profane  
I deny, defy, and spread a little hate, worldwide!  
  
Open life scars, crushing open wounds  
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you  
You left senseless mentally unfit  
Never fucking heard from you again  
Never fucking heard from again

The holy cross  
Symbol of lies  
Intimidate the lives of Christian born  
Speak of death  
The words of hate  
Anticipation grows amongst the dead  
Hell has seen  
The priests attempt  
To bring forth their lord of the cross  
Strike of twelve  
Raise the dead  
The chapel comes under attack  
  
The ghosts of sin  
Torment the priests  
Their altar will soon be destroyed  
Heaven's palace  
Turning black  
The church now belongs to the dead  
Blackened magic  
Infest with lust  
Lucifer rules supreme  
The crystal ball shows unknown fate  
The last thing that's heard is the screams  
  
Ghosts from hell invade this feeble shrine  
Heaven's holy house will fall in time  
Satan's morbid soldiers chant in lust  
Destruction of the church we'll burn the cross  
  
Attacking angels as they pray to god  
Tormented preachers hail the twisted cross  
Haunting the chapel  
Hell's demons prevail  
Death has come  
The house of god has failed

Existing on damnation's edge  
The priest had never known  
To witness such a violent show  
Of power overthrown  
  
Angels fighting aimlessly  
Still dying by the sword  
Our legions killing all in sight  
To get the one called Lord  
  
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see  
There's no price to pay just follow me  
I can take your lost soul from the grave  
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved  
  
Crucify the so called Lord  
He soon shall fall to me  
Your souls are damned your God has fell  
To slave for me eternally  
Hell awaits  
  
The Reaper guard's the darkened Gates  
That Satan calls his home  
Demons feed the furnace where  
The Dead are free to roam  
  
Lonely children of the night  
There's seven ways to go  
Each leading to the burning hole  
The Lucifer controls  
  
Priests of Hades seek the sacred star  
Satan sees the answer lies not far  
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you  
Satanic laws prevail your life is through  
  
Pray to the moon, when it is round  
Death with you shall then abound  
What you seek, for can't be found  
In sea or sky or underground  
  
Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp  
The seven bloody Gates of Hell  
Is where you'll live your last  
  
Warriors from Hell's Domain  
Will bring you to your Death  
The flames of Hades burning strong  
Your soul shall never rest  
  
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see  
There's no price to pay just follow me  
I can take your lost soul from the grave  
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved  
  
Sacrifice the lives of all I know they  
Soon shall die  
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell  
and keep the fire growing deep inside  
Hell awaits

I am the new hell on earth  
The lord of agony divine  
Domination, intimidation  
Lives within these eyes  
Reign of power  
Remorseless anarchy  
I am arrogance in the flesh  
Unleashed intensity  
  
Step aside for the nightmare  
Pure destruction stands before you  
No escape as the psycho  
Brings you misery  
The line starts here  
  
I am brutality the face of everlasting pain  
Annihilation, Obliteration  
Pulses in these veins  
Sheer defiance drives my hostility  
I am merciless to the core  
Chaotic fury breeds  
  
Step aside for the nightmare  
Pure destruction stands before you  
No escape as the psycho  
Brings you misery  
The line starts here  
  
Bring it all on  
Come and take on what you fear  
I'm the storm  
That towers overhead  
Ticking time bomb  
With an infinite charge  
Bringer of torture  
The master is here  
Everyone falls  
  
Here comes the pain  
You're no different from the rest  
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland  
Here comes the pain  
Your destruction manifests  
Lying there broken looking up as I still stand  
  
Bring it all on  
Come and take on what you fear  
I'm the storm  
That towers overhead  
Ticking time bomb  
With an infinite charge  
Bringer of torture  
The master is here  
Everyone falls

Illness, infected born mutilated strain  
Issue transfusion no one left to blame  
Nature's way of thinning out the human fucking herd  
  
Disease, to war to fear his own kind  
The human strain, returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child  
  
Cities, increase speed population rise  
Dying, the future process in the genes  
Death stalking man as he embraces the absurd  
Through peace, through life, the hatred of himself  
  
The human strain, returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child  
Death stalking man though peace, through life, though hatred of himself  
  
Death stalking man, as he embraces his crucifixion  
Skinless resurrection, from the bodies of the dead  
Sickness is increasing, as the oceans turn red  
  
Apparatus for self destruction, day of judgement is now at hand  
Decayed memories haunt vaccinated minds  
Risk contamination mechanism of death  
Anyone left alive scorch turn to ash  
  
Disease, war black death touching man  
The human strain, returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child

You were just a waste of sperm  
They way you look  
Makes my stomach turn  
The way you think  
Is no way at all  
  
God you really think you have balls  
  
I hate you  
Ain't it true  
I hate you  
And everything you do  
  
You walk around like a fucking dick  
And every time you're near  
You know I get real sick  
  
You're so stupid  
There's nothing in your head  
God how I wish that you were dead  
  
I hate you  
Ain't it true  
I hate you  
And everything you do  
  
You were just a waste of sperm  
They way you look  
Makes my stomach turn  
The way you think  
Is no way at all

I'm all jacked up  
I want you here  
In my room I want you dear  
  
And now it's time to bury my face  
Between your legs  
With my tongue in that special place  
  
Now I'm gonna be your God  
Now I'm gonna be your God  
I'm gonna be your God  
  
Now I'm ready to close my eyes  
To feel that warm deep throat action  
Now I'm ready to make you cum  
And fuck like dogs all night long  
  
Now I'm gonna be your God  
Now I'm gonna be your God  
I'm gonna be your fucking God  
  
I'm all jacked up  
I want you here  
In my room  
I want you dear  
  
Now I'm ready to make you cum  
And fuck like dogs all night long  
  
I'm gonna be your God  
I'm gonna be your God  
I'm gonna be your fucking God

In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby,  
Don't you know that I want you?  
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey,  
Don't you know that I'll always be true?  
  
Oh, won't you come with me  
And take my hand?  
  
Oh, won't you come with me  
And walk this land?  
  
Please take my hand!

Oh, won't you come with me  
And take my hand?  
  
Oh, won't you come with me  
And walk this land?  
  
Please take my hand

I want to, invite you, welcome you  
To my hate, to my scorn, to myself  
Saturate you, infest you, betray you  
Stimulate you, so eager for my lies  
For my lies, lies  
Lies in the name of god  
  
[lead: king]  
  
I take you, I play you, invade you  
Lacerate you, I scar you, innocence  
Masticate you, ingest you, become you  
Defenseless, I fill your emptiness  
With my lies, lies  
Lies in the name of god  
  
In this world of shit I exist  
Perfect world conforms I resist  
Disconnect the nerves from the spine  
Desecrate the walls of the mind  
Through these eyes no love is alive  
Through these eyes unrest never dies  
Through these lies compassion is lost  
Through these lies await the ungod  
Antichrist is the name of god [repeat: x4]

You go to the church, you kiss the cross  
You will be saved at any cost  
You have your own reality  
Christianity  
You spend your life just kissing ass  
A trait that's grown as time has passed  
You think the world will end today  
You praise the Lord, it's all you say  
  
Jesus saves, listen to you pray  
You think you'll see the pearly gates  
When death takes you away  
  
For all respect you cannot lust  
In an invisible man you place your trust  
Indirect dependency  
Eternal attempt at amnesty  
He will decide who lives and dies  
Depopulate Satanas rise  
You will be an accessory  
Irreverence and blasphemy  
  
Jesus saves, no need to pray  
The gates of pearl have turned to gold  
It seems you've lost your way  
  
Jesus saves, no words of praise  
No promised land to take you to  
There is no other way

Lurking in the dismal fog  
Hungry for your blood  
Seeking harmless victims  
Satisfy my needs  
  
Schizophrenic lunatic  
Uncontrolled desire  
Rape and ravage lady fair  
Pledged to die  
  
[Chorus]  
No apparent motive  
Just kill and kill again  
Survive my brutal thrashing  
I'll hunt you till the end  
My life's a constant battle  
The rage of many men  
Homicidal maniac  
  
Trapped in mortal solitude  
Lift the gleaming blade  
Slice her flesh to shreds  
Watch the blood flow free  
  
Hatred growing stronger  
None survive my wrath  
Suffer from the throbbing pain  
Yield your life to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kill the preacher's only son  
Watch the infant die  
Bodily dismemberment  
Drink the purest blood  
Unrelenting need to kill  
Death upon you now  
Anxiously awaiting  
Next in line.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Kill again)

You know the feeling  
When adrenaline takes control  
Can't beat the rush  
That leaves a suicidal hold  
  
Instinct spares no one  
Destroying the human heart  
The taste of blood  
Can rip your soul apart  
  
Devils that drive us  
Do not discriminate  
A state of mind  
That becomes the ultimate end  
  
Action reaction  
Blood line is not immune  
To the depth of human nature  
Inside of me and you  
  
A sociopath with empty eyes  
And no soul  
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone  
My blood runs cold  
  
Evils of passion  
Can drive reason to extremes  
Love hate and murder  
Temporary insanity  
  
On the edge of a  
Demented personality  
Emotional  
Pain is a deadly reality  
  
A sociopath with empty eyes  
And no soul  
Paranoid psychotic heart of stone  
My blood runs cold  
  
A choice is made of free will  
Just like the choice to kill  
Decisions to lose control  
My self-destructive rationale  
  
A choice is made, made of free will  
Just like the choice, the choice to kill  
In the speed of a moment  
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field  
  
A choice is made of free will  
Just like the choice to kill  
In the speed of a moment  
Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field

Enter my mind can you stop the rage  
No one shall mourn or pity my grave  
Fighting the world without remorse  
Searching for blood to never grow old  
A personal hell is where I reside  
Taunting death sounds cadavers in pain  
Judging my soul I am not his son  
Screaming God's name I want some more  
  
[Chorus]  
You love to hate me  
But you won't kill me  
Suicidal surge  
Desensitize the world  
  
Take what I want primordial ground  
Humanity bleeds from inside my veins  
Losing all grasp an evil so old  
Vengeance it breeds driving you insane  
Exhaust all will hanging by the neck  
Anguish within let it blind the eyes  
Better off dead us your epitaph  
Apathy feeds the human demise  
Absolute reign a malevolent mind  
Conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul  
Total addicting, corrupt and profane  
Force-fed lies in this chapel of lust  
Dancing in blood disciples enslaved  
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh  
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pessimistic dreams  
Realistic screams  
Crucify creation  
Magnify damnation  
Enter my mind can you stop the rage  
No one shall mourn or pity my grave  
Fighting the world without remorse  
Searching for blood to never grow old  
Conceptions so vice in this bottomless soul  
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh  
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross  
  
[Chorus]

Bombers in flight  
Trident missiles in the air  
My missiles underground  
Protect us till we're dead  
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow  
  
Push the button  
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal  
A bomber flying off their ramps  
Nuclear bombs explode  
  
Radio active people  
Search for medicine  
Pray for shelter  
Kill for food  
  
Mass starvation  
Contaminated water  
Destroyed Cities  
Mutilated bodies  
  
Memories of tomorrow, crying sorrow  
I'll kill myself  
I'd rather die  
If you could see in the future  
You'd know why  
  
Memories of tomorrow

Unknown are the caverns of the mind  
New realms of affliction lurk inside  
Unbound massive mental energy  
Your last breaths taken from you easily  
  
Incoherence disrupts your rationale  
Involuntary your last confessional  
No sense of being missing segments of time  
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind  
  
Mind control, pain unfolds  
I own all your sensations  
Weakening, reasoning  
Mesmeric full demolition  
Hypnotized, victimized  
Behold the threshold to the web  
Scream souls fear echoes  
Piercing boundaries of death  
  
Penetration of the window to your soul  
Deterioration of the mind, no self-control  
Temporary comprehend no memories  
Hollow carcass of a man, is all I leave  
  
Execution but a thought in the end  
Slowly erasing your life and what has been  
Passing victims in the land of secrecy  
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams

You will be the lucky one  
Who will see the deadly one  
You will die on your knees  
By the hand of Mr. Freeze  
  
Will you see when the rest are blind  
Will you remain frozen in time  
Will you flee underground  
  
Watch the blanket search the ground  
You will die on your knees  
By the hand of Mr. Freeze  
  
Horror awaits for those who evade  
Ice cold blood stops in their veins  
  
Arm yourselves to the T  
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze  
See the blood drop in your eye  
See your family burned alive  
  
I don't even know you  
I just know where you live  
I raided your child's bedroom  
And burned his virgin skin  
  
I crucified your nation  
I left the dead rot  
I parade down the street  
Carrying an iron cross  
  
The oceans have been ripped away  
It does no good to pray  
Catalysm  
Men restore to cannibalism  
  
I'm worth all you'd care for  
Then I'll fuck you in the ass  
I'm so fucking happy  
I'll kick your face and laugh  
  
Today's war stories  
At night you can hear him scream  
There's blood on your pillow  
This is no bad dream  
You try to think with reason  
But all you can do is scream

Mortuaries, dead of night  
My body starts to rise  
In my mind the horror lives  
To feel death deep inside  
  
Relentless lust of rotting flesh  
To thrash the tomb she lies  
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath  
I spit at your demise  
  
Virgin child now drained of life  
Your soul cannot be free  
Not given the chance to rot in Hell  
  
Satan's cross points to Hell  
The earth I must uncover  
A passion grows to feast upon  
The frozen blood inside her  
  
I feel the urge the growing need  
To fuck this sinful corpse  
My tasks complete the bitch's soul  
Lies raped in demonic lust  
  
Her stomach bursts the casket breaks  
The seed has taken form  
A writhing shape of twisted flesh  
The Devil's child is thrown  
  
Hungry for the smell of Death  
He rules forbidden evil  
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred  
The bastard now must die  
  
Lost souls of the dead  
Form legions that burst through Hell's Gates  
Death of one sacrifice  
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave  
Blood of one mortal man  
The fire grows stronger within  
Fate of a frenzied lust  
Lucifer takes my dark soul  
  
Down to the fiery pits of Hell  
(Down to the fiery pits of hell)

Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain  
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged  
  
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air  
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair?  
  
Ripping apart  
Severing flesh  
Gouging eyes  
Tearing limb from limb  
  
Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay  
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away  
  
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs  
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine  
  
Ripping apart  
Severing flesh  
Gouging eyes  
Tearing limb from limb  
  
(LEAD: HANNEMAN, KING)  
  
Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain  
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged  
  
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air  
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair  
  
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs  
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine  
  
Necrophobic can't control the paranoia  
Scared to die

Holy man open up your eyes  
To the ways of the world you've been so blind  
As the walls of religion come crashing down  
How's the ignorance taste the second time around  
  
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end  
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins  
  
Welcome to the horror of the revelation  
Tell me what you think of your savior now  
I reject all the biblical views of the truth  
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times  
I won't be force fed prophecies  
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind  
Join the new faith for the celebration  
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation  
  
Holy man come and worship me  
I am all that you ever wanted to be  
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew  
The epitome of evil shining through  
  
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end  
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins  
  
Welcome to the horror of the revelation  
Tell me what you think of your savior now  
I reject all the biblical views of the truth  
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times  
I won't be force fed prophecies  
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind  
I keep the bible in a pool of blood  
So that none of its lies can affect me  
  
This is new faith  
A different way of life  
Witness the shame  
See for yourself the lies  
I'll take the fight  
Bring it every time, any time  
Refuse to let them win  
My heresy begins  
  
Pray for life, wish for death  
Pray for life, know in time you'll pray for death  
  
Tear it away  
It lives inside your mind  
Silence the fear  
That keeps you pure inside  
Now you can see  
Life's atrocities endlessly  
Witness the miracle  
Witness the miracle  
  
Pray for life, wish for death  
Pray for life, with every breath  
You'll pray for death, you'll pray for death  
Embrace new faith, embrace new faith  
Yeah, new faith, yeah, new faith.

It's the terror that you've gotta miss  
And I wanna see you right in front of death  
Your eyes will shine  
We're all alone and there is no noise  
  
Step into my shadow  
With no remorse  
  
With no remorse you ain't gotta die  
The loudest noise can't make me happy  
Come on, bastards, feels so good  
The record's coming out, baby  
  
With no remorse I want to die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
"Remain calm, I'm coming to your house to kill you"  
  
I can't come down  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  
  
What you want me to do?  
What you want me to do?  
  
No remorse 'cause I wanna die  
  
No remorse  
With no remorse I wanna die  

Awake each day, to propaganda  
Complacency, conformity  
Relentless madness they regurgitate  
So save your breath, you can't coerce the strong with verbal warfare  
  
Defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to Christ or they will  
Watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak  
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god  
  
Replicate, like a virus that infects with disease  
The beckoning pestering, don't preach to me with your blasphemy  
Exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey  
There's symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you  
  
Fuckin' burn, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak  
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god  
False god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses  
  
Outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness  
No need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah  
I seek a deviant pariah  
  
Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect  
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries  
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued  
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow  
  
You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery  
  
You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness  
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed  
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again  
A target for all time, until the end  
  
I'll expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy  
Cos I am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology  
Intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Cos I am the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god

I breach your life  
Indoctrinate  
Police your thoughts  
Ask why I hate  
  
I lose control  
When I see your face  
Abusing power  
I infiltrate  
  
Continue lies  
Then masturbate  
I walk the line  
I'll do no time  
  
I hate your church  
I'll burn your state  
A bleeding heart  
A seal of fate  
  
There is no crime  
Within my mind  
  
I'll sell your life and preach your death  
A wicked plan born of contempt  
Bleeding my ideology through pain  
  
Audacious plans  
I calculate  
A new world view  
I'll re-instate  
  
Don't cross my path  
Or I'll see you burn  
You'll meet your end  
Find death alone  
  
No grave to mark  
The seeds you've sown  
You've pushed too far  
My secrets I defend  
  
I'll sell your life and preach your death  
A wicked plan born of contempt  
Bleeding my ideology through pain  
  
Demonize what is feared profane architect  
Skull and bones through the mind  
Barbaric thoughts of old  
Celebrate all unknown  
  
At last the head await  
The die is cast for the meek  
Inherit endless dead time  
Smell the victim are near  
  
Consume the catalyst  
Hunting masses for game  
Implanting septic thoughts  
Reaping terror through words while  
  
Armed behind your back  
Pseudo leaders betray  
Enslaving all of mankind  
Cast out the Demi God  
  
Dethrone the demagogue  
Cast out the church God  
I command your life  
And I don't care  
  
Let bullets rain  
From everywhere  
No suicide  
Will save you from yourself

You need to take a closer look at me  
Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side  
No matter what you think you're gonna see  
You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride  
You don't want none of me  
  
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain  
Pissing your common sense away  
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight  
For my own peace of mind, I'm going to  
Tear your fucking eyes out  
Rip your fucking flesh off  
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass  
Fuck you and your progress  
Watch me fucking regress  
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing  
Payback's a bitch motherfucker  
  
You only live to be a parasite  
Your life must suck when nothing's going your way  
Everything melts away before your eyes  
You're just a punk that doesn't have the sense to get away  
Get the fuck away  
  
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain  
Pissing your common sense away  
When you draw first blood you can't stop this fight  
For my own peace of mind, I'm going to  
Tear your fucking eyes out  
Rip your fucking flesh off  
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass  
Fuck you and your progress  
Watch me fucking regress  
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing  
Payback's a bitch motherfucker  
  
I will never become your fucking scapegoat  
I don't know how it feels to come up short  
I only want vengeance  
To come shining down on me  
I don't want you to die  
Before I get the chance to kill you myself  
  
You've got a fucking catheter in your brain  
Pissing your common sense away  
This is for the mind fuck  
This is for the hell of it  
This is for me, I'm going to  
Tear your fucking eyes out  
Rip your fucking flesh off  
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass  
  
Fuck you and your progress  
Watch me fucking regress  
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing  
  
Tear your fucking eyes out  
Rip your fucking flesh off  
Beat you till you're just a fucking lifeless carcass  
  
Fuck you and your progress  
Watch me fucking regress  
You were made to take the fall, now you're nothing  
Now you're nothing  
You ain't fuckin' shit

You better learn my name  
Cause I'm the one insane  
And I'm a constant threat  
You run in fear from my dark silhouette  
Inside my violent mind  
Chaos is all you'll find  
Anarchy uncontained  
Bear witness to the scorn of my campaign  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
Within my world of hate  
Disruption I instate  
Malicious entity  
Defile and desecrate humanity  
Alone they all will die  
Corroding from inside  
With no one left to save them  
As I'm dancing on the fucking graves  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
Take a look into my mind  
Where pleasure is refined  
Endless burning holes  
Of scarred souls  
Step inside my world of hate  
Where everything mutates  
Your senses under siege  
Ingest the virtues I feed  
A higher level of pain  
Is racing through my veins  
There's nothing more intense  
Than mental misery that I dispense  
So follow right along  
Observe a fresh new dawn  
Of super sensation  
My realm of torture stimulation  
  
Perversions of pain  
Seep from my eyes  
Into your brain  
Visualize  
  
You better learn my name  
Cause I'm a man insane  
Inside my violent mind  
Chaos is all you'll find  
Within my world of hate  
Disruption I instate  
Alone you all will die  
Corroding from inside  
Follow right alone  
Observe a fresh new dawn  
Racing through my veins  
A higher level of pain  
Higher level of pain  
Higher level of pain

Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
The only way to exit  
Is going piece by piece  
  
You have no choice of life or death  
My face you will not see  
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath  
Dismembered destiny  
  
As soon as life has left your corpse  
I'll make you part of me  
No emotion  
Death is all I see  
  
Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
The only way to exit  
Is going piece by piece  
  
Bones and blood lie on the ground  
Rotten limbs lie dead  
Decapitated bodies found  
On my wall, your head!  
  
On your trail I close the gap  
One more life that soon won't be  
No emotion  
Your flesh is all I need  
  
I'll send you to your maker  
Confront the God you seek  
A flash of red upon his [sings "your"] chest  
Safety out of reach  
  
[You have no choice of life or death  
My face you will not see  
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath  
Dismembered destiny]  
  
[Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
There's only one way out of here  
Piece by piece]

I'm the one that brings you war  
Infiltrate unguarded shores  
Master of afflicting pain  
Point is where all die  
  
I'm the one to taste your blood  
Trashing though the crimson mud  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where I reign  
Piercing, impaling, no judgment, just punishment  
Discrete, annihilate assault with no regret  
I'm the one to taste your death  
Basking in your dying breath  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where all die  
Piercing, impaling no judgment, just punishment  
Discrete, annihilate assault with no regret  
Born to kill sweep and clear  
Staring down the face of fear  
Shrapnel flies dehumanize  
Flesh and blood will fertilize  
Empty all the magazines  
Lethal spray from M-16's  
Pace the march and sing the song  
Right the fuck where I belong  
Stained in blood  
  
No fear, no sound  
Penetrate your holy ground  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Point is where all die  
Pure destruction has begun  
Fearlessly the battle's won  
Spread extinction through the dawn  
Signature of wrath is spawned  
Minister of death unleashed  
My lust for war will never cease  
With no remorse I watch you die  
Body count's the bottom line  
Crashing slashing to the end  
Your final pulse has just been spent  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Point is where all fucking die  
  
Crashing slashing to the end  
Your final pulse has just been spent  
Leave you where your comrades lie  
Stained in blood  
No fear, no pain, no life  
  
Clouded skies rain only death  
Silence all opposing threats  
Quench the hunger of my gun  
Exploding cities overrun  
I'm the one to taste your death  
Basking in your dying breath  
Messenger of all demise  
Point is where all die

Funeral held for the depression of man  
Holds the key to his own death  
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived  
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck  
  
Sifting away the debris of hated life  
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine  
Seeking life beyond your perishment  
Repeating words echoing through your mind  
  
Chanting lines of blind witchery  
To save yourself from extinction  
Wanting to die is your reason to live  
New life born from the oppressed  
  
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air  
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall  
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near  
Fatality, reality, you await the final call  
  
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it  
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity  
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth  
Come and die with me forever  
Share insanity  
  
Do you want to die!  
  
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies  
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind  
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality  
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death

Deceased in mind decree of Death  
Blackened heart baptized in fire  
Exertion now need to blitz  
Vicious ways brought up in Hell  
  
Draw the line Life or Death  
Potent thrust excessive pain  
Massive dose adrenalin  
Minor threat can not decline  
  
[Chorus]  
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth  
Shackled and bound we lie  
Praise of Death life's a dream  
We're only living to die  
  
Victim of life insanity lives  
Deep in shock intensive care  
Tables turned blast of strength  
Kill at once time to prevail  
  
Begin to crank feel the rush  
Start to rage take to extremes  
Push too far overkill  
Time to die no way to win  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Running and hunting and slashing  
And crushing and searching  
And seeing and stabbing and shooting  
And thrashing and smashing and  
Burning destroying and killing  
And bleeding and pleading then Death  
  
At Mach ten velocity  
Pressure builds can't take the strain  
Life blood flows to its grave  
Dripping sweat, Death shall erase  
  
Time to think time to breath  
Feel the pulse life will expire  
Surging speed Hell afast  
Cardiac cease to exist  
  
[Chorus]

Anarchy, disarray this is the world today  
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by  
No peace, only guns, can't trust anyone  
Live or die it's an eye for an eye  
  
Unrest, marshal law, society decays  
And it's safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment  
  
Blameless innocent, lies of the decadent  
Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots  
New tax, market crash, high life never lasts  
No quick fix, for broken politics  
  
Unrest, marshal law, society decays  
And it's safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment  
  
Aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined  
Individual pain is a strong incentive  
Infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near  
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see  
  
Disarray, no quick fix, for broken politics  
Anarchy, live or die it's an eye for an eye  
  
Unrest, marshal law, society decays  
And it's safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment

Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,  
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.  
You care not for the old that suffer,  
When empty pockets cry from hunger.  
  
Penniless from their generosity,  
Sharing their money to quench your greed.  
Searching for the answer to their prayers  
They cry their last wish of need.  
Save me.  
  
His spirit lives and breathes in me.  
The almighty transformed to your screen.  
The meanings lost in its translation,  
No holy words, describe his deception.  
  
You say you'll help us find the lord,  
Tell me preacher how do you know  
A simple quest for a visible savior,  
To lead us through our final prayer.  
Save me.  
  
Send your donations,  
Contribute to the cause.  
Luxuries,  
Your righteous reward?  
  
Praise the lord, praise god,  
Is what you wish to sell.  
There is no heaven without a hell.  
  
In your mind's eye could you truly believe,  
That by giving you can save your soul,  
Could you be so naive!  
You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,  
You blind the congregation  
With the things you say.  
  
Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,  
That death will come and all will be lost.  
  
Can you hear the serpents call,  
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.  
Ignore the writing on the wall,  
You should read between the lies.  
  
When doubt subsides his honesty,  
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?  
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,  
No sermons left to hide or cover,  
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,  
To steal a dream or get it killed.  
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,  
You may believe it but Satan wouldn't lie.

Convicted witch my life will end  
At midnight on the stake  
My dedicated life was spent  
To insubordinate  
Secured by lock inside a cell  
Imprisoned for no crime  
The shackles will be useless  
When your life is out of time  
  
Incantation spell gone by  
I will see life again  
My deals will made eternally  
I signed the book of red  
My rage will be unleashed again  
Burning the next morn  
Death means nothing, there is no end  
I will be reborn  
  
No gift of exile in my fate  
I'll get no amnesty  
You can't control my destiny  
There is no habitual need  
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath  
It takes more than one try  
Indulge your ineffective curse  
I will never die  
  
You think by killing me tonight  
My powers will not rise  
There'll be nowhere for you to run  
When my hatred comes to life  
Condemned to fill the prophecy  
Allowing no first born  
Defy your morbid declaration  
Leave you ripped and torn  
  
Count your blessing would be priest  
As I burn upon the stake  
You'd be forgiven endlessly  
But your values are all fake  
Forever servant of my Lord  
By choice and not submission  
Maybe now I've made you wonder  
Am I superstition  
  
Incantation spell gone by  
I will live again  
My deals will made eternally  
I signed the book in red  
My rage will be unleashed again  
Burning the next morn  
Death means nothing there is no end  
I will be reborn

No blood no glory  
All pain and fury  
A demonstration  
Of domination  
Show of pure intimidation  
  
Full contact why I live and breathe  
Side stepping all the human debris  
Head strong I know that I'll prevail  
Face down in my arena you will fall  
Head to head eye to eye  
Human pile of proven pride  
Ripping flesh spitting teeth  
Sacrifice for victory  
Base line goal lie  
Overtime killing time  
Relentless brotherhood of disciple  
Centuries of traditions is to win  
Head first into battle feel the rush  
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed  
  
No blood no glory  
All pain and fury  
Head to head eye to eye  
Human pile of proven pride  
Ripping flesh spitting teeth  
Sacrifice for victory  
Base line goal line  
Overtime killing time

Let me take you down without a sound  
Dead before you hit the ground  
Blood washes my hand can't understand  
Sterilizing my pain  
  
Washed away with crimson tide  
By my hand I keep testing time  
Quench the fire that drives my soul  
Soothing me as death takes hold  
  
Peaceful and serene slowly bleeding  
Eyes once bright are now fading  
Pallid ashen face against my skin  
Staring blindly at some distant place  
  
Washed away by crimson tide  
By my hand I keep testing time  
Straight flesh lace adorns your neck  
Spilling your blood all over my flesh  
  
Quench the fire that drives my soul  
Soothing me as death takes hold  
Divine godsend enveloping me  
Spiritual ecstasy sets me free

I saw them all around today  
They don't stop they won't go away  
They love the darkness in my eyes  
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself  
  
They show me everything I need  
There's nothing wrong with a little greed  
Never enough to satisfy  
Such a driving desire that burns inside  
  
My life came with it's own scars  
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow  
I can't say I've seen it all  
But I live for the things that keep me hollow  
  
Everyday I look into the mirror  
Staring back I look less familiar  
I've seen all seven faces  
Each one looks a lot like me  
  
They all look like me  
I never see them coming  
But they show me more of myself  
Drawn into the depths  
I never knew existed  
Launching me face first  
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed  
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess  
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of  
Everything  
  
My Life came with it's own scars

Well I'm searching through my bed  
I got ankles in my head  
I'm in really bad  
It's the best time I ever had  
I'm a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy - there should be more  
Well I'm happy the way I am  
A sardine in a can  
People taking notes  
People in white coats  
I'm a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy - there should be more  
Well I'm happy the way I am  
And I'm sorry I shit on my hand  
People taking notes  
People in rubber coats  
I'm a sick boy  
Just a sick boy  
I'm a sick boy  
There's assholes everywhere  
Plus girls with big town hair  
But why must I suffer  
For being a fecal lover  
I'm a shit boy  
I'm a snit boy - there should be more  

Unbound God's creation  
Has grown into the sinner  
Abandoned innocence  
Impenitent transgressor  
Escape mortality  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn in God's eyes  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
Life's too short to be focused on insanity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
Your faith has atrophied  
And rots in hell's asylum  
Despondence tears you down  
A free-falling social strain  
Escape atrocity  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn to God's lies  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ

Minutes seem like days  
Since fire ruled the sky  
The rich became the beggars  
And the fools became the wise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Of burning from the acid rain  
A pain I never have won  
  
Nothing here remains  
No future and no past  
No one could foresee  
The end that came so fast  
Hear the prophet make his guess  
That paradise lies to the west  
So join his quest for the sun  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
The world slowly decays  
Destruction fills my eyes  
Harboring the image  
Of a spiraling demise  
Burning winds release their fury  
Simulating judge and jury  
Drifting flurries of pain  
  
Deafening silence reigns  
As twilight fills the sky  
Eventual supremacy  
Daylight waits to die  
Darkness always calls my name  
A pawn in this recurring game  
Humanity going insane  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
Minutes seem like days  
Corrosion fills the sky  
Morbid dreams of anarchy  
Brought judgment in disguise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Life with nothing more to gain  
Perpetual madness remains  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Skeletons of society  
Fragments of what used to be  
Skeletons of society

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.  
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.  
Judgment day the second coming arrives.  
Before you see the light you must die.  
  
Forgotten children, conform a new faith,  
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.  
[The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity,  
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.  
  
Chaos rampant,  
An age of distrust.  
Confrontations.  
Impulsive habitat.  
  
Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,  
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.  
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,  
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.  
  
Chaos rampant,  
An age of distrust.  
Confrontations.  
Impulsive sabbath.  
  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven  
  
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.  
A force that has lived all eternity.  
A never ending search for a truth never told.  
The loss of all hope and your dignity.  
  
Chaos rampant,  
An age of distrust.  
Confrontations.  
Impulsive habitat.  
  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven  
On and on, south of heaven

Come walk with me through endless time.  
See what has been and what the future sees.  
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,  
Step in a life that's yet to be born.  
  
You spill the blood,  
Eternal soul.  
  
I'll show you sights that you would not believe.  
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.  
At one with evil that has ruled before.  
Now smell the stench of immortality.  
  
You spill the blood,  
Eternal soul.  
  
Spill your blood, let it run on to me,  
Take my hand and let go of your life.  
Close your eyes and see what is me,  
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.  
  
You've spilt the blood.  
I have your soul.

Ancient crown placed on your head  
The hangmen of Prague  
Seven keys to the chamber  
Surrendered to the God  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And spill some more  
  
Hiding  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And bleed some more  
  
Golden door submits secrets  
As this nation falls  
Atmosphere of deadly terror  
Subservient to all  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And spill some more  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And bleed some more  
  
Burning sense of mission  
Assassination  
Symbol of oppression  
  
Crusade led from exile  
Obliteration  
Sabotaged campaign  
  
Check resistance from afar  
Planning the death of one  
When the plot is executed  
There will be nowhere to run  
Ramifications will be high  
A price paid in torment  
The end justifies the means  
To hell you will be sent  
  
The wolf leader now is the stalked  
Expansion state of horror  
Guns echo over the grave  
A thousand fates are sealed  
Murderous power brought to an end  
Only to rise again  
Cold and restless and iron will  
Protectorate of the dead  
  
A thorough sweep  
Prelude to death  
Secrets kept  
But no one left  
Firing squad  
Begins their work  
Harsh reprisal  
For what you took  
Retribution selective terror  
The stench of death is everywhere  
A severed head  
A floating mass  
Will give me answers to what I ask

Crushing all your worthless goals  
I define control  
Your pain's my fucking ecstasy  
So putrid is my world of tyranny  
Accentuate your desperation  
Flesh from bone, I'll rip and tear  
I hate the fact  
That we breathe the same air  
Helpless, as I dominate  
I won't celebrate  
Until you've all been crucified  
I can not rest 'til everyone has died  
I can't stand the victim in you  
Infecting everything that I do  
I will eradicate  
Obliterate, depopulate  
Divine, atrocious suffering  
Cleansation of the weak, supremacy  
Pissing on your faith  
Incinerate God's whore  
Perpetual is my reign  
I will eat your soul  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak  
Must contain the minds of the free  
Must maintain control of the weak  

Have you ever felt the need  
To see more than you can see  
Look into uncertainty  
Reflections of treachery  
Would you leave the world behind  
Endless life is here to find  
Can I interest you in lies  
Sell your soul for all it buys  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Play with your insanity  
Shatter your reality  
Pulsing in your blood  
  
I can satisfy your greed  
For now all your debts are free  
I have all eternity  
To quench all the death I breed  
Recreate the rules of play  
From now things are done my way  
None have ever won my game  
Crucified them all in flames  
  
Have you ever danced with the devil  
His temptation ever summoned you  
Ever penned your name in blood  
Let possession slowly swallow you  
When you stand under full moonlight  
The attraction mesmerizes you  
Have you ever wondered why  
It seems that evil you're attracted to  
  
Reach out to my hand  
Step back in time's sand  
Genetic wasteland  
Far beyond death

Screams of terror across the sea  
Begging for mercy in their one final plea  
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death  
Fighting and killing to their very last breath  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
He makes his move to conquer the land  
Turning all hopes of life to sand  
  
[Chorus]  
Machine gun fire, blood level higher  
Visions of torture and terror to all  
Ready for battle awaiting the final command  
  
Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen  
Awaiting our victory ending his dream  
Cursed are the souls who defy his will  
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
Shocking the world with his mass devastation  
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At the crack of dawn they storm again  
Hunting, fighting and killing all men  
The end is near our time now short  
Our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
Withdrawn from fighting he now takes his leave  
Seeking out goals that can't be conceived  
  
[Chorus]

I don't want to see, I don't want to hear  
I don't want to feel anything can't you understand  
Everything I do doesn't stem from you  
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you  
I just want to die throw it all away  
Never have to feel again the way you make me  
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time  
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me  
Take it  
  
I can't control the rage that flows from me  
I can't shut it down it overwhelms me  
I can't stop the rage that flows from me  
  
Can't stop the  
Violence I love it  
No one's immune to hate that flows from it  
Infectious I feed on it  
Every fucking endless day  
You're either on my side or else  
You're in my way  
  
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out  
Random hate there is no other way  
It's my discipline it's my way of life  
  
Never wanted bliss never wanted you  
Never needed anyone I've polluted  
Everything you feel everything you are  
Everything you'll ever be you repulse me  
It's always about you always come at me  
With shit I can't identify you know it makes me  
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time  
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me  
  
Take it  
Can't stop the  
Violence I love it  
No one's immune to hate that flows from it  
  
Infectious I feed on it  
Every fucking endless day  
You're either on my side or else you're in my way  
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out  
Random hate there is no other way  
It's my discipline it's my way of life

Use the need, lose control,  
Hidden voice inviting,  
Imposing will, unconscious skill  
Embraced immoral passion.  
Born is still, thirst for thrill,  
Indulgence of illusion.  
Neurotic, psychotic,  
Dead silent screams, come alive.  
  
Killing seed, first degree,  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.  
  
A final thrill, a timely kill  
Unbound, unguarded.  
Fantasized, realized,  
Enforced upon the dying.  
Free reign of the asylum,  
Archaic energy thrives,  
Dead cold, I control  
Eternal screams that slowly die.  
  
Killing spree, first degree.  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.  
  
Dimentia born of sin,  
A symptom that begins,  
Vengeance so divine.  
  
Lost my grip of what's real.  
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.  
Manic power chills my spine.  
I can't erase this instinct I embrace.  
  
Two faced moral abandon,  
Races my blood boils my skin.  
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,  
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.  
Beginning the end of temptation.  
A vengeance so divine.  
The end of temptation,  
A vengeance so divine.  
  
Killing spree, first degree,  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.

I am the last of the dying insane  
You would scream at the things I've done  
Knowing that the dead still see  
My blood it runs like mercury  
  
Your last breath the sword comes down  
She dies first speaking death to me  
Philosophy, the vision, the view within  
Duty, science, abstract cruelty  
  
[Chorus]  
What are your final thoughts?  
Do you want to kill me or die in shame?  
From my point of view  
Justified action, the enemy burns  
  
The fun of massacre in the brain  
Bio-weapons and I are the same  
Look at their face, hatred in their blood  
Pile up the dead, my humanity  
  
X-rays burn all that you can see  
Nobody knows what a body can stand  
Skulls on fire yet mercy is worse  
You seek only your pleasure in death  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bacterial target, eyes exploding  
Melting flesh through your mind  
Become your madness insanity wins  
Infant's flesh on the walls  
Testing limits threshold of pain  
Ripping out teeth to observe  
I want blood  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Knowing now the dead still see  
My blood it runs like mercury  
  
Human brain experiment  
On prisoners open skull  
Vivisection, live dissection  
Repulsing to the core  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fuckin' burns  
  
Pathogens seek horrible end  
Churning factories of death  
Crematoriums see your crime  
You will see me in hell

Explosive you feel the impact hit your face  
What makes you think I'll let you survive  
You want a war I'm the front line  
Unbroken  
  
This ain't about me  
I'm better than you'll ever be  
You don't concern me  
I know you'll never get to me  
You want a shot  
I can take your best bring it on  
Get ready for the pain  
Cause this where it's going down  
  
War zone  
This is where it's going down  
War zone  
When you walk in my world  
  
Madness is coming your way  
As long as my heart still beats  
I can guarantee you  
Madness is coming your way  
  
Survival here is thrust upon you  
Fuel the fire bring another victim  
Take your lesson in Supremacy  
Cause I'm the one who stands alone at the summit  
  
This ain't about me  
I'm better than you'll ever be  
You don't concern me  
You know you'll never get to me  
You want a shot  
I can take your best bring it on  
Get ready for the pain  
Cause this is where it's going down  
  
I am the wall you can never climb  
I am the pain that you feel inside  
I bring it all let the show begin  
I am the War you can never win  
  
War zone  
This is where it's going down  
War zone  
When you walk in my world  
  
Madness is coming your way  
As long as my heart still beats  
I can guarantee you  
Madness is coming your way

Witching Hour  
  

Disease spreading death  
Entire population dies  
Dead before you're born  
Massive suicide  
Vicious game of fear  
It's all extermination now  
Poison in your veins  
Global genocide  
Slaughter governs law  
The apocalypse begins  
Pain becomes the norm  
Seeking homicide  
Beware the coming storm  
That starts illuminating fires  
God is laughing hard  
Man has gone insane  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
Tip the human scale  
Follow revelations plan  
It must come to pass  
Secret shadows lie  
Blue print haunting dreams  
In which manipulation wins  
Speak no hidden fears  
Religion neutralized  
Emerged from the dark  
Sadist mercenary ride  
Realm of this world  
Godless messengers  
Sickless, mindless hate  
Becoming evolution's cure  
Planets usher in alignment  
God has died  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
God send death, watch it bleed, justified  
Manufactured lives born in hell  
Angels fall, wings on fire, crucified  
Terrorizing man, burn the world  
Reflecting eyes, sickle swings, wave of blood  
Suicidal mind from the start  
Endless pain, open wounds, slit the throat  
Radiation child seeks the throne  
  
Strafing down demigods certain death  
Coming from the stars, lord of all  
Dark rift rise, flourish life, perish man  
We destroy ourselves, cease to live  
Children's blood feed the dead sea of flesh  
Catastrophic fall rest in hell  
Flaming corpse, screaming eyes, watch it die  
Walk among the dead, pick your grave  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Like a disease spreading death  
Erasing your existence  
  
Satan's hand begins the end  
And frees the world forever  
Gomorrah's dream to live in sin  
Has reached its critical mass  
Man himself has become God  
And laughs at his destruction  
In which we trust a secret government  
Is now in total collapse  
  
Disease spreading death  
Entire population dies  
Dead before you're born  
Massive suicide  
Vicious game of fear  
It's all extermination now  
Poison in your veins  
Global genocide  
Slaughter governs law  
The apocalypse begins  
Pain becomes the norm  
Seeking homicide  
Beware the coming storm  
That starts illuminating fires  
God is laughing hard  
Man has gone insane  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood in ice, plague  
Signs of disease, rivers red, blood  
Welcoming our death
