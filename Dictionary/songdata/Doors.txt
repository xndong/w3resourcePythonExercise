I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees  
Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees

You can run, you can run, tell my friends I'll be by  
And I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.  
  
Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a  
Grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through  
The desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian  
Workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't  
Know what happened - but there were Indians scattered  
All over the highway, bleeding to death.  
  
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time I tasted fear.  
I musta' been about four - like a child is like a flower,  
His head is just floating in the breeze, man.  
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking back  
Is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead Indians  
Maybe one or two of 'em, were just running around freaking out,  
And just leaped into my soul.  
And they're still in there.  
  
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.  
  
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven  
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice  
Blood in my love in the terrible summer  
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A.  
  
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers  
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation  
Blood is the rose of mysterious union  
Blood on the rise, it's following me.  
  
Indian, Indian what did you die for?  
Indian says, nothing at all.

Dead cats, dead rats  
Can't see what they were at, all right  
Dead cat in a top hat, wow  
Sucking on the young man's blood  
Wishing he could come, yeah  
Sucking on the soldier's brain  
Wishing it would be the same  
  
Dead cat, dead rat  
Can't you see what they were at?  
Fat cat in a top hat  
Thinks he's an aristocrat  
Thinks he can kill and slaughter  
Thinks he can shoot my daughter  
  
Yeah right! Oh yeah!  
Oh right! Yeeah!  
  
Dead cats, dead rats  
Think they're an aristocrat  
Crap, now that's crap!

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She's walking down the street  
Blind to every eye she meets  
Do you think you'll be the guy  
To make the queen of the angels sigh?  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long  
When she moves my brain screams out this song  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello  
I want you, hello, I need my baby  
Hello, hello, hello, hello

I  
Don't know  
Just where I'm going  
But I'm  
Gonna try  
For the kingdom  
If I can  
Cuz it makes me feel like I'm a man  
When I put a spike into my vain  
And I tell you things aren't quite the same  
When I'm rushing on my run  
And I feel just like Jesus' son  
And I guess  
That I just don't know  
And I guess  
That I just don't know  
  
I  
Have made  
Big decisions  
I'm  
Gonna try  
To nullify my life  
Cuz when the blood  
Begins to flow  
When it shoots up the droppers neck  
When I'm closing in on death  
You can't help  
Not you guys  
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all  
Go take a walk  
And I guess  
I just don't know  
And I guess  
That I just don't know.  
  
I  
Wish that  
I was born a thousand years ago  
I  
Wish that  
I'd sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
In a sailor's suit and cap  
Oh we're from the big city  
Where a man can not be free  
Of all the evils of this town  
And of himself  
And those around  
And I guess that I just don't know  
Oh well I guess that I just don't know.  
  
Heroine  
Be the death of me  
Heroine  
It's my wife and it's my life  
Because a mainer to my vain  
Leads to a center  
In my head  
And then I am better  
Off than dead  
  
Because when the smack  
Begins to flow  
I really don't care anymore  
About all the gin gins  
In this town  
And all the politicians  
Making crazy sounds  
And everybody putting  
Everybody else down  
And all the dead bodies  
Piled up in mounds  
  
Cuz when the smack  
Begins to flow  
I really don't care anymore  
When the heroine is in my blood  
And that blood is in my head  
Man thank God that I'm good as dead  
And thank your God that I'm not aware  
And thank God that I just don't care  
And I guess that I just don't know  
And I guess  
I just don't know

Resident mockery give us an hour for magic  
We of the purple glove  
We of the starling flight and velvet hour  
We of Arabic pleasure's breed  
We of sundome and the night

Nobody thought we'd be able to bring the Doors here, and we did.  
But we've got a couple of thi... Wait a second man!  
Look, we've just got a couple of little things that we've gotta tell you
about.  
The fire-marshal is not gonna let this show go on,  
and I just had a long meeting with him, and man,  
this is no joke, you either gotta sit down, and you gotta go back to your
seats,  
you gotta make isles, and that's it man. You gotta move back.  
Hey look! Hey look!  
Wait a second, hold on! Let's have a little help, man.  
Come on, everybody go back to their seats. People are gonna get hurt up here,  
they're gonna pass out.  
Now we don't want that man, and the Doors don't want that either.  
Ladies and gentlemen, the Doors!  
Now hold it, we've gotta tune up.  
Hey Philadelphia!  
Do you feel all right?

There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And God, I know I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sewed my new blue jeans  
My father was a gambling man  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now, the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time that he's satisfied  
Is when he's out on a drunk.  
  
Oh, Mother, tell your children  
Not to do what I have done.  
Spend your lives in sin and misery  
In the House of the Rising Sun.  
  
Well, I've got one foot on the platform,  
The other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
Well, there is a house in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And God, I know I'm one.

Lament for my cock  
Sore and crucified  
I seek to know you  
Acquiring soulful wisdom  
You can open walls of mystery

How to acquire death in the morning show  
TV death which the child absorbs  
Death well mystery which makes me write  
Slow train, the death of my cock gives life  
  
Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry  
Taught us god in the child's praye in the night  
  
Guitar player  
Ancient wise satyr  
Sing your ode to my cock  
  
Caress it's lament

To speak to the heart  
And give the great gift  
Words Power Trance  
  
This stable friend and the beast of his zoo  
Wild haired chicks  
Women flowering in their summit  
Monsters of skin  
Each color connects  
To create the boat  
Which rocks the race  
Could any hell be more horrible  
Than now  
And real?  
  
I pressed her thigh and death smiled  
Death, old friend  
Death and my cock are the world  
I can forgive my injuries in the name of  
Wisdom Luxury Romance  
  
Sentence upon sentence  
Words are the healing lament  
For the death of my cock's spirit  
Has no meaning in the soft fire  
Words got me the wound and will get me well  
I you believe it  
  
All join now and lament the death of my cock  
A tongue of knowledge in the feathered night  
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer  
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence

Come on people, don't you look so down  
You know the rain man is coming to town  
He'll change your weather, change your luck  
And it'll teach you how to  
Find yourself  
L'America  
  
Friendly strangers came to town  
All the people put them down  
But the women loved their ways  
Come again some other day  
Like the gentle rain  
Like the gentle rain  
That falls  
  
I took a trip down to L'America  
To trade some beads for a pint of gold

Grandma love a sailor  
who sailed the frozen sea.  
Grandpa was a whaler  
And he took me on his knee.  
  
He said, "Son, I'm going crazy  
From livin' on the land.  
Got to find my shipmates  
And walk on foreign sands."  
  
This old man was graceful  
With silver in his smile.  
He smoked a briar pipe and  
He walked four country miles.  
  
Singing songs of shady sisters  
And old time liberty.  
Songs of love and songs of death  
And songs to set men free.  
  
Yea!  
  
I've got three ships and sixteen men,  
A course for ports unread.  
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow  
Till half of us are dead.  
  
Land ho!  
  
Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill,  
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill.  
If I get my hands on a number five,  
Gonna skin that little girl alive.  
  
If I get my hand on a number two,  
Come back home and marry you, marry you, marry you.  
Alright!  
  
Land ho!

You know that it would be untrue  
You know that I would be a liar  
If I was to say to you  
Girl, we couldn't get much higher  
  
Come on baby, light my fire  
Come on baby, light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire  
  
The time to hesitate is through  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now we can only lose  
And our love become a funeral pyre  
  
Come on baby, light my fire  
Come on baby, light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire, yeah  
  
The time to hesitate is through  
No time to wallow in the mire

Lions in the street and roaming  
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming  
A beast caged in the heart of a city  
The body of his mother  
Rotting in the summer ground  
He fled the town  
He went down South and crossed the border  
Left the chaos and disorder  
Back there over his shoulder  
One morning he awoke in a green hotel  
With a strange creature groaning beside him  
Sweat oozed from it's shiny skin  
Is everybody in?  
The ceremony is about to begin

Let's swim to the moon, uh huh  
Let's climb through the tide  
Penetrate the evenin' that the  
City sleeps to hide  
Let's swim out tonight, love  
It's our turn to try  
Parked beside the ocean  
On our moonlight drive  
Let's swim to the moon, uh huh  
Let's climb through the tide  
Surrender to the waiting worlds  
That lap against our side  
Nothin' left open  
And no time to decide  
We've stepped into a river  
On our moonlight drive  
Let's swim to the moon  
Let's climb through the tide  
You reach your hand to hold me  
But I can't be your guide  
Easy, I love you  
As I watch you glide  
Falling through wet forests  
On our moonlight drive, baby  
Moonlight drive  
Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride  
Down, down by the ocean side  
Gonna get real close  
Get real tight  
Baby gonna drown tonight  
Goin' down, down, down

Let's swim to the moon, ah ha  
Let's climb through the tide  
Penetrate the evenin' that the  
City sleeps to hide  
Let's swim out tonight, love  
It's our turn to try  
Parked beside the ocean  
On our moonlight drive

Goin' down, down, down, down  
Goin' down  
Goin' down, way down  
Down, down, down, down, down  
Down, baby low  
Children of the caves will let the  
Secret fires glow  
  
When the still sea conspires an armor  
And her sullen and aborted  
Currents breed tiny monsters,  
True sailing is dead.  
  
  
Awkward instant  
And the first animal is jettisoned,  
Legs furiously pumping  
Their stiff green gallop,  
And head bob up  
Poise  
Delicate  
Pause  
Consent  
In mute nostril agony  
Carefully refined  
And sealed over.  
  
Easy, to love you  
As I watch you glide  
Yeah, we're falling through wet forests  
On our moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
  
Thank you, thank you!

My wild love went ridin'  
She rode all the day  
She wrote to the devil  
And asked him to pay  
The devil was wiser  
It's time to repent  
He asked her to give back  
The money she spent  
My wild love went ridin'  
She rode to the sea  
She gathered together  
Some shells for her head  
She rode and she rode on  
She rode for a while  
Then stopped for an evenin'  
And lay her head down  
She rode on to Christmas  
She rode to the farm  
She rode to Japan  
And we entered a town  
By this time the river  
Had changed one degree  
She asked for the people  
To let her go free  
My wild love is crazy  
She screams like a bird  
She moans like a cat  
When she wants to be heard  
My wild love went ridin'  
She rode for an hour  
She rode and she rested  
And then she rode on  
Ride, c'mon

Gently they stir, gently rise  
The dead are newborn awakening  
With ravaged limbs and wet souls  
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement  
Who called these dead to dance?  
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?  
Was it the wilderness children?  
Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?  
I called you up to anoint the earth  
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin  
I called you to wish you well  
To glory in self like a new monster  
And now I call you to pray

Not to touch the earth  
Not to see the sun  
Nothing left to do, but  
Run, run, run  
Let's run  
Let's run  
House upon the hill  
Moon is lying still  
Shadows of the trees  
Witnessing the wild breeze  
C'mon baby run with me  
Let's run  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Let's run  
The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill  
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there  
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs  
And you won't know a thing till you get inside  
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car  
The engine runs on glue and tar  
Come on along, not goin' very far  
To the East to meet the Czar  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Let's run  
Whoa!  
Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake  
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake  
Who lives in a well by the side of the road  
Wake up, girl, we're almost home  
Ya, c'mon!  
We should see the gates by mornin'  
We should be inside the evenin'  
Sun, sun, sun  
Burn, burn, burn  
Soon, soon, soon  
Moon, moon, moon  
I will get you  
Soon!, Soon!, Soon!  
I am the Lizard King  
I can do anything

People are strange when you're a stranger  
Faces look ugly when you're alone  
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted  
Streets are uneven, when you're down

Faces come out of the rain  
When you're strange  
No one remembers your name

Wow, I'm sick of doubt  
Live in the life of certain, south, cruel bindings  
The servants have the power  
Dog men and they're mean women  
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors  
  
I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the tv tower  
I want roses in my garden bower, dig?  
Royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud  
These mutants blood meal, the plant that's ploughed  
  
They are waiting to take us into the severed garden  
You know how pale, wanton, thrillful comes death  
In the strange hour  
Unannounced, unplanned for  
Like the scary over friendly guest you bought to bed  
  
Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings  
Where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws  
  
No more money, no more fancy dress  
This other kingdom seems by far the best  
Until it's other jaw reveals incest  
And lose obedience to a vegetable  
  
I will not go  
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family

There will never be,  
Another one like you  
There will never be,  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do, oh  
Will you give another chance?,  
Will you try, little try?  
Please stop and you remember,  
We were together, anyway, all right  
And if you have a certain evenin',  
You could lend to me  
I'd give it all right back to you,  
A how it has to be with you  
I know your moves and your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
Will you stop and think and wonder?  
Just what you'll see  
Out on the train yard  
Nursin' penitentiary  
It's gone, I cry out long  
Go head, brother  
Did you stop it to consider?,  
How it will feel  
Cold, grinded grizzly bear jaws,  
Hot on your heels  
Do you often stop and whisper?  
It's Saturday's shore  
The whole world's a savior  
Who could ever, ever, ever  
Ever, ever, ever,  
Ask for more?  
Do you remember?  
Will you stop?,  
Will you stop?,  
The pain  
And there will never be  
Another one like you  
There will never be  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do, oh  
Will you give another chance?  
Will you try, little try?  
Please stop and you remember  
We were together, anyway, all right  
How you must of think and wondered  
How I must feel  
Out on the meadows  
While you run the field  
I'm alone for you  
And I cry  
The sweat, look at it,  
Optical promise  
Heh, heh, heh,  
You'll be dead and in hell  
Before I'm born,  
Sure thing  
Brides maid,  
The only solution  
Isn't it amazing?

The human race was dyin' out.  
No one left to scream and shout.  
People walking on the moon.  
Smog will get you pretty soon.  
  
Everyone was hanging out.  
Hanging up and hanging down.  
Hanging in and holding fast.  
Hope our little world will last.  
  
Yeah, along came Mr. Goodtrips  
Looking for a new a ship.  
Come on, people better climb on board.  
Come on, baby, now we're going home.  
  
Ship of fools, ship of fools.  
  
The human race was dyin' out.  
No one left to scream and shout.  
People walking on the moon.  
Smog will get you pretty soon.  
  
Ship of fools, ship of fools.  
Ship of fools, ship of fools.  
Ship of fools, ship of fools.

Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Familiar freaks will fill your living room  
Rugs lash out their lizard tongues  
You're not getting young  
You're not getting young  
  
But you're going to die  
And you're going to be needing all of your eyes  
  
You'll be all alone  
When the animals cry  
All by yourself  
In some infancy's lie  
  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Television bleeding like a harvest moon  
Flush the scissors down the hole  
You're getting old  
You're getting old  
  
And I hate to remind you but your going to die  
And you're going to be needing all of your lies  
  
You'll be all alone  
When the animals cry  
All by yourself  
In some infancy's lie  
  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon

Well, the clock says it's time to close now  
I guess I'd better go now  
I'd really like to stay here all night  
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes  
Street lights share their hollow glow  
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise  
Still one place to go  
Still one place to go  
  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
  
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets  
I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
  
Well the clock says it's time to close now  
I know I have to go now  
I really want to stay here  
All night, all night, all night

Carry me caravan take me away  
Take me to Portugal, take me to Spain  
Andalusia with fields full of grain  
I have to see you again and again  
Take me, Spanish caravan  
Yes, I know you can  
Trade winds find Galleons lost in the sea  
I know where treasure is waiting for me  
Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain  
I have to see you again and again  
Take me, Spanish caravan  
Yes, I know you can

Summer's almost gone  
Summer's almost gone  
Almost gone  
Yeah, it's almost gone  
Where will we be  
When the summer's gone?  
Morning found us calmly unaware  
Noon burn gold into our hair  
At night, we swim the laughin' sea  
When summer's gone  
Where will we be  
Where will we be  
Where will we be  
Morning found us calmly unaware  
Noon burn gold into our hair  
At night, we swim the laughin' sea  
When summer's gone  
Where will we be  
Summer's almost gone  
Summer's almost gone  
We had some good times  
But they're gone  
The winter's comin' on  
Summer's almost gone

(jim in Miami where he gets arrested, the video of this is awesome)  
  
This is the end, beatiful friend  
This is the end, my only friend, the end  
Of our elaborate plans, the end  
Of everything that stands, the end  
No safety or suprise, the end  
I'll never look into your eyes... Again  
  
Can you picture what will be?  
So limitless and free?  
Desperately in need of some strangers hand  
In our desperate land  
  
I'm lost in my own mind's pain  
Feeding on the juices of my brain  
Loss of oxygen, I'm going insane  
At least the girls know that I came  
  
I'm going, I'm going down to the ground  
To see my funeral and watch my casket be buried  
I wanna hide behind a gravestone and watch them cry over me  
I'm not normal, can't you fuckers see?

Lets finish our song here guys!  
  
The killer awoke befoer dawn!  
He put his snakeskin boots on!  
He took a face from the ancient gallery  
And he walked on down that hall, god damnit  
And he went to the room where his sister lived  
And he walked inside her room, and he lay down on her bed  
And he lay her on her back  
And he slid her shirt off  
And he unbuttoned and unzipped her pants and slid those down  
And he pulled off her bra, and he  
And he, and he, he--uh--he pulled off her panties, and then he  
Stuck his dick inside of her!!!!!!!! And fucked his sister for an hour  
And then he, paid a visit to his brother, and he, walked inside his  
Brothers room, and lay down next to him on the bed, and he  
Lay his brother in his back, and he ripped off his brothers shirt, and  
He sucked on his brothers nipples, and he pulled down his brothers  
Jeans and boxers, and he put his brother on his hands and knees  
And he.. Put vaseline on his brothers asshole, and he fucked his  
Brother in the asshole for an hour.... Then... He walkd on down the  
Hall!!!!  
And he came do another door, and he looked inside  
Father!!!!!!!! Yes, son?

Wanna make it hurt, and I wanna take off your pants, cause you just  
Wont give me a chance, and I wanna put my dick in your mouth, and I  
Wanna shoot sperm in your throat, and I wanna shove my dick in your  
Ass for 30 minutes, then... I want to!!!!!!!! Fuck your pussy raw  
Mommy!!!!!!!!!

This is the end, my only friend, the end

The end of nights we tried to die!  
This is the end!!!! It's the end baby!! The end!!!!  
Kill the father!!! Fuck the mother and sister and brother! And fuck me!  
I want a dick in my ass!!!! Hey cop, what do you have to say?  
  
(Jim Morrison arrested)

Awake.  
Shake dreams from your hair  
My pretty child, my sweet one.  
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day  
The day's divinity  
First thing you see.  
  
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon  
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side  
And we laugh like soft, mad children  
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy  
The music and voices are all around us.  
  
Choose they croon the ancient ones  
The time has come again  
Choose now, they croon  
Beneath the moon  
Beside an ancient lake  
  
Enter again the sweet forest  
Enter the hot dream  
Come with us  
Everything is broken up and dances.  
  
Indians scattered,  
On dawn's highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young child's,  
Fragile eggshell mind  
  
We have assembled inside,  
This ancient and insane theater  
To propagate our lust for life,  
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets.  
  
The barns have stormed  
The windows kept,  
And only one of all the rest  
To dance and save us  
From the divine mockery of words,  
Music inflames temperament.  
  
Ooh great creator of being  
Grant us one more hour,  
To perform our art  
And perfect our lives.  
  
We need great golden copulations,  
  
When the true kings murderers  
Are allowed to roam free,  
A thousand magicians arise in the land  
Where are the feast we are promised?

Thoughts in time and out of season  
The hitchhiker  
Stood by the side of the road  
And leveled his thumb  
In the calm calculus of reason  
  
Hi. how you doin'? I just got back into town L.A.  
I was out on the desert for awhile  
"Riders on the storm"  
Yeah. in the middle of it  
"Riders on the storm"  
Right  
"Into this world we're born"  
Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem  
"Into this world we're thrown"  
When I was out on the desert, ya know  
"Like a dog without a bone  
An actor out on loan"  
I don't know how to tell you  
"Riders on the storm"  
But, ah, I killed somebody  
"There's a killer on the road"  
No  
"His brain is squirming like a toad"  
It's no big deal, ya know  
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but  
"Take a long holiday"  
Just, ah  
"Let your children play"  
This guy gave me a ride, and ah  
If you give this man a ride"  
Started giving me a lot of trouble  
"Sweet family will die"  
And I just couldn't take it, ya know  
"Killer on the road"  
And I wasted him  
Yeah

The movie will begin in five moments  
The mindless voice announced  
All those unseated will await the next show.  
  
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall  
The auditorium was vast and silent  
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued.  
  
The program for this evening is not new  
You've seen this entertainment through and through  
You've seen your birth your life and death  
you might recall all of the rest  
Did you have a good world when you died?  
Enough to base a movie on?.  
  
I'm getting out of here  
Where are you going?  
To the other side of morning  
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas  
  
Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand.  
  
It's alright, all your friends are here  
When can I meet them?  
After you've eaten  
I'm not hungry  
Uh, we meant beaten  
  
Silver stream, silvery scream  
  
Oooooh, impossible concentration.

When I was back there in seminary school,  
There was a person there  
Who put forth the proposition,  
That you can petition the Lord with prayer  
Petition the lord with prayer,  
Petition the lord with prayer  
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!  
Can you give me sanctuary, I must find a place to hide,  
A place for me to hide  
Can you find me soft asylum, I can't make it anymore,  
The Man is at the door  
Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy,  
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy  
There's only four ways to get unraveled,  
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da  
One is a bandit up in the hills,  
One is to love your neighbor 'till  
His wife gets home  
Catacombs,  
Nursery bones,  
Winter women,  
Growing stones  
Carrying babies,  
To the river  
Streets and shoes,  
Avenues,  
Leather riders  
Selling news,  
The monk bought lunch  
Ha ha, he bought a little,  
Yes, he did,  
Woo!  
This is the best part of the trip,  
This is the trip, the best part  
I really like,  
What'd he say?,  
Yeah!,  
Yeah, right!  
Pretty good, huh,  
Huh!,  
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number  
Successful hills are here to stay,  
Everything must be this way  
Gentle streets where people play,  
Welcome to the Soft Parade  
All our lives we sweat and save,  
Building for a shallow grave  
Must be something else we say,  
Somehow to defend this place  
Everything must be this way,  
Everything must be this way, yeah  
The Soft Parade has now begun,  
Listen to the engines hum  
People out to have some fun,  
A cobra on my left  
Leopard on my right, yeah  
The deer woman in a silk dress,  
Girls with beads around their necks  
Kiss the hunter of the green vest,  
Who has wrestled before  
With lions in the night  
Out of sight!,  
The lights are getting brighter  
The radio is moaning,  
Calling to the dogs  
There are still a few animals,  
Left out in the yard  
But it's getting harder,  
To describe sailors,  
To the underfed  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure  
What got us this far,  
To this mild equator?  
We need someone or something new  
Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon  
Callin' on the dogs,  
Callin' on the dogs  
Oh, it's gettin' harder,  
Callin' on the dogs  
Callin' in the dogs,  
Callin' all the dogs,  
Callin' on the gods  
You gotta meet me,  
Too late, baby  
Slay a few animals,  
At the crossroads,  
Too late  
All in the yard,  
But it's gettin' harder,  
By the crossroads  
You gotta meet me,  
Oh, we're goin', we're goin great  
At the edge of town,  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure  
Havin' a good time,  
Got to come along,  
What got us this far  
To this mild equator?,  
Outskirts of the city,  
You and I  
We need someone new,  
Somethin' new,  
Somethin' else to get us through  
Better bring your gun,  
Better bring your gun  
Tropic corridor,  
Tropic treasure,  
We're gonna ride and have some fun  
When all else fails,  
We can whip the horse's eyes  
And make them sleep,  
And cry

I'm a spy in the house of love.  
I know the dream, that you're dreamin' of.  
I know the word that you long to hear.  
I know your deepest, secret fear.

I wanna tell you 'bout texas radio and the big beat  
Comes out of the virginia swamps  
Cool and slow with plenty of precision  
With a back beat narrow and hard to master  
  
Some call it heavenly in it's brilliance  
Others, mean and ruthful of the western dream  
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft  
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping  
This is the land where the pharaoh died  
  
The negroes in the forest brightly feathered  
They are saying, "forget the night  
Live with us in forests of azure  
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars  
Out here we is stoned - immaculate. "  
  
Listen to this, and i'll tell you 'bout the heartache  
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the lose of god  
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night  
The meager food for souls forgot  
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul  
  
I'll tell you this  
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn  
  
I'll tell you 'bout texas radio and the big beat  
Soft drivin', slow and mad, like some new language  
  
Now, listen to this, and i'll tell you 'bout the texas  
I'll tell you 'bout the texas radio  
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night  
Wandering the western dream  
Tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul

You're on a tightrope ride  
Nobody by your side  
Well, you're all alone  
Gotta find a new home  
Don't go over the line  
You better keep on time  
Or you'll lose your mind  
On your tightrope ride  
  
Watch out don't fall  
Careful don't slip  
  
You better get your balance  
You have to feel the weight  
There are no more questions  
Or no answers today  
There are no reasons  
There are no more rhymes  
But if you can feel it, you can fly next time  
You can fly next time  
Or maybe this time  
  
Did you think we were all together  
Did you think we were all the same  
Did you think I could help you remember your name  
Remember the pain  
What's the name of the game  
  
It's a very good game  
Never stays the same  
From the mud to the sun  
You're on a tightrope ride  
We're all by your side  
But you're all alone and we're going home  
And we're by you side  
But you're all alone like a rolling stone  
Like Brian Jones  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride  
On a tightrope ride

Yeah!  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Now touch me, baby  
Can't you see that I am not afraid?  
What was that promise that you made?  
Why won't you tell me what she said?  
What was that promise that you made?  
  
Now, I'm gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Now touch me, baby  
  
Can't you see that I am not afraid?  
What was that promise that you made?  
Why won't you tell me what she said?  
What was that promise that you made?  
  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the heavens stop the rain  
I'm gonna love you  
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I

Well, she's fashionably lean,  
And she's fashionably late  
She'll never wreck a scene,  
She'll never break a date  
But she's no drag,  
Just watch the way she walks  
She's a twentieth century fox,  
She's a twentieth century fox  
No tears, no fears,  
No ruined years, no clocks  
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's the queen of cool,  
And she's the lady who waits  
Sent to manless school,  
It never hesitates  
She won't waste time,  
On elementary talk  
'Cause she's a twentieth century fox,  
She's a twentieth century fox  
Got the world locked up,  
Inside a plastic box  
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
Twentieth century fox  
She's a twentieth century fox

Unhappy girl, Left all alone

Playing warden to your soul  
You are locked in a prison  
Of your own devise  
And you can't believe  
What it does to me  
To see you  
Crying

Melt your cell today  
You are caught in a prison  
Of your own devise  
Unhappy girl  
Fly fast away  
Don't miss your chance  
To swim in mystery  
You are dying in a prison  
Of your own devise

I was doing time  
In the universal mind  
I was feeling fine  
I was turning keys  
I was setting people free  
I was doing all right  
Then you came along  
With a suitcase and a song  
Turned my head around  
Now I'm so alone  
Just looking for a home  
In every place I see  
  
I'm the freedom man  
I'm the freedom man  
I'm the freedom man  
That's how lucky I am

Yeah, that's how lucky I am  
I'm the freedom man

At first flash of Eden, we race down to the sea.  
Standing there on freedom's shore.  
  
[Chorus]  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun  
Waiting for the sun.  
  
Can you feel it, now that Spring has come,  
That it's time to live in the scattered sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waiting for the sun.  
  
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to hear my song  
Waiting for you to come along  
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong.  
  
This is the strangest life I've ever known.  
  
Can't you feel it, now that Spring has come,  
That it's time to live in the scattered sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Waiting for the sun.

We could be so good together  
Ya, so good together

Ya, we could, I know we could  
Tell you lies

Tell you 'bout the world that we'll invent  
Wanton world without lament

Tell you wicked lies

Beheads the angels you destroy  
Angels fight, angels cry  
Angels dance and angels die  
Ya, so good together  
Ah, but so good together  
We could be so good together  
Ya, we could, know we could

Yeah, c'mon

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection  
Send my credentials to the House of Detention  
I got some friends inside  
The face in the mirror won't stop  
The girl in the window won't drop  
A feast of friends, "alive!" she cried  
Waitin' for me, outside!  
Before I sink, into the big sleep  
I want to hear, I want to hear  
The scream of the butterfly  
Come back, baby, back into my arm  
We're gettin' tired of hangin' around  
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground  
I hear a very gentle sound,  
Very near yet very far  
Very soft, yeah, very clear,  
Come today, come today  
What have they done to the earth?  
What have they done to our fair sister?  
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her  
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn  
And tied her with fences and dragged her down  
I hear a very gentle sound  
With your ear down to the ground  
We want the world and we want it  
We want the world and we want it  
Now, now?, now!  
Persian night, babe, see the light, babe  
Save us!, Jesus!, save us!  
So when the music's over  
When the music's over, yeah  
When the music's over  
Turn out the lights  
Turn out the lights  
Turn out the lights  
Well the music is your special friend  
Dance on fire as it intends  
Music is your only friend  
Until the end  
Until the end  
Until the end

Well I'll tell you a story of whiskey and mystics and men  
And about the believers, and how the whole thing began  
First there were women and children obeying the moon  
Then daylight brought wisdom and fever and sickness too soon  
You can try to remind me instead of the other you can  
You can help to insure that we all insecure our command  
If you don't give a listen I won't try to tell your new hand  
This is it can't you see that we all have our end in the band  
  
And if all of the teachers and preachers of wealth were arraigned  
We could see quite a future for me in the literal sands  
And if all of the people could claim to inspect such regret  
Well we'd have no forgiveness forgetfulness faithful remorse  
So I tell you I tell you I tell you we must send away  
We must try to find a new answer instead of a way

Want you to hold me, oh
