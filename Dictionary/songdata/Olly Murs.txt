I'm always at the place where your friends meet,  
It's the long way home but I walk your street  
And when I trip, and fall right at your feet.  
It's not accidental.  
  
I make it like luck is in the air,  
Every time you turn, I'm standing there  
You look into the stars, our names are clear.  
It's not accidental.  
  
And when you get a wrong number,  
Don't hang up too soon and wonder.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
I know you like the kind of clothes I wear  
Think I threw them on without a care  
The style's from a book  
You read a magazine you left.  
It's not coincidental.  
  
And even when you hear your favorite song  
You don't know, but I put it on  
You bought the record yesterday, so I knew what to play  
It's not coincidental.  
  
And when you get a wrong number,  
Don't hang up too soon and wonder.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
This all feels right time, right place whoa  
'Cause every time I see you face to face  
Our future calls.  
Not saying I bend the truth  
Just doing my best to get you, oh make you my destiny.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
You are the one that's meant for me  
I'm twisting fate to make believe.  
It's all accidental  
This was always meant to be  
When you're in my arms then you will see  
It wasn't accidental.  
  
It's not accidental  
Accidental.

I can't leave you alone tonight!  
I can't leave you aloooone!  
  
Bring my beat at midnight  
Don't be till the daylight, do it right  
Kiss me with affection,  
Make that friends' connection with some tide,  
Alright  
You don't have to wait another life,  
Put it all, put it all, put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alone!  
  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
  
Stroll down to the dancefloor,  
Act like you don't know me for tonight  
Sexy like a diva, dressed in black to tease me in the light  
Alright  
  
You don't have to wait another life,  
Put it all, put it all, put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alone!  
  
(A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah)  
  
I'm lost in a different body  
Surely you can see the signs  
This thing you seize you're mine  
You're all tied up  
And it's different every time,  
But you always feel the same, the same  
Don't change, don't you ever change  
  
Be that fantasy that I visualize  
And you're telling me to do the same,  
And we'll just dress our love up in the skies  
And I'll show what that means!!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alooone!  
  
(A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah)

Sat on my bed and looked in my eyes  
Saw I was grieving for some other time  
Stood on my breath and moved close to say  
Oh won't you love me let's walk out to play  
  
Ooh we caught the moon from the sky  
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run  
  
Why don't you ask me to stay?  
Ask me to stay  
  
Looked so surprised when she said to me  
Can you move the mountain then we can both see  
She fell in my arms then I melted away  
She said why won't you ask me to stay, ask me to stay?  
  
Ooh we caught the moon from the sky  
And wrapped it up with the love that we found in our eyes  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run?  
  
She picked up the pillow and lay down her head  
We were loving like good friends again  
Why don't you touch me, like we used to know  
Move over and love me or let me go  
  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
  
And if the words don't tell me you love me  
And if the night won't hold us as one  
Now there is nothing left that can numb me  
Do you love me or do I run  
  
Why don't you ask me to stay?  
Ask me to stay  
Ask me to stay  
Ask me to stay  
  
As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change (ask me to
stay)  
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again (ask me to stay)  
As first you make a wish and pray that things will never change (ask me to
stay)  
And then we reach the point of being just good friends again (ask me to stay)

She  
Ties her hair up, tight  
Puts her armor on  
When she steps outside  
She  
Is in black and white  
And the color's gone  
But it's in her eyes  
Time and time again we're going back to the start  
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart  
And I don't know why  
And I'm picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet  
We confide in other demons, though she'll never be free  
We could hide it in the shadows, though it's hard to believe  
And I don't know why  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
She,  
She never gets it right  
And it feels like rain on a perfect night  
And I  
I'd be a hand to hold  
You can push me hard, but I won't let go  
Time and time again we're going back to the start  
And I'm trying, try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every day's a battle and it tears her apart  
But, don't you cry,  
  
[Chorus:]  
My love don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
  
Love, I'll be your ordinary goal,  
You're so amazing, don't you know?  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
The light breaks through your hair and  
They're all stopping and staring  
I'd go anywhere  
Oh, why can't you just see that?  
I'm crazy about you  
I can't live without you  
You don't see it,  
But you're beautiful to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful  
Ohh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, don't ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
Come'on  
  
Love, I'll be your ordinary goal,  
You're so amazing, don't you know?  
I don't care what you say  
You're beautiful to me  
You're beautiful to me

Weekends in bed, no scramble eggs, or bacon  
I just have time for you  
Backs on the grass, heads in the clouds, we  
Closed our eyes  
Enjoy the view  
  
We don't wanna hear  
The real world passing by  
Saying that we're crazy  
  
We spend all our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing.  
  
No magazines or DVD's we both got  
Better things to do  
I'll hold your hand  
Or shall we dance together  
It's so hard to choose  
  
Every time we hear  
The whole world rushing by  
I know that we're not crazy  
  
We spend all our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing  
  
Should be working hard  
Instead of lying here naked  
Phone rings but I wont take it  
'Cause you only get one life, only get one life  
  
All our time lying side by side  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy doing nothing  
We spend all our time running for our lives  
Going nowhere, it's really something  
Getting busy, doing nothing  
  
All our time, doing nothing  
All our time, getting busy doing nothing

Something's come, feel it down in my bones  
Yeah it's been a long time gone, but ya here tonight  
Now let's not look back, ya keeping me right on track  
Feel the karma coming back, we're gonna be alright  
  
If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Troubled times, been a good friend of mine  
Yeah it's been around a while keeping me down  
But through it all, even with a broken soul  
Here I am standing tall cause you're around  
  
If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
For every sign that said we'd never find the means to  
For every word they said they never heard that they knew  
Given time I want some piece of mind  
Same as you do  
Sing it!  
  
Change is  
Coming  
You better be waiting  
You better be  
Ready  
Running  
Faster, faster it's coming  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep up  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
Change is gonna come  
  
Living on an all time high  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Change is coming, oh you better be running  
I see you ready, I keep running  
Faster and faster it's coming  
  
Change is coming, oh you better be running  
I see you ready, I keep running  
Faster and faster it's coming

When you walked in the room, I thought I'd forgotten you  
Turns out it isn't true after all  
And now I do regret all the things I said  
I can't take this anymore  
  
I want you  
I'm telling you  
Oh, oh  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sitting there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Ooooooo  
  
I'll do overtime, just to make you mine  
I can't remember why I left you behind  
Things that I shoulda done, I was having too much fun  
Why did I let you go?  
  
I want you, and I'm telling you  
Oh, oh  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sittin' there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Ooooooo  
  
I was such a fool  
Oh, I was so damn cruel  
But I'm willing to change  
I wanna be your man again  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sitting there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Ladies and Gentlemen we've got a special treat for tonight  
I'm gonna call my friend Olly up here to sing to you ladies  
Olly!  
Yeah!  
Let's go man  
Okay  
  
My name is Olly nice to meet you can I tell you baby  
Look around there's a whole lot of pretty ladies  
But not like you, you shine so bright, yeah  
  
I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute  
On the floor up and close getting lost in it  
I won't give up without a fight  
  
I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
  
We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now  
Loosen up and let you hands go down, down  
Go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah  
  
I feel the music moving through your body  
Looking at you I can tell you want me  
Don't stop keep moving till the morning light, yeah  
  
When I saw you there, sitting all alone in the dark acting like you didn't
have a care  
I knew right then, you'd be mine, we'd be dancing the whole damn night, like  
Oh baby, I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
  
Break it down now, shake it like that, now bring it all back  
To dance with me tonight  
One more time, one more time, come on now  
Do your thing, everybody sing  
I just wanna, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight  
So come on, oh baby  
I just want you to dance with me tonight

The table's set for 2 but I'm the only one  
That's how you left me here with a smoking gun  
Thought we were solid wood but we are plastic trees  
I swear I hear you laughing cause the joke's on me  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you  
  
But I saw your colors in a shining light  
But it was just a sketch of you in black and white  
What kind of crazy spell did you leave me on  
It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumpation running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose you,  
Letting go is the hardest part  
Like holding on to a shooting star  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you, did I lose  
  
Can you lose what you never did have  
It's hard to hold there in your hands  
Was my assumption running too fast  
Did I lose you...

Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn  
I wish that's how I felt  
I just can't hide the fool that I am  
As I let you walk away into the sunset  
It's just another famine  
I try to do the right thing  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown  
  
I made a mistake  
I got confused  
It's easy to forget  
'Cause this is real life  
With so much to lose  
When I let you walk away into the sunset  
I wasn't brokenhearted  
It'd be a happy ending but  
I ended up with nothing good  
  
And I blame Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown  
No oh oh  
Tinseltown, oh  
Tinseltown, no oh oh  
Tinseltown  
  
I fell for the lines  
You knew that I would  
Hurray for Hollywood  
  
I tried to be strong, to be brave, to behave like a hero (hero)  
I tried to be tough, to be cool, to be smooth like De Niro (De Niro)  
But it hurts without you  
And I look like a fool  
And I don't have a clue what to say when love breaks down  
'Cause this ain't Tinseltown

There's too much light in this room  
But soon the moon will be gone from view  
There's too much fight 'til we bruise  
One step from saying goodbye to you  
  
And maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out  
Maybe it's the darkness all around, all around  
Tore this love apart, what happens now?  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late if I stay?  
  
My bags are packed in a row  
Don't think I'm ready to let you go now  
This hurts me more than you know  
The sound of silence before the showdown  
  
Maybe it's my heart that's holding out, holding out  
I know that the spark is blowing out, blowing out  
Maybe it's the darkness all around, all around  
Tear this love apart or stand my ground?  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late?  
  
If I stay right here, hold you forever  
For a thousand years, for worse or for better  
We can't stop now, we'll make it together someway  
If I stay, ooh if I stay  
  
If I stay, will you hold me again?  
If I stay to forgive and forget  
If I lay my defenses down on the floor  
If we come to our senses and love like before  
Will you say, will you say that it's not too late if I stay?

Maybe you're out tonight  
With somebody else by your side  
Oh oh oh oh  
You forgot about me, yeah  
And I guess you're moving on  
You got sick of me like a song  
Oh oh oh oh  
That's playing on repeat  
  
While you're living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
So I dated other girls, yeah  
I tried everything in the world  
Oh oh oh oh  
To forget your face  
Why would anyone stick around  
When I get up screaming out  
At the worst time  
Your name  
  
That's while you're living the good life  
I feel a sharp knife  
Stabbing me straight through the heart  
  
You gotta know that I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
  
Don't even know if you care  
That I'm waiting right here  
Unable to make one move  
Still waiting for you to call  
Banging my head against the wall  
I'm so hopeless without you  
  
I'm here all alone  
Wondering if you feel this low  
As I do without you oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
Since you left I've been miserable  
Why did you have to go oh oh?  
  
Can you hear me when I say  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
I really want you  
I really need you  
Oh oh oh oh  
In case you didn't know  
In case you didn't know  
In case you didn't know

I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
  
Ooh ooh ooh (I'd try anything, to get you off my mind)  
  
We used to climb Primrose Hill  
When it was just the two of us  
We used to run up the stairs  
On the double-decker bus  
And oh, I can't do that anymore  
No, it just reminds me of before  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
I see a girl across the street  
On a sunny afternoon  
And if I look through half-closed eyes  
She looks a bit like you  
Oh, it just reminds me of before  
No, I can't do that anymore  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
All my days are messed up  
Can't break down, can't break up  
Sleepless nights that never end  
I wish I could pretend  
Oh, I can't do this anymore  
  
I've tried everything,  
To get you off my mind  
I've been running 'round,  
Breaking things, getting into fights  
I don't know what it takes  
Ooh, I wish I didn't have to think of us  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough  
  
Ooh ooh ooh (Anything anything baby, to get you off my mind)  
I've tried everything,  
And everything is not enough

[Verse 1]  
I want to love you, give you that loving baby  
Take it high with you, do what you like baby  
I got to find out, how you can be my lady  
I got to do things, do things to drive you crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We got one chance and I want it badly  
Do you feel like it's going the right way?  
Do you know what you're doing inside me?  
If you want that then bring that fire baby  
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it  
If you like that then we can go round it  
If you need that then tell me right now  
Baby cause I wanna know  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Verse 2]  
I want to show you, show you that good life baby  
You got my heartbeat, beating inside me lately  
I'm watching your lips move, can't hear a word you're saying  
Cause I want to do things, do things that drive you crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We got one chance and I want it badly  
Do you feel like it's going the right way?  
Do you know what you're doing inside me?  
If you want that then bring that fire baby  
Yeah you got me, I'm dreaming about it  
If you like that then we can go round it  
If you need that then tell me right now  
Baby cause I wanna know  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh kiss me, oh hold me  
Let's go to a place, we'll never be lonely  
Oh I need you, I need you to hold me  
Oh baby, kiss me like you mean it  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it  
Kiss me like you mean it, kiss me like you mean it  
If this is the last night  
Baby let's do this right, kiss me like you mean it

[Verse:]  
Keep that light on in your window  
Undo the locks and let me in  
I've come seeking my salvation  
The one who's lost, in search of it  
The one who's lost, in search of it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
With every motion, every moment that we've owned  
I'll be here to break the fall  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Keep that love light in your window  
Till I get back home to you  
Lift my heart and set your soul free  
Tell me love's the only truth  
Tell me love's the only truth  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
There's an open book of stories to be told  
And I'll be here to tell them all  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and we can fill our lives with magic  
Let me in and we can keep each other warm  
With every motion, every moment that we hold  
I'll be here to break the fall  
I'm always here to break the fall

Love is moving faster but I'm taking my time  
I'm gonna be there when I get there  
You just follow the signs  
I'm making something out of nothing  
And if you want a ride  
Get your self together  
And we'll leave the world behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground  
Nothing gonna stand in our way (Oh)  
Get up get on my cloud  
I'm not gonna let you down  
Let's make it happen today  
  
I'll be busy doing nothing  
And it's starting to show  
But let's turn nothing into something  
I can't do it alone  
So if you wanna make it happen  
And you got time to do  
Get your self together  
And we'll leave it all behind  
  
Get up get on my cloud  
Lift your feet right off the ground

One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love  
One of these days I'll find you if I don't give up.  
  
Time is going by, I'm only getting older  
Middle of the night, it's only getting colder  
Are you cold out there too?  
  
My room is big enough for the both of us  
So won't you come around? Help me fill it up  
'Cause I'm sitting here in all this space  
Why don't you come and show your face?  
  
One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love (Ahhh)  
One of these days I'll find you if I don't give up (Ahhh)  
  
Time is going by, I'm only getting older  
Middle of the night, it's only getting colder  
Are you cold out there too?  
  
My room is big enough for the both of us  
So won't you come around? Help me fill it up  
Oh I'm sitting here in all this space  
Why don't you come and show your face?  
  
Ooooh! Oooh, yeah  
  
One of these days I'm gonna find someone to love  
One of these days I'll find you cause I won't give up

I asked for your number but you wanted mine,  
You said write on my hand so it's easy to find.  
We were right at the start,  
And everything was possible.  
  
We were stupid, reckless, breaking the rules,  
Careless, happy, fearless and new.  
We were right at the start, somehow we got here.  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We come so close, we got so far.  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.  
  
We were caught in a bubble, no one could burst.  
Had whole conversations without any words.  
We got right to the top  
And couldn't believe the view.  
  
It's a long way down.  
Nobody cares when it feels like flying a long way down, yeah.  
Somehow we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We've come so close, we got so far  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.  
  
To say goodbye.  
Doesn't get better  
Doesn't g-get better  
It doesn't get better than this.  
  
I was stupid, reckless, breaking the rules.  
I was foolish, hurtful, selfish and cruel.  
I was out of control but that's how we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night...  
It doesn't get better than this  
The perfect time...  
Oh tell me that you feel it, tell me that you feel it too.  
We've come so close, we got so far  
We made it, we made it the perfect night, the perfect time  
To say goodbye.

You walked through the door

How many lies?  
Question  
How many times?

Where do I begin?  
Should I tell you

You're underneath my skin  
But I'm confused  
My head is spinning all around  
I waited so long  
I need to know, darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
No, please don't let me go

My heart is beating double time, yeah  
And do you feel the same? (Do you feel the same)  
Don't leave me in the dark, no  
But baby don't put out this spark, no  
I waited so long  
I need to know, darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes

No, please don't let me go  
Baby no, no, no, no  
  
Caught in the inquisition  
Under these conditions  
I need a definition  
Is it love that we're sharing  
Show me that you're caring  
You see my fascination  
Tell me I'm not mistaken  
Give me the information I need  
One, two, three  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)  
Baby please don't let me go (Please don't let me go)  
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)

Words unspoken disappearing in the air  
All I see is you and I  
You're the only lifeline, that I need tonight

Butterflies inside, freaking me out  
I should be walking away but I'm pinned to the ground  
I can't get free, no-one's saving me  
Walking in the water, seeing what I can find  
Before I even knew it I was caught on the line (Yeah)  
You pulled me in, you got under my skin  
  
Every part of my body's telling me to go  
Telling me to get out  
Every part of my body's saying I should be gone  
But I'm still here  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
It's the first time in forever that I've been so scared  
You just five foot six, blue eyes, blonde hair  
When I see your face  
There's no breathing space  
In my life  
You stop deep inside  
Take me home  
Then I can go  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
Oh I can't fight it  
No I can't fight it  
  
Every part of my body's telling me to go  
Telling me to get out  
Every part of my body's saying I should be gone  
But I'm still here  
  
I can't run away, it's a losing game  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
So I put my hands up  
I got a white flag flying  
Only you can knock me out  
I can't fight it (fight it)  
You want me and I like it  
  
I can't fight it  
Oh no I can't fight it

Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Baby girl with the broken smile  
Would you mind if I stayed a while?  
And if you're cold, I could light your fire  
If that's what you want, if that's what you want  
I admit that I done some wrong  
But those wrongs helped me write this song  
And through it all, I figured out where I belong  
Right by your side, right by your side  
  
They say that hearts don't lie  
The head might try but it won't be right  
You tell me what you feel inside  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Baby girl, let your hair hang down  
And if we're lost, baby let's get found  
And when the world's flipping upside down  
Let's make it right, let's make it right  
  
They say that hearts don't lie  
The head might try but it won't be right  
You tell me what you feel inside  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
For every season

Too much time and too much space looking for the truth  
Mountains you have had to climb, valleys you've been through  
I don't know about where you've been or where you're going to  
I will get lost with you  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
I will get lost with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
Oh yeah, so stick with me  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
Too much blame and too much shame, none of it is true  
All the weight of your regrets, we all got a few  
It's not too much to carry if you let me carry too, yeah  
I will be there with you  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
But I'll be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
We all get lonely  
Come on baby!  
  
Oh, father don't you worry, I've never let you down  
Oh, mother when you need me, I'll always be around  
Sister, it's hard to see you struggle like you do  
But I'll be there with you  
  
We all get lonely  
Trying to find a place where we should be  
Trying to find someone to set us free  
There are times a friend is all you need  
We all get lonely, so stick with me  
  
So stick with me, oh yeah

Try to walk  
Try to run  
Try to fool  
Everyone  
To imply that you were fine is pitiful  
  
So I give chase but you were too fast  
Try to lose track of your past  
Too far gone to notice my hands  
Walking on broken glass  
The reasons why you survived was a miracle  
  
So I made a call to your front door  
Telling you I'm never gonna go far  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
'Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here, to start a new  
Before you too comes undone  
  
I woke up I am just a man  
All I have is these two hands  
I took on the world when you ran  
I have fire water and air  
With you in mind, I'll move space and time to heal you  
  
So I sent a letter to your front door  
Telling you everything I said before  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here to start a new, before you too comes undone  
'Cause you're the one.  
  
Step by step we go, far away from trouble  
How I wish you could see what you never see  
  
And under us the river subsides for you  
Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you  
'Cause you're the one  
You can call on me for all of the dark you fear  
And I am here, to start a new before you too comes undone.  
'Cause you're the one.  
  
'Cause you're the one.

Wintertime in London, are you making plans?  
Are you still rocking Converse with your old Ray Bans  
If you're sitting in the places that we use to be  
Or if you're somewhere listening to Bob Marley  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach?  
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet  
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free  
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze?  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
Oh yes, you are  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
  
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last  
No point regretting that it went so fast  
Time that we had was like sand in our hands  
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine  
  
I remember taking you home on that 86  
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss  
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street  
If you remember just how scared I use to be  
  
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me  
  
Bumped into Irene down in Waterloo  
She told me that you got yourself somebody new  
She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice  
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I  
  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now  
I know, wherever you go  
That you'll be thinking about me now

This one's for the girl that I see at the coffee shop  
Who knows my name and looks so hot  
I always get an extra shot and smile for free  
  
And this is for the girl, so sugar sweet  
At the bus stop waiting for the 23  
She's so shy, I wish she'd notice me  
  
This one's for the girls x2  
  
This one's for the girl in the pub sitting next to me  
She spends too much on the fruit machine  
She drinks me under the table every time  
  
And what about the one from around the way?  
She's not all that, but that's okay  
She talks to tree's but still, she blows my mind  
  
Woah woah woah ohh  
There's nothing better  
Woah woah woah ohh  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
And this one's for the girl at the club in the trilby hat  
Standing up on the bar shaking this and that  
Even though she's got that big exam at 8  
  
And here's to all those office girls  
From the secretaries to the CEO  
Baby when you coming home?  
Coz I can't wait  
  
Woah woah woah ohh  
There's nothing better  
Woah woah woah ohh  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
I love to love those girls  
  
Huh, listen  
I love those Scottish girls  
I can't resist the Irish girls, and  
The Welsh and English girls  
Haha, and don't forget the Essex girls  
  
No matter where I go  
No matter what I do  
The only thing I know  
It's all about the girls  
  
This one's for the girls  
I can't stop thinking about you  
This one's for the girls  
Life would really suck without you  
  
This one's for the girls, girls, girls  
All around the world  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls  
  
(This one's for the girls)  
I can't stop thinking about you  
(This one's for the girls)  
Life would suck without you  
(This one's for the girls)  
  
Ohh  
I love to love to love, love to love those girls

This is my confessional  
Pen and paper I'm gonna right this down  
Saying things you never thought  
That were on my mind,  
Let the truth pour out  
Cause I'm tired of the games  
I won't lie, no I'm not ok!  
You were wrong you're to blame,  
Now the world knows your name  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you,  
This is no mistake, yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you, about you!  
  
This song is about you, yeah!  
Seem I'm feeling better now,  
I like the way our heads lifting off my chest!  
Should have done months ago  
If I knew back ten it would feel like this!  
Cause you done all the games  
I won't lie, no I'm not ok  
You were wrong, you're the blame  
Now the world knows your name!  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you,  
This is no mistake, yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you, about you!  
  
When you hear this play,  
I hope you feel the same way that I felt that day  
That you let me, yeah you left me!  
This is my confession  
This is my confessional  
Pen and paper round gonna right this down  
  
So here you go,  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down!

About you, about you, about you!

You know it's hard to be your friend  
I hate to let you down again  
We don't know how it's gonna end  
Cause now you know the secret  
I can't never mend And this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged  
Time that is left, is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away  
It all could go away This silence is deafening  
This ocean is without an end  
And there's something I know  
Something I know, we were meant to be  
Please listen to me, are you listening? Cause this could be gone when we wake
up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged  
Time that is left, is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away  
It all could go away  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
And this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged, time that is left is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away

[Verse 1]  
I drew a broken heart right on your window pane,  
Waited for your reply here in the pouring rain.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Just breathe against the glass,  
Leave me some kind of sign.  
I know the hurt won't pass, yeah  
Just tell me it's not the end of the line,  
Just tell me it's not the end of the line.  
  
[Chorus]  
I never meant to break your heart,  
I won't let this plane go down.  
I never meant to make you cry,  
I'll do what it takes to make this fly, oh  
You gotta hold on, hold on to what you're feeling,  
That feeling is the best thing, the best thing, alright.  
I'm gonna place my bet on us,  
I know this love is heading in the same direction,  
That's up.  
  
[Verse 2]  
You drew a question mark, but you know what I want.  
I wanna turn the clock, yeah, right back to where it was.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So let's build a bridge, yeah,  
From your side to mine.  
I'll be the one to cross over,  
Just tell me it's not the end of the line,  
Just tell me it's not the end of the line.  
  
[Chorus]  
I never meant to break your heart,  
I won't let this plane go down.  
I never meant to make you cry,  
I'll do what it takes to make this fly, oh  
You gotta hold on, hold on to what you're feeling,  
That feeling is the best thing, the best thing, alright.  
I'm gonna place my bet on us,  
I know this love is heading in the same direction,  
That's up.  
  
[Bridge]  
Girl, I know we could climb back to where we were then,  
Feel it here in my heart, put my heart in your hand.  
Well, I hope and I pray that you do understand,  
If you did, all you have to say is  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm waiting for you.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I never meant to break your heart,  
I won't let this plane go down (let this plane go down).  
I never meant to make you cry,  
I'll do what it takes to make this fly, oh  
You gotta hold on, hold on to what you're feeling,  
That feeling is the best thing, the best thing, alright.  
I'm gonna place my bet on us,  
I know this love is heading in the same direction,  
That's up.

Your heart beat so near me  
But I can't break in  
How easy you control me  
Look at the state I'm in  
  
You got me jumping like I'm up and down  
I'm inside out again  
You keep me running 'til the sun goes down  
'Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't nothing there  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
  
You're cold, your heart  
I'm in too far  
I love you and I can't pretend  
But your heart beats so near me  
But I can't break in  
  
You got me jumping like I'm up and down  
I'm inside out again  
You keep me running 'til the sun goes down  
'Til the sun comes round again  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
There ain't nothing there  
  
Real hearts don't feel this pain  
Let it go, let it go  
Real hearts don't feel this strain  
Let it go, let it go  
Real hearts don't feel this way  
Let it go, let it go  
But this heart won't ever change  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I care?  
I keep on chasing you  
I'm going nowhere  
Why can't I hate you?  
Why don't I dare?  
Thought I saw an angel  
But there ain't, there ain't nothing there  
  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?  
Why do I love you?

[Verse 1]  
I don't wanna be your lover  
I don't wanna be your fool  
Pick me up whenever you want it  
Throw me down when you are trough  
Cause I've learned more from what's missing  
It's about me and not about you  
I know I made some bad decisions  
But my last one was you...  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me googbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Verse 2]  
You say I can do it better  
Better than someone like you  
What I feel, can't write in a letter  
So I wrote this for you  
  
Next to you are those lies, lies, lies  
How it feels when love dies, dies, dies  
And you told me goodbye, bye, bye  
I don't know when it's over, when it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
You don't know love 'til it feels like you died when it's missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Bridge]  
(You, you, you, you)  
You won't ever get no better  
(You, you, you, you)  
Got a lot more to lose  
(You, you, you, you)  
You won't ever, ever get it  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know love 'til it tears up your heart  
And cuts it and leaves you with scars  
You're still feeling  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
You don't know love 'til it feels like you died when it's missing  
It leaves you blind with no vision  
You don't know love  
You don't know love  
  
(You don't know love)
