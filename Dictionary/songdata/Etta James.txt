Hush now don't explain  
I know you raise Cain  
I'm glad you're back  
Don't explain  
  
Quiet, don't explain  
You mixed with some dame  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you and what love endures  
All my thoughts are of you  
For I'm so completely yours  
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat  
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my joy and pain  
My life's yours love  
Don't explain

Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you, daddy  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess  
My mind's more at ease  
But never, never, nevertheless  
Why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
I might have gone but what for?  
It's awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
And ohh, darling, darling, darling, I guess  
My mind is more at ease  
But never, never, nevertheless  
Ohh, why stir up memories?  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for?  
It's always awfully different without you, daddy  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Don't get around much anymore  
Don't get around much anymore

Build your dreams to the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me  
Play with fire till your fingers burn  
And when there's no place for you to turn  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me  
For, when you hear a call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart I know  
I've been through it all and I'm an old hand  
And I'll understand if you go  
So make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers, come on to me  
Oh, make your mark for your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me  

Dream when you're feeling blue  
Dream that's the thing to do  
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
And I know you'll find your child memories there  
So dream when the day is through  
Oh, dream and they might come true  
And things never are as bad as they seem  
So dream, dream, dream  
Dream when you're feeling blue  
And ooh, dream, that's the thing to do  
And just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
And I know and I know  
You'll find your share of memories there

Fool that I am,  
For falling in love with you.  
And a, fool that I am,  
For thinking you loved me, too.  
  
You took my heart,  
Then played the part of little coquette.  
And, all my dreams just disappeared  
Like the smoke from a cigarette.  
  
Fool that I am,  
For hoping you'd understand.  
And thinking you  
Would listen, too,  
And, oh, the things I had planned.  
  
But we couldn't see eye to eye  
So, darling, darling, darling,  
This is goodbye.  
But I still care, but I still care,  
And oh, fool that I am.  
Oh, but I still care,  
Fool that I am.

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread  
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head  
Though I see the danger there  
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care  
  
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?  
When we met, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go  
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?  
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in  
Just open up your heart because I, I, I, I, I, I, I am coming in  
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night  
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
  
Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay  
It seems I met you when my love went away  
Now everyday I start by saying to you  
Good morning heartache, what's new  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't chase you no how  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight through Sunday blues

Might as well get used to you hanging around

If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything  
If I can see it, I can do it  
I used to think that I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first I know it starts inside of me  
If I can see it, I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
'Cause I believe in me  
I believe in me  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe, I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe, I believe  
I believe I can fly and I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
I know, I know I can fly  
I know, I know I can soar  
See me running through that open door  
I, I can fly  

People say that we don't know  
What love is or how to make it grow  
Well, I don't know if all that's true  
'Cause you got me and baby, I got you  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
Say, our love won't pay the rent  
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent  
I guess that's sure, we don't have a lot  
But at least I'm sure of all the things we've got  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got flowers in the spring, yeah  
I've got you, I've got you to wear my ring  
And when I'm sad, you're a clown  
And when I get scared, you're always around  
Let them say we are wrong  
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong  
But with our love like your's and mine  
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got you to hold my hand  
I got you to understand  
I got you to walk with me  
And I got you to talk with me  
I got you to kiss goodnight  
I got you, hold me tight  
I got you, I won't let go  
I got you to love me so  
Oh, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  
I got you, babe, I got you, babe, I got you, babe  

I want to be loved, I want to be loved  
I want to be loved, I need to be loved  
I want to be loved with inspiration  
I want to be loved starting tonight  
Instead of merely holding conversation  
Oh, hold me tight  
I want to be loved, I crave affection  
Those kisses of your's I gladly share  
I want your eyes to shine in my direction  
Oh, make me care  
I want a can't of romance  
That should be strong and equally as tender  
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning  
The word surrender, surrender, come on, surrender  
I want to be thrilled by only you, dear  
I want to be thrilled by your caress  
I want to find each dream of mine come true, dear  
I want to be loved  
I want the can't of romance

In the basement, down in the basement, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Where can you dance to any music you choose?  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Oh, you got the comforts of home, a nightclub too.

In the basement, in the basement, in the basement  
That's where its at

Where they don't , where they don't check you age at the door,  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Barracuda and ? til your feet get sore  
In the basement, whoa down in the basement  
Do any dance you want to do, there's no one under you  
In the basement, I know it, you tell 'em oh-h-h-h I wanna go

I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
Honey, I saw you there last night  
Another woman's arms, holding you tight  
Nobody knows what I feel inside  
All I know, that I walked away and cried  
I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, oh, nothin' but dreams to remember  
I know you said she was just your friend  
But I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly?  
'Cause I've got dreams, dreams to remember  
I've got dreams, oh, dreams to remember  
Hey, and I, and I still want you to stay

I saw you kiss her again and again and again  
And these eyes of mine, they don't fool me  
Why did she hold you so tenderly?  
'Cause I've got dreams, dreams, dreams to remember  
Oh, I've got dreams, oh, I've got dreams to remember

Just friends, lovers no more  
Just friends but not like before  
  
To think of what we've been  
Not to love again seems like pretending  
This isn't the ending  
  
True friends, drifting apart  
Two friends, but one broken heart  
We loved, we laughed, we cried  
Then suddenly love died  
The story ends and we're just friends  
  
To think of all we've been  
Not to love again seems like pretending

After my baby quit me  
I wouldn't even go outside  
When my friends tried to fix me up  
I crawl under my bed and hide  
I knew I was never gonna change my look  
Till I got my [Incomprehensible] up to try  
And when I went ahead and spread my wings  
I found out that I could fly  
Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
I had no way of knowing  
What would come from our first kiss  
It scares me now to think about  
The good love that I might have missed  
I was just tryin' to find some help  
Tryin' to see myself as a survivor  
I had to rise up from the ashes of love  
And jump back into the fire  
Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, you gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
Yeah, oh yeah  
You gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Oh yeah, sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
Sometimes, all it takes

Sometimes, all it takes  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith

Oh, sometimes, all it takes  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  

Here you come draggin' in  
Three a.m. again  
Grinnin' that silly grin  
Smellin' just like sin  
Holdin' up that alibi that's tissue paper thin  
Diggin' down deeper and deeper  
In that hole you're already in  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth  
I know you been foolin' around  
With some fool from way 'cross town  
You're tearin' our good thing down  
Makin' me out your clown  
Lookin' for excuses that you know can't be found  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth  
And you could be more discreet  
With your love letters  
And honey, I smell some other man  
All over your Cashmere sweater  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better  
If you can't lie no better than that  
You might as well tell the truth  

Looking back over my life  
I can see where I have caused you strife  
But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Looking back over my deeds  
I can see signs a wise man heeds  
And if I just had the chance  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Once my cup was overflowing  
But I gave nothing in return  
Now I can't begin to tell you  
What a lesson I have learned  
  
Looking back over the slate  
I can see love turn to hate  
But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Once my cup was overflowing  
But I gave nothing in return  
Now I can't begin to tell you

But I know, oh yes, I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again

Love letters straight from your heart  
Keep us so near while apart  
I'm not alone in the night  
When I can have all the love you write  
I memorize every line  
And I kiss the name that you sign  
And darling, then I read again right from the start  
Love letters straight from your heart  
I memorize every line  
And I kiss the name that you sign  
And darling, then I read again right from the start  
Love letters straight from your heart  
Love letters straight from your  
Love letters straight from your heart  
Love letters straight from your heart  

I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad  
I'd long to try something I'd never had  
Never had no kissing, ooh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
The night is cold and I'm so all alone  
I'd give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me but no one's here to love me  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
And I'll go to bed with a prayer  
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
And whisper sweet, little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing baby  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance  
Could be like a heavenly dream  
And I'll go to bed with the prayer  
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?  
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord  
Since my baby said goodbye  
Oh Lord, I don't know what I'd do  
All I knew is sit and sigh  
  
The last long day, he said goodbye  
Oh Lord, I thought I would cry  
He'll do me, he'll do you  
He got the kind of loving, Lord  
I love to hear him when he call me  
Sweet ma ma, mama  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
I've grown so used to, to you somehow  
Woah, I'm nobody's, well, sugar mama now  
And I'm lonesome  
Oh, I got those lovesick blues  
  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful guy  
That's what's the matter with me  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful guy  
But he don't care about me  
  
Lord, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied  
Oh, he just wouldn't stay  
So now that he's leaving  
This is all I can say, hey, yeah  
  
I got the feeling called the blues  
  
I got the feeling called the blues, oh Lord  
Hate to think it's all over, over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
Woah, I'm nobody's sugar mama now  
And I'm lonesome, Lord  
I got those lovesick blues  
I got those lovesick blues  
  
Oh, I got a feelin' called the blues, blues  
Got a feelin' down in my shoes  
I got those lovesick blues  
Yeah, a feelin' in my shoes  
  
Lovesick blues  
From my heart to my shoes  
I got those lovesick blues  
I, I, I, I, I, I got the lovesick blues  
Feelin' in my shoes

If you could see me now.  
The one who said that she?d rather roam  
The one that said she?d rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment I could really make you mine  
Just for awhile turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain  
Take any comfort that I can  
Looking back and hoping for a freedom from my chains  
And Lie in your loving arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere through the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain  
Take any comfort that I can  
Looking back and hoping for a freedom of my chains  
And Lie in your loving arms again  
  
I can almost feel your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again

Call me fool  
Send me away  
I've got to say  
It's you I adore  
  
Alone and in love  
Falling apart  
I followed my heart  
Straight Through your door  
  
Face to Face  
With all Honesty  
I would be greatful  
If you give to me  
  
One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
Could it be that I was wrong  
To make every dream  
You ever had come true  
Oh it's just, one night  
Just One Night  
  
Standing the close  
The sound of your voice  
Leaves me no choice  
I open my love  
  
Am I so wrong  
To think, to think you might fall  
And baby you're all  
You're all I'm thinking of  
  
Face to Face  
With all Honesty  
I would be greatful  
If you give to me  
  
One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
Could it be that I was wrong  
To make every dream  
You ever had come true  
Oh it's one night  
Just One Night  
  
(Sax lead)  
2 bars  
  
One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
One Night  
One Night

I just needed someone, somebody to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
And the nights grew cold  
In my hour of darkness  
  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
You touched my soul  
  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
When I couldn't fly  
There's no words could explain  
  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
In a world full of anger  
In times gone strange  
  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
But everybody needs a little something  
To pull them through  
  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road alone  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
You're the one  
That touched my very soul  
  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road alone  
Only time will  
Only time will  
  
(Can you bring my hands to yours)  
Only time will tell  
(Can you teach my soul to fly)  
  
Only time will  
Only time will  
(Can you save me)  
  
Only time will tell  
Angel of mercy  
It's time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside  
Angel of mercy

Out of the rain, under the shelter  
I've been so long where the sun don't shine  
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way  
But now I've found you and the storm is behind  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
  
Over the wall, I'm out in the open  
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain  
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles  
I can see a long ways I feel love again  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
  
There was a time I was taking no prisoners  
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone  
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon  
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong  
  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  
Out of the rain, out of the rain  

Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace of mind.  
But, if it's not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
Show all the world how to get along,  
Peace will enter when hate is gone.  
But, if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.  
My answer is always the same.  
That unless men put an end to all of this,  
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.  
Just because I'm in misery.  
I'm not begging for no sympathy.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Just send me someone to love.  
  
Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace of mind.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love.

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do

Silent night! Holy night!  
All's asleep, one sole light,  
Just the faithful and holy pair,  
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,  
Sleep in heavenly peace!  
  
Silent night! Holy night!  
God's Son laughs, o how bright.  
Love from your holy lips shines clear,  
As the dawn of salvation draws near,  
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!  
  
Silent night! Holy night!  
Brought the world peace tonight,  
From the heavens' golden height  
Shows the grace of His holy might  
Jesus, as man on this earth!  
  
Silent night! holy night!  
Where today all the might  
Of His fatherly love us graced  
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.  
All the peoples on earth!  
  
Silent night! Holy night!  
Long we hoped that He might,  
As our Lord, free us of wrath,  
Since times of our fathers He hath  
Promised to spare all mankind!  
  
Silent night! Holy night!  
Sheperds first see the sight.  
Told by angelic Alleluja,  
Sounding everywhere, both near and far:  
"Christ the Savior is here!"

There's a saying old, says that love is blind  
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"  
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind  
  
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet  
He's the big affair I cannot forget  
Only man I ever think of with regret  
  
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram  
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody I'm longin' to see  
I hope that he, turns out to be  
Someone to watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could, always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some  
Girls think of as handsome  
To my heart he carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh, how I need  
Someone to watch over me  
  
Someone to watch over me

Tell Mama  
Etta James  
  
Your dogs ain't found a good girl,  
One that love you and give you warning  
Now you find that you been misused,  
Well how many girls can think all right  
  
She'd embarrass you anywhere,  
She'd make her friends think that she didn't care  
Give me the chance and I'd been begging  
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to  
  
Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need  
Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right  
Let me hear you say  

If there's anyone here  
Who knows why these two people should not be joined together  
Let them speak now or forever hold their peace  
  
Wait, wait stop the wedding  
You just marrying her for spite  
If she knew the inside story  
She'd tell you what your doing just ain't right  
  
I know you don't wanna hurt me  
So stop this madness before it starts  
Revenge will only cause you regret  
So don't do it, don't do it  
Don't break two hearts  
(Don't break two hearts)  
  
'Cause you belong to me, oh darlin'  
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now  
I know you feel that way too  
So baby, don't do it (don't do it)  
Don't do it (don't do it) don't do it (don't do it)  
Oh, don't you break two hearts  
(Oh don't break two hearts)

(Oh, don't break two hearts)

I smoked my last cigarette  
Threw that nasty habit away  
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet  
Didn't ever win anyway  
  
Gave up the wine and whiskey  
'Cause everybody said I should  
But I'm givin' up on quittin' you, baby  
'Cause it feels so damn good  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
And I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
You been runnin' around for a long time now  
I know all the games you play  
Sooner or later you will put me down  
Gonna have to face it someday  
  
But baby, every time you hold me  
And I get another taste of your kiss  
I feel a power comin' over me  
That my body just can't miss  
  
You are my strongest weakness  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
You are my deepest secret  
I know it's wrong but I can't go on  
  
I try, try, try,  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
My strongest weakness  
  
Why can't you just say no?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I let you go?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
Why, why do I keep, keep breakin' down?  
(Strongest weakness)  
I said why can't I turn around?  
(Strongest weakness)  
  
You know I try, try, try  
I ask myself why, why, why?  
I give in to you, baby  
You are my strongest weakness  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Can't get enough, can't give you up  
(Deepest secret)  
Deepest secret  
  
(Strongest weakness)  
Strongest weakness  
(Deepest secret)  
You are, you are  
(Strongest weakness)

You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain  
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain  
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew  
And I find the very mention of you  
Like the kicker in a julep or two  
  
The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea  
Cast a spell over me  
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself  
Can't you see that it never can be  
  
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise  
Like a summer with a thousand Julys  
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance  
You go to my head  
You go to my head
