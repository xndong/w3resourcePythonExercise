I didn't meet you in the jungle  
Swinging from a tree  
I sat down at the piano  
You were playing with me  
I couldn't believe all the things you could do  
The apes I've seen were in the zoo  
  
They say we are unique with this language that we speak  
But you have proved them wrong  
Skinner and Chomsky, how could they be so blind  
With evidence this strong?  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
When you watch King Kong or The Planet of the Apes  
Upon your video screen  
When the animals die, tears fill your eye  
And you question what you've seen  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
You can search the internet  
You can use your video phone  
To call another friend  
If we gave you all the tools  
You can do whatever you want  
Who knows when this will end  
  
Intelligent life is all around us  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where I come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to me now  
I am listening  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Look in your eyes  
That's where we come from  
  
Hey, bonobo woman  
Hey, bonobo man  
Talk to us now  
We are listening  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
Bonobo calling me now  
  
Starting to hear the things you've said  
Getting to know what's going on in your head  
There's no humans on the line  
But there'll be plenty more there in good time  
Dolphins, cats, and elephants  
This is not some wild romance  
Just look in their eyes and say it's not true  
Look in their eyes, they're checking out you  
  
Communication with the Animal Nation  
We are in communication with the Animal Nation x20

I'm on my way, I'm making it  
I've got to make it show, yeah  
So much larger than life  
I'm going to watch it growing  
  
The place where I come from is a small town  
They think so small  
They use small words  
But not me  
I'm smarter than that  
I worked it out  
I've been stretching my mouth  
To let those big words come right out  
  
I've had enough, I'm getting out  
To the city, the big big city  
I'll be a big noise with all the big boys  
There's so much stuff I will own  
And I will pray to a big god  
As I kneel in the big church  
  
Big time  
I'm on my way-I'm making it  
Big time big time  
I've got to make it show yeah  
Big time big time  
So much larger than life  
Big time  
I'm going to watch it growing  
Big time  
  
My parties all have big names  
And I greet them with the widest smile  
Tell them how my life is one big adventure  
And always they're amazed  
When I show them 'round my house, to my bed  
I had it made like a mountain range  
With a snow-white pillow for my big fat head  
And my heaven will be a big heaven  
And I will walk through the front door  
  
Big time  
I'm on my way-I'm making it  
Big time big time  
I've got to make it show-yeah  
Big time big time  
So much larger than life  
I'm going to watch it growing  
Big time big time  
My car is getting bigger  
Big time  
My house is getting bigger  
Big time  
My eyes are getting bigger  
Big time  
And my mouth  
Big time  
My belly is getting bigger  
Big time  
And my bank account  
Big time  
Look at my circumstance  
Big time  
And the bulge in my big big big big big big big

September '77  
Port Elizabeth weather fine  
It was business as usual  
In police room 619  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
When I try to sleep at night  
I can only dream in red  
The outside world is black and white  
With only one colour dead  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
You can blow out a candle  
But you can't blow out a fire  
Once the flames begin to catch  
The wind will blow it higher  
Oh Biko, Biko, because Biko  
Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja  
The man is dead  
The man is dead  
  
And the eyes of the world are watching now, watching now

I caught sight of my reflection  
I caught it in the window  
I saw the darkness in my heart  
I saw the signs of my undoing  
They had been there from the start  
  
And the darkness still has work to do  
The knotted chord's untying  
The heated and the holy  
Oh they're sitting there on high  
So secure with everything they're buying  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
We wanted the the union oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man  
  
My grip is surely slipping  
I think I've lost my hold  
Yes I think I've lost my hold  
I cannot get insurance any more  
They don't take credit, only gold  
Is that a dagger or a crucifix I see  
You hold so tightly in your hand  
And all the while the distance grows between you and me  
I do not understand  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
We wanted the the union oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man  
  
At my request you take me in  
In that tenderness I am floating away  
No certainty, nothing to rely on  
Holding still for a moment  
What a moment this is  
Oh for a moment of forgetting  
A moment of bliss  
Oh  
  
I can hear the distant thunder  
Of a million unheard souls  
Of a million unheard souls  
Watch each one reach for creature comfort  
For the filling of their holes  
  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
In the blood of Eden lie the woman and the man  
I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
  
In the blood of Eden we have done everything we can  
In the blood of Eden, so we end as we began  
With the man in the woman and the woman in the man  
It was all for the union, oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man

I'm scared of swimming in the sea  
Dark shapes moving under me  
Every fear I swallow makes me small  
Inconsequential things occur  
Alarms are triggered  
Memories stir  
It's not the way it has to be  
  
I'm afraid of what I do not know  
I hate being undermined  
I'm afraid I can be devil man  
And I'm scared to be divine  
Don't mess with me my fuse is short  
Beneath this skin these fragments caught  
  
When I allow it to be  
There's no control over me  
I have my fears  
But they do not have me  
  
Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods  
The deeper I go, the darker it gets  
I peer through the window  
Knock at the door  
And the monster I was  
So afraid of  
Lies curled up on the floor  
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy  
  
I cry until I laugh  
  
I'm afraid of being mothered  
With my balls shut in the pen  
I'm afraid of loving women  
And I'm scared of loving men  
Flashbacks coming in every night  
Don't tell me everything's alright  
  
When I allow it to be  
It has no control over me  
I own my fear  
So it doesn't own me  
  
Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods  
The deeper I go, the darker it gets  
I peer through the window  
Knock at the door  
And the monster I was  
So afraid of  
Lies curled up on the floor  
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy  
  
I cry until I laugh

Umzingelt von spiegeln  
Von traeumen befleckt  
Der saum schnuert ein  
Was I'm koerper steckt  
Sanft der bauch, gespannter muskel  
Weiche tuecher auf der tigerhaut  
  
Feucht wie gras  
Reif und schwer wie bluetenpollen  
Der schwamm ist voll  
Keiner hat es sehen wollen  
Auf alles legt sich kon-ver-sa-tion  
Glasur auf warmem, frischem kuchen  
  
Licht draengt durch ihre geheimen tunnel  
Ein sog, der nach draussen geht  
Bricht sich bahn als greller blitz  
Der feinste fratzen erbleichen laesst  
  
Spuer verlangen in leisem fluestern  
Spannung I'm gesicht  
Koerper pressen gegen gitter  
Spielt die musik, spielt gericht  
Fuer sie  
  
Opfergaben - gekoepfte huehner  
Tanzen walzer - sagen - komm!  
Mann und weib - nackt vor allen!  
Gekreuzte staemme in hitze besetzt  
  
Auch wenn die zarte haut schon zittert  
Fuehlen sie noch mit der mutter  
Die einsam geniesst, was der tag ihr bringt  
Doch auch an andere stunden denkt  
  
Der vater traurig, letzte liebe  
Fegt asche mit dem besen  
Leises kichern, schmierige witze  
Spritzen ueber tisch und tuch  
Und worte, worte, worte  
  
Weisst du noch? - der boden ist da...  
Liebes, liebster, du... von frost bedeckt  
  
Weisst du noch? - der boden ist da...  
Liebes, liebster, du... von frost bedeckt  
  
Ploetzlich stille, fallbeil saust, alle tueren zu  
Haende greifen fest ans messer  
Schneid den kuche nur I'm dunklen an!  
Jeder kriegt ein stueck - ein kleines stueck  
Den koerper - und das fleisch  
Die familie - und das fischernetz  
Ein neuer - in den maschen  
  
Der koerper und das fleisch  
Der koerper und das fleisch  
Und das fleisch

Don't tell me what I will do, 'cause I won't  
Don't tell me to believe in you, 'cause I don't  
Be on your guard, better hostile and don't risk affection  
Like flesh to the bone in the no-go zone  
You're still waiting for the resurrection  
Come up to me with your "What did you say?"  
And I'll tell you straight in the eye  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
Do it yourself  
  
Everyone want to be what he not, what he not  
Nobody happy with what he got, what he got  
You function like a dummy with a new ventriloquist  
Do you say nothing yourself?  
Hanging like a thriller on the final twist  
You know you're getting stuck on the shelf  
Come up to me with your "What did you say?"  
And I'll tell you straight in the eye  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
  
When things get so big, I don't trust them at all  
You want some control,you've got to keep it small  
  
D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y. D.I.Y.  
Do it yourself

Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
All this momentum keeps stealing through  
Across the cornfields, through all the marshland  
There's nothing gonna stop this thing  
Clear the trees, burn the brushwood  
Bring the diggers in, I'm gonna move this earth  
Lay the big stones, put down the sleepers  
Haul the steel in, I will beat this land  
Don't care how but, I'm coming through here  
Whatever it takes, oh  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Right through these fences, cut through the stone walls  
Dig out the tunnels from a solid stone  
There she is, but so surrounded  
All those fancy men with soft white hands  
Come all this distance, that should be me there  
Whatever it takes (whatever it takes), oh  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion  
We work together in sympathy  

'Hey Mac, see you down the Dolce Vita!  
'Get back, we don't have time  
'cause I hear we're sending off the heroes  
When the year goes, they're out of the bay,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'  
  
'So long' said poor men to their families,  
Be strong 'til we get back home.  
And if not, take care of all the children  
Until then just hope and pray  
To make it alive'  
  
'You guys are crazy'  
  
They shout and then we leave the harbor.  
In doubt, they're acting weird  
And the sea is whipping up a welcome  
If hell come we're all easy prey,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'  
  
'You guys are crazy'  
  
The captain's hand shook for the guys to get in place  
He said, 'Let's look behind your face.'  
With each corner covered, they were all around  
Waiting for the midnight bell to sound  
'Out of sight," cried Aeron through his glasses  
'Don't fight' said Gorham's smioulder  
I was scared of being easy prey,  
Trying to find a way  
To make it alive'

I looked up at the tallest building.  
Felt it falling down.  
  
I could feel my balance shifting.  
Everything was moving around.  
  
These streets so fixed and solid.  
Ah, shimmering haze.  
  
And everything I relied on disappeared.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight from the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
All the strangers look like family.  
All the family look so strange.  
  
The only constant, I am sure of.  
Is this accelerating rate of change.  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.  
  
I stand here, watch you spinning.  
Until I am drawn in.  
A centripetal force.  
You pull me in.  
  
Pull me in.  
  
OVO  
  
Downside up, upside down.  
Take my weight off the ground.  
Falling deep in the sky.  
Slipping in the unknown.

Excuse me  
You're wearing out my joie de vie  
Grabbing those good years again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me  
I'm not the man I used to be  
Someone else crept in again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me please  
I'm looking for Lost Angeles  
Soaking up the sin again  
I want to be alone  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right (Alright)  
  
Excuse me please  
You're standing on my memories  
Stealing souvenirs again  
I want to be alone  
  
Leave me alone, I want to be alone  
(repeated several times)  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska, if it all turns out right

The streets are lined with camera crews  
Everywhere he goes is news  
Today is different  
Today is not the same  
Today I make the action  
Take snapshot into the light, snapshot into the light  
I'm shooting into the light  
  
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on  
Driving into the sun  
If I worked it out right  
They won't see me or the gun  
  
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road  
The cheering has really begun  
I've got my radio  
I can hear what's going on  
  
I've been waiting for this  
I have been waiting for this  
All you people in TV land  
I will wake up your empty shells  
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash  
As I burn into your memory cells  
'cause I'm alive  
  
They're coming 'round the corner with the bikers at the front  
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes  
It's a matter of time  
It's a matter of will  
And the governor's car is not far behind  
He's not the one I've got in mind  
'cause there he is-the man of the hour, standing in the limousine  
"I don't really hate you  
I don't care what you do  
We were made for each other  
Me and you  
I want to be somebody  
You were like that too  
If you don't get given you learn to take  
And I will take you."  
  
Holding my breath  
Release the catch  
And I let the bullet fly  
  
All turned quiet I have been here before  
Lonely boy hiding behind the front door  
Friends have all gone home  
There's my toy gun on the floor  
Come back Mum and Dad  
You're growing apart  
You know that I'm growing up sad  
I need some attention  
I shoot into the light

Father, son  
Locked as one  
In this empty room  
Spine against spine  
Yours against mine  
Till the warmth comes through  
  
Remember the breakwaters down by the waves  
I first found my courage  
Knowing daddy could save  
I could hold back the tide  
With my dad by my side  
  
Dogs, plows and bows  
We move through each pose  
Struggling in our separate ways  
Mantras and hymns  
Unfolding limbs  
Looking for release through the pain  
  
And the yogi's eyes are open  
Looking up above  
He too is dreaming of his daddy's love  
With his dad by his side  
Got his dad by his side  
  
Can you recall  
How you took me to school  
We couldn't talk much at all  
It's been so many years  
And now these tears  
Guess I'm still a child  
  
Out on the moors  
We take a pause  
See how far we have come  
You're moving quite slow  
How far can we go  
Father and son  
  
With my dad by my side  
With my dad by my side  
Got my dad by my side  
With me

Doing nothing stuck in the mud  
Just pumping the blood  
The water level's getting low  
Something ugly is going to show  
  
If I could only touch you  
I guess you'd be alarmed  
If only I could touch you  
I don't mean you no harm  
  
If only I could touch you  
like the wind can touch the sail  
If only I could touch you, darling  
now that words have failed  
Oh, Flotsam still afloat  
Oh, Jetsam thrown out of the boat  
  
Oh love, my love  
nothing here is what it seems  
  
We both know it  
Christ! you show it  
Oh, oh my love

Essen - essen - essen  
Immer noch so hungrig  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
  
Schlafen - schlafen - schlafen  
Nachts immer so nervoes  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Nein, hoer nie wieder auf  
  
Schnell ans telefon  
Egal welche nummer  
Jede stimme ist mir recht  
Zu weit diesmal  
Viel zu weit hab ich's getrieben  
Der kopf platzt - mir ist schlecht  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
  
Hinter jedem stuhl  
Steckt ein schweigen, das lebt  
Es kommt hervor, wenn der nebel sich hebt  
Es frisst alles -  
Alarm !  
Lichter gehn aus, sterne stuerzen ab  
Wie ein bienenschwarm  
Keine selbst-  
Keine selbstkontrolle  
Keine selbst-  
Keine selbst-  
Keine selbstkontrolle  
  
Reden - reden - reden  
Ich tu dir nicht gern weh  
Ich hoer nicht wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
  
Regen in der strasse  
Regen in der nacht  
Ich muss jetzt weitergehn  
Ich muss jetzt weitergehn  
Nein, ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Nein, ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf  
Ich hoer nie wieder auf

See me a big woman, big woman look how you dance  
See me a big woman, big woman caught in a trance  
  
Dancing on the tabletop, covered up with the Easter feast  
You're dancing for the fishermen, from the very large right  
to the least  
Dancing for the slow release, first the boy and then the beast  
Then the beast  
  
Burning, burning with the kiss of life  
Burning, burning with the kiss of life  
  
See me, a big woman, big woman so full of life  
See me, a big woman, big woman going to be my wife  
  
Watching for the different eyes they change your face they come inside  
Watch the spirits laugh and cry, watch them find a place to hide  
Watch the spirits talk in tongues, watch them take you for a ride  
  
Down at the ocean lies a body in the sand  
Big woman sits beside, head in hand  
With heat from her skin, and fire from her breath  
She blows hard, she slows deep in the mouth of death  
  
Burning, burning with the kiss of life  
Burning, burning with the kiss of life  
Burning, burning with the kiss of life

Sat in the corner of the Garden Grill, with plastic flowers on the window sil  
No more miracles, loaves and fishes, been so busy with the washing of the
dishes  
Reaction level's much too high - I can do without the stimuli  
  
I'm living way beyond my ways and means, living in the zone of the inbetweens  
I can see the flashes on the frozen ocean, static charge of the cold emotion  
Watched on by the distant eyes - watched on by the silent hidden spies  
  
But still the warmth flows through me  
And I sense you know me well  
No luck, no golden chances  
No mitigating circumstances now  
It's only common sense  
There are no accidents around here  
  
I am willing - lay your hands on me  
I am ready - lay your hands on me  
I believe - lay your hands on me, over me  
  
Working in gardens, thornless roses, fat men play with their garden hoses  
Poolside laughter has a cynical bite, sausage speared by the cocktail
satellite  
I walk away from from light and sound, down stairways leading underground  
  
But still the warmth flows through me  
And I sense you know me well  
It's only common sense  
There are no accidents around here  
  
I am willing - lay your hands on me  
I am ready - lay your hands on me  
I believe - lay your hands on me, over me over me  
  
Lay your hands on me  
Lay your hands on me  
Lay your hands on me, over me

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right it front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
For though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Yeah, there will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
And when the night is cloudy  
There is still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow  
Let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
There will be an answer  
Let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom  
Let it be

So, you know how people are  
When it's all gone much too far  
The way their minds are made  
Still, there's something you should know  
That I could not let show  
That fear of letting go  
  
And in this moment, I need to be needed  
With this darkness all around me, I like to be liked  
In this emptiness and fear, I want to be wanted  
Cause I love to be loved  
I love to be loved [Repeat x2]  
Yes, I love to be loved  
  
I cry the way that babies cry  
The way they can't deny  
The way they feel  
Words, they climb all over you  
'Til they uncover you  
From where you hide  
  
And in this moment, I need to be needed  
When my self-esteem is sinking, I like to be liked  
In this emptiness and fear,  
I want to be wanted  
Cause I love to be loved  
I love to be loved [Repeat x2]  
Oh I love to be loved  
  
This old familiar craving  
I've been here before, this way of behaving  
Don't know who the hell I'm saving anymore  
Let it pass let it go let it leave  
From the deepest place I grieve  
This time I believe  
  
And I let go [Repeat x2]  
I can let go of it  
Though it takes all the strength in me  
And all the world can see  
I'm losing such a central part of me  
I can let go of it  
You know I mean it  
You know that I mean it  
I recognize how much I've lost  
But I cannot face the cost  
Cause I love to be loved  
  
Yes I love to be loved  
I love to be loved  
[Repeat x3]  
  
I love to be loved  
  
I love to be loved  
Yes I love to be loved

People go naked and pick up these trails  
Someone before me laid down these rails  
When it's loaded up too heavy,  
this engine fails  
In lovetown  
I can't settle down  
And do those teeth still match the wound  
Take a good look around  
In lovetown  
  
Aaahha, aaahha  
Looking in lovetown  
Aaahha, aaahha  
This is lovetown  
  
Sometimes you're stormy water  
on which I pour my oil  
In each other's shadow  
The roots reach into the soil  
All these knots so tightly tied  
We could not uncoil  
In lovetown  
No place to settle down  
And do those teeth still match the wound  
Take a good look around  
In lovetown  
  
Aaahha, aaahha  
This is lovetown  
Aaahha, aaahha  
Looking in lovetown  
  
Who's lonely lips will find these hidden scars?  
Who's seen the kisses left in dim lit bars?  
Who's out in the streets, looking for love like ours?  
Who's looking in lovetown tonight?  
  
Have you got what you want  
Said have you got what you need  
With what you did and what you saw  
Did you find you needed more  
Have you got what you came for  
Are you really so sure  
Are you really so sure  
  
Looking in lovetown  
In lovetown  
Living in lovetown  
Hey yeah yeah.

Put on the dress in which you were married.  
Pull down the veil till your eyes are hid.  
  
Can you remember where we both came from.  
Let us do as we did.  
  
Look at tomorrow today.  
Making tomorrow today.  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today.  
  
Put back the photo under the window.  
Put down the 'phone that you hold in your hand.  
  
Put away these things that stand in between us.  
Let us be what we can.  
  
When it seems, hopeless.  
When it seems, hopeless.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today.  
  
What better measure of what you were doing here  
Than what you can leave behind.  
  
All the children of your children's children.  
Do you ever think what they're going to find.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.  
Where the sacred met the scared.  
  
Make tomorrow, make tomorrow.  
Where the dreamer's dream is dared.  
  
In each one of us, a dream can burn like the sun.  
Let's try it all one more time to get this lesson learned.  
  
Sitting up in a spaceship.  
Looking down at the earth.  
You wonder what they're struggling for.  
What's it all really worth.  
  
Making tomorrow today.  
Making tomorrow today.  
Make tomorrow. Make tomorrow.

Me and my teddy bear  
Have no trouble have no care  
Me and my teddy bear  
Just play and play all day.  
  
I love my teddy bear  
He has one eye and has no hair  
I love my teddy bear  
We play and play all day.  
  
Every night he's with me  
When I climb up the stairs  
And by my bed he listens  
Until I say my prayers.  
  
Oh, me and my teddy bear  
Have no trouble have no care  
Me and my teddy bear  
We play (blp blp) and play (blp blp)  
All day!

Looking down on empty streets, all she can see  
Are the dreams all made solid  
Are the dreams all made real  
  
All of the buildings, all of those cars  
Were once just a dream  
In somebody's head  
  
She pictures the broken glass, she pictures the steam  
She pictures a soul  
With no leak at the seam  
  
Let's take the boat out  
Wait until darkness  
Let's take the boat out  
Wait until darkness comes  
  
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey  
Nowhere in the suburbs  
In the cold light of day  
There in the midst of it so alive and alone  
Words support like bone  
  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Wear your inside out  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddy's arms again  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
'Swear they moved that sign  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddy's arms  
  
Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth  
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word  
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box  
To the priest, he's the doctor  
He can handle the shocks  
Dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips  
Of kissing Mary's lips  
  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Wear your inside out  
Dreaming of mercy  
In your daddy's arms again  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
'Swear they moved that sign  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddy's arms  
  
Looking for mercy  
Looking for mercy  
Looking for mercy  
Mercy, mercy  
  
Anne, with her father is out in the boat  
Riding the water  
Riding the waves on the sea

Hey, I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean  
All you can give is a spin in your washing machine  
I fly off to Rome to my prima bella  
She leaves me in the rain with telescopic umbrella  
Ooh the pain -- Modern love can be a strain  
  
I trusted my Venus was untouched in her shell  
But the pearls in her oyster were as tacky as hell  
For Lady Godiva I came incognito  
But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto  
Ooh the pain, modern love can be a strain  
  
I don't know why they leave me in the lurch  
To carry on the search  
It's driving me up the wall  
Pity when I have so much passion  
Romance is out of fashion  
Can't handle modern love at all  
  
So I worship Diana by the light of the moon  
When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune  
In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa  
She gives me the wink, then she shows me the freezer  
Ooh the pain  
Modern love can be a strain

I woke up and the world outside was dark  
All so quiet before the dawn  
Opened up the door and walked outside  
The ground was cold  
  
I walked until I couldn't walk any more  
To a place I'd never been  
There was something stirring in the air  
In front of me, I could see  
  
More than this  
More than this  
So much more than this  
There is something else there  
When all that you had has all gone  
And more than this  
I stand  
Feeling so connected  
And I'm all there  
Right next to you  
  
It started when I saw the ship go down  
I saw them struggle in the sea  
And suddenly the picture disappears  
In front of me  
  
Now we're busy making all our busy plans  
On foundations build to last  
But nothing fades as fast as the future  
And nothing clings like the past, until we can see  
  
More than this  
More than this  
So much more than this  
There is something out there  
More than this  
It's coming through  
And more than this  
I stand alone and so connected  
And I'm all there  
Right next to you  
  
Oh then it's alright  
When with every day another bit falls away  
Oh but its still alright, alright, alright  
And like words together we can make some sense  
  
Much more than this  
Way beyond imagination  
Much more than this  
Beyond the stars  
With my head so full  
So full of fractured pictures  
And I'm all there  
Right next to you  
  
More than this  
More than this  
More than this  
More than this

Walking the street with her naked feet  
So full of rhythm but I can't find the beat  
Snapping her heels clicking her toes  
Everybody knows just where she goes  
  
Fear, fear, she's the mother of violence  
Making me tense to watch the way she breed  
Fear, she's the mother of violence  
You know self-defense is all you need  
It's getting hard to breathe  
It's getting so hard to believe  
To believe in anything at all  
  
Mouth all dry eyes blood shot  
Data stored in microdot  
Kicking the cloud with my moccasin shoes  
T.V. dinner, T.V. news  
  
Fear, fear, she's the mother of violence  
Don't make any sense to watch the way she breed  
Fear, she's the mother of violence  
Making me tense to watch the way she feed  
The only way you know she's there  
Is the subtle flavor in the air  
Getting hard to breathe  
Hard to believe in anything at all, but fear

Zeig mir die frau, oh  
Gott, wie sie tanzt  
Zeig mir die frau  
Koerper voll in trance  
Wie sie tanzt!  
  
Sie tanzt auf den tischen  
Fegt bestecke weg  
Greift sich den staerksten  
Nimmt auch den buckel mit  
Glitzert abends auf der pier  
Erloest den jungen  
Dann das tier  
Und das tier  
  
Brennen, brennen  
Will brennen: zuend mich an!  
  
Zeig mir die frau, oh  
Gott, wie sie tanzt  
Zeig mir die frau  
Koerper voll in trance  
Wie sie tanzt!  
  
Du hast mich verzaubert  
Will in deine seele sehn  
Die eine will kommen  
Die and're seele will schnell gehn  
Frag mich, wer ihr schweigen bricht -  
Kannst du ihre sprache nicht  
Verstehn?  
Verstehn?  
  
Unten am meer  
Liegt ein koerper I'm sand  
Die frau sitzt da  
Seinen kopf in der hand  
Die haut vibriert, ihr atem macht wund  
Sie blaest heiss  
Sie blaest stark in den toten mund  
  
Brennen, brennen  
Will brennen: zuend mich an

I dream of birds, birds without wings  
Children who grew up to be dangerous things  
I was known as the postman, I worked through the night  
I made my deliveries sink out of sight  
  
We would wrap them, wrap them up  
Anything to shut them up  
Had to stitch them, stitch them up  
See how they fly  
See how they fly  
  
We'd hold them in the center 'till we were all done  
We'd turn up the music and have some fun  
You're on your way out, that's what they were told  
And we'd mock them and drug them, 'till our stupor took it's hold  
  
We would wrap them, wrap them up  
Anything to shut them up  
Had to stitch them, stitch them up  
See how they fly  
See how they fly  
  
Fly out low, some way offshore  
The sacking covers up their heads  
Don't want to look into their eyes  
As I push them through the open door

It's only water  
In a stranger's tear  
Looks are deceptive  
But distinctions are clear  
A foreign body  
And a foreign mind  
Never welcome  
In the land of the blind  
You may look like we do  
Talk like we do  
But you know how it is  
  
You're not one of us  
Not one of us  
No you're not one of us  
Not one of us  
Not one of us  
No you're not one of us  
  
There's safety in numbers  
When you learn to divide  
How can we be in  
If there is no outside  
All shades of opinion  
Feed an open mind  
But your values are twisted  
Let us help you unwind  
You may look like we do  
Talk like we do  
But you know how it is  
  
You're not one of us  
Not one of us  
No you're not one of us  
You're not one of us  
Not one of us  
No you're not one of us  
  
Not one of us  
You're not one of us  
Not one of us  
You're not one of us  
Not one of us  
You're not one of us

Only Us  
  
It wasn't in the words that kept sticking in their throats  
It wasn't with the angels in their quilted coats  
These battered wings still kick up dust  
Seduced by the noise and the bright things that glisten  
I knew all the time I should shut up and listen  
And I'm finding my way home from the great escape  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The further on I go, oh the less I know  
I can find only us breathing  
Only us sleeping  
Only us dreaming  
Only us  
  
I hear you calling me  
Yes I hear you calling me  
Home from the great escape  
Yes I can read you loud and clear  
  
The further on I go, oh the less I know  
Friend or foe, there's only us  
  
I'm coming home again, home again  
And I hear you calling me home again  
I am coming home again  
  
Only us

Had enough of this  
Out Out Out Out  
I seen a crazy dog, crazy dog  
In the flowers in the wood, crazy dog  
I've seen a crazy dog, crazy dog  
Crash through flowers in the big wood  
Do not know why it is that everywhere I go  
I'm seeing tall trees, tall trees  
They cover me  
All around me  
As they're standing up all around me  
With their big leaves, small leaves  
They cover me  
I've had enough  
I want out out, out out  
  
Gotta do something, can't do nothing  
Cause I know these people, they don't know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out, I want out, out out  
I want out, I want out, out out  
  
When I'm home I look around me in a room  
I see the white walls, stone walls, so solid  
And in the lonely night, watch the disappearing light  
On white walls, stone walls, swear they're moving in  
  
Gotta do something, can't do nothing  
Cause I know these people, they don't know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms, again  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out, I want out, out out  
I want out, I want out, out out  
Out out out Hey Hey Hey out out  
Out out out Ho Ho Ho Ho...  
  
Come out of the night  
I want out, I want out  
Come out of the shadow  
Out of fear, out of fear and pain  
Into the warming sun  
Into the warming sun  
I will be with you again, will be with you  
Out of the shadow, out of fear and pain  
I will be, I will be, I will be, I will be  
I will be with you again  
Out Out, out, out  
Drain away the blood, out of darkness  
Out of shadow, out of the night  
Out of all the pain I'm going  
Ho Ho Ho Ho, out out...  
Out Out out out out Hey Hey...

I need perspective 'cause I'm facing the wall  
I need perspective 'cause I'm not that tall  
I need perspective heard the trumpet call  
Don't trust my eyes want to know where things fall  
  
I need perspective party time for the newly wed  
I need perspective colors ran as the images bled  
I need perspective like confetti on the flower bed  
Don't trust my eyes priest crying he's got fire in his head  
  
Oh Gaia, if that's your name  
Treat you like dirt, but I don't want to blame  
Oh Gaia, the wind heats the fire and blows the ash away  
  
I need perspective sitting in a long long hall  
I need perspective staring at the white white wall  
I need perspective waiting for the phone to call  
Don't trust my eyes there's one thing I've got to tell you all  
  
I need perspective to see through red red skies  
I need perspective to carry merchandise  
I need perspective I don't trust my eyes  
Don't trust my eyes and I don't like surprise  
  
Oh Gaia, etc  
  
I used to be industrial giant  
sitting in a garden full of chemical plant  
trying very hard to get you off my mind  
acting like any man  
taking you for everything I can  
just the same, the same as all my kind  
So blind  
  
I need perspective

Sometimes I think that I know  
What love's all about  
And when I see the light  
I know I'll be all right.  
  
I've got my friends in the world,  
I had my friends  
When we were boys and girls  
And the secrets came unfurled.  
  
City of brotherly love  
Place I call home  
Don't turn your back on me  
I don't want to be alone  
Love lasts forever.  
  
Someone is talking to me,  
Calling my name  
Tell me I'm not to blame  
I won't be ashamed of love.  
  
Philadelphia,  
City of brotherly love.  
Brotherly love.  
  
Sometimes I think that I know  
What love's all about  
And when I see the light  
I know I'll be all right.  
Philadelphia

Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream  
I cannot make a single sound as you scream  
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch  
We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town  
They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down  
There is no blood around, see no sign of pain  
Hay ay ay no pain  
Seeing no red at all, see no rain  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
Red rain  
Ohhhh  
Putting the pressure on much harder now  
To return again and again  
Just let the red rain splash you  
Let the rain fall on your skin  
I come to you defenses down  
With the trust of a child  
  
Red rain is coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
Pouring down all over me  
  
And I can't watch any more  
No more denial  
It's so hard to lay down in all of this  
  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain  
Red rain is pouring down  
I'm bathing in  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain is falling down  
Red rain is coming down all over me  
I'm begging you  
  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
Red rain coming down  
  
Over me in the red red sea  
Over me  
Over me  
Red rain

Thick cloud, steam rising, hissing stone on sweat lodge fire  
Around me, buffalo robe, sage in bundle, rub on skin  
Outside, cold air, stand, wait for rising sun  
Red paint, eagle feathers, coyote calling, it has begun  
Something moving in, I taste it in my mouth and in my heart  
It feels like dying, slow, letting go of life  
  
Medicine man lead me up though town, Indian ground, so far down  
Cut up land, each house, a pool, kids wearing water wings, drink in cool  
Follow dry river bed, watch Scout and Guides make pow-wow signs  
Past Geronimo's disco, Sit 'n' Bull steakhouse, white men dream  
A rattle in the old man's sack, look at mountain top, keep climbing up  
Way above us the desert snow, white wind blow  
  
I hold the line, the line of strength that pulls me through the fear  
San Jacinto, I hold the line  
San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line  
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker  
I hold the line, I hold the line  
San Jacinto, yellow eagle flies down from the sun, from the sun  
  
We will walk, on the land  
We will breathe, of the air  
We will drink, from the stream  
We will live, hold the line  
Hold the line  
Hold the line

Fasse mich wenn ich brenn  
Fasse mich wenn ich renn  
Schuettel die baeume I'm regenwald  
Von oben faellt ein tier  
Fasse mich jetzt und hier  
Offen - offen - uh - uh  
Ja, due weisst: das schockt den affen  
  
Fuchs den fuchs  
Deck den dachs

Keiner merkt's  
Lass die haeute heute springen  
Schluss jetzt! schluss!  
Fasse mich - fasse mich  
Offen - offen - uh - uh  
Ja, du weisst: das schockt den affen

Schock! - das tut dem affen weh  
  
Fasse mich wenn ich schlaf  
Fasse mich wenn ich wach  
Wirfst deine perlen vor die sau  
Treibst den affen in den bau  
Fasse mich jetzt und hier  
Offen - offen - uh - uh  
Ja, due weisst: das schockt den affen  
  
Viel zuviel in frage  
Unsicher alle tage  
Und jetzt auch noch dies:  
  
Schock! - das tut dem affen weh  
Schock! - das tut dem affen weh  
  
Schock den affen I'm schlaf

I stood in this sun sheltered place  
'Til I could see the face behind the face  
All that had gone before had left no trace  
  
Down by the railway siding  
In our secret world, we were colliding  
All the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
So I watch you wash your hair  
Underwater, unaware  
And the plane flies through the air  
Did you think you didn't have to choose it  
That I alone could win or lose it  
In all the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
In this house of make believe  
Divided in two, like Adam and Eve  
You put out and I receive  
  
[Chorus]  
Down by the railway siding  
In our secret world, we were colliding  
In all the places we were hiding love  
What was it we were thinking of?  
  
Oh the wheel is turning spinning round and round  
And the house is crumbling but the stairways stand  
  
With no guilt and no shame, no sorrow or blame  
Whatever it is, we are all the same  
  
Making it up in our secret world [x3]  
Shaking it up  
Breaking it up  
Making it up in our secret world  
  
Seeing things that were not there  
On a wing on a prayer  
In this state of disrepair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shh, listen

Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
  
Waiting your time, dreaming of a better life  
Waiting your time, you're more than just a wife  
You don't want to do what your mother has done  
She has done  
This is your life, this new life has begun  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave  
Turning the tide, you know you are nobody's slave  
[ 1989 version - Find your Brothers and sisters ]  
[ 1990 version - Find your sisters and brothers ]  
Who can hear all the truth in what you say  
They can support you when you're on your way  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
  
[ extra lyrics from 1989 12" remix ]  
  
There's nothing to gain when there's nothing to be lost  
There's nothing to gain if you stay behind and count the cost  
Make the decision that you can be who you can be  
You can be  
Tasting the fruit come to the Liberty Tree  
It's your day - a woman's day  
It's your day - a woman's day  
  
[ end of extra lyrics from 12" remix ]  
  
Changing your ways, changing those surrounding you  
Changing your ways, more than any man can do  
Open your heart, show him the anger and pain, so you heal  
Maybe he's looking for his womanly side, let him feel  
  
You had to be so strong  
And you do nothing wrong  
Nothing wrong at all  
We're gonna to break it down  
We have to shake it down  
Shake it all around  
  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree  
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree

Shock the monkey to life  
Shock the monkey to life  
  
Cover me when I run  
Cover me through the fire  
Something knocked me out' the trees  
Now I'm on my knees  
Cover me, darling please  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know when you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Fox the fox  
Rat the rat  
You can ape the ape  
I know about that  
There is one thing you must be sure of  
I can't take any more  
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Wheels keep turning  
Something's burning  
Don't like it but I guess I'm learning  
  
Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey  
  
Cover me, when I sleep  
Cover me, when I breathe  
You throw your pearls before the swine  
Make the monkey blind  
Cover me, darling please  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Too much at stake  
Ground beneath me shake  
And the news is breaking  
  
Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey  
  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey to life

You know the way that things go  
When what you fight for starts to fall  
And in that fuzzy picture  
The writing stands out on the wall  
So clearly on the wall  
  
Send out the signals deep and loud  
  
And in this place, can you reassure me  
With a touch, a smile - while the cradle's burning  
All the while the world is turning to noise  
Oh the more that it's surrounding us  
The more that it destroys  
Turn up the signal  
Wipe out the noise  
  
Send out the signal deep and loud  
  
Man I'm losing sound and sight  
Of all those who can tell me wrong from right  
When all things beautiful and bright  
Sink in the night  
Yet there's still something in my heart  
That can find a way  
To make a start  
To turn up the signal  
Wipe out the noise  
  
Wipe out the noise  
Wipe out the noise  
You know that's it  
You know that's it  
You know that's it  
Receive and transmit  
Receive and transmit  
Receive and transmit  
You know that's it  
You know that's it  
Receive and transmit  
You know that's it  
You know that's it  
Receive and transmit

Lost my time lost my place in  
Sky blue  
Those two blue eyes light your face in  
Sky blue  
I know how to fly, I know how to drown in  
Sky blue  
  
Warm wind blowing over the earth  
Sky blue  
I sing through the land, the land sings through me  
Sky blue  
Reaching into the deepest shade of  
Sky blue  
  
Sky blue  
So tired of all this traveling  
So many miles away from home  
I keep moving to be stable  
Free to wander, free to roam  
  
Train pulled out said my goodbyes  
Sky blue  
Back on the road alone with the sky  
Sky blue  
There's a presence here no one denies  
Sky blue  
  
Sky blue  
So tired of all this traveling  
So many miles away from home  
I keep moving to be stable  
Free to wander, free to roam  
  
I can hear the same voice calling  
Crying out, from my heart  
And that cry, what a cry  
What a cry, it's going to be  
If I can stop to let it out, oh.

You could have a steam train  
If you'd just lay down your tracks  
You could have an aeroplane flying  
If you bring your blue sky back  
  
All you do is call me  
I'll be anything you need  
  
You could have a big dipper  
Going up and down, all around the bends  
You could have a bumper car, bumping  
This amusement never ends  
  
I want to be your sledgehammer  
Why don't you call my name  
Oh let me be your sledgehammer  
This will be my testimony  
  
Show me round your fruit cages  
'Cause I will be your honey bee  
Open up your fruit cages  
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be  
  
I want to be your sledgehammer  
Why don't you call my name  
I'm going to be-the sledgehammer  
This can be my testimony  
I'm your sledgehammer  
Let there be no doubt about it  
  
Sledge sledge sledgehammer  
  
I kicked the habit (I kicked the habit)  
She'd my skin (Shed my skin)  
This is the new stuff (This is the new stuff)  
I go dancing in, (We could go dancing in)  
Oh won't you show for me (Show for me)  
I will show for you (Show for you)  
Show for me (Show for me), I will show for you  
  
Yea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you  
Only you, you've been coming through  
Going to build that power  
Build, build up that power, hey  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
Going to feel that power, build in you  
  
Come on, come on, help me do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
I've been feeding the rhythm  
It's what we're doing, doing  
All day and night, come on and help me do, come on and help me do

Climbing up on Solsbury Hill  
I could see the city light  
Wind was blowing, time stood still  
Eagle flew out of the night  
He was something to observe  
Came in close, I heard a voice  
Standing, stretching every nerve  
I had to listen had no choice  
I did not believe the information  
I just had to trust imagination  
My heart going boom, boom, boom  
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home  
  
To keep in silence I resigned  
My friends would think I was a nut  
Turning water into wine  
Open doors would soon be shut  
So I went from day to day  
Though my life was in a rut  
Till I thought of what I'd say  
And which connection I should cut  
I was feeling part of the scenery  
I walked right out of the machinery  
My heart going boom, boom, boom  
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home  
  
When illusion spin her net  
I'm never where I want to be  
And liberty she pirouette  
When I think that I am free  
Watched by empty silhouettes  
Close their eyes but still can see  
No one taught them etiquette  
So I will show another me  
Today I don't need a replacement  
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant  
My heart going boom, boom, boom  
Hey, I said, you can keep my things they've come to take me home  
  
Come back home  
Come back home  
Come back home

Stand back!  
Stand back!  
  
What are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet  
They're on to something, picking up  
Picking up this heat, this heat  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as anything you've seen  
Get a life with this dreamer's dream  
  
You know your culture from your trash  
You know your plastic from your cash  
When I lose sight of the track  
You know the way back  
But I know you  
  
You know your stripper from your paint  
You know your sinner from your saint  
Whenever heaven's doors are shut  
You kick them open but  
I know you  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Give me steam  
And how you feel to make it real  
Real as any place you've been  
Get a life with the dreamer's dream  
  
Stand back!  
Stand back!  
Can't you see I've lost control I'm getting indiscreet  
You're moving in so close 'til I'm picking up  
Picking up this heat, this heat  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
You know your green from your red  
You know the quick from the dead  
So much better than the rest  
You think you've been blessed  
But I know you  
  
You know your ladder from your snake  
You know the throttle from the brake  
You know your straight line from a curve  
You've got a lot of nerve  
But I know you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
Everybody nosedive  
Hold your breath, count to five  
Back-slap, booby-trap,  
Cover it up in bubble wrap  
Room shake, earthquake  
Find a way to stay awake  
It's going to blow, it's going to break  
This is more than I can take  
  
Oh yeah, I need steam  
Feel the steam all around me  
Ah you're turning up the heat  
When I start to dream aloud  
See you move your hands and feet  
Won't you step into this cloud of steam  
This steam  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
Help me yeah  
Ready to steam out the log jam  
Stir crazy from the freezer to the boil  
Water's bubbling, it's b-b-b-bubbling  
Bubbling [Repeat x 4]  
Like it's coming to a boil  
Give me steam, lady  
Give me steam around me now  
Ahh, coming alive [Repeat x 2]  
Said give me some steam

Rows of houses all bearing down on me  
I can feel their blue hands touching me  
All these things in all positions  
All these things will one day take control  
And fade out again and fade out  
  
This machine will will not communicate these thoughts  
And the strain I am under  
Be a world child form a circle before we all go under  
And fade out again and fade out again  
  
Cracked eggs dead birds  
Scream as they fight for life  
I can feel death can see it's beady eyes  
All these things into fruition  
All these things we'll one day swallow whole  
And fade out again and fade out again.

I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I'm listening to the conversation:  
Judge and jury in my head  
It's coloring everything  
All we did and said  
And still I head that sharp tongue talking  
Talking tangled words  
I can sense the danger  
Just listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I'm hearing right and wrong so clearly  
There must be more than this  
It's only in uncertainty  
That we're naked and alive  
I hear it through the rattle of a streetcar  
Hear it through the things you said  
I can get so scared  
Listen to the wind  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
Hear that voice again  
  
What I carry in my heart  
Brings us so close or so far apart  
Only love can make love  
  
I want you close I want you near  
I can't help but listen  
But I don't want to hear  
I hear that voice again  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be clear  
But each time I try  
It's the voice I hear  
I hear that voice again

The book of love is long and boring  
No one can lift the damn thing  
It's full of charts and facts and figures  
And instructions for dancing  
  
But I  
I love it when you read to me  
And you  
You can read me anything  
The book of love has music in it  
In fact that's where music comes from  
Some of it is just transcendental  
Some of it is just really dumb  
  
But I  
I love it when you sing to me  
And you  
You can sing me anything  
The book of love is long and boring  
And written very long ago  
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes  
And things we're all too young to know  
  
But I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
And I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
And I  
I love it when you give me things  
And you  
You ought to give me wedding rings  
You ought to give me wedding rings

It was a slow day,  
And the sun was beating  
On the soldiers by the side of the road,  
There was a bright light,  
A shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage  
Was wired to the radio,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder,  
This is the long distance call,  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all,  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It was a dry wind,  
And it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth,  
And the dead sand,  
Falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers  
And the automatic earth,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder,  
This is the long distance call,  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all o-yeah,  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It's a turn-around jump shot  
It's everybody jump start  
It's, every generation throws a hero up the pop charts,  
Medicine is magical and magical is art think of  
The Boy in the Bubble  
And the baby with the baboon heart  
  
And I believe  
These are the days of lasers in the jungle,  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere,  
Staccato signals of constant information,  
A loose affiliation of millionaires  
And billionaires and baby,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder,  
This is the long distance call,  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all o-yeah,  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky,  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby don't cry  
Don't cry don't cry  
  
Om

Suffocated by mirrors, stained by dreams  
Her honey belly pulls the seams  
Curves are still upon the hinge  
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin  
  
Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night  
The sponge is full, well out of sight  
All around the conversations  
Icing on the warm flesh cake  
  
Light creeps through her secret tunnels  
Sucked into the open spaces  
Burning out in sudden flashes  
Draining blood from well-fed faces  
  
Desires form in subtle whispers  
Flex the muscles in denial  
Up and down its pristine cage  
So the music, so the trial  
  
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens  
Dance in circles, they the blessed  
Man and wife, undressed by all  
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed  
  
Even as the soft skins tingle  
They mingle with the homeless mother  
Who loves the day but lives another  
That once was hers  
  
The worried father, long lost lover  
Brushes ashes with his broom  
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover  
Bursting over the bride and groom  
  
And the talk goes on  
  
Memories crash on tireless waves  
The lifeguards whom the winter saves  
  
Silence falls the guillotine  
All the doors are shut  
Nervous hands grip tight the knife  
In the darkness, till the cake is cut  
  
Passed around, in little pieces  
The body and the flesh  
The family and the fishing-net  
And another in the mesh  
  
The body and the flesh

Looking out the window  
I see the red dust clear  
High up on the red rock  
Stands the shadow with the spear  
  
The land here is strong  
Strong beneath my feet  
It feeds on the blood  
It feeds on the heat  
  
The rhythm is below me  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm is around me  
The rhythm has control  
The rhythm is inside me  
The rhythm has my soul  
  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm of the heat  
The rhythm of the heat  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Drawn across the plainland  
To the place that is higher  
Drawn into the circle  
That dances round the fire  
We spit into out hands  
And breathe across the palms  
Raising them up high  
Held open to the sun  
  
Self-conscious, uncertain  
I'm showered with the dust  
The spirit enters into me  
And I submit to trust  
  
Smash the radio  
No outside voices here  
Smash the watch  
Cannot tear the day to shreds  
Smash the camera  
Cannot steal away spirits  
The rhythm is around me  
The rhythm has control  
The rhythm is inside me  
The rhythm has my soul

In the big house  
Where the sun lives  
With the walls so white and blue  
In the red soil  
All the green grows  
And the winds blow across your face  
They blow across your heart  
  
It's the time of the turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
All the earth breaks  
Like a stale bread  
And the seeds are folded in the soil  
Oh the sun pours  
Then the rains fall  
While the roots reach out right through the ground  
They reach out through the ground  
  
It's the time of turning and there's something stirring outside  
It's the time of turning and the old world's falling  
Nothing you can do can stop the next emerging  
Time of the turning and we'd better learn to say our goodbyes  
  
If we can stand up  
When all else falls down  
We'll last through the winter  
We'll last through the storms  
We'll last through the north winds  
That bring down the ice and snow  
We'll last through the long nights  
Till the green field's growing again  
Growing again

There's a bump in the basement  
There's a knocking on the wall  
In the pumping of the pistons  
I swear I heard your call  
There's a bump in the basement  
There's a hole in the floor  
There's a guard in the garden  
Locking up the door  
  
There's a rumble in the floorboards  
No shutting out the sound  
And the workers are below me  
Digging underground  
Feel the building all around me  
Like a wrap of armoured skin  
But the more we are protected  
The more we're trapped within  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till there's no misunderstanding  
When You strip it right back  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Tell it like it is  
Till there's no misunderstanding  
Make up what you like  
Man feed machine  
Machine feed man  
  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
Brick by brick  
We're building

Und durch den draht hoer ich dich  
Und durch den draht wird er hart  
Und durch den draht seh ich dich  
Nur durch den draht  
  
Freitag nacht in deinem bett aus chrom ich will dich  
Ich klick und tick wie'n metronom ich will dich  
Ich schleich um's wasserloch wie ein wildes tier ich will dich  
Ueberdruck - warum bist du nicht da ich will dich  
  
Und durch den draht bist du allein?  
Und durch den draht nimm dich in acht!  
Und durch den draht hoer ich dich schrei'n  
Nur durch den draht  
  
Uhrmacher mit der feinen hand ich will dich  
Grillt blutige steaks auf rotem strand ich will dich  
Fuehlst du's kommen schlangengleich ich will dich  
Ich bin in dir glaesern und weich ich will dich  
  
Und durch den draht hoer ich dich  
Und durch den draht wird er hart  
Und durch den draht seh ich dich  
Nur durch den draht  
  
Kreisel um die riesenstadt  
Die keine zukunft hat  
Lies das bild, mal' das wort  
Wirf bedeutung einfach fort  
Jeder schritt ist hart  
Vorsicht, draht  
  
Und durch den draht bist du allein?  
Und durch den draht wir saugen uns fest  
Und durch den draht du musst durch den test  
Und durch den draht wir suchen - o r d n u n g  
  
Und durch den draht jenseits der grenze beginnt die fremde  
Jenseits der grenze beginnt die fremde

Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
No trace of indecision  
Lion keep his vision clear  
Moving out  
Across the water  
The wet leaves quiver in the heat  
Darkness heavy on my shoulder  
Smell the smoke, sickly sweet  
The body's weak, the shadow's strong  
Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
Lion show no sign of fear  
Walk through the fire  
Through the dust and ashes  
While the building crashes  
Walk through the flame  
No time for doubt or caution  
Taken by the strong emotion  
Walk through the fire  
No trace of indecision  
Lion hold his vision clear  
Walk through the fire  
Walking in the path of angel  
Walk on down below, walk on down below  
Walk on down below, walk on down alone  

Six by six, from wall to wall  
Shutters on the windows, no light at all  
Damp on the floor you got damp in the bed  
They're trying to get you crazy get you out of your head  
They feed you scraps and they feed you lies  
To lower your defenses, no compromise  
There's nothing you can do, the day can be long  
You mind is working overtime, your body's not too strong  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on,  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
They put you in a box so you can't get heard  
Let your spirit stay unbroken, may you not be deterred  
Hold on, you have gambled with your own life  
You faced the night alone  
While the builders of the cages  
Sleep with bullets, bars and stone  
They do not see the road to freedom  
That you build with flesh and bone  
  
They take you out the light burns your eyes  
To the talking room it's not surprise  
Loaded questions from clean white coats  
Their eyes are all as hidden as their Hippocratic Oath  
They tell you how to behave, behave as their guest  
You want to resist them, you do your best  
They take you to your limits, they take you beyond  
For all that they are doing there's no way to respond  
  
Hold on, hold on  
They put you in a box so you can't get heard  
Let your spirit stay unbroken, may you not be deterred  
Hold on, you have gambled with your own life  
You face the night alone  
While the builders of the cages  
Sleep with bullets, bars and stone  
They do not see the road to freedom  
That you build with flesh and bone  
  
Though you may disappear, you're not forgotten here  
And I will say to you, I will do what I can do  
  
You may disappear, you're not forgotten here  
And I will say you you, I will do what I can do  
And I will do what I can do  
I will do what I can do

Mamma's little boy has fallen down,  
Mamma's little boy has hit the ground.  
Now he's gone, Ian is gone,  
His time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can take you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
So well, pretend it's all well conceived,  
Build solid as steel, stuff we believe.  
Now he's gone. Ion is gone,  
His time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down.  
Mamma's little boy, doing good.  
Mamma's little boy did all he could.  
Now he's gone, Ion is gone, time is done.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
The weight of a dream  
Can bring you down.  
White, white ashes, building crashes down  
White, white ashes, building crashes down  
  

Ten coaches roll into the dust  
Chrome windows turned to rust  
'Hand on inside they know they must  
Hanging on the green backed words "In God we trust"  
  
No one knew if the spirit died  
All wrapped to go like Kentucky Fried  
Trying to read the flight of birds  
Low on fuel, getting low on words  
  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
She comes out like a white shadow  
  
Each one drawn to empty spaces  
Outsiders, borderline cases  
It's hard to tell black from white  
When you wake up in the middle of the night  
  
Weighed down by the absence of sound  
Broken now by the cry of a hound  
Looking for movement within the haze  
Light can be deceptive with her rays  
  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
And she comes out like a white shadow  
She comes out like a white shadow
