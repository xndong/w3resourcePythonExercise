Hey, hey, honey, what's on your mind  
Well, you said that sleepin' with a poor band's not your style  
Ain't that just a little unkind  
Hey, Marlon Brando, what would you do in a spot like this  
I don't play as your pawn tonight  
  
Doin' the New York Hustle with a hundred dollar miss  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
There's music, and I can always hear it playin'  
New York Nights and there's music in the streets  
  
A doin' the Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin' that old familiar tune  
And now yakety yak and don't talk back  
When a guy lay me down with my Pontiac  
Tell those high school queens of mine that the  
Prom was for your monkey shine  
  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh, so pretty  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls make you feel so fine  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
New York girls are oh, so pretty  
Try 'n' a catch a cab in New York City  
Music in the streets  
  
Another night, another town  
I'm out on the road and ther's no one around  
And it's rainin', yeah, it's rainin'  
Silence is all around  
It's cold and lonely, oh darlin', if only I could feel it  
Oh, can you feel it  
  
Eighth Avenue Shuffle on a Friday afternoon  
With the hum of a thousand engines  
Singin' that old familiar tune  
Hey, Marlon Brando, do you agree it feels so fine  
Doin' the New York Hustle  
These girls are doin' the monkey shine  
  
Summer night in the city  
New York girls they always make you feel so fine  
There's music, and I can always hear it playin'  
New York Nights and there's music in the streets

Since you're the delegate from Kansas  
Will you kindly take the floor?  
Now tell us, what is Kansas thinkin'?  
What is Kansas for?  
  
Well Kansas is for the farmer  
We stand behind the little man  
We need a fire house in Topeka  
So help us if you can  
  
I see the gentleman from Utah  
Our friendly Beehive State  
How can we help you Utah?  
How can we make you great?  
  
We got to irrigate our deserts  
We got to get some things to grow  
We got to tell this country about Utah  
'Cause nobody seems to know

There was a place in East St. Louis, it was in  
Nineteen fifty nine, when they played they filled  
The streets with music, that lonely blue note music  
That takes your cares away, far away  
They packed the place when the band was playin'  
To get some joy from a smoke filled room, through that door  
You could see the bodies swayin', the blue note band  
Was playin' some lonely blue note song all night long  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay  
If you should ever make it to St. Louis on some hot  
And lonely night, if you listen you can hear  
That blue note music, they fill the streets with music  
It carries you away, far away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay  

Patrick Simmons  
I just looked in the mirror, was that me  
I'm older now than I used to be  
The sky above me, lord, it's turnin' red  
There's a hard rain fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
Oh, lord, fallin' 'round my head  
  
The road I'm standin' on, it twists and turns  
The soles of my feet, lord, they're 'bout to burn  
The reaper beckons, and he points the way  
Oh, lord, I'm gettin' closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day  
Oh, lord, closer every day

Autumn breeze blowin' to the east  
Shift of breeze upon a sea of peace  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Dizzy dancin', golden ladies  
Misty eyes that cannot fool  
Silver shoreline waves come crashin'  
To the end of all of you  
Like a spider weavin' silken nets  
Fingers move, swaying silhouettes  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Spinning, turning, moonlit madness  
'Round the fire burnin' bright  
I can see it risin' higher  
Lightin' up the starry night  
  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring

Well I dreamed I was standin' in the middle of a river,  
Someone waited on the other side.  
My body shivered in the rushing icy water.  
I cried out but no one could hear me.  
I tried to swim but it was much too far.  
I felt a hand pull me up as I was going under.  
Somebody's waiting there to catch you  
You don't have to be afraid now baby.  
Nobody really knows for sure,  
Just open up your heart.  
Don't be afraid, someone will catch you if you fall too far.  
Sometimes you feel like you're invisible  
There's a crowd but you're all alone.  
Can't they see your heart is breaking?  
You pretend that it just doesn't matter,  
Try to keep smilin' baby hope against hope.  
Love is gonna find you and set you free  
Somebody's waiting there to catch you  
You don't have to be afraid now baby.  
Nobody really knows for sure,  
Just open up your heart.  
Don't be afraid, someone will catch you if you fall too far.  
Too far.

Everybody tells me but I don't believe it babe

Day after day I'm more confused  
When I look for the light in the pouring rain  
I know that's a game that I hate to lose  
And I'm feeling the strength  
Ain't it a shame  
[Chorus:]  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so un-kind  
I'm countin' on you  
To carry me through... Oh...  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Yeah!.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
When my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
When I'm feeling blue  
The guitar is coming through to soothe me...  
Thanks for the joy that your giving me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rythem and Rhyme and Harmony  
You've helped me along  
Making me strong.... Oh!...  
(Acapalla)  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Now, now, now, wont ya  
Wont ya take me, oh... Take me

I hear your voice everywhere  
It's echoes of love  
Making me look back over my shoulder  
Echoes of love are started all over  
Echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
I'm out of control  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love are out of control  
Bringing back love I used to hold  
  
Darlin', since you went away  
Think about you every day  
So many memories  
Got to get the best of me  
  
Recalling the times  
I used to hold you  
I just wouldn't do  
What I was supposed to  
I've done things  
I'd like to undo  
Now darlin' it's you  
I'd like to run to  
  
Echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
I'm out of control  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love are out of control  
Bringing back love I used to hold  
  
Echoes of love  
Echoes of love  
Love, echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
Echoes of love, echoes of love  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love

Well, the light's turnin' gray, nearly every day  
Come a walkin' into town and try to find the way  
Well, I've only got a nickel, got to score myself a dime  
And try to make it 'til tomorrow, buy a little more time  
  
Evil woman

Week by week, day by day  
You got me changin' in so many ways  
Thinking of you i feel the call  
Somebody get a doctor  
I'm starting to fall  
  
I get excited don't you understand  
I get excited 'cause it's part of the plan  
  
Day by day, hour by hour  
I get a shiver from your lovin' power  
Fire in your eyes just lets me know  
Ain't no way i ever let go  
  
I get excited don't you understand  
I get excited 'cause it's part of the plan  
  
Hot love, what you bring to me  
I get excited by the novelty  
Hot love, like a fever you feed  
Black lace and promise is all that i need  
You bring it on  
  
I love it baby, i love it all  
Anytime, anytime you call  
Day or night as the world moves on  
It's time for action, the talkin' is done

Eyes of silver hungry and aware  
Eyes of silver, your mystic love I share  
'Cause I'm hungry baby  
For the love you give away  
Kick out all that stupid pride  
That's standin' in my way  
Inside my loving eyes are open wide  
Eyes of silver, on which I shall rely  
Diamonds are forever, and gold can make you lie  
But your eyes of silver shine on, shine on  
Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all  
Rubies by the hundreds fill the Taj Mahal  
Eyes of silver, you tell me what I need  
To bring this cold and lonely man  
Down to his bended knees  
Inside my lovin' arms are open wide  
For you eyes of silver  
On which I shall rely  
Diamonds and gold make you lie, lie, lie  
But your eyes of silver, they shine on, shine on  
Eyes of silver, baby, shine on, shine on  
Baby, shining, yeah yeah, yeah, baby shining

Well, the sun is shinin? a new day is here  
All the people smilin? and the sky is clear  
Not an hour wasted will I share with you  
Got to keep lovin?, mama no matter what I do  
Ooh, ooh, ooh I got to tell you  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Jesus, hear me when I sing out loud  
The echoes of my gladness fall upon the crowd  
I don't care for sadness and I don't need fear  
Hope they finally realize that the feelin? is near  
Ooh, ooh, ooh I got to tell you  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, baby, feelin? farther down  
Feelin? down farther, feelin? farther down

Tiran porter  
Well, I thought you'd be back on the track  
But I guess I was wrong, man  
For the look in your eyes was the same  
Empty high that you'd shown  
As I ran down the road I'd forgotten this load was upon you  
So the band packed it's bags and played on, goodbye  
It's been years since I cried  
But this feeling inside really hurt me  
And you know that we're loyal  
Through the years of hard toil we stood by  
But our licks' gotten better  
I thought you could weather the good times  
So I guess that it's hard to leave  
Bad times and downers behind  
So it came down to sayin'  
You haven't been playin' for so long  
That our heads caked with rust  
And the dust of a million sad sighs  
In the mornings I've tried  
To reach down inside  
And push that nightmare away  
Now I'm glad that it's over, it's over  
Now I can play  

Oh, I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
They've got to find their way from here  
Oh, show us the way  
  
If they only knew  
Oh, show us the light  
Show them what light?  
  
It shines from within  
You make your own day  
You make your own night  
And sometimes you win  
  
Oh, show us the way  
But you always get through  
Oh, show us the light  
  
Oh, why do they come and ask for more?  
They've got stars they don't have wishes for  
They're just givin' up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive?  
  
I'm wonderin' why, I'm wonderin' how  
They're gonna bail themselves out now  
Oh, give us this day  
I'm shakin' my head  
Oh, keep us through night  
  
Oh, I hand them this life  
To do what they will  
They've got to find their way from here  
Oh, show us the way  
If they only knew  
Oh, show us the light  
  
Oh, why do they come and ask for more?  
They've got stars they don't have wishes for  
They're just givin' up their blame to me  
How do the fools survive?  
  
It's not like it was before  
When they call I won't come running  
It was so long ago  
I left them on their own  
Oh, how do the fools survive?

Tom johnston  
Mama been workin', so hard  
Keep on workin' mama but you don't get far  
But baby I know, baby you're blind  
And I'll keep a-risin' mama, just to show you're mine  
And I keep workin' on you  
Well I been watchin' you grow  
And baby you got what it takes to let me know  
Sure as the devil, rise in the blind  
It's gonna be nasty and it's gonna be mine  
I been workin' on you  
Keep on movin' pretty baby, I feel you in my heart  
Gentle on me movin' honey, honey, but you can't be far but you  
Keep on with me, true to form  
I can't ask for more now but your  
Soul star is born  

The days grow short, the nights are gone  
Since you were here, I can't go on  
I cried for you, to no avail  
Now my life runs cold when the night winds wail  
But I cheat the hangman, cheated him many times before  
The bell that tolls the hour has turned sweet lips to sour  
Yes, I cheat the hangman and even when life has flown away  
I leave a kiss behind  
  
The rain that fell upon my stone  
Like tears you cry I shared alone  
I walk the night, I cannot sleep  
The love you spend you cannot reap  
  
The glow of love will then shine  
Lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home  
Only lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home

Early in the mornin' when the sun come up  
You'll find me sittin' at the table, drinkin' from a wooden cup  
The mortgage is a comin' tryin' to take my home away  
I'm not gonna let it turn my head away  
It won't be right  
No matter what they say  
Won't be right  
Tryin' to take my home away  
Won't be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I don't have to take it  
And I really don't want to see  
  
Early in the evenin' long about supper time  
There's nothin' left here for me but a bottle of wine  
I'm gonna be evicted along about the hour of five  
Well, it's enough to make me wonder why I'm alive  
  
It won't be right  
No matter what they say  
Won't be right  
Tryin' to take my home away  
Won't be right  
If they do this thing to me  
I don't have to take it  
And I really don't want to see

Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Catherine the Great and brave Ulysses  
Playin' checkers out in the sun.  
Jesse James and young William Bonnie  
Have started a religion for everyone.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Well the drums they are loud down in rap town,  
But the Pope has been quiet for days.  
Well some gunmen robbed a bank in California  
And the cops blew them all away.  
If you don't like the picture don't turn it off.  
The only way to change it is to do it yourself.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Peace and love on the wings of a dove  
Has flown away.  
We're payin' the rent  
On the blood that's been spent,  
On a mortgage that's too high to be paid.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain  
Just about a mile from Jericho.  
And my throat is hot and dusty,  
Down to the water I must go.  
  

Patrick simmons  
Just when you think you've seen your darkest night  
Look around  
Over there someone's waiting, right now  
Right now, just to make things right  
Love comes just in time  
Without lovin' the sun don't shine  
Love comes just in time  
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted  
Oh baby, love is all we need  
And when you think that love has let you down  
And every place you go it seems like such a lonely town  
You gotta just run away  
As fast as you can  
Reach out now, baby  
And love will take your hand  
Love comes just in time  
Without lovin' the sun don't shine  
Love comes just in time  
Oh baby, love is all that we wanted  
Oh baby, love is all we need  

The hardest thing I've ever done  
Is say goodbye to you.  
But even though I love you baby,  
I know you can't be true.  
I walked down that country road  
Out to the big highway  
I caught a ride on an eighteen-wheeler  
And I'm takin' it all the way.  
Takin' all these blues to the highway  
Tryin' to get her out of my mind.  
When I'm out on the open road  
With the wind in my face,  
I'll leave my heartache behind.  
Raindrops on my window,  
Teardrops from my eyes,  
I thought our love was sacred  
Now I know that's just a lie.  
So I pack my suitcase  
And head out that old front door.  
Better take a long last look now baby  
'cause I won't be back no more.  
Takin' all these blues to the highway  
Tryin' to get her out of my mind.  
When I'm out on the open road  
With the wind in my face  
I'll leave my heartache behind.  
  

Don't you feel it growing, day by day  
People getting ready for the news  
Some are happy, some are sad  
Woah, gotta let the music play  
  
What the people need is a way to make them smile  
Ain't so hard to do if you know how  
Gotta get a message, get it on through  
Oh now momma don't you ask me why  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Well I Know, You know better, everything I say  
Meet me in the country for a day  
We'll be happy and we'll dance  
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away  
  
And if I'm feeling good to you and you're feeling good to me  
There ain't nothing we can't do or say  
Feeling good, feeling fine  
Oh, baby, let the music play  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time  
  
Like a lazy flowing river  
Surrounding castles in the sky  
And the crowd is growing bigger  
Listening for the happy sounds  
And I got to let them fly  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music  
  
All the time

Patrick simmons  
Underneath us all  
There's a world that we always forget 'til it moves us  
Where the moon on the bay dances all alone  
Ramone, he draw the razor swift, it slice the air  
No more lovely dreams of those summer nights  
Down in santo domingo  
They laugh and play in the sleepy harbor town  
So unaware of the danger that's around  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
Livin' on the fault line  
No one can run when it finally comes down  
Nobody knows what is stirrin' underground  
Caruso stumbled  
While the city tumbled down  
The palace was in splinters  
Theodore was leaving town  

Down around the corner, half a mile from here  
See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear  
Without love, where would you be now  
Without lo-o-o-ove  
  
You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks  
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back  
Without love, where would you be right now  
Without lo-o-o-ove  
  
Well the Illinois Central  
And the Southern Central Freight  
Got to keep on pushin' mama  
You know they're running late  
Without love, where would you be now  
Without lo-o-o-ve  
  
Well the pistons keep on turning  
And the wheels go round and round  
The steel rails are cold and hard  
For the miles that they go down  
  
Without love, where would you be right now  
Without lo-o-o-ve ooh  
Where would you be now  
  
Baby baby baby babe oh won't you move it down  
I gotta keep on moving, gotta keep on moving

There aren't enough words to say  
When all I mean is I no longer love you  
I'd like to leave it lie right there  
For the rest ain't kind  
I'm pickin' up my pride, and I'll be on my way  
If you no longer need me  
I only had a word or two that I care to say  
Listen, baby  
If you should ever find your spirit start to breaking  
When your heart is aching  
Remember me  
I was your fool for really quite a long time  
'Til I found out how it feels to play  
On the losing end  
  
When you finally turn and find  
No one around to catch you when you're falling  
To hear you when you're calling  
Oh, remember me, oh, darlin'  
When you finally turn and find  
  
No one around  
To catch you when you're falling  
To hear you when you're calling  
From down on the losin' end  
Oh, ain't it just the losin' end

Patrick simmons  
Layin' back and sittin' in the sunshine  
Hot wind, I drink me little rum wine  
Straw hat down across my eyes  
Lettin' the world go by  
Music, it start my toes a tappin'  
Drum beat, it set my hands a clappin'  
Rum wine, it get my head a spinnin'  
Turnin' around and 'round  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
Gypsy, she say I got the fever  
I don't know whether to believe her  
But when the wind blow from the sea  
My soul start to fly away  
She give me charm that will protect me  
Necklace with stone from far across the sea  
But island magic much too strong  
It won't let me go this time  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current, please take me  
I hear you callin' me home  
Got to get back to jamaica

Hey, don't you worry, I've been lied to  
I've been here many times before  
Girl, don't you worry, I know where I stand  
I don't need this love, I don't need your hand  
I know I could turn, blink, and you'd be gone  
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
But minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute  
I keep holding on  
  
You would stay just to watch me, darlin'  
Wilt away on lies from you  
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run  
I take it all for granted like you're the only one  
  
Livin' on my own  
Somehow that sounds nice  
You think I'm you fool  
Well, you may just be right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Call my name and I'll be gone  
You'll reach out and I won't be there  
Just my luck you'll realize  
You should spend your life with someone  
You could spend your life with someone  
  
[Chorus]

Tom johnston  
It's late at night  
Can't go to sleep  
Eyes open wide  
Doin' the midnight creep  
Well it's just a holiday  
For a circus dream  
'cause I'm a music man baby  
Hangin' from a wire with no net below  
You know I'm gonna catch you if you fall  
Swirling dancers  
Driftin' in the night  
Make you go crazy  
Forget what is wrong and what is right  
'cause the melody gonna make you high  
Float you away like a cloud in the sky  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it  
When you get back home to your flat in the city  
Notice that your neighbor has the radio on  
Out of nowhere you gonna hear a sound  
Movin' through your head, spinning 'round and 'round  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it  

People outside my window  
Goin' everywhere  
People that are happy  
People without a care  
We all got to be loved  
It's a nat'ral thing don't you know  
The sooner we find what we need  
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show  
  
I'm gonna change my method  
Get me a big ham bone  
Gonna make all the leaders of the country  
Get it together and bring it on home  
  
We all got to be loved  
It's a nat'ral thing don't you know  
The sooner we find what we need  
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show  
  
Those men in the circus  
Those men on the wire  
Their feet hangin' fifty feet up  
Know they're countin' on their daily luck  
To bring them through the fire

Well, a travelin' man's affliction makes it hard to settle down  
But I'm stuck here in the flatlands while my heart is homeward bound  
Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth  
Well it was Neal Cassady that started me to travelin'  
All the stories that were told, I believed them every one  
And it's a windin' road I'm on you understand  
And no time to worry 'bout tomorrow when you're followin' the sun  
  
Papa don't you worry now and mama don't you cry  
Sweet woman don't forsake me, I'll be comin' by and by  
  
Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home  
On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth

Hey Mister, walkin' with the blues  
Hey Mister, payin' heavy dues  
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find  
When you're ridin' double, and you're running out of time  
  
No need to feel, that you lack the spirit  
Within the body, but it's in the soul  
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Hey Mister, tell me how long has it been  
Hey sister, so how could you pretend  
Why keep the sorrow, where it don't belong  
Well come tomorrow, oh help me sing the song  
  
No need to feel, that you lack the spirit  
Within the body, but it's in the soul  
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it  
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back  
Need a little taste of love  
  
Need a little taste of love  

Every time when I think I'm closer  
To what I need most  
Here I am, standing in line  
Will it be worth the waiting?  
Had enough of hard times  
I can't stand no more  
Layin' down a new line  
Now I know for sure  
Every heartbreak made me that much stronger  
Good things take that long  
Had enough of hard times  
There's no stopping us now  
Had enough of hard times  
There's no stopping us now  
I know I was born to love you  
So glad it's you  
Got a new rhyme  
Here's another rhythm got me steppin' in time  
Sittin' with your head on my shoulder  
Right where you belong

Evil ways of practice may surround you  
Callin' on your inner core of life  
But your father was just a complex man of bus'ness  
And your mother merely portioned out your fright  
But run the risk of a sudden loss  
You got no mama to bear your cross beside you  
Uh huh, uh huh  
As midnight angels shine their wings  
And time begins just bo build a wall around you  
  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
  
Settin' out on a voyage down to jenner  
I've given all I've got to help the cause  
Need a place just to settle out my pressures  
A place where you and I can sit and pause  
So I can see the sky at night  
Without a fear of hidden light to blind me  
Mm, mm  
And so you see the path is clear  
And changes will be swayed around me  
  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me  
Nobody, nobody gonna take my love away from me

Michael mcdonald  
So you tell him to say no more  
You don't want to know why or where  
Where he's been all these lonely nights  
You know what's wrong and don't care what's right  
As long as he comes back to you  
Someone to love him all his life  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
It ain't nothing but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
There's always there comes a day  
When love just goes away  
When there's no caring, no words to say  
There's no forgiving, no games to play  
When all you know will get you through  
Seems like you've known it all your life  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  
It ain't nothin' but a heartache  
Darling, you'll get over it  

Brother, you've fallen far behind.  
What is it that's on your mind?  
Sister, oh how do you decide?  
What do you see through your clouded eyes?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Brother, you've fallen to your knees.  
What do your children need?  
The distance is never out of reach,  
There's only inches between you and me.  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today.  
Count up the corners of 'em, add up the dollars for 'em.  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' your way, you know,  
Ten thousand of 'em all over town.  
I wouldn't ask if things weren't like they were today,  
But is it really helpin', whatever I do?  
Hey, mister, well I'm lookin' at you, you know  
Will I feel good about it, will I feel a fool?  
I hate to beg, 'cause I feel like such a fool?  
On every corner I turn to,  
Some variation of "help me please,"  
Can't pretend I don't see you there.  
How should I feel?  
  

Where and why I'm destined to go  
Right here and now that's all I know  
On either side future or past  
Neither is real both fade so fast  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay  
Good times are still there to find  
When times are their worst  
Keep your eyes open wide  
'Cause through it all are moments that shine  
And moments that glow  
I wanna be there for mine  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay  
Even when you're close to a dream  
It can still let you down, still let you down  
You'll always have a chance to give up  
So why do it now  
So one by one given these moments to live  
Just as one by one they're taken away  
So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride  
And one by one the memories stay  

Baby, there's a chance you ought to take  
Chance of a mistake you gotta make  
Maybe I'm mistaken too  
To take my chance with you  
I need you like a shadow needs a light  
I'll follow you like morning follows night  
When nothin's left ahead of you  
I'll be right behind you  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that you're right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer  
I'll be next to you  
  
Baby, it's a secret I can't keep  
Trouble comes and suddenly you're weak  
I don't believe you got the strength  
To fight this kind of love  
I know it's risky now and then,  
What with all the what ifs and the when's  
Who is there to say we're wrong  
To tell us it can't be  
Come on, baby, please don't go  
I'm heart of stone and you know why is it so hard to do  
Tell me that you're right there too, baby  
Baby, can't you see we're runnin' late  
Can't you see we ain't got time to wait  
Might be that you're scared of me  
Of something you might feel  
Hold on to me, baby, hold on tight  
I can take us through the night all right  
Maybe I will stay here too  
Take my chance with you  
  
Shadows disappear at night  
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one  
Why is it so hard to find  
Tell me that you're right there too  
  
One step baby  
Two steps maybe  
One step closer

Girl, as we take a long last look at this love  
Before you go, I've got to know  
I've got to know, was it ever true  
I've got to hear it from you  
Girl, I can take one more hurt in this heart  
Before you go, I've got to know  
I've got to know, was it ever true  
I've got to hear it from you  
  
Not like before  
We were lost in a whirling dance  
Never slowing down  
Long enough to give truth a chance  
To come out  
So that the light could shine in  
  
And open your eyes  
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown  
Open your eyes  
Let's not let what never was bring us down  
  
I've got to know, was it ever true  
I've got to hear it from you  
  
Not like before  
We were lost in a whirling dance  
Never slowing down  
Long enough to give truth a chance  
To come out  
So that the light could shine in  
  
And open your eyes  
If it's not real, there's no reason to frown  
Open your eyes  
Let's not let what never was bring us down...

In between the doubts and the dreamin'  
Comes my humble quest for a plan.  
I've been out there hoverin' by,  
Don't forget to pull me in sometimes.  
Will you be with me as I make my journey  
Through the labyrinth of time?  
And I'm still waitin' for the good Lord  
To show me the way, babe.  
This is who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.  
Will my reckless courage invite you  
To become my clever companion?  
Madly in love and in love with the madness,  
Get ready to run baby.  
This is who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.  
Enjoyin' the ride,  
Savor the simple pleasure  
With you by my side.  
Who you see, this is who I am.  
Please forgive me if I fall sometimes,  
Just an ordinary man.  
  

Wake up everybody  
Take a good look around  
There's far too many reasons  
For all the troubles goin' down.  
Jesus is watchin',  
And the devil is alive.  
Buddha is cryin',  
And Allah is mystified.  
Brothers killin' brothers,  
And our children in the streets.  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times.  
The world is watchin', just look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
Down on every corner  
We got children sellin' dope.  
Who's gonna send a message  
And try to give 'em hope.  
Jesus is watchin',  
And the devil is alive.  
Buddha is cryin',  
And Allah is mystified.  
Brothers killin' brothers,  
And our children in the streets.  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times.  
The world is watchin', just look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.  
Can't buy love with a paycheck,  
It means nothin' to a boy and girl.  
You need universal love of all mankind  
To change what's wrong with the world.  
The world is watchin', look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.  
The world is watchin', look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.  

On a cross town bus in the city  
I spied a lady all dressed in black  
High heeled shoes and her dress cut loose  
Her front was saggin' out on the rack  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
Driver, won't you stop this crazy machine  
And let my feet out and touch the ground  
Got to lay me a line on the lady  
Before she walks down the street too far  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
That's right  
Yes she has, yes she has  
Watch me waking  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
I believe, I believe  
That the lady's gonna bring me luck  
I know she bring some luck  

The sky is fallin' and the ground is reachin' up  
The river's goin' by and the water's gettin' high and I feel like givin' up  
Standin' in the downpour with these rainy day crossroad blues  
Got those woods on my left, city on my right, don't want to sleep alone
tonight again  
Hole in my coat, hole in my shoes, sittin' in Mobile singin' the blues about
you  
Company people call my house most every day  
Won't let a body concentrate  
Gotta get some peace that way  
Waitin' for that water risin', think I'll put my guitar in my boat  
'Cause I'm floatin' to the nearest levy just to lay down  
In that sand  
Just pickin' wild berries, gettin' stung by honey bees  
The Lord above and the devil below havin' a fight inside of me  
Thinkin' ' bout my gun, maybe that will set me free  
'Cause thunder and lightnin' are trapped inside of me  
Innocent darlin' why you treat your daddy this way?  
The price of the question is a mighty hard price to pay  
'Cause you brought these rainy day crossroad blues my way  
I can't take it no more

Darlin', I know I'm just another head on your pillow  
If only just tonight, girl, let me hear you lie just a little  
Tell me I'm the only man that you ever really loved  
Honey, take me back in my memory place  
When it was all very right, so very nice, so very nice  
Here, darlin', stands another bandit wanting you  
In and out your life, they come and they go  
Your days and nights like a wheel that turns  
Grindin' down a secret part of you  
Deep inside your heart, that nobody knows  
  
When you say comfort me to anyone who approaches  
Chalkin' up the hurt, you live and you learn  
Well, we've both lived long enough to know  
That we'd trade it all right now for just one minute of real love, real love  
  
When you say comfort me to anyone who approaches  
Chalkin' up the hurt, you live and you learn  
Well, we've both lived long enough to know  
That we'd trade it all right now for just one minute of real love, real love

When things get stale  
You get on a boat and sail to Rio  
The beaches and the sea  
That's where I long to be  
In Rio  
But I'm workin' for the man every day up in the city  
Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And it's waiting there for you and me  
In Rio  
  
Dark eyed lady  
Drive Mercedes everywhere  
In Rio  
She said, "Do you want to take a ride?"  
So I jumped right in beside her  
In Rio  
  
But I'm workin' for the man every day up in the city  
Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And it's waiting there for you and me  
In Rio  
  
When things get stale  
You get on a boat and sail to Rio  
The beaches and the sea  
That's where I long to be  
In Rio  
  
But I'm workin' for the man every day up in the city  
Got to get away on a boat around the corner  
And it's waiting there for you and me  
In Rio

I was ridin' down that highway  
Silver Harley by my side  
When I thought I saw my lady  
She was headed for the Berkely Hill  
Pistol on her hip in case she needed a thrill  
I don't believe it  
Don't believe a word  
I don't believe it  
Don't believe a word  
I said come on with me baby  
Don't you want to ride with me  
She put her hand into her bag, now  
Pulled out a half pint of red eye sauce  
Sneakin' 'round the corner, drinkin' whiskey from a jar  
I don't believe it  
Don't believe a word  
I don't believe it  
Don't believe a word  

Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'  
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor  
All the way in town they can hear me comin'  
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more  
And i smell my motor burnin'  
Underneath the hood is smoke  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
  
The highway patrol got his eyes on me  
I know what he's thinkin' and it ain't good  
I'm movin' so fast he can barely see me  
Gonna lose that man, i know i should  
I gotta kick in my pedal  
Make my ford move a little bit faster  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway

Take me back to an easy life,  
Robin Hood and Marian,  
A lone ranger on a silver horse.  
Make believe in a box of sand,  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about dinner time  
I'm eatin' bullets. Come on Fury - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Sun down with a chorus girl,  
Ragtime and whiskey pour.  
Midnight in a rented room  
With a key inside the bedroom door.  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about out of my mind.  
Come on Lily. Come on honey - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Last chance for an easy life  
Double down and let it ride.  
Lone ranger with a silver bullet  
For the one arm man inside.  
Bang, bang, we all fall down.  
Just about run out of time.  
Come on seven. Come on eleven - take me for a ride.  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse. Rocking Horse  
  

Tom johnston  
Outside of town there is a river  
And it calls to me  
Like a song in the night  
A whole lotta people make way to that river  
Cause it keeps on rollin' on  
Like everything's alright  
That old river just keeps rollin' on  
Even when all love is just a song  
And like that river we just keep on rollin' along  
Everybody needs somethin' they can count on everyday  
Like a clock that keeps the time for ya  
It never drifts away  
You and me you see are different but the same  
And though we may not understand each other  
We got to try just the same  
Now all these thoughts don't mean nothin'  
If we don't live like we say  
And I for one need love and direction  
To help me find my way  

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels  
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields  
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one  
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on  
  
Running on-running on empty  
Running on-running blind  
Running on-running into the sun  
But I'm running behind  
  
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive  
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive  
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own  
I don't know when that road turned into the road I'm on  
  
Running on-running on empty  
Running on-running blind  
Running on-running into the sun  
But I'm running behind  
  
Everyone I know, everywhere I go  
People need some reason to believe  
I don't know about anyone but me  
If it takes all night, that'll be all right  
If I can get you to smile before I leave  
  
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels  
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels  
I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through  
Looking into their eyes I see them running too  
  
Running on-running on empty  
Running on-running blind  
Running on-running into the sun  
But I'm running behind  
  
Honey you really tempt me  
You know the way you look so kind  
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind  
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find  
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Down along the river  
Where the big bulrushes grow  
You find the old frog jumpin the water  
He won't come up no more, babe  
He won't come up no more, baby  
He won't come up no more, woo  
He won't come up no more, sugar mama  
He won't come up no more  
  
Smell that burnin' fire, baby  
Burnin' in the sand  
See that devil rise, mama  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, now  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, baby  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, woo  
He sho' want to take yo' hand, sugar mama  
He sho' want to take yo' hand,  
  
Oh, harvest moon  
Keep shinin' your light down on me  
The lord reach out his hand  
My soul floats out to thee  
  
I don't feel no pain  
When they shot me down  
Lay my body out, baby  
They put me in the ground so cold  
They put me in the ground, baby  
They put me in the ground, woo  
They put me in the ground, sugar mama  
They put me in the ground

Woke up this mornin'  
Jumped to my feet  
Ran to the window  
And down in the street  
The paperboy was jumpin'  
Like a monkey on a leash  
Yellin', read all about it  
Read all about it  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Down on Sunset  
In the summertime  
It gets so hot you think you're goin' blind  
Little girls all dressed up  
And they're ready to go out  
Makes me wanna shout  
Makes me wanna shout  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
You've got nowhere to go  
No one to go there with  
Ain't nobody cares about anything you did  
Lookin' for trouble  
You've got plenty on your mind  
Now we'll read all about it  
Read all about it, baby  
Slow burn in L.A. town  
Slow burn in L.A. town  

I didn't stand a chance  
I heard a voice within  
With just a passing glance  
You made the walls cave in  
  
You were gone baby, without a word  
I got the message loud and clear  
Couldn't help but hear  
As you were walkin' away  
It was somethin' you said  
  
Now I wake up in the night  
Strange things in my head  
Oh, you did it with your eyes  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said  
So say it again  
  
I'm just delirious  
Caught in a waking dream  
Did you mean what you said  
An' did you say what you mean  
  
Mere words, fade away  
You had a language I couldn't miss  
It was on your lips, but  
You didn't get me that way  
It was something you said  
  
Now I wake up in the night  
Strange things in my head  
Oh, you did it with your eyes  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said  
So say it again  
  
In the middle of the night  
All alone in my bed  
It was nothin' you could write  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said

Sometimes I can't see past a day  
I know I'm growin' tired and I feel it, yeah  
And the song that I sing when the notes begin to ring  
It's hard for my head to get into the melody, yeah  
  
Day to day, I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
A small town store with an old wooden floor  
The old man inside sellin' dry goods  
Has a smile on his face  
Don't you know that's hard to replace  
I bet he's gonna live to be a hundred, yeah  
  
Day to day, I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
Summer is hot and the winter is cold  
People all doin' just what they're told  
It's too bad, it's too sad  
Thinkin' for yourself is a hard thing to do  
Well, don't you know they're depending on you  
To see them through, yeah  
To see them through  
It's the only thing you can do  
You know you got to see them through  
  
Shinin' my light like a candle so bright  
Show me the way to my future, yeah  
With your hand on my face  
Take me far from this place  
Honey, I'll be the key to your heavenly door  
Hear me, baby, calling to you now  
Don't you know now baby, well, they're countin' on you  
  
See me, baby, reachin' for you  
For you, reachin' out for you, baby  
Don't you see me reachin' out for you  
Hear me, baby, hear me callin' to you  
Don't you know, baby, that I'm countin' on you  
To see me through

Up all night I could not sleep  
The whiskey that I drank was cheap  
With shakin' hands I went and I lit up my last cigarette  
Well the sun came, night had fled  
And sleepy eyed I reached my bed  
I saw you sleepy dreamin' there all covered and warm  
  
South city midnight lady  
I'm much obliged indeed  
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need  
I thought there was no reason  
For all these things I do  
But the smile that I sent out returned with you  
  
When day has left the night behind  
And shadows roll across my mind  
I sometimes find myself alone out walkin' the street  
Yes, and when I'm feelin' down and blue  
Then all I do is think of you  
And all my foolish problems seem to fade away  
  
South city midnight lady  
I'm much obliged indeed  
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need  
I thought there was no reason  
For all these things I do  
But the smile that I sent out returned with you

Tom johnston  
There's a town south of the border  
South of el paso they say  
Where the nights are long and the winds are warm  
And the women they love to play  
In an old adobe tavern  
Mescal flows like water  
And rita will dance on your table so fine  
You are bound to place your order  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding down the highway south of the border  
As I ride into town and the dust settles down  
And the mariachi music is playing  
I buy me a room from a guy named luis  
It's just up the stairs and it's waiting  
Downstairs rita is dancing  
Just the way her mother has taught her  
So I settle down for the show and a beer  
And wait for that mother's daughter  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding  
When the morning comes and I wake up  
To the sounds of the people below  
There's a note on my bed that is easily read  
Buenos dias and a kiss when you go  
As I ride out of town with my face to the sun  
And the dust is trailing behind  
Soon I'll go back to this sleepy old town  
Back where I know I can find  
I don't have to think about it  
I don't have to wonder  
Where I'm going to ride tonight  
I'll be riding down the highway south of the border  

Just look my way  
And I'm ready to go  
Oooo-oo-oo, your sweet lovin'  
I can't leave it alone  
You start my heart to pumpin'  
Just walkin' my way  
I don't care if I feel like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and a reelin'  
Actin' like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and really in love  
Well, I know it's always said  
That love will break your heart  
That ain't so  
'Cause I gave my heart to you  
And now I know  
Ooooo, Sweet feelin'  
Got me dancin' on the ceiling  
Actin' like a fool  
I don't care if I feel like a fool  
It's just a, ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and a reelin'  
Actin' like a fool  
Ohh, sweet feelin'  
Got me rockin' and really in love...  
  

She can capture your heart,  
When they start the music playin'  
Sparkle in her eyes,  
You better be wise or you will end up lose your mind  
I said baby, pretty baby,  
Got to get my hands on you  
Something's got a hold on  
Something's got a hold on  
Something's got a hold on me  
She was born with it in her soul  
Lord she knows how to rock and roll  
  
She's the answer to poor boy's dream  
Never seen such a sweet young thing  
She's a teaser, love to squeeze her  
An actress from a fantasy scene  
I said baby, pretty baby  
Open your eyes to the truth  
  
She's got the power, power in her soul  
She's got the power, rock and roll

Drove my car to the top of the hill  
And I looked out across the town  
I got the urge to move again  
I guess I'll never settle down  
  
We talked about things getting better  
But they still looked the same to me  
Could be a near sighted heart  
Seein' what it wants to see  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear  
  
Nothin' seems to move fast enough  
When time isn't on your side  
Can't seem to keep the wheels in motion  
No matter how hard you try  
  
I need another point of view  
Someplace I've never seen  
Keepin' my eyes wide open  
Goin' where I've never been  
  
So take me to the highway  
Take me far from here  
These days I'm not seein' anything too clear  
  
I've been lookin' for an answer  
And I've got a long way to go  
But when I reach that place  
I know I'll find what I'm lookin' for

Patrick simmons  
  
Easy, time won't keep you waitin' any longer  
Than you waited in the past  
Cool and breezy, winds are blowin' sweetly  
On the edges of the garden at last  
  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and you'll see me standin' there  
  
Feelin' happiness inside you now  
You always knew it was a state of mind  
You're just reelin', takin' in the thoughts around you  
Every one's got secrets you must find  
  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and you'll see me standin' there  
  
Oo, it's so easy  
Cool and breezy  
What a feelin'  
It's got me reelin'  
  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Tell me what you want and i'll give you what you need  
Look into my eyes and you'll see me standin' there

Sittin' by myself in the summertime, when the heat is burnin' down  
Watchin' the golden crops in the field just growin' without a sound  
I was a boy raised in the country and it's still a part of me  
And you see no matter where I go it's a beautiful memory  
Rise with sun at the break of day, lookin' out my window  
It's the same as yesterday  
Sittin' under an old oak tree, pickin' my guitar in the shade  
That old tree spreadin' over my head is the closest friend I made  
Just me and some lonely wooden music, floatin' through air  
The grass is rustlin' and the birds are singin' and my heart don't have a care  
Still another day finds me in the fields, sweat is soakin' up my ragged
clothes  
But I'd rather work than steal  
Watchin' the sun settle down over open Texas land, looking at the cattle and
the horses runnin' wild as they can  
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done  
When you were finished workin' in the fields, there was chores at home to be
done  
I was always hearin' music, always wanna play me some  
As a full-time friend or the way to ease the end of a woman that swayed me
some  
Hearin' those tunes always had a way of soothin' out my soul  
When times got hard and work got slow it was music that kept me whole  
Sun beatin' down through the trees, gets so hot bring a workin' man to his
knees  
Part of my heart, part of my soul, part of a melody  
Hands are clappin' and people swayin' in simple harmony  
Life was different in the old days, you just get a day's work done  
When you finished workin' in the fields there was chores at home to be done  
Late in the evenin' on the front porch when the sun is settin' in the west  
Me and the boys pass around the bottle and sing what we like best  
Sing about our wives, sing about our children, singin' out the Delta blues  
We're simple folks and we like it that way, got nothin' left to lose  

Why am I soaring high  
Just one look and you touched my mind  
I have heard of this thing  
Now my heart can truly sing  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny  
You have shown me the way  
Now I know love is here to stay  
As the path opens wide  
We clearly see love cannot hide  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny  
This is heaven, my dear  
I've never seen love quite so clear  
We will wander no more  
Our hearts are one, let's close the door  
Oh, love is here  
Oh, what a feeling, love has set me free  
Oh, love is here  
You are the one, you are my destiny  

Deep as a river, wide as the sea  
Changin' the ways of a captain and me  
I could be happy, lord, so then should he  
If all of the universe unveiled itself to me  
So then a day flows into night  
Down the street the beggar man who finds himself in wine  
If i am a good man and sure in all my ways  
The captain of a starship that's homeward bound today  
  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
  
A whisper, an answer, a cry in the night  
Break down, turn around, a feeling of fright  
The Indian, the black man, the Asian who see  
A door that is opening, and they're goin' to be free  
  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
  
We are all acceptable, we are all a place in time  
Moving through a passageway, bringing forth the end of time  
Growin', growin', changin' ev'ry day  
Knowin', showin' all my worldly ways  
Hear the chimes, hear how they ring  
Marking time all through the day  
Light the fire, start the day, mark the light that shows the way  
Changing times of fortunes past, we will all be free at last  
  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea  
We're gonna be there when ev'ry body laughs about  
The way that we are changin', you and me, yeah  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea  
We're gonna be there when ev'ry body laughs about  
The way that we are changin', you and me, yeah  
We are the people of the round about  
We are the sails upon the sea

Just don't know why I keep on tryin'  
Must be a better way out  
I hope I find it soon  
Every night, I just can't keep from cryin'  
Even my old dog  
Keeps howlin' at the moon  
Even my old dog  
Keeps howlin' at the moon  
Even the sun, it just a keep on shinin'  
Pollyanna days when I was a child and on my own  
Even the tracks, they just a keep on linin'  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
Oh, but bless the days and the many different ways  
People try to love one another  
And won't you bless the times and the holy light that shine  
Our cross has been brought asunder  
Even the sun, it just a keep on shinin'  
Pollyanna days when I was a child and on my own  
Even the tracks, they just a keep on linin'  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
  

There's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
There's only so much we can be sure of  
We can see  
The rest belongs to time  
And things that are meant to be  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know you've found your rainy day  
Oh, the blues are bound to make you feel  
Just like they're here to stay  
All through your life  
Anything that's meant to be will be  
When tomorrow comes  
Once again, you'll see  
That there's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know you've found your rainy day  
Oh, the blues are bound to make you feel  
Jut like they're here to stay  
Oh, you should know  
There ain't much a broken heart can see  
When tomorrow hides  
The dream beyond this dream  
Oh, there's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  

This train I'm on is right on time  
In the mornin' I'll be there  
It's been so long since I held her in my arms  
I'm goin' back where I belong  
Where a love will always keep me safe from harm  
This train I'm on is right on time  
Now I know I'm on my way  
I can hear that whistle blow all down the line  
And as the towns go rollin' by  
I can almost smell the wind blow through the pines  
And they'll all be out to meet me  
Cause there's no place where they treat you quite so fine  
  
Well I've been all around and I know there's no place better  
Sun is gonna shine again in my back door  
Each time the wheels go 'round  
I'm closer to the one I've waited for

No one lives forever  
So don't waste your time  
Just ain't right to walk away  
Roll the dice, lay it on the line  
Many roads to travel  
In your search you might find  
That getting there will have no meaning  
If you can't enjoy the ride  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
If you're lookin' for trouble  
You can bet it's gaining from behind  
When you give, you get back double  
You can't lose, let your heart decide  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
No one lives forever  
So don't waste your time  
Just ain't right to walk away  
Roll the dice, lay it on the line  
Too high a price that everyone's paying  
The world ain't so nice, trying to survive  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep the dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life, takin' chances you're given  
That's always enough to keep that dream alive  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life  
That's always enough  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  
Spending your life  
That's always enough  
Too high a price  
The world ain't so nice  

I'm walkin' in shadows, I cannot see  
Faces, they smile when I fall or flee  
Doors without windows all shuttered tight again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way  
I just might pass this way again  
  
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing  
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring  
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans again  
  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way  
I just might pass this way again  
  
Locked in a room down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast  
Locked in a room down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast  
  
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing  
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring  
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast

People rushin' everywhere  
If they'd only slow down once  
They might find something there  
Green trees and timber land  
People workin' with their hands  
For sure a different way to live  
Gonna keep my cabin at hand  
Retreat and live off the land  
All around Ukiah, wo  
  
The mountain streams that rush on by  
Show the fish a jumpin'  
And reflect the open sky  
The fresh clean smell of the pines  
Symbol of unchanging times  
All around this sacred land  
Strangely, though, I've found my way  
Right here I'm gonna stay  
In this land Ukiah, wo

There's a stormy vision  
Stars before my eyes  
I seem to have this fear of the dark  
That only love defies  
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance  
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight  
When you snap your fingers and change my fate, baby  
Love gets its way and honey I must obey  
I'm under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin' down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
I'm under the spell  
A physical reaction, the doctors all agree  
Disillusion's all in my head  
It's so real to me  
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance  
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed  
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight  
When you snap my fingers and change my fate, baby  
You'll get your way - cause honey - I must obey  
  
I'm under the spell  
So tough to clear out my head  
Comin' down from a night of passion  
I blacked out the moment I felt  
This could only be love  
I'm under the spell  
Starstruck - I stare into space  
I see the flash - then I hear the thunder  
So shocked - I'm merely a shell  
It's stranger than love -  
I'm under the spell  
  
Fools fall in love under the moonlight  
Count me as one - under the spell

He came from somewhere back in her long ago  
The sentimental fool don't see  
Trying hard to recreate  
What had yet to be created once in her life  
  
She musters a smile  
For his nostalgic tale  
Never coming near what he wanted to say  
Only to realize  
It never really was  
  
[Chorus]  
She had a place in his life  
He never made her think twice  
As he rises to her apology  
Anybody else would surely know  
He's watching her go  
  
But what a fool believes he sees  
No wise man has the power to reason away  
What seems to be  
Is always better than nothing  
And nothing at all keeps sending him  
  
Somewhere back in her long ago  
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life  
Someday, somewhere, she will return  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But what a fool believes he sees  
No wise man has the power to reason away  
What seems to be  
Is always better than nothing  
There's nothing at all  
But what a fool believes he sees

Caught up in wheels of fortune while you've been asleep  
Come on, give it up, you got what's comin' to you  
No use for you to struggle, now you're in too deep  
It's gonna be a long, long time before it's through  
  
Changin' wheels of fortune  
Drivin' us on and on  
Winnin', sometimes losin'  
As soon as it's here it's gone  
  
I'm so tired of losin'  
But I still play the game  
And I know there's no reason  
Still I go on searchin' just the same  
  
Well, I've kicked around your city  
Seen your vanity  
Mister Society, can you hear me  
You get your satisfaction and you cover all the action  
But your loaded dice won't help you in the end  
  
Changin' wheels of fortune  
Drivin' us on and on  
Winnin', sometimes losin'  
As soon as it's here it's gone  
  
I'm so tired of losin'  
But I still play the game  
And I know there's no reason  
Still I go on searchin' just the same

Horizon of blue, hills are rollin'  
Walkin' with you through a field of red stones  
I been confused from voices callin', callin' to me  
Where the white sun has shown  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free  
  
The old man is weak, but strength comes from him  
A smile full of youth, and a gleam in his eye  
His garden is green and seems overflowin'  
And his dreams await in his rockin' chair sky  
  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
It's got to be free

As the wind blows down the canyon,  
And the rain falls on the river,  
I can hear her song of wishes.  
I can feel her body shiver.  
Her boots are made of feathers,  
Flying as she runs  
Across this painted desert,  
With a suitcase full of guns.  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
Near the old abandoned drive-in,  
There's a brand new Motel 6.  
It's hard to make a livin',  
But you work to get your kicks.  
You don't know how you got here,  
But it comes as no surprise.  
When the rust gets in your engine,  
And the dust gets in your eyes.  
  
Wild, wild ride.  
And the world goes 'round and 'round.  
Wild, wild ride.  
You go crazy from the sound.  
  
From Mobile to Milwaukee,  
Seattle, St. Joe.  
From Memphis to Miami,  
To the streets of Tokyo.  
Take a trip among the livin',  
Make a circle in the sky.  
It's a good day for believin',  
That we're never gonna die.

I get a feelin', lost without you baby  
Livin' alone is drivin' me crazy  
Don't you know  
I got nowhere to go  
You should be the one that's hurtin'  
You got everything you need  
Back in the days when love was so easy  
I was fancy free and laughin' with no reason  
Things have changed  
Your touch has grown strange  
I can't help myself  
I know that you have left me dyin' here  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you no more  
Baby, baby  
I can't live without you  
I feel you know it, huh  
Oh, baby, now I'm lost without my baby  
Oh, baby, baby, babe, don't you hear right now

Telephone down the hall  
Dark and dusty on a dirty wall  
Funky number scratched up above  
Call this number if you need some love  
Another number that's hard to read  
Fools 'round here call it endlessly  
But I know better, just leave it alone  
Sugar man sellin' dreams on the phone  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wrong number  
Don't cha do it, no don't cha do it  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wrong number  
Don't cha do it, no don't cha do it  
Oh oh that sugar it ain't worth the price  
Another day out in the streets  
The rollers drag another man to his feet  
Take him to jail, to city hall  
Sugar man puts a cross on his wall  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wrong number  
Don't cha do it, no don't cha do it  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wrong number  
Don't cha do it, no don't cha do it  
Oh oh that sugar it ain't worth the price  
They keep on callin' the man day and night  
Mercedes pulls up, they all gather 'round  
They flash their cash as the window rolls down  
Then they run, run and hide  
Back to their room for a warm sugar ride  

Wynken and Blynken and Nod one night  
Sailed off in a wooden shoe  
Sailed in a river of  
Crystal light into a sea of dew  
  
Now where are you going  
And what do you (A)wish  
The old moon asked of the three  
Well, we're going out fishing  
For herring fish that live in the  
Beautiful sea  
  
Nets of Silver and  
Gold have we said  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod  
  
The old moon laughed andsang  
A song  
As they rocked in their wooden  
Shoe  
And the wind that sped them all  
Night long ruffled the waves of dew  
  
Well the little stars were the  
Herring fish that lived  
In the beautiful sea  
Now cast your nets wherever  
You wish never afeared are we  
So sang the stars to the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod  
  
All night long their nets they  
Threw to the stars and  
The twinkling foam  
Then down from the skies came  
The wooden shoe bringing  
The fisherman home  
  
Twas all so pretty a sight  
It seemed as if it could not be  
And some folks thought it was  
A dream they dreamed  
Of sailingthe beautiful sea  
But I shall name you the  
Fisherman three:  
Wynken, Blynken and Nod  
  
Now Wynken and Blynken are  
Two little eyes and Nod is a  
Little head  
And the wooden shoe that  
Sailed the sky is a wee one's  
Trundle bed  
So close your eyes while  
Mother sings of the beautiful  
Sights that be  
And you will see wonderful  
Things as you rock on the misty sea  
Where the old moon rocks  
The fisherman three  
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Why'd you tell me this  
While you look for my reaction  
What do you need to know  
Don't you know I'll always be the one  
  
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers  
I've got lovin' eyes of my own  
You belong to me  
In this life  
  
Anyone could tell  
Any fool can see who you need  
I know you all too well  
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers  
I've got lovin' eyes and I can tell  
  
You belong to me  
Tell him you were foolin'  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
Tell him he's a stranger  
You belong to me

Who's gonna make you feel just right  
When that music's playin'  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that music's playin'  
When the thing cuts loose it's out-a hand  
You know you just can't stop it  
Can't sit in your chair, you got to stand  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
  
Whole damn place keeps blowin' higher, yeah  
Guitar man sets the strings on fire  
Hey, now it's 'bout time to set things straight  
You know you just can't stop it  
So now it's time to advocate  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
  
Who's gonna make you feel just right  
When that music's playin'  
You gotta kick out the doors and turn out the light  
When that music's playin'  
When the thing cuts loose it's out-a hand  
You know you just can't stop it  
Can't sit in your chair, you got to stand  
You know you just can't stop it  
  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild  
We can make it, we can shake it in a little while  
We can make it  
Down to the corner where the night's goin' hog wild

You're still playing that time-worn melody  
Play it now for old time's sake once more  
When you want me, you won't be usin' me  
Like you've done a thousand times before  
'Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Ain't no use in foolin' myself  
You never change at all  
  
You're still sayin'  
That you're misunderstood  
Won't go fallin' this time, that's for sure  
All your methods won't do you any good  
They've all been tried a thousand times before  
  
'Cause I found out now  
You never change  
Ain't no use in foolin' myself  
You never change at all  
  
It ain't no use, you'll never change  
Stop your runnin' around...

Who are you  
Where you been  
How'd you come into my life  
I just know once you get started  
Girl, I been throwin' my heart in  
You're just like walkin' in a danger zone  
A chance I just had to take  
You're like a drink I needed so bad and found  
If no one pulled my head back in time, I would drown  
Oh, I get lost in your eyes  
I crossed the line for you so long ago  
Now I find truth in your lies  
You got me cornered with my back to the wall  
Takes all I've got just to hold on  
Through all the disappointment  
Love still remains  
Darling, you're made that way  
Girl, you're made that way  
"You were just a lonely man  
Living through your empty plans"  
I know you're made that way  
I know you're made that way  
Say it please  
Say you will  
Come back and be in my life  
Girl, if you just put your heart in it  
No one could stop us once we get started  
Well, I get tired of living for your applause  
And putting my happiness in your hands  
Well, I don't know what you're expecting of me  
What you want for me to be, I will be  
I know you're made that way  
I know you're made that way
