Yeah, count to five  
And I will start my car for a ride  
Yeah, a hundred miles  
And I will be at speed satisfied  
  
Yeah, I'll miss my life  
Behind my driving wheel once it's fine  
Yeah, action time  
One only can obtain with it's style  
  
Yeah, I'll miss my life  
Behind my driving wheel once it's fine  
Yeah, action time  
One only can obtain with it's style  
  
Yeah, it's a good time  
Time knows wish its mile  
Yeah, about time my  
Gotta speed in my life  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Go

The easy way  
Is not the way my life will take  
Because the limit is the sky  
The easy way  
Is not the way that I can take  
My life's in pieces half the time  
Dancing on a razor blade  
Break the ice but never break  
Where the time meets destiny  
Take your chance and come with me  
Aleyah  
The easy way  
Is not the way that I can take  
I keep on dancing in the sky  
It's the way  
And not the goal that will make it  
All so special in my life  
Dancing on the pulse of time  
Bring it home across the line  
Come with me  
Aleyah  
Dancing on a razor blade  
Break the ice but never break  
Where the time meets destiny  
Take your chance and come with me  
Aleyah  
Life in the fast lane  
Don't you think baby  
To make it up there  
We gotta be crazy

In the heat of the violence  
The night's exploding everywhere  
When hate pulls the trigger  
The devil comes to take his share  
  
In the garden of Eden  
The time is running out so fast  
Into heart of the demon  
With no escape our die is cast  
  
In the city of angels  
Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
On the eve of destruction  
A reign of terror rules the street  
When the heads start rolling  
The devil comes to let it bleed  
  
In the city of angels  
Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Walk on past the alien nation  
Walk on to the end of your reach  
No fear of the alien nation  
No fear of the hatred they preach  
  
Don't run, there's no place to hide  
Today or tomorrow it will get you  
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat  
And whatever you do, there's no way out  
  
When the shroud comes down on this place  
To bury us all alive  
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
Walk on past the alien nation  
Walk on to the end of your reach  
They pray for eternal damnation  
They pray for your soul to keep

Can't get enough of the girl that I love  
She's hot like the fire which burns on the sun.  
She turns me on and my mind's goin' round  
Hot lovin' woman is back in town  
  
Well just to make me feel alright  
All night long, oh yeah  
But just to make me feel alright  
All night long  
  
Can't get enough of the girl that I love  
She's hot like the fire which burns on the sun.  
She turns me on and my mind's goin' round  
Hot lovin' woman is back in town  
  
Oh yeah  
Well just to make me feel alright  
All night long, oh yeah  
But just to make me feel alright  
All night long

Lyrics:Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell  
  
You get me loose  
I want ya, that's all I do  
You leave me loose  
I want ya, that's all I do  
  
Make love to me right now  
Love me till I'm down  
  
You make me groove  
I want ya, that's all I do  
You let me groove  
I want ya, that's all I do  
  
Make love to me right now  
Love me till I'm down  
  
Who are you?  
Your magic is strange and new  
Who are you?  
I want ya, that's all I do  
  
Make love to me right now  
Love me till I'm down  
  
Make love to me right now  
Love me till I'm down

Another rainy morning  
People rushing by  
My head is still in the clouds  
I dream with open eyes  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
Like we know each other  
For quite a while  
  
In the sound of silence  
Time is standing still  
There's some kind of bond between us  
That's givin' me the chill  
Do you really wonder  
That we can burn the sky  
It's written a thousand years ago  
In the book of life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
The one who keeps me goin'  
When I can't go on  
The one that I've been waiting for  
For so long  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
Suddenly out of nowhere  
She came into my life  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's always in my dreams  
  
Are you the one that God had made for me  
Are you the one who's mine eternally  
The one who keeps me dreamin'  
When I'm sad and tired  
Who gives my life a meaning  
'Til the day I die  
  
Are you the one  
Are you the one

Arizona really was a gas  
I was screwed up in a total mess  
Mind blowing all the way, you know  
Just out of sight  
Some girl stopped me in the street at night  
Ooh, what a knockout and she felt so right  
Ooh, yeah she took my breath away  
Just out of sight  
  
Loved her in her car  
Took me to the stars  
Babe, we went nuts all the way  
Loved her on the moon  
Morning came too soon  
She got me high and loose, loose, loose  
  
Arizona really feels alright  
Girls swing here and they treat you right  
Have so many special ways, you know  
And that's alright  
Was so hard to leave and say goodbye  
I'd like to stay and have another try  
Mind blowing all the way, you know  
Just out of sight  
  
Loved her in her car  
Took me to the stars  
Babe, we went nuts all the way  
Loved her on the moon  
Morning came too soon  
She got me high and loose, loose, loose  
  
Ooh, what a night  
Such a good time  
Out of sight  
Yeah, what a night

If you feel real sad sometimes  
Caught in bad vibrations  
And it seems you've lost your drive  
And your destination  
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by  
Catch the train of better times  
Rock tonight  
  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
  
If you feel that all your life  
Is packed with complications  
And almost everything you try  
Ends up in new frustrations  
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by  
Catch the train of better times  
Rock tonight  
  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll  
Hard times go  
As soon as the good times roll

Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna I know  
You wanted my love and I gave it to you.  
Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna you know  
Goodbye is hello, 'cause I'm on the road.  
  
Take it easy, don't get me wrong,  
Just keep me in your dreams.  
Take it easy, life goes on  
My little backstage queen.  
  
Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna so good  
My feeling with you was all very true.  
Hey little Donna, sweet little Donna you know  
Goodbye is hello, 'cause I'm on the road.  
  
Take it easy, don't get me wrong,  
Just keep me in your dreams.  
Take it easy, life goes on  
My little backstage queen.  
  
Hey little Donna  
Sweet little Donna  
Goodbye Donna

Out in the streets  
The dogs are on the run  
The cats are all in heat  
Out in the streets  
Snakes are all around you  
Dirty rats are on their way  
They control you and they'll make you play  
  
Out in the night  
Glaring eyes in darkness  
Tigers want to fight  
Out in the night  
Spiders all around you  
Spinning webs and make you pray  
Tie you up and you can't get away  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
  
Out in the streets  
The dogs are on the run  
The cats are all in heat  
Out in the night  
Spiders all around you  
Spinning webs and make you pray  
Tie you up and you can't get away  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
  
Bad boys running wild  
If you don't play along with their games  
Bad boys running wild  
And you better get out of their way  
Get out of their way

Bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The French word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
The thoughts in my head  
Where would they be going?  
Seems to me  
  
It's a tough call for one to imagine  
They're saying they do when I win  
I look in the mirror  
Reflect from the ceiling  
She wears next to nothin'  
Next to nothin' but only  
A touch of perfume on her skin, oh yeah  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The french word of a kiss  
  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The french word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
If those were my fingers  
What would they be doing  
Is pouring along  
From head to toe like a stranger  
To be once again lost and found yeah  
  
She's so bad for good  
She tells it like it is  
The French word of a kiss  
She's so bad for good to me  
She's so bad for good  
She wants more of this  
You can feel it with a kiss  
She's as bad as she can be  
  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
She's so bad for good  
Bad for good  
Bad for good

How does it fell babe  
To taste sweet revenge  
Do you want me on my knees  
How does it feel babe  
  
To let me feel your strength  
Don't be cruel, can't you see  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't tell me "no way"  
Babe I miss you so much more than words can say  
  
How does it feel babe  
To kill our destiny  
I swear I'm not gonna crawl oh no  
How does it feel babe  
  
To make a fool out of me  
How can you be so cold  
If you don't catch me now  
I can't stop falling down  
  
Just one more night and the devil's got my soul  
I need your love babe don't treat me this way  
Ooh I miss you, I miss you  
  
Baby our love's got what it takes  
To give us one more chance to start once again  
Baby our love will find a way  
As long as we believe in love

When the daylight is falling down into the night  
And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life  
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill  
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune  
Which never stand still  
  
Big city, big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city, big city nights  
  
When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes  
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side  
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before  
But it's more like looking out for something  
I can't find anymore  
  
Big city, big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city, big city nights  
Always yearning  
  
There is no dream  
That you can't make true, if you're looking for love  
But there's no girl  
Who's burning the ice away from my heart  
Maybe tonight!  
  
Big city, big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city, big city nights  
Always yearning  
  
Big city, big city nights  
You keep me burning  
Big city, big city nights  
Always yearning

I came all around the world just to be with you  
I've been flying supersonic, between black and blue  
I promised I'd be there  
And now I'm here and I won't go  
Before I give you everything I've got  
  
You left everything behind, just to feel that touch  
To join the family of spiders. really means so much  
There's a storm up in the air  
It's the power we all share  
When it runs through our flesh and blood  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
  
I came all around the world, like on flying wings  
To hear you screaming out for more, still means everything  
Raise your hands up in the air  
I swear to you that I'll be there  
I swear it, in the name of rock  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me

You're like a brother, just like no other  
You keep the torch, that eternal flame  
We bought the ticket, that one-way ticket  
The hottest seat on the crazy train  
  
It takes power to walk in our shoes  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
  
We rock the planet, up to the zenith  
Feel that adrenalin overload  
Can't stop the fever, that road fever  
It's in my blood, in every single bone  
  
It takes power to walk in our shoes  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
Doing it now or never  
We walk into the alright  
Bringing this baby home  
  
Another day around the corner  
There is sunshine after rain  
This journey is going an forever  
Home is where my heart is  
And I'm always on my way  
I don't look back now  
We don't look back now  
  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
Doing it now or never  
We walk into the alight  
Bringing this baby home

I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
  
Close your eyes and I'll try to get in  
To waken your heart like the sping  
'Cause I was born to touch your feelings  
  
Steal the time, take a song and be glad  
Be free as the birds, don't be sad  
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it  
You're still young like the sun after rain  
Follow the light it's not in vain  
And you will see I'll touch your feelings  
  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
You were born just to lose or to win  
To be someone's chime in the wind  
To live between your mind and feelings  
Find your way, check it out  
Learn each day  
Follow the light, it's not in vain  
And you will see I'll touch your feelings  
  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
You've got your songs  
They are everyday for awhile  
Just the only way to feel all right  
  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling  
I was born from the sound of the strings  
For someone to give everything  
To be a song just for your feeling

Let me tell you something  
  
In the darkness of the room  
I'm leaning back against the wall  
Try to walk on broken glass  
A cut so deep just hurts so bad  
  
I remember what you said  
Tears were rollin' down your face  
And after all's been said and done  
You're a woman, I'm a man  
Could I turn back the time again  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
And I step outside the door (step outside the door)  
Blinded by a million lights  
In the valley of the fools (in the valley of the fools)  
Another day went by so fast  
What in the world will ever last  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
There's nothin' else that we have got  
But our love is like a rock  
Standing up against the tide  
  
There's nothin' else that we have got  
But our love is like a rock  
Standing up against the tide  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
You must know by now  
I won't let you down  
Whatever comes along the way  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
  
Don't you agree that one thing is true  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
I'm not the best, but the best for you  
I'm not the best, but the best for you

Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
  
Something has come over me  
I can't explain how full and free  
I want you to feel it  
Suddenly deep inside I have peace on my mind  
I want you to feel it  
  
On the last day that I walked the earth  
I found the answer to the question that we all search  
Where do we go from here  
  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
  
Come inside, now you are cold  
No colors block unopen doors  
I want you to feel it  
Suddenly deep inside, you have peace on your mind  
Tell me, can you feel it  
  
It's the last chance to take a look inside  
It's up to you to change the world for a better life  
Where do we go from here  
  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there  
Can you feel it, love is waiting there  
When you feel it, I'll be waiting there

That's the stuff that turns me on  
More than gold and money  
I need sounds loud and rough  
Like the bee the honey my love  
I can't get enough  
  
Move you legs stamp your feet  
The language of your body  
Is right now all need  
To understand you're ready for love  
I can't get enough  
  
Burning lips the taste of life  
High energy hot feelings  
Heavy sounds to feel alright  
And Rock 'n' Roll for Speed Kings my love  
I can't get enough  
We can't get enough

You stand in front of the band  
With all those scarves in your hands  
I see you play imaginary guitars  
You people shaking your heads  
Right till the end of the set  
You really turn me on wherever we are  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
  
Put your hands in the air  
So I can see you are there  
I want to see all your lights shining on  
Want you to stand up and dance  
Gonna leave you no chance  
To take a breath between each single song  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
  
Stand up and shout  
We're ready to rock, we're ready to roll  
Stand up and shout  
Are you ready, are you ready  
Come on and get it!  
  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you  
Can't live, can't live without you

Wake up man it's late but not too late,  
It's six o'clock like everyday!  
  
Get your things run and forget the rain,  
Take power pills don't miss your train!  
  
And you'd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love, for your life check your way.  
And you like the rock 'n' roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But don't be low keep your own style  
And catch your train!  
  
Don't be lazy man and work off your ass,  
He's the boss you've gotta do what he says!  
  
Catch your train, run and forget those ways,  
Keep it cool it's not too late!  
  
And you'd like to be another  
A different guy and a better lover  
For your love, for your life check your way.  
And you like the rock 'n' roller  
A different life and whiskey Cola  
But don't be low keep your own style  
And catch your train!

My fingers walk all over you  
I won't stop before you scream  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
I feel your body on my skin  
You're the goddess of my dreams  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
  
You're the sting that's in my flesh  
When I am feelin down and low  
That's why I love you  
That's why I love you  
I make you scream I make you cry  
With all my heart and soul  
That's why I love you  
That's why I love you  
  
She's the one who is crying we're flying  
She cries bitter tears when I'm blue  
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming  
Tonight I will reach  
Out for you, out for you  
Totally electric fire  
When I hold you in my arms  
Cause I love you  
  
Cause I love you  
The only true love of my life  
You're the owner of my heart  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
She's the one who is crying we're flying  
We fly on the way to the stars  
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming  
When I reach you with my guitar  
My guitar, my guitar

Every morning when I wake up yawning  
I'm still far away  
Trucks still rolling through the early morning  
To the place we play  
Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know  
The tour's still far away  
Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know  
You're having just a break  
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like  
Coming home again  
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like  
Coming home again  
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like  
Coming home again  
It's great to be here to see you all  
I know, for me it is like  
Coming home  
Day after day out on the road  
There's no place too far that we wouldn't go  
We go wherever you like  
To rock 'n' roll  
Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air  
Give me a shout, let me hear you're out there  
The wilder you scream for some more rock 'n' roll  
The higher we'll go  
Year after year out on the road  
It's great to be here to rock you all  
I know, for me it is like  
Coming home  
Like coming home

I get up in the morning  
For my dose of the news  
Crawl right back in the sack girl  
Had enough of the truth  
  
Spend your dollars and rubels  
Buy a piece of the wall  
Build it up in your backyard  
I'm so sick of it all  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
  
Drivin' down to the city  
Doin' 155  
Better late than never  
I'm more dead than alive  
  
We can find the Titanic  
Put a man on the moon  
But we can't fix out backyard  
Man we better start soon  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
  
I don't want to hear about it  
I wish it would be worlds away  
You know the more I think about it  
The more I feel we need to change  
  
I get up (In a crazy, crazy world)  
We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)  
Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world)  
I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world)  
  
Goin' home to my baby  
It's been another hard day  
Bust my balls for the tax man  
So what else can I say  
  
They spent our money on missiles  
For the third world war  
Now they're stacked in my backyard  
We don't need them no more  
  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world  
Ooh, it's a crazy world

It seems to me a nightmare becomes reality  
The last days of the paradise are gone for you and me  
We're living in the crossfire  
And we'll be killed at first  
  
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world  
Understand that we don't want to fight  
Understand that we are mush too young to die  
Understand no one will survive  
Understand that we love our life  
  
Can I trust the meaning of the life line in my hand  
Which is as long as exciting hundred years  
I could be a lucky man  
But I'm living in the crossfire  
Of a time that starts to burn  
  
Why cannot people that we made the leaders of the world  
Understand that we don't want to fight  
Understand that we are mush too young to die  
Understand no one will survive  
Understand that we love our life

Force yourself to use your brain,  
The only way to gain,  
A lot of things are just a lie.  
This world we love comes down in pain  
With hate and bloody games  
A question-mark up in the sky.  
  
Look, you can't keep away  
And you can't hide  
Tomorrow, yesterday, today ...  
  
Some people say, we'll do it better  
Some people say, everything's good  
Some people sing, let's come together  
But nobody has ever brought it through  
Maybe you and me ...

Sweet little child  
You know nothing  
About a cold world outside  
You're too young to realize  
What he wants from you tonight  
  
Poor little girl  
There is no one  
You can trust in the world  
In the darkness of the night  
What he's doing is a crime  
  
Your mother denies  
There's a problem  
She's looking away  
She don't wanna hear you cry  
She will pray  
That it's over for a while

She don't wanna hear you cry

Is drowning your heart  
What never should be  
Will remain in the dark

Daddy's girl  
Daddy's girl

Sitting alone in the doghouse  
Thinking of you all the time  
Sighing, crying  
Sitting alone in the doghouse  
Thinking of you all the time  
Sighing, crying  
  
Dark lady  
  
Sitting alone by my window  
Counting the stars of the night  
Waiting, hating  
Sitting alone by my window  
Counting the stars of the night  
Waiting, hating  
  
Dark lady  
  
Sitting and watching the sunrise  
Darkness is filling my eyes  
Sighing, crying  
Sitting and watching the sunrise  
Darkness is filling my eyes  
Sighing, crying  
  
Dark Lady

Sometimes there's a time you must say goodbye  
Though it hurts you must learn to try  
I know I've got to let you go  
But I know anywhere you go  
You'll never be far  
'Cause like the light of a bright star  
You'll keep shining in my life  
You're gonna be right  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
Won't be any tears falling from these eyes  
'Cause when love's true love never dies  
It stays alive forever  
Time can't take away what we have  
I will remember our time together  
You might think our time is through  
But I still have you  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
I know you'll be back again  
And 'till then  
My love is waiting  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
Tracy I Love You

Down, I am down  
On the ground, sad and tired  
I'm down, it's over now  
Yes I'm down, should I like it  
  
It's deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
It's deep and dark  
Since we've been apart  
  
Ls this love that comes around  
That takes me up light years higher  
Cause I want to feel love once again  
  
It's deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
It's deep and dark  
Since we've been apart  
  
It's deep and dark  
Deep down in my heart  
It's deep and dark  
Without someones love

Do you say a prayer when your feeling down  
Do you believe that love can turn your faith around  
You're feeling high and low, but you don't know what to think  
The world is full of saints who live their lives in sin  
  
Don't ask the mirror ball you better ask yourself  
I think you know the answers but maybe you can't tell  
If you see it all so clear just take a look inside  
The judge you build inside your heart will always be your guide  
  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
  
Another day goes by and so does your life  
You try to make some sense before your time to die  
If you feel humility for something that is true  
You'll find the secrets of this life deep inside of you  
  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
The innocent won't feel the judgement day  
  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
The innocent won't feel the judgement day  
  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin inscrit en toi  
Mon destin

Is this world out of control  
Say what is right what is wrong  
Do I know this world at all  
I think I do but then I don't  
I'm confused by what I see  
I try to understand  
But it makes no sense at all  
I'm confused by what I feel  
I thought that our love  
Was something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
So many things that I recall  
When we were young just flying high  
Can we turn our fate at all  
I wish we could say don't you cry  
I'm confused by what I hear  
Girl it seems to me  
We're losing after all  
I'm confused by what I feel  
I thought that our love  
Was something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Another day has just begun  
Life goes on there's no return  
How can I trust anyone  
When honesty is such a dirty word  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Does anyone know  
The truth we're looking for  
Can't find it anymore  
Does anyone know  
How to make me feel  
For something that is real  
  
Yeah

Out for a thrill  
Got time to kill  
Just livin' up my dreams  
for heaven's sake  
  
She's on the make  
A twisted vicar's queen  
And then one night we took a ride  
She was all over me  
  
Outrageous  
Just ain't real  
I was too wasted to see  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
She'll make your heart break  
She'll give you fever  
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her  
A perfect stranger  
  
She knows the game  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Out on the street of broken dreams  
Where no one ever wins  
Just when you thought you'd made a start  
You're back where you begin  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
I think you know what I mean  
  
She'll make you crazy  
She's such a teaser  
Says you're the only one but don't believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girl's insane  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Before you get in too deep  
And you get burned by the heat  
Oh yeah  
She'll take you there  
You know it happened to me  
  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
Don't believe her (Don't believe her)  
I can't believe her (Don't believe her)  
  
She'll make your heart break  
She'll give you fever  
She'll tell you everything but don't believe her  
A perfect stranger  
She knows the game  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
  
She'll make you crazy  
She's such a teaser  
Says you're the only one but don't believe her  
She deals in danger  
  
The girl's insane  
She'll promise heaven on earth  
But don't believe her  
  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her  
Don't believe her

You never take the easy way  
The wind is blowing straight into your face  
You never ever close your eyes  
For any trouble that may cross your way  
There's no risk that you're not taking  
Not a mountain that's too high  
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Don't stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
You never make a compromise  
Your will has got the power that won't break  
You never say never to a challenge  
That will come along the way  
There's no risk that you're not taking  
Not a mountain that's too high  
Spread your wings, you're gonna make it  
To the best time of your life  
  
Don't stop at the top  
Touch the sky before you drop  
Never stop! Don't stop at the top

Well, I'm sitting on a stone  
Sitting all alone  
Daisies are rolling down the mountain  
Well see the lonesome tramp  
Who's living in the damp  
Nobody's in the valley  
Shine on, Shine on sun  
Oh it's so cold right here  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Shine on all night long  
All night long  
  
Baby doll, I'm sad and blue  
Glossy wings will carry you  
Well, midnight sun will never shine  
These ravings of a fool  
You're thinking all about him all the time  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Oh it's so cold right here  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Shine on all night long, all night long  
All night long, yeah  
  
One day baby told you sun just fades away  
Forgot your life is fading, now he's in the grave  
Some days like drifting haze  
Some days like glowing blaze  
Some days like tides of light  
Some days like tides of night  
  
One day baby told you sun just fades away  
Forgot your life is fading, now he's in the grave  
Some days like drifting haze  
Some days like glowing blaze  
Some days like tides of light  
Some days like tides of night  
  
Traveling along a tropic highway  
Crazy as the world goes round and round  
Hallowed heaven, night or day  
Burning thing has putting the sun away  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Let it shine on all night long  
Shine on, shine on sun  
Let it shine on all night long

Who's gonna tell you when, it's too late  
Who's gonna tell you things, aren't so great  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna pick you up, when you fall  
Who's gonna hang it up, when you call  
Who's gonna pay attention, to your dreams  
Who's gonna plug your ears, when you scream  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
Who's gonna hold you down, when you escape  
Who's gonna come around, when you break  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
  
You can't go on, thinking nothing's wrong  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight  
Who's gonna drive you home tonight

I close my eyes  
Only for a moment and the moment?s gone  
All my dreams  
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity  
Dust in the wind  
All they are is dust in the wind  
Same old song  
Just a drop of water in an endless sea  
All we do  
Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see  
Dust in the wind  
  
All we are is dust in the wind  
don't hang on  
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky  
It slips away  
And all your money won't another minute buy  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind  
(all we are is dust in the wind)  
Dust in the wind  
Everything is dust in the wind  
(everything is dust in the wind)

Kick your ass to heaven  
With rock'n roll tonight  
I'll make this night a special one  
Make you feel alright  
  
Shoot my heat into your body  
Give ya all my size  
I'm gonna beat the beat tonight  
It's time to break the ice  
  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
  
Hit the top together  
Get ya with my spell  
I'm gonna make my shot tonight  
Take you down to hell  
  
Eat your meat until you're breathless  
Twirl your hips around  
I'm gonna break my neck tonight  
I'll get you off the ground  
  
Dynamite  
You're dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
  
Get it now or never  
Let's get it really tight  
We'll make this night a special one  
Make us feel alright  
  
Put your heat into my body  
Give ya all my size  
We gonna beat the beat tonight  
Come on let's break the ice  
  
Dynamite  
You're dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
You're dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
You baby, you baby  
You're dynamite

Only the Lord knows the answer  
To the mess this world is in  
At the end of the rainbow  
We're scared to death once again  
  
Life's getting shorter every hour  
It keeps on feeding in my face  
Why can't we stop the evil power  
That will kill the human race  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Only the Lord knows the answer  
To the mess this world is in  
This place has turned into Atlantis  
And it's already started to sink  
  
Life in the fast lane  
Has turned into a dead end street  
Let's turn the wheel back to the future  
Let's use the power of our dreams  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time  
  
Right, baby don't cry  
Keep on dancing tonight  
On the edge of time

A summer day is gone  
Listen to the evening wind  
Singing tunes of (tel aviv)?  
Into the setting sun  
You lie in twilight sleep  
Dreaming colors deep  
Today all life is gone  
  
Look at the golden chalice  
Flag broken on the ground  
Ringing fire blazing round  
Where are your friends  
You see all hope  
Lying broken on a slope  
Today all life is gone  
  
Have you ever listened to the evening wind  
To the ? and it through  
Have a listen and you will see my friends  
Wind is telling you the truth

Well it seems that I was lost  
In intoxicated nights  
Following the trace of ecstasy  
With no future and no past  
Just the present was alive  
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream  
  
I was drowning in a feeling  
That obsession rules  
'till the morning kills the creatures of the night  
And I read your lipstick message  
On the mirror of the truth  
Now that you're gone I realize  
Without you  
Life's like a song without music  
Without you  
This world won't be the same  
  
I need your love, every minute  
I need your love, every day  
I need your love, every minute  
I need your love, come back and stay  
  
Well I know that I was lost  
In the nightmare of my life  
Following the flash of fantasy  
In a feeling that exploded  
I'd left reality behind  
Addicted to the power of a dream  
Without you  
Life's like that road that leads nowhere  
Without you  
The world won't feel the same  
  
I need your love, every minute  
I need your love, every day  
I need your love, every minute  
I need your love, come back and stay

A live begins another's over  
As another day begins  
Life runs full circle getting older  
It happens to me  
It happens to you  
I do believe you're still around me  
You're still around me all the time  
I have no doubt one day in heaven  
I will see you again  
I'll see you again, see you again  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart you'll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While we're here we shouldn't waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you  
Eye to eye  
When you came home the war was over  
So many years before my time  
I was so proud the day you told me  
You haven't hurt anyone  
No one  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart you'll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While we're here we shouldn't waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
It's now that I'd just wish so much to see you  
Eye to eye

I look in your eyes, I really think you're fooling me  
You're pretty and nice, it doesn't matter don't you see  
'Cause I falling in love, it happens to me every day  
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm falling in love  
Oh, oh  
  
Don't tell me your lies, I don't believe a word you say  
You do realize, I move around from day to day  
And I'm falling in love, it happens to me every day  
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away  
  
[Chorus x4]  
I'm falling in love  
Oh, oh

Take your hand and you take my hand  
Let's try to learn to fly  
Here what I say, here what I say  
Dream and close your eyes  
  
Too much hate  
Too much hate  
So many things are wrong  
So many ways, so many ways  
Flying through the sky forever  
into another time  
  
Yesterday so far away  
Many miles together  
Were looking for a way  
  
Day by day  
So far away  
All the world  
To do the same  
  
So we go together  
Will you show me the way  
Time has gone  
It has gone  
  
Far away, far away  
  
And today  
I'll see a way  
Follow me we love you  
Just listen, what I say  
  
Forget your name and yesterday  
Put out your hand  
I'll do the same  
  
Now were going to another land  
Will you show me the way  
Time has gone  
It has gone far away  
Far away

And I see the tears in your eyes  
The rain will fall tonight  
And tonight we'll go to the sky  
Because and we fly  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
And I see the smile on your face  
When you look into space  
He's so bright and he is so great  
Come on or it's too late  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
See the rainbow in the sun  
The man will not go  
And the world they have no fun  
Hurry up people run  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly  
  
All together  
Fly to the sky  
Fly to the rainbow  
Fly people fly  
Fly people fly

Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,  
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,  
Gliding through this life, and another is a child,  
And we're doing games, and losing things,  
Always playing gigs.  
  
Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,  
Where the sun is shining, in the night.  
I am in disgrace, yet I see a smiling face,  
And I hope you let me, share your place.  
I don't live today.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Rain in the sky , make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,  
Into time, beg me your time.  
  
Well, I lived in magic solitude  
Of cloudy-looking mountains  
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops  
Roaming through Space ten thousand years ago  
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis  
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness  
  
Somewhere in the blue distance  
Are those long-forgotten trees of yore  
A broken violin floating alone in December  
Darkness everywhere and nothing more.  
  
Symbol, strange Symbol, Melancholy  
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green  
Candle breathing one night only  
Far away, in chillness, bleak, unseen  
  
Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow,  
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time  
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow  
To call the Thing  
Sublime!

A G-string is looking for a pilot  
White flesh is coming down the stairs again  
Your look just makes me a believer  
Stray cats are landing in a rain storm  
Crashed down lost in wango tango land  
Spaced out your body gives me fever  
You sex it  
Relax it  
Reload it  
You want it freshly squeezed  
Closed down the road of all restrictions  
Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again  
Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers  
Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight  
Exit is the door that I can't find  
Black out it can't get it any deeper  
You sex it  
Relax it  
Reload it  
And never hold it  
You slash it  
Refresh it  
Reload it  
You want it fresh  
Got no diamonds rings  
But a song to sing  
Just to make you fly  
Beggar or a king

Hey baby, listen up  
I'm not in love with you  
You keep runnin' off at the mouth  
And someone else can scratch my back  
And I could care less about your legs  
I just want to see 'em walk all over me  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
So don't think about movin' any closer, baby  
Just forget about it  
You body may be a weapon on legs  
But hey, I'm not fallin' for that  
Don't you get it, I'm not impressed at all  
I just want to see you crawl all over me  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice  
  
Don't you understand  
Don't you understand  
  
Tell me when your eyes say yes  
How can your lips say no  
A girl like you shouldn't be surprised  
It's just I hate to be nice  
  
I'm runnin' out of patience  
And I ain't gonna say it twice  
The world out there is down'n dirty, honey  
And I just hate to be nice

Fire in her eyes ? burn ?  
Perfume of the skies ?  
Fingers cold as ice ? freeze ?  
Devil in disguise!  
  
Well, she's a, she's a, she's a  
You know that she's a hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat, hell-cat  
(She's gonna scratch up your mind ?)  
You know that guy with piccadilly-eyes  
Was talking to the French boy  
But didn't realize.  
Banana-long-boat-eating  
An' he tried to get a wife  
But he couldn't stay alive  
Well, you know that lad with the rubber-dad  
Paints his fingers yellow, blue, and red.  
An' you also know that she's a liar  
Knowing only her desire ?

Hello Josephine

Do you remember me baby  
Like I remember you?  
You used to laugh at me, sunshine  
What a fool, fool, fool

Down by the railroad track  
But if you need some other  
I ain't never coming back  
You used to laugh at me  
What a fool, fool, fool  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha

Heroes don't cry  
Heroes don't cry  
  
Standing here in front of you  
A wave of joy and sadness fills the room  
Your soul has crashed into a wall  
Your world just broke to pieces after all  
  
The days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
But you find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry  
  
Heroes don't cry  
Heroes don't cry  
  
The judge decided it's your right  
To wake up from the dream of your life  
The curtain is about to fall  
No need for words, your eyes just say it all  
  
The days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
You find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry  
  
Heroes don't cry  
  
There are days of your life  
Leave the world standing outside  
You find the strength for a smile  
Because heroes like you wouldn't cry  
  
Heroes don't cry  
  
I can't forget that afternoon  
So many times I've been thinking of you  
I'm happy that you've decided to live  
And what touches me most is what you said  
Heaven can wait, can wait, can wait,

I saw it walkin' lonely down the street  
Cool like a cat, like crazy clean  
I looked twice again, I can't believe  
Oh no no no  
  
It turned around right then  
And looked at me  
I said oh no, it really couldn't be  
It was a man, it was a woman, too  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
I think it really came from far away  
I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay  
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go  
Let's go, let's go, let's go  
We're goin' home, it's nice and warm to say  
He starts to move, she starts to play  
I need a body, why not you  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)

Hey you, I'm in love with your eyes  
And the sound of your name  
Hey you, I'm in love with your smile  
And the way you're dressed today  
  
Hey you, well I like the way you walk  
Just like a star moves on stage  
Hey you, well I like the way you talk  
You're really calm for your age  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love 100 times  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
To be your answer  
  
Hey you, I said you know what's going on  
Do you know what I mean  
Hey you, daddy wants you to come  
This school is up to me  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
  
I really die  
You're driving me wild  
I really die  
I'm in love a hundred times  
To be your answer

Late at night when you're all alone  
Take a ride to the danger zone  
If someone wants to cut you down to size  
You never argue with a loaded .45  
  
Just when you've had enough  
It's really getting tough  
  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Can't you see I'm much too young to die  
  
You can feel the tension in the street  
There's no escape, getting closer to the heat  
You play with fire, get your fingers burned  
It's too late, past the point of no return  
  
Just when you've had enough  
It's really getting tough  
  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Someone get me out of here alive  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Can't you see I'm much too young to die  
  
Late at night when you're all alone

Someone get me out of here alive  
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes  
Can't you see I'm much too young to die

She's the one, that's what I thought  
When our love had just begun  
But times have changed  
And I's better go  
Because it's gonna be too late  
And all my love will turn to hate  
You've always known  
That music is my life  
And I live just for Rock' n 'Roll  
No one can make me change my mind  
'Cause I just want to live my life  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
You're still the one  
But you've shown me  
How independent you've become  
Don't tell me you need, you need me  
To be your ever faithful strong lovin' man  
Don't tell me I'm wrong  
I gotta go my way  
And you'll see, where I belong  
You live your life and I live mine  
I bet, you will turn out fine  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight  
  
Alright don't want me to stay  
Alright have it your way  
Alright I'm leaving tonight  
Alright woman, I'll get out of your sight

Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Exchange the cold days for the sun  
A good time and fun  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Exchange your troubles for some love  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Longing for the sun you will come  
To the island without name  
Longing for the sun be welcome  
On the island many miles away from home  
Be welcome on the island without name  
Longing for the sun you will come  
To the island many miles away from home

So here we are  
It's hour one  
And it's a nightmare  
There's nothing left  
And yet it's good to be alive  
There's no use crying  
Cause the universe is not fair  
The wicked and the innocent  
Are fighting to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
Child stay down, stay down  
You better run for cover underground  
Child stay down, stay down  
You better shut your mouth  
Don't make a sound  
  
Human nature is the reason  
For our downfall  
And we deserve it playing God  
With our machines  
Our religions are a prison  
That's our fatal flaw  
Bombs are flying  
While we're sleeping with the enemy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at me, right at me  
When I'm telling you to stay down  
Come to me, run to me  
I am begging you to stay down  
Cling to me desperately  
All you gotta do is stay down  
Pay attention my child down  
  
Look at me, right at me  
When I'm telling you to stay down  
Come to me, run to me  
I am begging you to stay down  
Cling to me desperately  
All you gotta do is stay down  
Pay attention my child  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Child, stay down, stay down  
You better run for cover underground  
Child stay down, stay down  
Stay down

Humanity  
Auf wiedersehen  
It's time to say goodbye  
The party's over  
As the laughter dies  
An angel cries  
  
Humanity  
It's au revoir to your insanity  
You sold your soul to feed your vanity  
Your fantasies and lies  
  
You're a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you don't see it  
You don't believe it  
At the end of the day  
You're a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
And now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Be on your way  
Adios amigo there's a price to pay  
For all the egotistic games you played  
The world you made  
Is gone  
  
You're a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you don't see it  
You don't believe it  
At the end of the day  
You're a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
And now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Run and hide there's fire in the sky  
Stay inside  
The water's gonna rise and pull you under  
In your eyes I'm staring at the end of time  
Nothing can change us  
No one can save us from ourselves  
  
You're a drop in the rain  
Just a number not a name  
And you don't see it  
You don't believe it  
At the end of the day  
You're a needle in the hay  
You signed and sealed it  
Now you gotta deal with it  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Humanity  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye

Walking through the desert  
You know what it's about  
It's really from the church  
Too foreign  
That was never there  
Yet you know I'm in heaven  
But it is a hell  
Sun is drying up my brain  
The smile and installations  
Are my pain  
I'm going mad  
I'm going mad  
I'm going mad  
Aaaayowwww!!!  
  
Walking through the desert  
You know what it's about  
It's really from the church  
Too foreign  
That was never there  
I'm goin' mad!  
Sun is drying out my brain  
The smile and installations  
Are my pain  
I'm goin' mad!  
I'm goin' mad!  
I'm goin' mad!  
Mad!

Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you  
I've got to go tonight  
Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you, I've got to go  
I can't stay  
  
You shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue  
When I go tonight  
Baby, you shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue, when I'm gone  
I can't stay  
  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to take you worlds away,  
To take you worlds away, baby  
  
Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you  
I've got to go tonight  
Baby, you shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue, when I'm gone  
I can't stay  
  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya

When I'm alone I'm feeling blue  
Dreaming a dream of a world that's lovely and true  
  
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world  
And no one will care as long as the world will turn  
  
Faintly the dream of a true and wonderful world  
And no one will care as long as the world will turn  
  
And I know a place to find my peace of mind  
And I know a place to find my peace of mind  
  
And I try  
And I try  
And I try  
And I try

In the night there is  
A gentle voice of silence  
So low and quiet  
She'll catch me 'cause I've been longing.  
  
I want to walk in your park  
'cause I'm alone,  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you? I don't know  
  
I look around and see  
The sunshine in the morning.  
(Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley)  
  
On my journey I change the time,  
Leave everything behind me.  
(Shadows in the night  
Like angels by your side in the alley)  
  
I want to walk in your park  
'cause I'm alone,  
I want to walk in your heart  
Where are you? I don't know  
  
Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!

Test the mend, devil melt  
Bloody money when it's lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money, oh  
  
Heavenly won't it be  
Here's some money  
Belong to thee  
I will pay they will say  
Give your money, oh  
  
Obligator came and said to me  
Why don't you pay your debt  
The debt that you amend  
Asking him forgive on his demand  
For I am with a mate  
Despite in her return  
Remittance of the debt  
I can't accept  
He told me and he capped  
Quite time on his demand  
  
Imaginations came into my brain  
'Cause if you patients came  
That brings me in my break  
  
Test the mend, devil mend  
Bloody money when it's lent  
Scum repair everywhere  
They want money, oh

Open my mind let me find new vibrations  
Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination  
And a place where I can stay  
Where is the love of my life couldn't find her  
Show me the way to find myself  
'Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days  
  
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration  
Who shows me the way to my love  
Is there anybody there with that inclination  
To bring back to sun to my heart  
  
I find myself in a state of confusion  
Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion  
Where's a place that I can stay  
Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean  
I need your help everyday to control my emotions  
In the darkness of these days  
  
Is there anybody there who feels that vibration  
Who shows me the way to my love  
Is there anybody there with that inclination  
To bring back the sun to my heart

You're burnin' my heart  
You're burnin' my mind  
You're spoilin' my art  
You're wasting my time  
No taste in your actions  
No taste in your line  
No tears now...  
Just don't do you ever mind  
  
You say you want to be a superstar  
You're givin' up half to get that far  
You say you want to ride a diamond car  
But i don't like your fancy car  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
You're in love with success  
You're spilling my wine  
No part of my address, babe  
Your ways aren't mine  
You may got the money  
But your wastin' my life  
I'm not your bugs bunny  
And you're not my wife  
  
You say you only do it for affect  
But you don't want to see what i detest  
I think you're depraved  
I'm gonna leave you so  
But you can't see what i see so let me go  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone

You're climbing up the ladder on this shaking monkey tree.  
Dreams are coming true that are just far beyond belief.  
You're facing every storm that's blowing right into your face.  
What happened was it's waiting that you're falling in disgrace.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Your heading for tomorrow for the better days in life.  
But you can only make it if you stand the test of time.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Just put a china in your pocket  
Keep it in there as long as you can.  
Take the magic and just lock it.  
Where you'll still find the boy inside of man, inside of man, inside of man.  
  
You really never know.  
But life will always go  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Well, you know sometimes life doesn't go straight.  
It doesn't go left.  
It doesn't go right.  
Sometimes it just goes nowhere.  
But in the end,  
Life goes around.  
  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.  
  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Around, around, around, life goes around.

In the dirty old city  
There is my home  
There's my home, there's my home  
There is my home  
  
Nothing really looks pretty  
And I've been alone  
I've been alone, I've been alone  
I've been alone  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
In the house of darkness  
There's a magic stone  
Magic stone, magic stone  
The magic stone  
  
But I couldn't find it  
'Cause the shine is gone  
Shine is gone, shine is gone  
The shine is gone  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
And in my heart  
Many wishes are crying  
Living and dying  
  
Living and dying  
Living and dying

I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
  
Let's make this world  
A better place to live  
Stop to take  
Start to give  
  
Love's got the power  
To get it done  
To stop the pain  
Of a killing gun  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place  
  
Let's make this life  
A better life to live  
Stop to hate  
Learn to forgive  
  
Evil power can kill  
The human race  
If we give life  
A human face (a human face)  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for toda  
  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place (a better place)  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow

Since you're gone  
There is an empty space  
Since you're gone  
The world is not the same  
  
I go back to the places we've been  
It feels like you're still there  
I live all those moments again  
Wishing you were here  
  
Since you're gone  
There is an lonely heart  
Since you're gone  
Nothin' is like it was  
  
There are memories all over the place  
Bringin' it back all so clear  
Remember all of those days  
Wishing you were here  
  
All those lonely nights  
I gotta fight for you, yes I do  
Yes I do  
  
Since you're gone  
There is a heart that bleeds  
Since you're gone  
I'm not the man I used to be  
  
I follow you steps in the snow  
The traces disappear  
We know what we've lost when it's gone  
I'm wishing you were here  
  
All those lonely nights  
I gotta fight for you, yes I do  
Yes I do

Blowing 'cross the universe  
Like a shooting star that lost its way  
Looking back with no regrets  
Living tor what hasn't happened yet  
  
Love 'em or leave 'em  
No rhyme or reason  
Break out to make out  
No change in the season  
Love 'em or leave 'em  
Put out or get out  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
Love 'em or leave 'em  
  
Roller coaster flies oft the track  
Hits you in the face, stabs you in the back  
They Jake your right, leave nothing left  
Steal you blind, your mind and leave you deaf  
  
Love 'em or leave 'em  
No rhyme or reason  
State of the nation  
Pure intoxication  
Feel the vibration  
The anticipation  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
  
Don't want to waste no time  
I'm never losing track  
I've seen til all and so much more  
But I ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Love 'em or leave 'em  
No rhyme or reason  
State of the nation  
Pure intoxication  
Feel the vibration  
The anticipation  
Simple survival  
No more denial  
  
Love 'em or leave 'em

Close my eyes  
Didn't want to see  
Believe the lies  
You said to me  
  
She played a game  
I played along  
But now I know  
I was not the only one  
  
She treated me  
Just like a fool  
I was in love you  
Share my soul  
  
The way you touched  
I never knew before  
Can't ask you out  
Don't close the door  
  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
By my side  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Don't you know  
It's a state of mind  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is blind, baby  
  
Didn't know  
But you never life  
But something told me  
I was right inside  
  
Things you said  
They felt so good  
They ask your brain was  
Oh was so cute  
  
But then I got  
Behind the scene  
I want to go  
But I can't leave  
  
The way you touched  
I never knew before  
Can't ask you out now  
Don't close the door  
  
I want to feel you  
I want to touch you  
I want to feel you  
By my side  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Don't you know  
It's a state of mind  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is blind, baby  
  
Love is  
Love is blind  
Love is  
Love is blind

I'm a man  
Trying to understand  
The reason I'm lost in this world  
Tonight  
I was blind  
I just couldn't see the signs  
Caught in your web of lies  
  
It's too dark to sleep  
Too late to pray  
Too hard to reach  
Too much to save  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will re-write history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
  
Life goes by  
Faster than lightning strikes  
Crashes before you can say  
Goodbye  
  
Too scared to run  
Too proud to hide  
Too far to fall  
Too high to climb  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will re-write history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
  
I laid down my defenses  
I opened up the door  
I gave you what you wanted  
I couldn't give you more  
And I gave you everything  
You said it's all or nothing  
To you it's just a game  
A game you're never losing  
  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will re-write history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
You were once a friend to me  
Now you are my enemy  
Passion turns to hate and you make  
Hate worth fighting for  
I will re-write history  
And you will not exist to me  
On the day you crossed the line  
I found out love is war  
Found out love is war

I love you once  
Rock you twice  
My love's a gun that wants to talk tonight  
I kiss the lust  
Right from your lips  
The way it feels will hit you like a blitz  
  
Day after day  
Day after day I rock the speed  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love  
  
Turn outside in  
And inside out  
With me you'll find the kicks you've never found  
I kiss the pearl  
Right from the shell  
Until You'll feel what all these words can't tell  
Day after day  
Day after day I'm burning free  
Night after night  
Night after night  
  
Love on the run  
Always loaded like a gun  
For love on the run

When I look at you  
I can see the sadness in your eyes  
In these desperate times  
We get pushed and shoved from every side  
  
I can't love you if you won't let me  
Can't touch me if you don't try  
I can feel you  
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
  
When you walk away  
There's an empty feeling in my mind  
As the days go by  
We get caught up in our separate lives  
  
If you need me  
You know I'll come running  
Right to you  
Just give me a sign  
I won't leave you  
We'll make it together  
And take it to the end of time  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
  
Oh, I've got a lot of loving to show you  
You know I'd never want to control you  
I only want to be by your side  
  
I can't love you if you won't let me  
Can't touch me if you don't try  
I can feel you  
I know that you're ready to take it to the other side  
  
Love will keep us alive  
Let's make the moment right  
It's now or never  
Love will keep us alive  
Even the darkest night  
Will shine forever  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love, love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Love will keep us alive  
Alive  
Love will keep us alive

A girl to drive a car to love  
The music rocks me down the motorway  
My whore's got wings we're taking off  
And I can't stop this flight of speed today  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
The city lights of London town  
Are far away my hand is on her wing (on her wing)  
I stop the car and she gets down  
I'd like to show why Scorpions got a sting  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love, you drive me crazy babe  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love, you drive me crazy babe  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
You drive me crazy babe  
  
It's a lovedrive on wheels of fire  
A lovedrive just one desire love  
Sweet love, you drive me crazy babe  
  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy babe  
You drive me crazy baby  
  
It's a lovedrive

The innocence is gone  
But still I'm holding on  
Searchin' for love that lasts forever  
Lookin' for a place  
Where love can hide away  
Takin' a chance it's now or never  
  
Maybe it's time to draw the line  
There's just one thing that's on my mind  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
  
Lovers come and go  
Sometimes it's hard to know  
If this will be a night to treasure  
When the damage has been done  
And the hurting has begun  
You'll justify a moment's pleasure  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
Is it love  
Lust or love  
  
Maybe it's time to draw the line  
There's just one thing that's on my mind  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Whatever it is I can't get enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above  
  
Is it lust, is it love  
Still lookin' for more, it's never enough  
Is it lust, is it love  
When I look around tell me who can I trust  
  
Is it love, is it love, is it love  
Is it love, is it love

You can always trust your inner feelings  
'Cause they always tell the truth  
Where did it get you, then your analyzing  
Just do what feels right for you  
  
If you take life as a crazy gamble  
Throw your dice take your chance  
You will see it from the different angle  
And you too can join the dance  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy oh yeah  
  
Did you ever have a secret yearning  
Don't you know it could come true  
Now's the time to set wheels turning  
To open up your life for you  
  
As you know there's always good and evil  
Make your choice don't be blind  
Open up your mind and don't be trivial  
There's a whole new world to find  
  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy  
Make it real not fantasy  
Fantasy oh yeah  
  
Did you ever have a secret yearning  
Don't you know it could come true  
Now's the time to set wheels turning  
To open up your life for you  
  
If you take life as a crazy gamble  
Throw your dice take your chance  
You will see if from a different angle  
And you too will join the dance  
  
Make it real not fantasy

Fantasy oh yeah

Maybe I, maybe you  
Can make a change to the world  
We're reaching out for a soul  
That's kind of lost in the dark  
  
Maybe I, maybe you  
Can find the key to the stars  
To catch the spirit of hope  
To save one hopeless heart  
  
You look up to the sky  
With all those questions in mind  
All you need is to hear  
The voice of your heart  
In a world full of pain  
Someone's calling your name  
Why don't we make if true  
Maybe I, maybe you  
  
Maybe I, maybe you  
Are just dreaming sometimes  
But the world would be cold  
Without dreamers like you  
  
Maybe I, maybe you  
Are just soldiers of love  
Born to carry the flame  
Bringin' light to the dark  
  
You look up to the sky  
With all those questions in mind  
All you need is to hear  
The voice of your heart  
In a world full of pain  
Someone's calling your name  
Why don't we make if true  
Maybe I, maybe you

They're watching me  
They're watching you  
Taking all the world under control  
They make you laugh  
They make you blue  
In the end they try to eat your soul  
  
Satellites transmit the latest thrill  
We can't escape the media overkill  
  
A purple flash  
The biggest crash  
Totally in tune around the world  
They take you high  
They make you cry  
We are at the point of no return  
  
Satellites transmit the latest thrill  
We can't escape the media overkill  
  
Over and over and over

Come with me come with me now  
Inside the garden  
Inside the garden of God  
Smell the sand it's running through your hands  
It's where we're from  
And where we'll go in the end  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
You gotta spread the  
You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
Sit in the shadow just smell the grass  
Where the past is buried  
Where the future grows so fast  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
You gotta spread the  
You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
You touch me so  
You touch me so deep  
I only wish my eyes could see  
The way you feel for me  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
My mind is like a tree  
And I want you to water me  
My mind is like a tree

You gotta spread the seed  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
  
Take my hand  
Make me see

Those mighty wheels keep rollin' on  
On to that crazy place  
That still feels like home  
The world outside is rushing by  
It feels good to take that road  
Time after time  
  
I don't know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am I'm back  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
  
No regrets, well just a few  
You haven't lost a thing  
I'm still crazy for you  
  
I don't know how you feel  
Are you excited too  
It has been way too long  
Tonight I'm back with you  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
  
I've been no stranger  
To every corner of your heart  
Your dream still lives inside of me  
  
I don't know how you feel  
My heart is beating fast  
It has been way too long  
But here I am I'm back  
  
In my city, my town  
Deep in my heart, I'm so proud  
Of my city, my town  
I'll never, ever let you down  
  
It's good to know you're still around  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
You get my feet back on the ground  
You'd never let me down, in my city  
My city, my town

Like it played loud  
Powerhouse sounds  
My body wants to rock and let it out  
Really high born  
  
Morning till dawn  
I'm going all the way just on and on  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
Teach me to fly  
want to stay high  
I have to live it up before I die  
Nightlife and booze  
Girls to choose  
  
Are you ready, baby, come on let's cruise  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
Getting out of control  
There's nothing that can bring me down  
Nothing I'll leave out tonight  
I'm feeling good, I'm living now!  
  
Like it real hot  
Never can't stop  
I'm running down the line to the top  
Never stay low  
  
I'm on the go  
No one holds me back  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now!  
  
It's gonna be wild, it's gonna be wild  
It's gonna be wild  
Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!

Girl, I don't think of you  
At least that's what I try to do, oh  
And I just miss those days  
Our secret little place, oh well, oh  
But I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
Now I don't feel the pain  
My world went upside down, insane, oh  
And I don't miss those nights  
Now maybe that's a lie as well, oh  
Still I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
It's where I belong, in my life  
In my life  
And I'll be there anytime your heart  
Is desperate just to love someone  
I want you to call me now  
'Cause it feels so good to be your lover  
(Feels so good to be your lover)  
When my lips are kissing you all over  
(Lips are kissing you all over)  
And no matter what I do  
I can't get you off my mind  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life, in my life  
I just want this night to last forever  
It cannot get any better in my life  
There's nothing left to do  
But to say those words to you  
Oh yes, I do  

Stranded in this town  
My machine slows down  
To take me where the night begins  
I'm playing everywhere  
Loving here and there  
I always take the chance to win  
Drove a million miles  
Gambling rules my life  
I only stop to start again  
  
I reach out through the air  
Good luck is everywhere  
Can almost touch it with my hands  
  
Just a little luck tonight  
Will do and dreams come true  
Just a little luck tonight  
I can't stop the wheel  
That turns the ball of steel  
  
When passion rules the game  
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames  
  
I'm a stranger in this town  
Life takes me up and down  
I'll break the score until I'm free  
Can't stop to roll the dice  
And in the morning light  
A girl like you is all I need  
  
Don't you need some love tonight  
I do, yes I do  
Don't you need some love tonight  
How can we stand the heat  
When love is all we need  
  
When passion rules the game  
I ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames

Down, down  
That's bringing me down  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to fall to the ground.  
Time, time  
  
I'm chasing the time  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to be turning round.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night of your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
  
Round, round  
My mind's whirling round  
The moons in the sky  
Seem to burn on the ground.  
Gone, gone  
  
My nightmares are gone  
The moons in the sky  
Seemed to eat up the sun.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Back from polar nights  
  
I was down  
I was out  
The nights at the pole've been  
So cold without you!  
I was down  
I was out  
The pole-star was bringing me  
Back home to you.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?

Crave communication  
See me this is my life in the crazy robot man reservation  
Do you feel him, the cold vibration  
Comes from everywhere, produce a crazy science fiction creation  
  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a loser  
I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
Well, that's my mind  
That's my life  
That's my soul  
  
Babe, it's a magic station  
Where we live what we do with our magic from my generation  
I say babe, it's not a vision  
It's reality, this is a robot scene what we live in.  
  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a loser  
I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
That's my mind  
That's my life  
That's my soul  
  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a loser  
  
I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a robot man  
And I say ooh, ooh  
I'm a loser

It's early morning, the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin?  
  
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell  
So give her inches and feed her well  
More days to come, new places to go  
I've got to leave, it's time for the show  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning, it starts to shout  
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it with someone I choose  
  
The night is calling, I have to go  
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show  
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win  
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, baby)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
It's early morning, the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin?  
  
The night is calling, I have to go  
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show  
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win  
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Are you ready, baby?)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane (Come on, come on, come on, come on)  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane

In every corner of my memory  
There's no place you wouldn't be  
If anything, I wish I had  
Another dream with you  
Life was forever yesterday  
Nothing in the world could take  
Your love away, will I ever know  
That time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said you can leave, but never  
Walk away  
  
Lights reflecting in the evening sun  
Back to the place where we were one  
Soul mates forever about to chase  
Rainbows in the dark  
Another day to destiny  
Come on and set me free  
When I close my eyes, I see your smile  
As I walk in the pouring rain  
I call your name  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, we will be together, someday  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, you can leave, but never  
Walk away  
  
I can see a million faces  
When I take a walk outside  
But I just never knew  
That I could go a million places  
And I'd see always, only you  
  
The loneliness crawls up on me  
Without you there's no me  
At any time or any place  
But time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I won't leave you, ever  
Just love me forever  
She said, we will be together, someday  
She said, I will wait forever  
I won't leave you ever  
She said, you can leave, but never  
Ever walk away  
  
Don't walk away  
Oh no don't walk away  
I'll be waiting, always  
Until you'll wake up from this dream  
Someday

Another bloody Monday  
Thirty-nine just died  
All hell breaks loose in the crowd  
A hopeless helter skelter  
Another mindless crime  
Some corner of the world is burning down  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like  
A thousand nights before  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed  
  
Corrupt politicians  
Promise paradise  
The thieves are reaching out for the crown  
Violence is a killer  
Threatens all our lives  
Judgment day has come here and now  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like  
A thousand nights before  
  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on rollin' through a deadly storm  
It won't take long 'till we collide  
The ship of fools  
Keeps on following the siren's call  
Damned to be sacrificed  
  
Heading for a nervous breakdown  
Can't take it anymore  
I see the fear explode just like

The ship of fools

Blood rains down across the tundra  
Ice flows through my veins  
As my life drains  
Northern bound, my dogs are dying  
But I still know  
That nothing is impossible  
  
I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the world around me receding  
No time for bleeding  
Show the world how  
Someday is now  
  
Eight steps till I reach the summit  
My line breaks and I fall down  
The rocky terrain  
My bones are broken into pieces  
My mind can't wait  
To get up and do it again  
  
I can feel I'm getting stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying  
There's no time for crying  
I'm gonna win someday  
  
No turning back, no more yesterdays  
I just won't get lost in the haze  
All my tomorrows, no sadness, no sorrow  
Watch out for the rest of my days  
  
Stronger, the longer  
I'm pushed to the limit  
Said I'd do it someday  
Someday is now  
When I see the the sun is shining, I'm flying  
There's no room for crying  
I'm gonna win some way  
Someday is now

I'm an alley cat with only seven lives  
I'm the trouble scratching at your door  
When the moon is bright and shining high  
I'm getting loose just like the night before  
One for the money, two for the show  
You can't resist it on a night like this  
I'm the answer baby and you know  
Tonight you're mine, forget the guy you're with  
  
Baby I don't care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
'cause you can take me everywhere  
And you're the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
  
Don't try to tell me that your daddy's mean  
You think your mama wouldn't let me in  
Come on 'n step inside my dream machine  
Don't fight it honey you just can't win  
  
'cause baby I don't care  
If I have to crawl an extra mile  
'cause you can take me everywhere  
And you're the one I really need tonight  
  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
That somebody could be you  
Someone to touch  
I need a girl like you  
Someone to touch  
c'mon baby, I think it's you

You look at a poster  
You look at the wall  
The wall in the room where you live  
Where you live with your stars  
Just listen to his records  
Now hear what he says  
For he says, "I love you little girl  
Come to see me today"  
  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
Speedy's Coming  
You live in his heart  
  
You like Alice Cooper  
You like Ringo Starr  
You like David Bowie  
And friends in the Royal Albert Hall

And I'll bring you the show little girl  
Come to see me today

I keep on dancin' on the roof  
Try not to fall, stay in the groove  
A step too far. I'm out of place  
Life beats you up some of these days  
Just like a whisper there's a voice  
Inside of me  
It's sayin' you ain't got a choice  
Well, can't you see  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
  
I keep on walkin' in the clouds  
Find out what life is all about  
I keep on runnin' away from here  
To learn the grass ain't greener there  
Just like a whisper there's a voice  
Inside of me  
It's sayin' you ain't got no choice  
As you can see  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
Ooh, cause no one else but you  
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Ooh, when your world comes tumbling down  
Ooh, you better find a way around  
Ooh, cause no one else but you  
Ooh, can find the stone inside your shoe  
  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Inside your shoe  
Yeah  
  
Keep rockin' in the street  
Keep landing on my feet  
Keep runnin' on and on  
Still play my favorite blond  
Keep rockin' mother earth  
Just all around the world  
These days mean safer sex  
Get my survival pack  
My orgasm isn't faked  
Ooh Lord, I need a break  
And what's annoying, too  
Is that damn thing in my shoe  
Ooh, there is a stone in my shoe

Yeah, well I'd like to tell you something now  
For men who shows you who's the furthest in the sky  
  
How can you lose your mind  
How can you waste your time  
Hoping like that  
Look at the sun inside  
  
Of my hand so bright  
I call it music  
  
Now if you touch you'll see  
The stars from infinity  
Judge me forever  
You and the touch of rain  
  
Music will make you sane  
Burn like you say 'em  
  
How can you lose your mind  
How can you waste your time  
Hoping like that  
Look at the sun inside  
  
Of my hand so bright  
I call it music

Ah, you turn me on  
I've been the biggest fan of yours  
Ah, ah there's something more  
So much more baby  
  
Ah, I can't be cool  
It's getting stronger every day  
Well, yeah, pictures of you  
I cut them out, baby  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
  
I can't get enough  
Too hard a body drives me mad  
Oh yeah it's like a drug  
Suspender love, baby  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
  
Ah, ah, oh yeah  
Ah, ha, ah, ha, ha  
Oh baby yeah  
  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain  
Give me the long faced girl on the magazine  
Show me the white Rolls Royce in the rain

I wake up in the morning I'm thinking of you  
In Dollars and Cents in high heel shoes  
  
I start to think and the headache goes boom  
I'm counting the bills that are stacked to the moon  
  
The money I'm giving to you  
I could live on forever (on the sunny side)  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better (God knows that I tried)  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
To keep up with you  
  
I work twice as hard what else can I do  
To make up the part that's been taken by you  
  
If it wasn't for you I would be rich  
But instead I'm a poor son of a bitch  
  
The money I'm giving to you  
I could live on forever (on the sunny side)  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried)  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see that it ain't funny  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
To keep up with you

I've been around the world  
I've known a lot of girls  
Livin' and lovin'  
It's hard to keep them all in line  
  
I've seen a lot of sights  
Many crazy nights  
Cruisin' and boozin'  
It's a wonder that I'm still alive  
  
Never wasted any time  
Never missed a beat  
Total satisfaction  
Always guaranteed  
  
Tease me  
Please me  
No one needs to know  
Tease me  
  
Please me  
Before I have to go  
  
Speed the world around  
The boys are back in town  
Reelin' and rockin'  
We're rollin' with it win or lose  
  
The girls are dressed to kill  
Lookin' for a thrill  
Slidin' and glidin'  
Sometimes they make it hard to choose  
  
I never wasted any time  
Never missed a beat  
Total satisfaction  
Always guaranteed  
  
Tease me  
Please me  
No one needs to know  
Tease me  
  
Please me  
Before I have to go  
Tease me  
Please me  
  
We'll take it nice and slow  
Tease me  
Please me  
Just let the feeling grow

Hey, do you remember me  
I finally found the strength to face  
The pain you made me feel  
I always held my tongue  
And all the things you've done to me  
Are secrets to reveal  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else  
No I could never live with myself  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked games  
With the mask you're wearing  
And now you gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
I'll nail you to the cross  
The cross I'm bearing  
  
You, you said you'd save my soul  
And sacrificed the innocence  
That I will never know  
Now it's time that you confess  
They say the devil doesn't rest  
Until the truth is told  
  
I'll never let you do this to someone else  
No I could never live with myself  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked games  
With the mask you're wearing  
And now you gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
I'll nail you to the cross  
The cross I'm bearing  
The cross I'm bearing  
  
I believed in love  
I believed in trust  
I believed in you  
You became my God  
I believed in love  
I believed in trust  
  
I was young and so naive  
You were God and I believed  
You made me kneel  
You made me feel  
Like it was all my fault  
But now I know it wasn't mine at all  
  
How dare you use my shame  
To play your wicked game  
You gotta make amends  
For the demons in my head  
You held me down in chains  
And made me take the blame  
I'll nail you to the cross

I'm lost in your eyes  
Reaching out to cross the great divide  
You are drifting away  
Mind and soul and body day by day  
  
Nothing's stopping you and I  
It's do or die tonight  
  
So tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
On a night that's so cold  
And you're just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
  
I've been dying inside  
Holding back the tears I never cried  
Now I'm down on my knees  
Cause everything you are is what I need  
  
You're the meaning of it all  
Don't let me fall you've gotta  
  
Tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
On a night that's so cold  
And you're just a touch away  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
  
We've got to come together  
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold  
Can't you see it's now or never  
Cause we've got nowhere else to go  
  
Tell me why I'm alone  
When we're lying here together  
  
Baby try to hold on  
Till we make it to forever  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
We're alive  
And the future never dies  
In your eyes  
The future never dies

The only king of rock has gone  
Gone to heaven  
A star on the way to the stars  
Another king of rock is born in '77  
Just born to be there when it's dark  
  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time  
  
Just to get the message to be more  
Than you desire  
A star full of life wild and young  
The hits from 1994 electric fire  
Will burn out the time like the sun  
  
'94, '95, if the world is still alive  
With the start of the riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for a burning train  
To set the world in flame  
To play the hero's game  
The riot of your time  
Here's a ticket for the future days  
You'll be the guitar king  
When your electric plays  
The riot of your time  
A new generation's mind  
The riot of your time

Dark night, there is no light  
In the realm of the black magic man  
Soul's flight into the cold blight  
Of the destroyer's magic land  
  
Poor man, whose spirits are stronger  
They're the ones who will reign  
You're struggles are in vain  
  
Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood  
Soon black magic's dying  
You'd better start crying  
  
Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood  
Soon black magic's dying  
You'd better start crying  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark king's kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark king's kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Keep on for the kingdom of light  
There is no darkness, there is no night

I remember when my teacher said,  
"How you want to make your life?"  
I said, "I can play guitar  
And it will be alright listen!"  
  
When I came out of school  
They said, "Which way you want to go?"  
But there was no way strong enough  
Compared with rock 'n roll  
To get the same thrill  
  
Anyhow I've found a job  
They tried to break me with their rules  
But they had no chance at all  
'Cause I knew what to do  
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll  
  
I had a feeling they couldn't buy  
Still got that feeling they still can't buy,  
They still can't buy,  
They still can't buy  
  
Tell me the alternative  
To what I'm doing, but I guess  
There's no other way of life  
Which is strong like this  
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll

The job is done and I go out  
Another boring day  
I leave it all behind me now  
So many worlds away  
  
I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill  
And all we gonna do  
Is walk around to catch the thrill  
On streets we call the zoo  
  
We eat the night, we drink the time  
Make our dreams come true  
And hungry eyes are passing by  
On streets we call the zoo  
  
We eat the night, we drink the time  
Make our dreams come true  
And hungry eyes are passing by  
On streets we call the zoo  
  
Enjoy the zoo  
And walk down 42nd Street  
You want to be excited too  
And you will feel the heat  
  
We eat the night, we drink the time  
Make our dreams come true  
And hungry eyes are passing by  
On streets we call the zoo  
  
We eat the night, we drink the time  
Make our dreams come true  
And hungry eyes are passing by  
On streets we call the zoo

I see a rainbow in the sky  
So many colors and the light  
I see the world and I see all the people  
How they're running all the time  
  
I see your shadow over me  
Then in my ears I hear a symphony  
I see the world and I see all the people  
What they are doing what they need  
  
They need a million and a billion  
And your money too  
They need a million and a billion  
And your money too  
  
I feel fine though I realize  
That I don't need the million  
They are all poor  
  
I feel fine though I have eyes  
To see my world and all it skits on ice  
  
I feel fine though I realize  
That I don't need the million  
They are all poor  
  
I feel fine though I have eyes  
To see my world and all it skits on ice

I can't believe what the people say  
There's only hate everywhere  
So many people go different ways  
So many things don't you care  
  
They see nobody, they see themselves  
But a stage like in a show  
They see the hell, and they need your help  
They need your help, they need love, love  
  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
  
I think I need you, you need me too  
The place where we live is here  
The world is griping what can I do  
For you and you everywhere  
  
I sing this song 'bout the world of love  
And hope you hear what I say  
Forever freedom, forever love  
Forever love everyday

Leaving through the back door  
Freezing in the cold  
Communication breakdown  
Emotional overload  
Been through a wall of fire  
Now I feel like, the ashes glow  
  
Cars passing on the freeway  
My mind is on the run  
I keep running from my shadow  
I'm not the only one  
Somewhere in the distance  
Someone's taking flight  
Destination unknown  
Just fade into the light  
  
There's so much said and done  
But after all  
The time has come, to leave it all  
Behind  
  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You's know I tried to change it all  
I've been trying all my life  
To stand up every time I fall  
If you could see it through my eyes  
  
I feel sadness up my spine  
The future on my hands  
I'm standing here alone  
With open arms again  
Tomorrow ain't no stranger  
There'll be a lucky star  
And love will find it's way  
Into someones heart  
  
Too late for tears  
No time to be confused  
It's just the echo of our  
Swan song  
  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You's know I tried to change it all  
I've been trying all my life  
To stand up every time I fall  
If you could see it through my eyes  
You'd see that love will always wait  
Somewhere out there is my life  
A new love that comes my way  
If you could see it through my eyes  
Through my eyes  
  
What was meant to be forever  
Is breaking all apart  
What was meant to be forever  
Leaves the hole inside my heart  
What was meant to be forever  
We throw it all away  
What was meant to be forever  
Was nothing but a game  
What was meant to be forever  
Is breaking all apart  
What was meant to be forever

You can shoot me down  
You can drag me 'round  
Girl I'll get you  
It won't be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
You can waste my time  
But you can't change my mind  
I won't stop you  
So just go on  
You can play your games  
But it's all in vain  
'Cause my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
Girl I'm on fire  
Heaven seems so close tonight  
Girl I would die for your love  
  
You can shoot me down  
You can drag me 'round  
Girl I'll get you  
It won't be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills...

You're a rock-n-roll star  
You are out of the charts  
Your blood is cold you're getting old  
But your life is rock-n-roll  
  
That crazy rock-n-roll band  
Is spinning in your head (in your head)  
Each and every way ya make the thoughts  
Is about stars on the chart  
  
Ohhh... and they are top of the bill  
  
You're a rock-n-roll star  
You've been the first one on the chart  
You've had glory and fame  
Rock-n-roll was your game  
  
Ohhh... and you were top of the bill

In the jungle of these times  
Honest love's so hard to find  
In the world of video  
Computers tell you what to do  
The world's devoted to the Dollar sign  
  
Remote-controlled and on the line  
Plug in man on the rack  
Waiting for a heart attack  
And no chance to die  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?  
  
In the jungle of these times  
There's nothing left for them to buy  
They look for God on the screen  
They've got even dream-machines  
They are mesmerized  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?  
  
No more space for love  
The world gets really tough  
Can't you see the end  
Twentieth Century Man?

I saw the morning  
It was shattered by a gun  
Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried  
I saw a mother  
She was praying for her son  
Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die  
  
Do you ever ask yourself  
Is there a Heaven in the sky  
Why can't we get it right  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one  
  
I saw the evening  
Fading shadows one by one  
We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice  
I saw the children  
The children of the sun  
How they wept, how they bled, how they died  
  
Do you ever ask yourself  
Is there a Heaven in the sky  
Why can't we stop the fight  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one  
  
Sometimes I think I'm going mad  
We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care  
But in my heart it doesn't change  
We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love  
  
And does it really matter  
If there's a heaven up above  
We sure could use some love  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one  
Cause we all live under the same sky  
We all look up at the same stars  
Then why, tell me why can't we live as one

It came up crawling from the ruins of the past  
And I just can't believe my eyes  
It wears the same old face we thought was dead and gone  
Forever buried by the time  
  
Unholy alliance  
Unholy alliance  
  
It came up screaming from the ashes of the grave  
To make this world a battle field  
It's got a voice that steals the courage from the brave  
And leaves a scar that will not heal  
  
Unholy alliance  
Unholy alliance  
  
Don't want to hear the same old lie that spreads the fear  
Only fools think it's cool  
We must be blind not to see the signs  
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday  
  
Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions  
Troubled times just learn your lesson well  
The party is over  
  
We must be blind not to see the signs  
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday  
  
Troubled times don't turn your back to the lions  
Troubled times just learn your lesson well  
The party is over  
  
Unholy alliance

Cry like you feel,  
Try like you feel, feel it!  
Try to escape,  
Cry to escape, escape it!  
It's so hard to run away  
He's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!  
  
Death on the screen,  
Sadistic magazines, watch out  
Suicides ev'ryday,  
Political ways, get it  
Well, you can't find new ways  
But he's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!  
  
Garbage in the streams,  
A-bombs in your dreams, look out  
Sharks in the pictures,  
Exorcist prescriptions, forget it  
Try to get away from that,  
'cause he's a virgin killer  
  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
No, no, no, can't you see?  
You're a demon's, you're a demon's,  
You're a demon's desire!

Welcome to a trip  
Into my hurt feelings  
To the center of my soul  
You better bring a light  
To find the house of meanings  
In the labyrinth of yeas or no  
For you, life is just like chess  
If you don't make a move  
You'll lose the game like this  
  
Cause you, you're walking on the edge  
You, you chose the way of love and pain  
You, don't you see the bridge  
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again  
  
Welcome to a trip  
Into my emotions  
To the language of my heart  
You're sailing on a river  
That becomes an ocean  
Which you can only cross with love  
For you, life is just like chess  
If you don't make a move  
You'll lose the game like this  
  
Cause you, you're walking on the edge  
You, you chose the way of love and pain  
You, don't you see the bridge  
I've built for you, it's just one step to start again

When love kills love  
Suddenly I think I always knew  
I had my share of mistakes  
Made quite a few  
Finally I know and that's for sure  
I don't look back in anger anymore  
Suddenly the sun comes up again  
There's a new beginning  
When we pass the end  
Finally I know and that's for sure  
I don't look back in anger anymore  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
When love kills love  
It's cutting through so deep  
Suddenly I wake up from the dream  
Someone tells me  
I've been talking in the sleep  
Finally I know and that's for sure  
I don't believe in daydreams anymore  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
  
When love kills love  
It's cutting through so deep  
Well life goes 'round  
And upside down  
It's pretty mad  
When love kills love  
Will someone set me free  
When love kills love  
It's cutting through so deep  
How can we choose  
When all we lose  
Is all we have  
We run away  
From all the pain  
We run away  
From all the pain  
When love kills love  
Will someone rescue me  
When love kills love  
It's cutting through so deep  
When love kills love  
When love kills love  
When love kills love  
When love kills love

Just when you make your way back home  
I find some time to be alone  
I go to see the place once more  
Just like a thousand nights before  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
  
This is the place where I belong  
I really love to turn you on  
I've got your sound still in my ear  
While your traces disappear  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
When the smoke is going down  
When the smoke is going down

You give me your smile  
A piece of your heart  
You give me the feel I've been looking for  
You give me your soul  
Your innocent love  
You are the one I've been waiting for  
I've been waiting for  
  
We're lost in a kiss  
A moment in time  
Forever young  
Just forever, just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
  
You make me dream  
By the look in your eyes  
You give me the feel, I've been longing for  
I wanna give you my soul  
All my life  
Cause you are the one I've been waiting for  
I've been waiting for so long  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
Into my heart  
  
Just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart  
When you came into my life  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin' round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found it's way  
To my heart

A place without a name  
Under a burning sky  
There's no milk and honey here  
In the land of God  
  
Someone holds a sign  
It says we are human, too  
And while the sun goes down  
The world goes by  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Waves, big like a house  
They're stranded on a piece of wood  
To leave it all behind  
To start again  
  
But instead of a new life  
All they find is a door that's closed  
And they keep looking for  
A place called hope  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Can anyone tell me why (can anyone tell me why)  
The children of the world (the children of the world)  
Have to pay the price (pay another price)  
  
And now your telling me  
You've seen it all before  
I know that's right but still  
It breaks my heart  
  
Well, the golden lamb we sent  
Makes us feel better now  
But you know it's just a drop  
In a sea of tears  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na

Don't hear the phone that rings  
I know the fever's coming  
God knows what life will bring  
This Sunday morning (Sunday Morning) without a warning  
  
Don't hear the neighbour scream  
He thinks my house is burning  
Well, life is good to me  
This Sunday morning (yeah)  
  
She's a wild child  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
Don't hear the backdoor crack  
Don't see the cops are coming back  
It's burnin' in my bed  
This Sunday morning (yeah)  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's on fire  
She's on fire  
She's on fire  
  
She's a wild child  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain  
  
She's a wild child  
She's a wild child  
  
Yeah  
  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And her l-l-love turns a man insane  
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)  
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain

Woman you can change my world  
Woman you can change my world  
  
I'm chained to the fears  
Inside these walls  
The silence talks loud  
'Bout the things I recall  
  
Through the bricks in the window  
I scream at the world  
But when no one is listening  
It's hard to be heard  
  
Woman you can change my world  
Woman there'll be no return  
  
I see shadows  
Coming through the walls  
I hear voices  
But no one's talking at all  
  
I can feel the madness  
Crawling up my spine  
Reachin' out  
To grab your mind  
  
Woman come and change my world  
  
(Do you remember all those fears?)  
They won't leave me alone  
(Do you remember all those tears?)  
I pretend to be strong  
  
(Do you remember all the pain?)  
I'm getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
You've never seen me  
But I know you so well  
And before it kills me  
I gotta break the spell  
  
The deeper we touch  
The higher we'll go  
The time has come  
To heal my soul  
  
Woman you can change my world  
  
(Do you remember all those fears?)  
They won't leave me alone  
(Do you remember all those tears?)  
I pretend to be strong  
  
(Do you remember all the pain?)  
I'm getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
Woman I'm gonna change your world

In the temple of gods  
The day had come to come together  
In the early morning sun  
They saw that girl that come to heaven  
  
They ask her 'bout life on earth  
If it was getting any better  
She told 'em someone took her life  
If they could send her back  
Just one more time  
She knew that someone feels so blue  
  
Wouldn't it be nice, hold on  
To spread the wings and fly, don't kill the butterfly  
To see him one more time, hold on  
To be a yellow butterfly, don't kill the butterfly  
  
He's been sitting on the bay  
Lost inside a cloud of darkness  
When I saw the butterfly  
Dancing in the wind  
The story goes  
He knew that she was still so close  
  
Wouldn't it be nice, hold on  
To spread the wings and fly, don't kill the butterfly  
To see him one more time, hold on  
To be a yellow butterfly, don't kill the butterfly

The yellow raven sipped the air  
Of thunder and of rain  
The yellow raven sipped the air  
Gentle eyes kissing the rain  
  
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?  
Take me away to somewhere  
Take me away from here!  
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?  
Answer to my yearning  
Take me away from here!  
  
The fire bird began to cry  
When the music died away  
The fire bird began to cry  
And smoke was slowly drifting by  
  
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?  
Take me away to somewhere  
Take me away from here!  
Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?  
Answer to my yearning  
Take me away from here

I lose control because of you babe  
I lose control when you look at me like this  
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight  
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door  
To a new exciting life  
  
I lose control when I'm close to you babe  
I lose control don't look at me like this  
There's something in your eyes, is this love at first sight  
Like a flower that grows, life just wants you to know  
All the secrets of life  
  
It's all written down in your lifelines  
It's written down inside your heart  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place, where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now, forever and a day  
  
I lose control because of you babe  
I lose control don't look at me like this  
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight  
I'm so curious for more just like never before  
In my innocent life  
  
It's all written down in your lifelines  
It's written down inside your heart  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place, where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now, forever and a day  
  
Time stands still when the days of innocence  
Are falling for the night  
I love you girl I always will  
I swear I'm there for you  
Till the day I die  
  
You and I just have a dream  
To find our love a place, where we can hide away  
You and I were just made  
To love each other now, forever and a day

New love is blind  
Why don't you see  
You hurt me inside, you're killing me  
It makes me sad all the time  
  
To see you around with all these guys  
My heart's in pain  
I need you so  
My love's the same  
So please don't go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
  
Let's try again  
There's still romance  
We'll start a new life, take a chance  
There are so many ways  
  
Please don't forget it anyday  
My heart's in pain  
I need you so  
My love's the same  
So please don't go  
  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need  
You give me all I need

Here I am  
Writing my last song for you  
Hear the words carefully  
And you'll see it's you  
I'm leaving  
Don't want to be the one to tell you  
That I can't stay another day  
  
I'll throw the pages on the floor  
I'm starting over like before  
I'll change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when I'm lying next to you  
It's hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
There you are  
Smiling at me from the next room  
Beautiful as the first day I met you  
And I'm so sorry  
I couldn't be the one to love you  
The way that you deserve to be  
  
I'll throw the pages on the floor  
I'm starting over like before  
I'll change this stupid ending  
And stay with you forever more  
But when I'm lying next to you  
It's hard to bargain with the truth  
Cause when you know the love is gone  
The time has come to write your last song  
  
It's hard to think of you and I  
As total strangers  
I've lived this last goodbye  
A million times or more in my mind  
My mind, my mind  
  
Oh and I'm gonna miss you  
But I can't go back  
Even just to kiss you  
Cause I can't exist  
Just living a lie  
Gotta lot of love to give  
You know before I die  
And as I watch you  
Sing along  
It's killing me to know  
That it's your last song

When you're feeling lost and blue  
When there is no love for you  
You'll find him and it's all right  
It's all right, it's all right  
When you're feeling down and low  
When you've got no place to go  
And when no one smiles hello  
He's by your side, you know  
When you're getting deaf and blind  
When you drag one leg behind  
And when you're finally gonna  
Lose your mind  
It's all right, it's all right  
It's all right  
'Cause he is by your side  
'Cause he will be your guide  
'Cause he will be your light  
And you're not alone, you're not alone  
You're not alone, you're not alone  
  
  

It's your move  
I'm in pain  
I'm a pawn  
In your game  
It's your life  
I just happen to be in it for a while  
  
Oh, you're lovin' me to death  
You're killin' me with kindness  
What's behind this sudden tenderness  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
  
When you touch  
Can you feel  
Is your heart  
Only made of steel  
When you cry  
Do you ever let emotions  
Break your stride  
  
Oh, you take away my breath  
Your unexpected hunger  
Makes me wonder  
What the hell comes next  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death  
You're lovin' me to death  
And leavin' me to die  
You make me wanna scream  
But my tongue is tied  
You played me like a toy  
You made my life a mess  
Everybody knows  
You're lovin' me to death
