Above all powers above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what You're worth  
  
Crucified laid behind the stone  
You lived to die rejected and alone  
Like a Rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what You're worth  
  
Crucified laid behind the stone  
You lived to die rejected and alone  
Like a Rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified laid behind the stone  
You lived to die rejected and alone  
Like a Rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a Rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all

Some days I'm fragile  
Some days I'm stronger  
Sometimes I just want to run  
But Your tender mercies gently pursue me  
When all is said and done  
  
[Chorus]  
Where else would I go  
Who else could there be  
No one but You, Lord, can see  
Can see all of me, oh  
You opened my eyes  
Oh, how I believe  
In everything You are 'cause You are  
All I'll ever need  
  
My heart's full of questions  
The future's uncertain  
But I'm gonna stand on what's true  
'Cause I have discovered  
A love like no other  
The love I've found in You  
  
[Chorus]

All is well, all is well  
Angels and men rejoice  
For tonight darkness fell  
Into the dawn of love's light  
Sing Alle  
Sing Alleluia  
All is well, all is well  
Let there be peace on earth  
Christ is come, go and tell  
That He is in the manger  
Sing Alle  
Sing Alleluia  
All is well, all is well  
Lift up your voice and sing  
Born is now Emmanuel  
Born is our Lord and Savior

All the world is a story  
All the world is a stage  
All the world is a canvas  
All the world is a page  
  
All the world is a horizon  
All the world is a field of dreams  
All the world is an open doorway  
All the world is a place for me  
  
To be your voice  
To be your touch  
To give an answer  
To show your love

Give an answer  
Show your love  
  
Hold out hope  
Offer peace  
Shine your light  
For all the world

Consider your needs of the past  
When somebody helped but you never asked  
Now think of the joy you received  
When you reached out to someone else in need  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Learning from different mistakes  
Learning to give instead of just take  
But when we all start to blend  
We'll be like colors surrounding the sun as it sets  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
'Cause some days we laugh  
Some days we cry  
Some days we hold it deep inside  
Though each day is a gift from on high  
But what I find amazing  
The love we give, the love we gain  
Amazing  
There's so much more that's in Jesus name  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Amazing, amazing  
Amazing  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
That it's more blessed to give than receive  
Consider your needs of the past  
When somebody helped but you never asked  

[Chorus]  
Breath of God, breathe on us  
We adore You, come before You  
To magnify Your name  
  
Breath of God, fill this place  
With your spirit drawing near us  
We'll never be the same  
  
Mighty God  
You are endless in power and mercy  
Be glorified  
We exalt You and lift up Your name  
Lord of all  
King of heaven and earth  
You are holy, holy  
  
Breath of God, breathe on us  
Come so sweetly and completely  
As we seek Your face  
  
Breath of God, reign in our hearts  
And restore us, stay before us  
To lead us all our days  
  
[Chorus][  
Breath of God  
You are endless in power and mercy  
Breathe on us  
We exalt You and lift up Your name  
Lord of all  
King of heaven and earth  
You are holy, holy, holy, holy  
Breath of God, breathe on us

I tried to walk quickly past the water's edge  
Didn't wanna see my own reflection  
But I just stepped off the highest ledge  
And fell into the sea of imperfection  
  
And just like every other time before  
I washed up in pieces on the shore  
  
But you found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I can't imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
This broken thing  
  
Yeah, I was wading in deep despair  
Wandering with no sense of direction  
Thinking prayers just vanished in the air  
Cause I got myself in this situation  
  
And just like every other time before  
You made the pieces into so much more  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I can't imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
This broken thing  
  
I know I'm not worthy of this  
Never ending perfect love  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
And I can't imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I can't imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
Was left inside this broken thing  
  
I know I'm not worthy of this  
Never ending perfect love  
  
I can't imagine anything more beautiful  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
This broken thing  
  
I know I'm not worthy of this love

Oh, I know that You'll be watching over me  
Your shining light has changed my life  
It's like I've found my way home  
I know You're near, hear You loud and clear  
I could live on this feeling alone  
Everywhere I go You are right there beside me  
Anytime of night or day  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
I don't have to see, see You to believe  
That Your not going away  
I know You'll be watching over me  
You're the shelter that's keeping me safe  
I know Your arms they can reach out to hold me  
Even when I'm feeling alone  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
Comes naturally like every breath I breathe  
Don't have to think it's second nature to me  
I close my eyes and You are there with me  
You know me, You see me, You hear me, You heal me  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
I'm gonna be wherever You are  
I love You with my heart and soul  
I close my eyes, all I have to do  
Is keep on loving you by heart  
I'm gonna be wherever You are  
I love You with my heart and soul  
I close my eyes, all I have to do  
Is keep on loving you by heart  

Just a hint of peppermint and every single thing begins to feel like  
Christmas  
And just like the snowflakes, no two are ever the same  
  
Red and white and candy striped in every shape and size, oh what a sweet  
Treat this is  
So hop on the choo choo and woo woo to Candy Cane Lane  
  
You'll be all aglow from your head to mistletoes, oh  
There's no road that could ever smell as sweet or look as good enough to  
Eat  
There's nothin' like a city block of hangin' lights, where I  
Just wanta curl up by the fire for a couple cups of cider and  
Roast all those marshmallows  
  
They're hung up in the trees in line, the bulbs all fill the street just  
Like a scene from a snow globe  
So baby, let's go take a stroll down to Candy Cane Lane  
  
You'll be all aglow from your head to mistletoes, oh  
There's no road that could ever smell as sweet or look as good enough to  
Eat  
There's nothin' like a city block of hangin' lights, where I  
Just wanta curl up by the fire for a couple cups of cider and  
Roast all those marshmallows  
  
Add a pinch of cinnamon and suddenly the world begins to taste like  
December  
And you'll always remember comin' down to Candy Cane Lane...  
Just a couple licks from the minty sugar stick and everything turns  
Wintergreen  
On Candy Cane Lane, one block from Gum Drop Street

We were made to love and be loved  
But the price this world demands will cost you far too much  
I spent so many lonely years just trying to fit in  
Now I've found a place in this circle of friends  
In a circle of friends we have one Father  
In a circle of friends we share this prayer  
That every orphaned soul will know  
And all will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends  
If you weep, I will weep with you  
If you sing for joy the rest of us will lift our voices too  
But no matter what you feel inside there's no need to pretend  
That's the way it is in this circle of friends  
In a circle of friends  
We have one father  
In a circle of friends we share this prayer  
That we'll gather together no matter how the highway bends  
I will not lose this circle of friends  
Among the nations, tribes and tongues we have sisters and brothers  
And when we meet in heaven we will recognize each other  
With joy so deep and love so sweet  
Oh we'll celebrate these friends  
And a life that never ends  
In a prayer  
That will not be long before  
All will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends  
That it will not be long before  
All will enter in  
To the shelter of this circle of friends

Lullay, Thou little tiny Child  
By, by, lully, lullay  
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child  
By, by, lully, lullay  
O sisters too, how may we do  
For to preserve this day  
This poor youngling for whom we sing  
By, by, lully, lullay  
Herod the king, in his raging  
Charged he hath this day  
His men of might, in his own sight  
All young children to slay  
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee!  
And ever morn and day  
For thy parting neither say nor sing  
By, by, lully, lullay

I'm not unhappy, but I'd take the train today  
If you'd let me, if you'd let me  
They may be clapping for me, but I wait  
For you to come get me, some come and get me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause day by day you're coming closer  
Making our way clearer and straighter  
Turning our faces into the light  
And I can't wait to fall at your glory  
On my face, god of the morning  
You're coming closer day by day  
  
Somebody told me I could travel the world  
To find beauty, to find beauty  
But to behold it I would have to carry it  
Within me, yeah well it's in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me a mission if I've still got the time  
'Cause I'm open, yeah I'm open  
Be my vision and I'll be your delight  
  
'Cause I'm goin' wherever you're goin'  
Turning faces into the light  
And I can't wait to fall at your glory  
On my face, god of the morning  
You're coming closer day by day  
  
[Chorus]

Just when I think it couldn't be  
Any harder down here  
Another blow comes out of nowhere  
And knocks me out again  
And when I think I'm all alone  
The phone starts to ring  
It's just the voice I needed to hear  
On the other end  
  
[Chorus]  
You do it again, You do it again  
You speak to me just like a friend  
You always seem to show up right on time  
You do it again, I guess you know when  
My heart needs to hear your voice  
I'm so forgetful, that's why I'm thankful  
You do it again  
I could be driving in my car  
I turn the radio on  
Trying to figure out my thoughts  
Then I hear the perfect song  
I can open up Your word  
And not be sure where to turn  
But I start to read and it's like you know  
Just what I need  
  
[Chorus]  
You use all these things to speak to me  
Could it be you're using me  
In someone else's life  
Well I wouldn't be surprised  
  
[Chorus]

Curiosity can get the best of me  
As I try to conceive the inconceivable  
All philosophy is escaping me  
As I try to believe the unbelievable  
I want to believe  
Without a single question  
Oh Lord hear my confession  
Chorus  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
Though I don't know everything  
And I believe that I could never truly figure it out  
'Cause You are so much more than me  
Above me - beyond me  
So far over my head but I still see You  
And I am finally making sense of it all  
As the wisdom of this fool begins to fall, fall, fall  
Down  
The story of my soul seems like a broken road  
And how I'm standing here is unbelievable  
Keep me lost in the mystery - down here on my knees  
The only way that I can reach what seems unreachable  
I want to believe  
Without a single question  
Oh Lord hear my confession  
Chorus

He looked through temples of time  
To see you right where you stand  
He emptied all of himself  
So he could reach out his hand  
To give hope and meaning  
To the wasted away  
And you are one of the ones  
That he was dying to save  
  
[Chorus:]  
He was dying to reach you  
Trying to meet you  
Where you need him most  
You've been living in search of  
The whole truth and real love  
Your whole life through  
You can open your heart  
'Cause he's dying to reach you  
  
He's standing there at the door  
You can hear him call you by name  
He simply waits to forgive  
All of the guilt and the shame  
He gave up his own life  
And he still bears the scars  
He only wants to receive you  
So come as you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, he has waited time and time before  
You must be still and know that he is lord

Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature  
O Thou art God and man, the son  
Thee, will I cherish, Thee, will I honor  
Thou, my soul's only joy and Christ  
Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands  
Mold in the blooming God of spring  
Jesus, Jesus is fairer, Jesus is pure  
Who makes the wrongful heart to, to see?  
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight  
And all that weakling, starry pose  
Oh Jesus, oh, my Jesus shines brighter  
Oh, my Jesus shines purer than all the angels Heaven can bolt out  
Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations  
Son of the God and Son of Man  
Glory and honor, praise, adoration  
Now and forevermore be thine  
Glory and honor, praise, adoration  
Now and forevermore be thine  

For even the most trusting soul  
This world can be a scary place  
So much that we can't control  
In every moment that we face  
When a thousand what ifs  
Whisper in our ears  
We remember who's we are  
And watch them disappear  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
There are worries chasing everyone  
It's evident in times like these  
But I have found the confidence that comes  
From time I spend on my knees  
There's a truth I'm holding onto  
As these days unfold  
Greater is He, God is in you  
And hear it in the world  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
He's my strength, He's my shelter  
He is with me all the way  
He's my light and my salvation  
Of whom shall I be afraid, of whom shall I be afraid?  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark, yeah  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road is dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart, with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart  

How clever is my pride, how it deceives my mind  
To think I am in control when I have really lost it all  
How brilliant is my greed for what it says I need  
And then I've come to find I'm empty on the inside  
Real, my heart is aching to be real  
So I am coming to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You for  
So what am I fighting You for  
How quick is my doubt to leave my heart without  
The presence of Your peace so that I scarce believe  
How pardoned is my guilt to crush the life You built  
And to keep me far away from any kind of shame  
Real, my heart is aching to be real  
So I am coming to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You for  
'Cause only You can save me  
And only You can change me  
And only You can love me  
Here I come, here I come  
So I come to You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness 'cause I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out so what am I fighting You  
All my broken motives, all my selfish dreams  
All of my foolishness now I understand where it leads  
I wanna be in Your love, I wanna be so much more  
I know You're reaching out I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
I don't wanna fight  

There are two roads  
How will I know?  
Sometimes the right direction is something I can't see  
I hear the wind blow  
And I can feel it  
But I know my emotions can play a trick on me  
My heart wants to tell me, your heart wants to tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
If it's got love  
If it's got peace  
That's the only way that I can believe it  
If it leads me to the light  
If it's got joy  
If it's got truth  
Something that's gonna take a little faith to do  
To make the pieces fit  
God is in it  
God is in it  
What I'm hearing  
Sounds convincing  
It's hard to decipher if all the words are real  
I am learning  
To be discerning  
Is this conversation something He's revealed?  
We need to define  
If it's something divine  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatever's lovely  
Whatever's pure  
Whatever's from His Word will endure  
You'll know its right  
You'll see the signs  
  
[Chorus]

Words and music by robert sterling  
A rushing river sweeps around us  
Just as dark and cold as night, it surrounds us  
But we pass through the water to a safer shore  
We're sheltered from the raging river's roar  
(chorus)  
Though the night is long  
And the river's strong  
Still God is with us  
We can stem the tide  
Reach the other side  
For God is with us  
The river deepens, night grows darker  
And the struggle seems to be getting harder  
Today has troubles yesterday has never known  
But we don't have to face them on our own  
(repeat chorus)  
And when we face the river's roll  
He holds our hand and won't let go  

So sad  
Depression deep inside has got your heart held down  
And you're afraid to feel  
Too bad  
Because life is here for living  
God desires to give you joy beyond imagination  
And so the saying goes  
You gotta stop and smell the roses  
  
(chorus)  
Got to be time for dancing  
Got to be time for singing  
Take the time to celebrate  
The fire of the moment  
Got to be time for laughing  
Got to be time for shouting  
Thank the lord for what he's done  
There's got to be time  
  
You've got to hold on  
Don't let the smallest struggle steal the victory  
When you weep in the night  
Stay strong  
Because joy comes in the morning  
Jesus longs to help you make  
The most of your salvation  
And so the saying goes  
You gotta stop and smell the roses  
  
(repeat chorus)  
So turn it up  
Turn up the music, turn up the music  
Let the rhythm set you free to move again  
Hey, turn it up  
Turn up the music, turn up the music  
You owe it to yourself to hang on tight and lose control  
You can feel it in you soul  
  
Dancing, singing celebration  
There's got to be time  
Laughing, shouting, celebration  
There's got to be time (3x)  
  
(repeat chorus) 2x

Hail, the Heaven born Prince of Peace  
Hail, the Son of Righteousness  
Life and light to all He brings  
While adoring angels sing  
  
Hark, the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born

You're not hearing the answers you've been praying for  
You try and try, can't find an open door  
You're not seeing the miracles not a one in sight  
And the way you feel you sure need one tonight  
Your faith is crumbling, your feet are stumbling  
It's so hard to believe in Him  
But He believes in you when you're at your weakest  
And hope's still burning through the night but you can't see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
Chin deep in the water you tried walking on  
And you reach for Him and you think He's gone  
He's still there beside you with His stubborn love  
No, He never left and He won't give up  
He will protect you until you're rescued  
Oh, there's nothing that He can't do  
'Cause He believes in you when you're at your weakest  
And hope's still burning through the night but you can't see it  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But in those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
You know in your heart He loves you  
But at those moments when you can't believe it's true  
He believes in you  
He believes in you, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  
He believes, He believes, He believes in you  

Waiting for that other shoe to drop  
And you swear this world's gonna come to a stop  
Drowning on dry land a can't come up for air  
Your knees are so weak and you look at that mountain  
Say there's no way over and no way around it  
And it feels like you're so far from home  
Even God's not there  
But  
  
Oh but every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul that's crying  
He can see yeah you're in His reach  
If He can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then what's all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe He holds everything  
  
When it's late at night and you're staring at the stack of bills  
It don't add up and you don't know how it will  
Clinging to your mother's faith with a half-hearted prayer  
But you still don't know  
When the anchor man breaks in on your TV  
And says these times they won't be easy  
And fear sets in and you wanna give in  
Just let it go  
Oh let it go  
  
Every single sparrow flying  
And every broken soul that's crying  
He can see yeah you're in His reach  
If he can hold an ocean back with one little shore  
Then what's all this worry and doubting for  
Oh I believe, yeah I believe He holds everything, he holds everything

A quiet conversation  
A solitary prayer  
Listening in the silence  
and knowing You are there  
Emptying my troubled heart  
My secret hopes and fears  
You speak to me in whispered words  
That the heart alone can hear  
  
[Chorus]  
I love You so  
Won't let You go  
Hold on to me  
  
I could never offer You  
the praise that You deserve  
The thanks for all You've given me  
and with nothing in return  
But I will give my life to you  
My moments and my days  
If only for the peace I find  
Every time I hear You say . . .  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep me near this day  
Never let me stray  
From Your everlasting, sweet embrace  
Hold on  
Hold on to me  
  
Another conversation  
Another quiet plea  
Stumbling for a way to say  
How much You mean to me  
and once again You give me more  
Than I can give to You  
So I'll just say these simple words  
'Cause it's all I know to do  
  
[Chorus]

Oh you can see it when you close your eyes  
A Norman Rockwell painting come to life  
With all the colors of a stained-glass window  
All the characters and old dogs and kin folk  
  
And it smells like bar-b-que and old garden roses  
Yells like cheerleaders and football coaches  
And it walks like a mayor and it dances like a prom  
And it sleeps like a porch and it cooks like your mama  
  
Hometown, hometown  
May be the sweetest word with the sweetest sound  
Hometown  
  
And it's growing like tomatoes on the vine  
Fading like a Dr. Pepper sign  
Still preaching like a Pentecostal  
And fishing like a backslider  
And pulling little sisters in bright red radio flyers  
  
And it marches in the veteran's day parade  
And it proudly lets old glory wave  
  
It's rodeos and county fairs  
All farris wheels and canned up pears  
It'll let you go just to welcome you back  
No it don't get no better than that  
  
Our hometown, yeah your hometown, hey our hometown, your hometown  
  
Oh you can see it when you close your eyes

Starlight falling on the snow  
Fire glows within  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
  
There is holly 'round the doorway  
There is cider on the stove  
And the sound of Psalm will fill the air  
As the family gathers close  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Praises to the infant King  
Hope is born again  
  
Through the frost upon the window  
See the stocking on the  
Where the light reflects the cheerfulness  
That's growing in our hearts  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Praises to the infant King  
Hope is born again  
  
And the hope of that first Christmas  
The day that heaven came to Earth  
Now it comes again and fills our heart  
As we celebrate his birth  
  
Starlight falling on the snow  
Fire glows within  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
Hope is born again

Wake up to the sunlight with your windows open  
Don't hold in your anger or leave things unspoken  
Wear your red dress use your good dishes  
Make a big mess and make lots of wishes  
Have what you want, but want what you have  
And don't spend you life looking back  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
So go to the ballgames and go to the ballet  
And go see your folks more than just on the holidays  
Kiss all your children Dance with your wife  
Tell your husband you love him every night  
Don't run from the truth cause you can't get away  
Oh no  
Just face it and you'll be ok  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
Where ever you are and wherever you've been  
Now is a time to begin  
  
So give to the needy and Pray for the grieving  
Even when you don't think that you can  
Cause all that you do is bound to come back to you  
So think of your fellow man  
And make peace with God and Make peace with yourself  
Oh yeah  
Cause in the end there's nobody else  
  
Turn up the music Turn it up Loud  
Take a few chances Let it all out  
Because you won't regret it  
Looking back from where you have been  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live  
  
Because it's not who you knew and it's not what you did  
It's how you Live

All our mind's attention  
All our hearts affection  
Every heart-cry, every rhyme  
Everybody's worshipping something  
All our life's devotion  
Has been set in motion  
Religions dozen for a dime  
Everybody's worshipping something  
'Cause that's what we were made to do  
  
[Chorus]  
And I choose You  
All my attention, affection  
And all my devotion's for You  
If everybody's worshipping something  
I choose You  
You are beyond conception  
Defying definition  
And You knew me before time  
Centuries of pagans  
Idols fill the nations  
But You are Lord to me and mine  
Everybody's worshipping something  
'Cause that's what we were made to do...oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Before I chose You, You first chose me  
I worship You, You alone are worthy  
You alone deserve it-all of my worship  
Lord I choose You

To hold me closer or set me free  
To trust completely or let it be  
You don't know my destiny  
You can't see what I can see  
  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
To love me truly or let me go  
In between I don't want to know  
  
This is how it has to be  
No more us and no more we  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
  
Once again, on the station  
See your face in a crowd  
Comes again the sensation  
You can't hear yourself think  
  
With their voices inside your head  
Hey, I wish I cared  
Hey, I wish I cared  
I wish I cared  
  
Yes I really do  
I wish I cared  
(Hey) I wish I cared  
Yes I really do  
  
I wish I cared  
(Hey) I wish I cared  
I wish I cared  
(Hey

When I'm walking the straight and narrow  
Sometimes life throws a little curve  
If I slip on the stones beneath me  
Will I lose my nerve?  
Looking up when I've hit the bottom  
Giving thanks that the motion's stopped  
I still have a rock to hold to  
If the bottom drops  
Out here on my own  
I won't be alone  
I'll keep believing You  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh I'll be believing You  
I'll be believing  
I will be believing  
Oh I'll be believing You  
  
If I find all my hopes are hollow  
Even if all my wells run dry  
If I'm left here with next to nothing  
And I don't know why  
I'm here on my own  
I won't be alone  
I'll keep believing You  
  
[Chorus 3X]

Words and music by connie harrington  
Speak a little softer so I can hear you  
Above the noise, the noise, the noise in this world, yeah  
You don't have to shout it for hearts to listen  
Just be a still, small voice, and let the truth be heard  
(chorus)  
That jesus is  
The way, the truth he is the light  
For me, for you, for the world tonight  
Our hope, the meaning of this life  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Everybody's looking, but how will they find it  
The road to happiness unless they're told  
That love is the answer to the ultimate question  
But how will they understand unless they know  
(chorus)  
The way, the truth, he is the light  
For me, for you, for the world tonight  
Our hope, the meaning of this life  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is, jesus is  
Jesus is  

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun.  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square  
In the frosty air.  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock.

Joy to the world! The Lord is come:  
Let earth receive her King.  
Let every heart prepare Him room,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.  
He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders, wonders of His love.

I've tried everything I know  
Just to earn a piece of mercy for my soul  
Despite my strain  
Guilty I remained  
Then I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation You've erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified  
You gave hope a place to stand  
Paying all the cost Your holiness demands  
Free from all  
All that I deserve  
I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation You've erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified  
Freedom from my darkest hours  
Freedom to be in the light  
Freedom I am blameless in Your sight  
I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation You've erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified

You think you're alone there in your silent storm  
But i've seen the tears you've cried falling down and trying to drown  
The flame of hope inside  
Let me tell you now, tell you now  
  
(chorus)  
When you're walking in the dead of night  
And your soul is churning  
When your hope seems out of sight  
Keep the candle burning  
All it takes is one steady heart in a world that's turning  
Shine a light and pierce the dark  
Keep the candle burning  
Keep the candle burning  
  
When you're down and you're discouraged  
When the darkness clouds your view  
You've got to gather up your courage  
You know the lord is gonna see you through  
Let me tell you now  
Tell you now  
  
(repeat chorus)  
One ray of light always breaks through  
Follow wherever he takes you  
Wherever he takes you

Spinning around on the tops of his feet  
Smiles of the angels could not be so sweet  
Wide blue eyes  
And picky-tails swirl  
She's her daddys' girl  
'Cause he knows the jokes that always make her laugh  
He takes her for ice cream instead of her nap  
At the end of the day by the light of the moon  
They turn up the music and there in the room  
  
And she yells  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
  
It's funny how life moves in circles at times  
To think not so long ago that fase was mine  
Houses get smaller we take different names  
But some things in life stay the same  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
  
'Cause some day she'll go off and find a life of her own  
Marry a good man  
And make a happy home  
Until she comes back and sees with those same eyes  
What time can not diskise  
  
She walks through the door with that look on her face  
Cause daddys' brown hair has all turned to gray  
They talk for hours they cry and they laugh  
Watchin' old movies and thinkin' back  
And just as she turns to go  
She says, "hey dad, how bout 1 for the road"  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch DOWN!  
  
"Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
Oh no there's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!"  
King of the world  
  
Spinning around on the tops of his feet  
Smiles of the angels could not be so sweet.

Words and music by brent wilson  
  
If a picture's worth a thousand words  
What are they?  
And since you're spirit intercedes for me  
What do you hear when I pray?  
'cause I'm finding it hard to find the word  
To let you know how my heart can hurt  
So I'll sing the tune  
And let you fill in the words  
  
(chorus)  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la...  
  
It's comforting to know  
My words aren't all you hear  
I can talk to you with laughter  
And I can talk to you in tears  
And I don't have to know just what to say  
For you to hear me when I pray  
So I'll sing a part and let you read my heart  
  
(repeat chorus)

It was not a silent night  
There was blood on the ground  
You could hear a woman cry  
In the alleyways that night  
On the streets of David's town  
  
And the stable was not clean  
And the cobblestones were cold  
And little Mary full of grace  
With the tears upon her face  
Had no mother's hand to hold  
  
It was a labor of pain  
It was a cold sky above  
But for the girl on the ground in the dark  
With every beat of her beautiful heart  
It was a labor of love  
  
Noble Joseph at her side  
Callused hands and weary eyes  
There were no midwives to be found  
On the streets of David's town  
In the middle of the night  
  
So he held her and he prayed  
Shafts of moonlight on his face  
For the baby in her womb  
He was the maker of the moon  
He was the author of the faith  
That could make the mountains move  
  
It was a labor of pain  
It was a cold sky above  
But for the girl on the ground in the dark  
With every beat of her beautiful heart  
It was a labor of love  
  
For little Mary full of grace  
With the tears upon her face  
It was a labor of love  
  
It was not a silent night  
On the streets of David's town

Star of wonder, star of might  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light  
  
From the beginning the Father  
Had a magnificent plan  
Revealed through the law and the prophets  
To fulfill the redemption of man  
  
You spoke after centuries of silence  
In the midst of a still, starry night  
And Emmanuel came down among us  
And the Father said, 'Let there be light'  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
People who walked in great darkness  
Gathered from near and afar  
Shepherds with flocks in their keeping  
Three kings who follow a star  
  
Together the poor and the richest  
Witness that Bethlehem night  
And the sky full of Angels announcing  
The birth of a glorious light  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
We who are His have this calling  
To praise Him and make His name known  
So one day the presence of Jesus  
Shines in every heart and every home  
(Shines in our home)  
(Star of wonder, star of beauty bright)  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light

Light of the world, shine down on Bethlehem  
God in His glory has sent us a Son  
Shout from on high, out in the street  
Jesus, our Savior is born  
Bright shining star, shine down on everyone  
God in His mercy has sent us a Son  
The shepherds will cry, praise to the Lord  
Jesus, our Savior is born  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Jesus, our Savior is born  
Sing Alleluia  
Light of the world, shine down on Bethlehem  
God in His glory has sent us a Son  
Shout from on high and out in the street  
Jesus, our Savior  
No, don't you know He's born  
Don't you know  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Jesus, our Savior is born  
Sing Alleluia  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Alleluia, baby Jesus  
Jesus, our Savior is born  
Sing Alleluia  
Joy to the world  

Come they told me

Our finest gifts we bring

To lay before the King

So to honor Him

When we come.  
  
Little Baby  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I have no gift to bring  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
That's fit to give our King  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Shall I play for you!  
Pa rum pum pum  
On my drum.  
  
Mary nodded  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
The ox and lamb kept time  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I played my drum for Him  
Pa rum pum pum  
I played my best for Him  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Then He smiled at me  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Me and my drum.

Written by Scott Krippayne, John Lemonis, Tony Wood  
A simple offering is all that we bring  
We give our lives, claim You as King  
We are Your servants and before You we bow  
With every breath we make this vow  
Chorus  
We will live to worship, give You praise  
With all our hearts for all our days  
Father we want to do what You created us to  
We will live to worship You  
Our every moment is a gift of Your grace  
We are all Yours, now and always  
More than just words, oh Lord, the cry of our hearts  
Is to let our lives speak of how great You are  
Chorus  
You are worthy, You are holy  
You alone are deserving  
You are holy, You are worthy  
You alone are deserving  
Chorus  
  

Here I go again it's another messy morning  
Walk around the clothes that are covering the floor and  
Take my kiss and coffee to go  
Then put on my mascara while I'm driving down the road  
I thought that I could do it all  
Turns out I was crazy  
Man I need an iPhone and a cleaning lady  
We haven't had a date night in what seems like forever  
It might take a miracle to get myself together  
  
Oh I wish that there were more than  
24 hours in a day  
I haven't found it yet but there's gotta be a way  
And I keep praying that  
I can get everything done  
And still have time for love  
And a load of laundry  
  
I'd sure like to relax laying in a bubble bath  
But then I'd have to clean the tub and really who's got time for that  
There goes my day dream I'm just wishful thinking  
Oh shoot I'm running late, I gotta make it to a meeting  
  
I've been waiting for this moment all day, just you and me  
The lights are low, next thing I know  
We're both drifting off to sleep

On your own,  
All alone and crying  
A wounded soul on an island in the blue  
Love's required  
But you're too tired from trying  
Don't Give Up  
There's love enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
There's love enough for a broken heart  
Love enough for another start  
Love enough in the Father's arms for you  
When it feels like the tears won't end  
When loneliness is your only friend  
There's love enough  
Love enough for you  
On His own  
Allone and dying  
He gave up everything for me and you  
Hear your heart  
It's time to start relying  
On the one who had love enough for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Like a cup that's running over  
Like a well that won't run dry  
From the storm a constant cover  
For a heart, the sole supply  
Chorus (2X)  
Love enough for you  
Love enough, love enough  
Love enough for me  
Love enough for you

Who would've known  
This heart would stumble on someone  
As great as you  
Out of the blue  
  
Who would've guessed  
That I would fall so deep  
In a hope as true  
As the one I found in You  
  
Heaven's hands  
Lead me to faith's open door  
I'm surrounded by a grace  
This soul just can't ignore  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord, I'm Living in a love like not other  
Lost in mercy like I've never known  
Lord, I'm trusting in a love like no other  
To lead me on  
  
Who would've cared  
Enough to reach beyond my thin disguise  
To heal my life  
Who would've dared  
  
To wear the shame I carried deep inside  
To be my sacrifice  
Saving me  
From myself in the nick of time  
  
Forgiveness found  
It's way into this heart of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unconditionally  
You embrace all that I am  
It's beyond all reason  
It's a love I'll never understand  
  
[Chorus]

Hey, I can see all your dreams  
Lying scattered in your fragile heart  
You think your world's come apart  
But hey, I believe there's gonna be  
  
A brighter day that shines for you my friend  
It's waiting around the bend  
You've been dancing on the wire  
Walking through the fire  
  
Thinking you're all alone  
But you're not on your owe  
There's a faithful hand to guide you  
God always be beside you  
  
All because he is love  
And love won't leave you now  
So fly, on the wings of your dreams  
To the place he is taking you  
  
You're gonna make it through  
And, if you doubt. Just think about  
All the promises that he has made  
You don't have to be afraid  
  
Through the smiles, through the sorrow  
He was faithful yesterday, and he'll be faithful tomorrow.

Well we walk, down the road, everyday  
With a plastic smile and we wave like we're in a parade  
Oooh and then we pass one another  
With a nothing but a "how do you do"  
Oh but it would make me smile  
If we'd stop for awhile  
And just give me the truth now  
We can make it real  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it real  
Look in my eyes  
You feel it inside  
Yea you know you will  
We can make it real now now  
We can make it  
Let your mind take a walk in the rain  
Let your head roll back, taste the joy, remember the pain  
'Cause we can talk about the weather  
We can weather it together my friend  
Yes we can  
And the sun will shine on your heart and mine  
We will feel it again and again and again  
Chorus  
This life that we're liven  
It's all that we're given  
There's so little precious time  
Cause now it's the moment  
Let your emotions breathe in the open sky  
Fly  
We can make it real now  
We can try to make it real  
Oh yea  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it real  
Look in my eyes  
You'll feel it inside  
Yea you know you will  
Open your heart  
'Cause that's when you start  
To truly feel  
We can make it  
We can make it real  
Yea you know we can  
We can make it real  
Yea

[Chorus]  
My heart is set on You  
Oh, my heart is set on You  
No other love will do  
Oh, my heart is set on You  
  
I'm placing my life safely in Your keeping  
Knowing Your love is here to stay  
I'm holding on to You no matter what I'm feeling  
Ever always  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I'm alone, I know Your there beside me  
Feeding me on for all days  
Wherever I go I know Your hand will guide me  
Ever always  
  
Nothing else will do Your love is better  
My hearts set on You forever and ever  
Nothing else will do 'cause Your love is better  
My heart's set on You forever and ever  
  
[Chorus]

Do you hear what I hear  
On this Christmas day  
Echoes from a stable long ago  
Word of God, now bundled  
In a manger lined with hay  
Baby with a message, born to grow  
  
Hear the sound  
Of chains now broken  
Love came down  
God has spoken  
Songs of hope  
Ringing through the sky  
On this not so silent night  
  
Oh, to be an angel  
On a midnight clear  
Joining in a chorus of unending joy  
Tell it on the mountain  
  
Heaven has drawn near  
Hand of God with fingers of a baby boy  
  
Hear the bells  
Resound with glory  
Hear them tell  
The age-old story  
Songs of hope  
Ringing through the sky  
On this not so silent night  
  
Voice of God  
In a newborn cry  
A Father calls  
Through a gift of life

O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
'Til He appeared in and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O night, o night divine  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
  
Christ is the Lord  
O, praise His name forever  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angel voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine  
O Holy night  
O night divine

Kings of earth on a course unknown  
Bearing gifts from afar  
Hoping, praying  
Following yonder star  
  
Silhouette of a caravan  
Painted against the sky  
Wise men searching  
For the Holy Child  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
A star hangs over Bethlehem  
A journey ends in the night  
Three kings trembling  
Behold the glorious sight  
  
Heaven's treasure Emmanuel  
Drawing men to bow down  
Tiny baby born to wear a crown  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satans power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh Tiny Baby born to wear a crown  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
One king held the purest gold  
One king held the hope of the world

I see people merely existing  
I see vacant eyes full of pain  
Lives broken and abused, yeah  
Hiding hearts scarred and stained  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
Could it be that I could make a difference?  
If I care the way You care for me  
When they look into my eyes  
Let it be Your eyes they see  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
Let me show them that You love them  
Won't You help me bring them in?  
Lord, I promise You again  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more crying soul, I'll go  
And I will love them, Jesus  
As long as there's one more needing You  
One more I can show Your love  
As long as there's one more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  
One more broken heart  

Earnestly I sought You, lovingly You found me  
Embraced me as Your child, now I'll never be the same  
No greater love than Yours, Lord, never known it before  
Only ever dreamed about this abundant love  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore  
How could I say thank You for joy and peace so beautiful?  
Father, friend, my Jesus, lover of my soul  
Savior of the world, I, I dance before Your throne  
Now all that is within me will rise to glorify  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore  
"Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
Singing, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to my awesome God  
Lift my voice unto my closest friend, I'll praise You to the end  
"Hallelujah, Hallelujah" to the faithful one  
Raise my hands in honor of You, Lord, I'll praise forevermore

Hey now you know it's true  
After all that we've been through  
You can count on me  
When it comes down to the end  
I will always be your friend  
No matter where you go  
I want you to know now  
  
Chorus  
I promise my prayers  
I promise my heart  
I'll be thinking of you  
Wherever you are  
When the daylight is done  
When the night is so dark  
When I cannot be there  
I promise my prayers  
  
Down each road we take  
We're joined together when we pray  
No matter where life leads  
I will lift you up  
You'll be covered by his love  
The angels will find you  
I'm here to remind you now  
  
Chorus  
I'll cover, I'll cover you, I'll cover  
  
Beyond our understanding  
His hand is moving and we stand amazed  
I pray His love will guide you  
I know He's there beside you always  
  
Chorus

Showers of sadness flood my soul  
In the dryness of my pain  
I watch for the rainbow  
When my heart turns gray  
As I long for yesterday  
I know that I need you  
In the time that I stray  
So I'll follow like night after day  
  
(Chorus)  
I need you to rain down on me please pour down your light  
For this is my life-line  
I need you to rain down on me  
The weather is fine when you rain on me  
The weather is fine when you rain on me  
  
The power of gladness takes control  
When it's streaming from Your face  
You vanish my sorrow  
You wash it away  
Like the sunlight in the rain  
I know that I need You  
In the time that I stray  
So I'll follow like night after day  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Holy water falls as I lift my eyes  
From my own fate  
Then heaven flows straight through my  
heart as it carries your embrace  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
The weather is fine when you rain on me

We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
In this world full of compromise and sin  
We must stand for Him  
Even when it tries to pull us in  
We must fight to win  
We gotta fix our eyes on our goal  
To love our God with all our soul  
This message of hope, it must be told  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
The world is searching for something that will last  
We've gotta help them fast  
We must be so faithful to the task  
For the time has passed  
On our knees, we've gotta run the race  
Following Jesus at His pace (at His pace)  
Share the story of His grace  
We're the children of the King  
We're gonna say so, say so  
We're not ashamed to see  
We're gonna say so, say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
Jesus Christ is our Lord, He's the one we adore  
We're gonna say so, don't say no, but say so  
Say so, don't say no, but say so  
  

When you feel down and out  
Sing a song, it'll make your day

Mitchell parish, leroy anderson 1948  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling "yoo hoo,"  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're gliding along with a song  
Of a wintry fairy land.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
There's a birthday party  
At the home of farmer gray  
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop,  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy,  
When they pass around the chocolate  
And the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By currier and ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives!  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling "yoo hoo,"  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're gliding along with a song  
Of a wintry fairy land.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.

We've got something so good  
We're gonna show you  
It makes me happy  
Always makes me feel free  
When I'm in His hands  
Do you understand  
Not trying to sell you  
I'm only trying to tell you  
That His love is for real  
It's there for you to feel  
There is no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
We've got something so good  
We're gonna show you  
Stand in His light you'll see  
It's gonna shine through  
  
Open you heart it's real  
And waiting for you  
We've got something so good  
All through the highs and lows  
The only thing you need to know  
Is that Jesus will be true  
He's there to comfort you  
You're not the only one  
Who feels like everything you've done  
Is measured in pain  
Come in from the rain  
There's no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A love we can give  
A love we can share  
A love that is more than money can buy  
I believe  
That He'll  
Set you free

Three men and a star in the sky  
Oh what I would give for a wisdom so bright  
One girl with a journey to make  
Oh how I wish I was that brave  
  
Fearless, shameless, faith through the dark  
How I wish I was as strong as they are  
  
You say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I?m your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
  
A child far away born in the night  
Too young to know what is meant for his life  
But he'll grow and he'll love more than anyone can  
And the world's gonna see a light where he stands  
  
He'll say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I'm your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
  
Christmas Eve, all I see  
Is snow on the trees  
And it's white and it glows  
That's how I want to be  
  
And You say come to me wait no more  
I give you all you're asking for  
Forget the lies this world has told  
I'll wrap your life in linen gold  
I'm more than just only  
One night that's holy  
I'm your star and I'm your wish  
Cause I am both the giver and the gift  
The giver and the gift

I'm trying to shave my legs  
Ups at the door  
The kids are clownin' on the bed  
The door is scratchin' up the floor  
Yeah - Everybody here's just a little crazy  
In our hoop jumping, good-lovin' Big Top, baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooo hoo welcome to the party  
Ooo hoo we're just getting started  
Take a front row seat  
Or the back if you prefer  
'Cause to me this three ring  
Is the greatest show on earth  
Ooo hoo  
Ooo hoo  
  
Oh the baby's on my hip and the noodles are boiling over  
Little Tommy just brought me a four leaf clover  
I'm spinnin' plates 'cause dinner's late and the phone keeps ringing  
So I turn the radio up 'cause I feel like singing  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
There's toys in the yard and the house needs paintin'  
And I'm pretty sure the neighbors all hate us  
But the view sure looks nice from the front porch swing  
I wouldn't trade it for anything, for anything  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Welcome to the party, oh welcome to the party, welcome to the party  
We're just getting started

When you're living for the love of  
A lifetime  
You wonder if the waiting will ever end  
And the right from the wrong  
That you've guarded so long  
Is closer that it's ever been  
But sometimes a moment of weakness  
Can sacrifice the treasure of time  
And cause you to miss the miracle  
That god longs for you to find  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a love he has for you  
There's a heart that he's been saving  
There's a joy beyond all measure  
That only comes from waiting  
There's a love he has for you  
It's more than the hope you're holding to  
And you will find the only love that's true  
Is the love he has for you  
  
When you're torn between today  
And tomorrow  
And holding out for something you  
Cannot see  
There's a strength you can find  
Knowing in god's own time  
You'll discover what he meant to be  
'Cause love like the father intended  
Is more than just a state of the heart  
So don't give up hope in the holding on  
'Cause no matter who you are  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
How long (how long)  
How wide (how wide)  
Is the love of Christ  
How deep (how deep)  
How high (how high)  
Is the love of Christ  
  
It would take ten thousand lifetimes  
To comprehend, a love with no beginning  
A love that knows no end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
More than any heart could measure or ever hold  
His love could fill the oceans  
'Til they overflowed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Higher than the mountains  
Deeper than the ocean  
Farther than the reach of the sky  
Wider than the heavens  
Longer than forever  
Greater is the love of Christ  
  
[Chorus]

God's passion is an endless river  
White water running wild  
In a restless rushing fury  
To see souls reconciled.  
It reaches wide across forever  
It's dangerous and deep  
And while some venture to the shoreline  
Some even dare to leap  
Chorus:  
And The River rages, The River runs  
All through the ages, Long after I'm gone  
There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore  
Whether I dive in or stand on the shore  
The River keeps rushing on.  
All of those who ride the rapids  
Have a message they must tell  
There's a joy in being lost in something  
That's bigger than yourself  
And though the current takes you places  
Where you learn to lose control  
If you think you're going under  
He'll never let you go, never let you go  
Chorus  

Can you hear the song moving on the wind  
Calling us home, drawing us in  
It's a wave of love that's melting all resistance  
Can you feel it, when it starts  
It's within the reach of our hearts  
It'll change the world around us if we listen  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
(chorus)  
The song is alive  
Stirring hope in the soul, don't you know  
It's the heartbeat of life  
Moving us with a love  
That's never ever ever gonna die  
The song is alive  
  
It's pushing down walls, driving out doubt  
No power on earth's gonna drown it out  
And in the middle of the night his voice will lead us  
And the music plays on  
When we start to sing the song  
No nothing's gonna stop the faithful love of jesus  
It's the living, breathing message  
Of the mercy of our god  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Welling up in us, a love beyond compare  
Spilling from the lips of the believers everywhere  
  
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know  
The song is alive  
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
It's pushing down walls, it's driving out doubt  
Don't you know

What do you say to someone who feels like they've lost it all  
Over the edge with no one there to break their fall  
And what do you say to someone who feels so unloved  
Giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough  
And what do you say to a hopeless soul who can't remember their way home  
And everything is out of their control  
  
Chorus:  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
What do you say to someone whose life is on the line  
And they're unsure what happens after their last breath in time  
What do you say to someone whose built a wall you can't break through  
And it's so hard for them to hear the truth  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.  
  
So don't lose hope, don't let go  
Don't give up, you are not alone  
  
There is no valley, there is no darkness  
There is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus.  
There is no moment, there is no distance,  
There is no heartbreak He can't take you through.  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
So before you think that you're too lost to save,  
Remember there is nothing greater than grace.

Chorus  
Trust, trust in the Lord  
Lean not on your own understanding  
In all, all of your ways  
Acknowledge Him  
He'll make your path straight  
  
You'll be my guide for life  
I'll walk by Your side  
With Your hand in mine  
I'll go where You lead me  
  
Chorus  
  
My eyes can only see  
The ground beneath my feet  
Your dreams are greater  
Your ways are higher  
O Lord please show me  
  
Chorus  
  
Bless my thoughts  
My dreams my imaginations  
Step by step  
Your delight, Your creation  
  
Chorus

Hearts of hope seem hard to find these days  
As darker deeds have their time on center stage  
We watch it all unfolding scene by scene  
And a happy ending seems a fading dream  
Fear and desperation have their day  
At least until faith steps up to say  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
But love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
It?s your life, as it plays out don't forget it  
Heartache comes but the stories not done yet  
Oh, when shadows come, your courage wants to fade  
Oh but in a moment, everything can change  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
there's always more to any story  
Than just what's here and now  
There's not one hopeless situation  
That can't be turned around  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things, oh  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  

Last night I hit rock bottom, finally saw right through myself  
Wasn't long 'till I called mamma, I wouldn't wanna call no one else  
And I knew exactly what she'd say  
But I wanted to hear it anyway she said  
  
What about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
'Cause it's a long road, if you're walking it alone  
Without Jesus, Jesus  
  
We said goodbye and I went out driving  
Running like I always do  
Until I found that lonely back road  
That wooden cross where I lost you  
And I swore I'd never pray again  
But mama's words were running through my head  
  
I've asked so many questions  
Since my world came crashing down  
But the one that really matters  
Just keeps on ringing out, over every doubt  
  
What about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
Oh, what about Jesus? What about Jesus?  
He's the answer you've been searching for  
'Cause it's a long road, when you're walking it alone  
Without Jesus, Jesus  
  
Opened up my grandma's Bible that she gave to me when I turned 16

What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  
Haste, haste to bring him laud,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,  
Come peasant king to own Him,  
The King of kings, salvation brings,  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  
  
Raise, raise the song on high,  
The Virgin sings her lullaby:  
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

Now and then I must admit  
I hide behind my shallowness  
I must confess I don't begin to say enough  
I'll tell you of my lessons learned  
But I may never quite express  
  
That God blessed me far beyond  
What I deserve  
I often miss the chance to show my  
Faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me  
  
[Chorus:]  
What's He gonna say about me  
When He weighs the works that  
I have done  
Against the words that I have  
Failed to speak  
What's He gonna say about me  
When the chaff is sifted from the wheat  
Will there be evidence that I believed  
What's He gonna say about me  
  
After this lifetime will come  
The thankfulness that I forget  
I will regret when I see clearly who He is  
Then I'll know all I should have said  
So I must choose to not neglect  
But resurrect the praise for all He is to me  
I often miss the chance to show my faith in Him  
By failing to convey what I have seen  
And then I wonder while I face eternity  
How Jesus ever finds a way to intercede  
For me, oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
If I confess Him before men  
He will confess me before the  
Father in heaven  
  
[Chorus:]

Close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believed  
The child was born, the star shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Christmas Eve, 2 a.m.  
Heavy snow is falling down  
And the streets clothed in white  
Echo songs that were sung by candlelight  
We're alive, we can breathe  
But do we really care for this world in need?  
There's a choice we must make each and every day  
So close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Ahh, oh yeah yeah  
Ahh, oh yeah yeah  
So Merry Christmas everyone and peace throughout the year  
The time has come to celebrate, so let your voices fill, the air  
Everyone, watch and pray that the sun will shine on a brighter day  
Join your hands, lift them high for this gift of life  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
When love came down, at Christmas time  
So close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
Close your eyes and share the dream  
Let everyone on earth believe  
The child was born, the stars shone bright  
And love came down at Christmas time  
And love came down at Christmas time  

I'm dreaming oh I'm dreaming  
I'm dreaming oh I'm dreaming  
I'm dreaming of a white christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow snow snow  
I'm dreaming of a white white christmas  
With every christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all all your christmases be white  
I'm dreaming of a white white christmas  
With every christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all all your christmases be white  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all all your christmases be white  
I'm dreaming oh I'm dreaming  
I'm dreaming oh I'm dreaming  
I'm dreaming I'm dreaming  
I'm dreaming I'm dreaming

She was the kind of girl that never quite fit in  
Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin  
Every time she saw those school doors open wide  
She'd wanna turn around and run back home and hide  
  
She got used to being stuck at the back of the line  
The kind that kept her head down  
Most of the time  
Secret dreams 'bout the boy in the high school band  
And wake up thinking  
She never had a chance  
  
She's a wildflower  
That's waitin' on a sunny day  
Waitin' on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
She's a wildflower  
  
She makes a wish on every single star she sees  
Yeah somewhere deep down she still believes  
She prays every night before she goes to bed  
Pretty soon her life is gonna change  
She just doesn't know it yet  
  
She's a wildflower  
That's waitin' on a sunny day  
Waitin' on the winds of change to blow  
Just a red hot spark that's looking for a little flame, yeah  
Trying to find the perfect place to grow  
Yeah she's trying to find a place  
She's a wildflower that's waiting on a sunny day  
She's the secret that nobody knows  
She's a wildflower, she's a wildflower, she's a wildflower

Words by robert sterling music by john mandeville  
Some think it all comes down to  
Fate and circumstance  
Life falls somewhere between  
Accident and chance  
Some seek solutions to the problems  
They face  
By hoping maybe someday, somehow  
It will all fall in place  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
(chorus)  
Without the love of jesus  
The stars wouldn't shine  
Rivers wouldn't run  
And hearts beat out of time  
Without the love of jesus  
Tell me where would we be?  
Lost on a lonely sea  
Without the love of jesus  
There's so much more to life than meets  
The naked eye  
It's no coincidence, no matter how we try  
When we try to deny what we  
Don't understand  
Maybe that's when we fail to see god's  
Providential hand  
We keep persisting  
Still something is missing  
(repeat chorus)  
It shouldn't take us a miracle  
Before we finally see  
That jesus' love is the only thing  
That we will ever need  
(repeat chorus)  

I woke up today with a revelation  
An introduction to the truth  
I knew the world was round  
What goes up comes down  
And maybe I  
Finally got it figured out  
Chorus  
A moment is worthless  
No meaning, purpose  
Every breath is just wasted  
If you are not the center of my world  
I'm just drifting, barely existing  
Every minute without you  
Is worthless  
You know the state of my condition  
And yet you hold me anyway  
So I won't take a step unless it's your direction  
Where was I  
Before I finally realized  
Chorus  
There's a void in my heart  
Where it's empty and dark  
Without You and Your love  
Lord, I'm broken apart  
I surrender my life  
To be right where You are

When the sun starts to rise and I open my eyes  
You are good, so good  
In the heat of the day with each stone that I lay  
You are good, so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I am grateful again  
When the moon rises high before each kiss goodnight  
You are good  
  
When the road starts to turn around each bend I've learned  
You are good, so good  
And when somebody's hand holds me up, helps me stand  
You are so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I'm grateful again  
Cause it's more than enough just to know I am loved  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You and what can I bring?  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King?  
So I'll sing You a love song it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
When it's dark and it's cold and I can't feel my soul  
You are still good  
When the world is gone gray and the rain's here to stay  
You are still good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I am grateful again  
And the storm may swell even then it is well  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You, what can I bring?  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King?  
I'll sing You this love song, it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
So I'll sing You a love song it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
You are holding my life in Your hands

You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
  
You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I get dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name
