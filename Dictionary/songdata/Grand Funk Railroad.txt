Aimless lady, is this your home town?  
Tell me baby, tell me where you're bound.  
When our eyes met, you were in the very first row.  
I couldn't even guess your name, but I just had to know.  
  
You were meant for me, would you grab your coat and flee?  
You were a mystery, but you just had to be  
An aimless lady.  
Aimless lady.  
Aimless lady.  
  
Should I try, and satisfy, you lady?  
Ain't no lie, now we'll get by, my baby.  
If you can stand, a real good man, now lady,  
Take my hand, and understand, me baby.  
  
Take your time, you're doing fine, now lady.  
You got yours, and I got mine, now baby.  
Can you see, the way to be, now lady.  
Stay with me, and set me free, now baby.  
  
Aimless lady.  
Aimless lady.  
Aimless lady.  
  
You're mine aimless lady.  
Yeah, aimless lady.  
You're mine aimless lady.  
Mine, aimless lady.  
Ooh

I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And I don't know why, but I'm startin' to cry.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And I can't figure out how I'm gonna' get by.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
I don't know why, I been down all season,  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
'cause there ain't no reason for the girl to be leavin' me.  
  
Chorus  
I don't know how I'll ever get by without you.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I'm startin' to realize my fate.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I'm ready to make up and give another try to live with you.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I hope for our love and us, it's not too late ... too late.  
Nobody, nobody.  
  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
Oh, and I don't really think that she'll ever come back.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
If she don't come back, I'll have a love attack.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And my tears are like rain, fallin' down on my face.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
'cause I know she's the girl that I'll never replace.  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus  

I got tarter on my teeth, but I don't care.  
I got dark brown stains, in my underwear.  
I'm a crumb and a bum, I'm a slouch and a louse.  
A crazy man who don't give a damn about his self.

I'm a man who don't give a damn 'bout who he is.

I can't tell ya' how to run your life,  
To get along with one another.  
Everybody knows what's wrong and what's right,  
But, you can't trust your own brother, yeah.  
  
Everybody wants to be your friend,  
All the chicks, they call you honey.  
But don't trust them 'till the very end,  
'cause all they're after is your money.  
  
All they want is all your money.  
All they're after is your money.  
... is your money.  
All they want is,  
All your money.  
All they want is ...  
  
Don't it scare ya',  
When they take such good care of ya',  
And all you've got is money?  
Before they fool ya',  
Please, let me school ya',  
All you've got is money.  
  
(various screams)  

If you find yourself looking for someone  
To make good the bad things that you've done  
Now do you think you're looking straight ahead  
And will you find the answer when you're dead  
  
Well then you should listen now to me  
And I'll tell you how I think it should be  
No one tells you why you're here to live  
And this is why it's you who must forgive  
  
No! You can't kill your brother  
No! Because you love each other  
No! You can't steal his pennies  
No! 'Cause you didn't leave him any  
  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
  
And if reason tells you not to live  
But you feel there's something left to give  
You can't leave this place until it's done  
So you'll see one more rising of the sun  
  
Sun  
Sun, you're just gonna see it one more time  
Sun, oh you can't get away from it  
Sun, you're gonna see it, oh just one more time, Oh

Are You Ready  
  
Are you ready? You can trust me all the way.  
Are you ready? Well, then let me hear you say  
That you're ready, and the world will know it's right.  
Yes, you're ready, and I know it's out of sight.  
  
Now you're ready, well, then what you waitin' for?  
If you're ready, you just open up your door  
'Cause I'm ready, for everything you got.  
Yes, I'm ready, come and get it while it's hot.

I'm in love with a girl that I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time  
To be in love, to be in love  
  
Well, let her be someone else's queen  
I don't want to know about it  
There's too many others that know what I mean  
And that's why I've got to live without it  
I'm in love with a girl I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
  
Well, the stories crawling back to me  
From my friends and the people that I want to see  
The things they say I know just couldn't be true  
At least not until I hear it from you  
'Cause I still the little girl, I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
  
You know that I love the little girl I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but it feels like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love

Life is too short now, to live it half way.  
I'm cryin' for my cousin, who died yesterday.  
He never had a chance, no, not to express his views.  
I swear that he's leaving it, to the rest of you.  
  
Oh he ...  
Chorus  
Lived his life of freedom, exactly the way that he wanted to.  
But there's always that one thing, we never do count on.  
You was born for it to happen to you ...  
  
... oooo-oooo, oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
  
He was on a motorcycle, in a side car.  
They was just outside of town, they hadn't ridden far.  
Out to have a good time, on a bike they built.  
How was they to know it, that night that he'd be killed.  
  
Oh he ...  
Chorus  
  
... oooo-oooo, oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
  
Oh he ...  
Chorus  
  
Yes he ...  
Chorus  
  
... oooo-oooo, oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  
Oooo-oooo  

Everybody's laughin' loud as it can be  
But please don't point your finger, especially not at me  
'Cause I'm not tryin' to be somebody, just do what I can  
But you just keep on laughin', call yourself a man  
I'm not lookin' for somebody to defend my case  
I've been scorned by more than one so stop this paper chase  
  
If you can't accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me, call yourself a man  
Tell me who you're foolin', is it not yourself?  
Go ahead be cool and, I'll just be myself  
And if you can't accept me just for what I am  
Go ahead reject me, call yourself a man

Other night, other night, other night.  
The dance they was doin' there, it was out of sight.  
Out-a-sight, out-a-sight, out-a-sight.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it.  
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it.  
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it.  
  
Well, first step: you got to move to the left.  
Second step: you got to go for yourself.  
Third step: well, you're doin' alright.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
  
Grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too.  
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro.  
The next thing you know, hey, you want to do it some more.  
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it.  
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it.  
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it.  
  
Yeah, first step: you got to move to the left.  
Second step: you got to go for yourself.  
Third step: well, you're doin' alright.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
  
You grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too.  
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro.  
You get out on the floor and start doin' it some more.  
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more.  
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it.  
Nothin

Time has come,  
To start my search for tomorrow.  
On and on,  
There's just no end to the sorrow.  
But I designed a way,  
To see my life through pity.  
I don't have too much to say,  
And the tears won't let me be.  
  
So,  
Chorus  
Carry me through the hard part.  
Help me find a new start.  
Carry me through the hard part.  
  
Far too long,  
I've thought of all the excuses.  
Try to go on,  
And stay my time to an end.  
Dreams in my head,  
All turning dark and useless.  
Help me find the hand,  
That knows where I've been.  
  
Please,  
Chorus  
  
Ahhhhhh ...  
Ahhhhhh ...  
  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me through ...  
Carry me, carry me, carry me ...  

Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
Though I'm feeling mighty sick  
  
I've been lost now for days uncounted  
And it's months since I've seen home  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Or am I all alone?  
  
If you return me to my home port  
I will kiss you Mother Earth  
Take me back now  
Take me back now  
To the port of my birth  
  
Am I in my cabin dreaming?  
Or are you really scheming  
To take my ship away from me?  
You'd better think about it  
I just can't live without it  
So please don't take my ship from me  
  
I can feel the hand of a stranger  
And it's tightening around my throat  
Heaven help me  
Heaven help me  
Take this stranger from my boat  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
Though I'm feeling mighty sick  
Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...  
  
I'm getting closer to my home  
I'm getting closer to my home  
I'm getting closer to my home

I was found after losing my way,  
Safe and sound after many a day.  
I was lost in a world of madness,  
Please take me from all of this sadness.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Comfort me, in whatever I do.  
Comfort me, and I'll comfort you too.  
Follow me, 'cause I'm trying to love you.  
Can't figure out what's wrong with my head,  
I used to think I wish I was dead.  
You took me from all of that sorrow,  
My future's bright, I can't wait 'till tomorrow.  
  
There ain't nothin' to it, anyone can do it,  
It's easy when you're feelin' right.  
I know that I feel good, and I know that you should,  
Stop not doin' what you know is right.  
Don't know what it is that's causing this feeling,  
What ever it is I'm touching the ceiling.  
I won't let go of this beautiful sound,  
I once was lost but now I am found.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just don't want to be your friend, yeah.  
You can trust me 'till the very end, yeah.  
I know just what I'm talkin' about, yeah, yeah.  
I'm talkin' 'bout the love that you can't live without, no, no.

Goin' down that country road,  
Leavin' behind that heavy load.  
Gettin' away from the city life,  
Society causes too many fights.  
  
Chorus  
Down my country road.  
Down my country road, oh.  
Down my country road.  
Down my country road, road, road.  
  
Too much killin' and too many wars,  
Women and children must be shuttin' their doors.  
Protect your country and for this you must die,  
They take your life but they don't tell you why.  
  
Chorus  

Hey, everybody won't you lend me your ear,  
There's something to fear, it's here, and that's clear.  
Men gettin' rich off rapin' the land,  
I can't understand, why we don't take them in hand.  
  
Woah, oh ... Lord, I don't want to be their fool no more.  
I don't want to be their fool no more.  
Open eyes, but you're sleepin',  
You best wake up 'fore tomorrow comes creepin' in.  
'Fore tomorrow comes creepin' in.  
  
Feel that our lives are in the hands of fools,  
Loosin' their cool, it's us that they rule.  
Too many people sittin' dead on their ass,  
They ain't got no class, people, this time must pass.  
  
Woah, oh ... Lord, I don't want to be their fool no more.  
Hey ... I don't want to be their fool no more.  
Open eyes, but you're sleepin',  
You best wake up 'fore tomorrow comes creepin' in.  
'Fore tomorrow comes creepin' in.  
  
Woah, oh ... yeah, tomorrow comes creepin'.  
  
Oh ... hear me cryin' 'cause the people like me,  
That long to be free, are not actually.  
Please everybody won't you hear this song,  
Help a country that's wrong, to someday be strong.  
  
Woah, oh ... Lord, I don't want to be their fool no more.  
No! Lord, I don't want to be their fool no more.  
Open eyes, but you're sleepin',  
You best wake up 'fore tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
Creepin' ...  
  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.  
Tomorrow comes creepin'.

You win or lose a penny.  
What does it matter any.  
We all are gamblers just by livin'.  
  
You hold a hopeless token.  
Even though your heart is broken.  
'cause you've nothin' left for the love you're givin'.  
  
(chorus)  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire ... of love.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire ... of love.  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
  
You played your hand at poker.  
But do you understand this joker.  
Who shot down all your hopes and dreams.  
  
Why do they always hurt you.  
You think they won't but you know they're sure to.  
Can't trust a soul no more it seems.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
  
You caught your love red handed.  
Been stuck up like a bandit.  
Crossfire.  
  
Low down dirty underhanded.  
Just ain't right can't understand it.  
Crossfire.  
  
(chorus)  
  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  
Caught in the crossfire.  

Ohhh, people why don't you come in here and let me talk to you a while.  
That's right, step right up and listen to a concerned citizen speak his piece.  
  
I'll tell you a little something that my daddy told to me.  
My basic fundamentals if you want to be free.  
'cause son, there's somthing wrong internally.  
So, if you want your freedom son.  
Don't want your country to be overrun.  
You got to keep america number one.  
  
(chorus)  
My daddy told me "son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
That's what they tryin' to do.  
Son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
They're takin' your bill of rights away from you."  
My daddy said "son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
That's what they tryin' to do.  
Son, don't let 'em take your gun.  
Don't let 'em take your gun away from you."  
  
Ohhh, this year is our anniversary.  
Two hundred years, people we've been free.  
Won't be nobody takin' over our land.  
If everybody's brother's got a gun in his hand.  
I'm tellin' you we learned to fight for justice.  
We're willing to die for freedom.  
Hand in hand.  
You got to understand.  
We are american men.  
  
Said they want your gun.  
Said they want your gun.  
Send 'em on the run.  
Send 'em on the run.  
Hip-hurray for fun.  
Hip-hurray for fun.  
If they do we're done.  
If they do we're done.  
  
(chorus)  

Seems I got to have a change in scene,  
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams.  
Imprisoned by the way things used to be, yeah,  
Left here on my own or so it seems.  
I got to leave before I start to scream,  
'Cause somebody locked the door and took the key.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.  
Feelin' alright? I'm not feelin' too good myself.  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.  
  
Baby, you sure took me on one big ride,  
And, even now I sit and wonder why.  
Then, when I think of you, I start to cry,  
I know I can't get upset and I must keep dry.  
I got to stop believin' in all your lies,  
'Cause I got too much to do before I die.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.

Come on everybody, we're gonna' have a good time, yeah,  
Gimmie' all the love that's in ya', I'm gonna' give ya' mine.

I wrote the words of freedom,  
I've even sung the song.  
But freedom is for children,  
'cause they don't understand what's wrong.  
  
The children are so very lucky,  
'cause they're not old enough to know.  
Not old enough to realize,  
But they'll find out as they grow.  
  
The children are so very lucky,  
But, on the other hand, who's gonna' save the land?  
The children are so very lucky,  
But man's invention is gonna' be the prevention of their life.  
  
This song is nearly over,  
And so's the world and the day.  
There's something missin',  
But who will listen enough to do what it will take?  
  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  

Lover, let's get it straight.  
Somthin's passin' much too late,  
To discover on down the line,  
It's fallin' apart. I just might be gettin' ...  
  
Chorus  
O ... over you.  
I'm gettin' o ... over you.  
  
Oh, we really ...  
Oh, we really ... oh, we really tried,  
Oh, we really ...  
Had that look in our eye.  
Ain't it crazy ...  
That I let you go.  
I don't understand I just don't know. gettin' ...  
  
Chorus  
  
You, look with the love that surrounds me.  
Blue, darkest I've ever seen.  
We take the cost of the time going through changes.  
What's the loss gettin' over you. you!  
  
You, look with the love that surrounds me.  
Blue, darkest I've ever seen.  
We take the cost of the time going through changes.  
What's the loss gettin' over you.  
  
I'm gettin' over you.  
I'm gettin' over you.  
I'm gettin' over you.  
I'm gettin' over you.  

I've been in love for a short time.  
I had a little trouble makin' up my mind.  
Somthin' got in my way, babe.  
I find it really hard for me to say.  
I know that my head was hot, girl.

You gotta' take time for what you wanna' do,  
And if you had the chance I know you would too, baby.  
  
Are you gonna' meet me on the moon tonight?

Got This Thing On The Move  
  
Come on over to my side, it's where you want to' be.  
Come on over to joy ride, and let your morals be.  
Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul.  
You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good times roll.  
  
Let me taste your life. Let me fill your stream.  
Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream.  
Got this thing on the move, it's beginin'.  
Got a strange kind of feeling, under my skin.  
  
I hear my baby knockin', at my front door.  
She knows what I got, she wants some more.  
And when it's all over, I start to come down.  
Think of the restin' place, I'll leave the ground

I been gettin' lonely, too much these days.  
I been gettin' lonely, I guess I better get away.  
But where can I go that's real? life's a stage on a ferris wheel.  
And the actors are all fighting just to see who gets the lead in the play.  
  
Oh, no, no.  
I gotta' find me a better day.  
  
Talk about down, I feel so lonely.  
Talk about down, I'm startin to worry.  
Don't really want to be all alone. I can't get along with the chicks at home.  
The world just don't seem right, my head is spinnin', and I hate what's goin'
down.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
  
Oh, gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
You gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find, gotta' find,  
Gotta' find me a better day.  
Gotta' find, gotta' find,

She cooks good and she looks good, and she just can't do no wrong.

She sits up and she begs, and she even rolls over on her back.  
  
CHORUS  
Please don't tell me that's the way that it goes, 'cause I've tried hard and I

I ain't been playin' in your back yard, 'cause I got my baby and she loves me

Hey baby so now you're goin', is your mind relieved?  
Did you get what you wanted and have some fun playin' make believe?  
I have never lost so much pleasure, so it's hard to be nice.  
Hey baby feel my hand, ain't it cold as ice?  
  
Chorus  
'cause I fell for your love, when I was out of my mind.  
I fell for your love, and now you tell me it's time.  
To kiss it away, to stand here and say, good-bye.  
  
Can't you understand the way I live?  
Half a love is all that I can give.  
Lonely ladies and empty faces for a long long time.  
And you might be one baby when we meet again and I'll still try to make you
mine.  
  
Chorus  
  
I fell for your love when I was out of my mind.  
I fell for your love when love was so hard to find.  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me it's time,  
To give up my love when it's so damn hard to find.  
  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.  
I'm so lonely baby.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Them empty faces, all I wanted was you.  
Love is so hard to find.  
  
I gave you my heart and now you tell me it's time,  
Love is so hard to find.  
To stand and say good-bye.  
Love is so hard to find.  
Love is so hard to find.

Hey hey mama

You keep on talkin' to me  
'Till your face turns blue  
Well do you think I'm a young boy  
Yet to make up my mind?  
Well I'm just castin' all my toys  
I'm gonna leave what's behind me behind  
I'm gonna leave what's behind me behind  
I saw an old high school friend  
Just the other day  
He didn't ask me how I'd been  
He asked me how was my pay  
Now do you call this a friendship?  
Judging from what I said  
If you do I've a real tip  
Ain't nobody gonna know about my bread  
Ain't nobody gonna know about my bread, Yah yah yaaaaahhh...  
If you got somebody, that you can trust to the very end  
I said if you do I want to be like you  
'Cause you sure got a real good friend  
You sure got a real good friend  
Friend  
Friend

I'm sitting here lonely like a broken man.  
I serve my time doin' the best I can.  
Walls and bars they surround me.  
But, I don't want no sympathy.  
  
No baby, no baby,  
All I need is some tender lovin'.  
To keep me sane in this burning oven.  
And, when my time is up, you'll be my reefer.  
  
Life gets worse on God's green earth.  
Be my reefer, got to keep smokin' that thing.  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
I said now baby baby let me smoke it smoke it  
Makes me feel good feel good, yes, I feel good ah  
Yes, I feel alright feel alright yes, I feel alright feel alright  
Yes, I feel alright ah  
Oh  
  
Ice cold water is runnin' through my veins.  
They try and drag me back to work again.  
Pain and blisters on my mind and hands.  
I work all day making up burlap bags.  
  
The oats they're feeding me are driving me wild.  
I feel unhappy like a new born child.  
Now, when my time is up, you wait and see.  
These walls and bars won't keep that stuff from me.  
  
No, no, baby,  
Won't keep that stuff from me.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
  
I need you right now mama.  
I need you right now baby.  
Right by my side, honey.  
All night long.  
  
Make me feel alright  
Yes, all yes, all yes, all alright.  
  
You better come on up and get down with me.  
I'll make you feel real good, just you wait and see.  
  
Make me feel alright yes, I feel alright  
Yes, all yes, all yes, alright.

Life, this is an outrageous life,  
We're living in.  
We call this turmoil our life,  
Oh, and it's gettin' old coming over again.  
But we don't hear nobody,  
Say what they're after.  
And we don't hear nobody,  
Searching for answers.  
John kennedy died,  
They thought he had a solution.  
We want to know,  
What happened to the revolution.  
  
Did we all get hung up in life.  
And do we all know,  
Just where were going.  
Everything's wrong,  
So a change has got to be right (man, baby).  
  
Life, for all the rest of our life,  
Will we be wrapped up in strife.  
Or, are we gonna start it all over again.  
We want to have somebody,  
Come up with the answers.  
We want to be somebody,  
That know's what their after.  
We hope that everybody,  
Can hear what I'm sayin'.  
We know that we will,  
If we just keep on prayin'.  
  
Chorus  
Learning to share what were standing on.  
Learning to care 'cus it's been so long.  
No one so big that they have it all.  
We've got to give to the very small.  
  
Life, give me the rest of my life,  
I want to finish it right.  
So, I don't have to start all over again.  
Let's get together,  
For some satisfaction.  
Let's stand together,  
On a chain reaction.  
We need somebody,  
We could really depend on.  
Don't wait till tomorrow,  
'cause it just might be too long.  
  
Chorus

Oh, I'm gonna tell you a story 'bout a little boy.  
Oh, a sad little boy.  
I'm talkin' 'bout little johnny hooker.  
  
Little johnny hooker was a sissy on the street all his life --  
All his natural born life.  
Until his daddy took him aside and said,  
"son, now here's your switchblade knife boy."  
  
He said "get out in the street boy,  
Cut yourself some meat boy.  
Get out on your own side of the road,  
And lighten my load."  
  
Johnny made a mistake and took his knife down to school one day.  
Hey, yeah, yeah.  
And, when the bell rang for lunch.  
Freddie miller went and got in johnny's way boy.  
He took his knife from his pocket, pushed a button on the side.  
When he seen the queen steel,  
You ought to seen the light in freddy's eyes.  
  
Oh, yeah ...  
  
Little johnny hooker learned his lesson from the knife now you see,  
(yes he did.)  
Because for what he done to fred he spent some time in a penitentiary.  
It was a day in the courtroom, exhibit letter "a."  
When the jury seen the knife they put little johnny's ass away.  
  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Oh, little johnny boy.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Oh, little johnny boy.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
He was a young boy,  
He's thinkin' the rest of his life,  
For what he done with the knife.  
Talkin' 'bout jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Jooohhhnnny.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't.  
Jooohhhnnny.

A long, long time ago there lived an indian boy,  
When he came upon this earth he brought his family joy.  
A paranoid young brave was he, inside his frame was some misery,  
He heard the other warriors talking angrily 'bout the white man taking over
his country.  
  
Chorus  
What he didn't know, is that some day his ma would be crying.  
What he didn't know, is that some day his tribe would be dying.  
What he didn't know, is that some day his father'd be gone.  
What he didn't know, is that some day he'd be all alone.  
  
None of the stories in the schoolbooks said it, the truth is gone and they're
tryin' to forget it.  
The history books are all one-sided, the truth is gone and their trying to
hide it.  
Who had the land 'till we came around? the indian made his life from the
ground.  
And what about the boy that this story's about? where his tee-pee once stood
there now is a town.  
  
Chorus  
  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain.  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain.  
He was the loneliest rider on the plain.  

Loneliness cries deep from my soul,  
Keeps trying to tell me about the world growing so cold.  
Too many people trying to take from my earth,  
But we can't live without controlling our birth.  
  
Deep inside a voice cries out for you,  
It's not alone 'cause, people, I been cryin' too.  
If we don't stop what we all see is wrong,  
I guarantee you mankind won't live long.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a land, a glorius land,  
It's right here on earth.  
Understand what you can from the land,  
Your life is it's worth.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh.  
  
To face the problems that everyone's found,  
We must replace what we took out of the ground.  
Pray for your brother, let your soul find a way,  
Help one another, oh, please listen to what I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loneliness  
Oh, I can't get away from loneliness  
Yeah, loneliness oooo  
Loneliness  
Yeah, loneli- loneli- lo-neliness  
I just can't get away from loneli- loneliness  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness  
Can't get away from loneliness

Look at granny run, run, and grandpa runnin' close behind.  
Look at granny run, run, there's something on grand-daddy's mind.

You say that this is the end,  
And I feel the knife cut off my right hand.  
You may not care right now,  
But if it's over, it's done and I won't turn around.  
  
Love is dyin'.

Oh how I love you, I love you but I won't be back.

Mean mistreater, you make me cry,  
You lay around, and watch me die.  
Mean mistreater, can't you see I'm real?  
Are you satisfied, with the way you feel?  
  
I've tried hard to live without you, in so many ways.  
I just can't help myself from thinking of you, for the rest of my days.  
Heartache is at my door step, won't leave me alone.  
I just can't get used to it, now that I'm on my own.  
  
I know all about you, your childhood days,  
Your mom and dad, your pretty face.  
Mean mistreater, if you need me,  
I'm needin' you to set me free.  
  
Mmm

I'm sitting here sad and lonely.  
Thinkin' 'bout my one and only.  
I been sittin' here cryin' my eyes out.  
Feelin' sorry for myself 'cause I just don't know what it's all about.  
No, I just don't know.

Hey, Mr. limousine driver,  
Can I ask you a favor, please?  
Let her in my door and don't look back here no more,  
I know you can do it with ease.  
  
Although, we're on our way from the show,  
And you don't like to get off the track.  
Please, Mr. chauffeur, let's talk things over,  
'Cause she says she loves me and that's a fact.  
  
Can you hear what I'm sayin', it's not like I'm prayin',  
You know, because you've done it before.  
So, why make me wait, please don't hesitate,  
Just get back here, and let her in my door.  
  
Hey, Mr. limousine driver,  
I know you know where it's at.  
Too late will be later, you just read your evening paper,  
And don't worry 'bout what's goin' on in back.

Hey, Mr. limousine driver ...

Hey, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
You sure been lookin' good. Yeah.  
Said, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
You lookin' like you should. Mmmmm ...  
Until you took the bottle and turned it up,  
You didn't want to quit 'til you drank up all of that stuff.  
Now, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Now you don't look so good. No, noooo ...  
  
Ahhhhhhh ... oh.  
Mr. Pretty Boy ....  
  
Sitting in the parlour,  
You entertain your guests. Mmmmm ...  
Mr. Pretty Boy ....  
That's what you do the best. That's what you do.  
Until you told the butler to bring another round,  
And no one else was drinkin' but you went and sucked them all down.  
Now, Mr. Pretty Boy ...,  
Now you don't look so good. No ... you don't

Oh ... I got one thing to tell ya', then you make up your mind.  
It's what I been tryin' to tell ya', for a long, long time.  
We need each other, to live in peace and harmony.  
Don't need a whole lot to give, 'cause love is for free.  
  
I ... I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't tryin' to sell ya',  
No lies.  
  
Forget all of your troubles, for a minute or two.  
Just listen to what I'm sayin', 'cause I'm talkin' to you.  
We don't need no leader, to tell us just what's wrong.  
We need love in the country, so we can get strong.  
  
And, I ... oh, you know, I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't tryin' to sell ya',

When I was feeling 'bout sixteen, I never had no idea.  
Listen to me if you want to know what I mean, your expression will let me see.  
I never knew what I was looking for, I never had the time.  
And now that time has opened up my door, now I'm looking forward just to see
what, just what's mine.  
  
When I was feeling 'bout eighteen, it's then when I began to see.  
No matter how hard you push on the door, it won't open without the key.  
Opportunity only knocks once, if you shut it out it's a sin.  
And when something keeps right on poundin', then, my friend, you'd better let
it in.  
  
Now I feel just a little bit old and, sadness fills my brain.  
I can flash to future years and nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.

Paranoid  
  
Did you ever have that feeling in your life, that someone was watching you?  
He don't have no reason, that's right. But, still he's there watching you.  
Someone is waiting just outside the door, to take you away.  
Everybody knows just what he's there for, to take you away.  
  
But, you don't know why he's been waiting.  
But, you don't know why he's been waiting.  
Spent too much time anticipating.  
Spent too much time anticipating.  
  
Did you ever think it could be you, that's just outside the door?  
There's just one way to find out if it's true. So, what you waiting for?  
Oh, get yourself together now, my friend, and step outside the pad.  
If there's no one waiting for you there, my friend, I think you should be
glad.  
  
But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?  
But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?  
Get back inside your wall, and shut the door.  
Get back inside your wall, and shut the door.  
  
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody,  
You're better off by yourself.  
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad, and say you're bad,  
You're better off by yourself.  
  
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody,  
You're better off by yourself.  
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad, and say you're bad,  
You're better off by yourself.  
  
Ahhhhh ...

Pass It Around  
  
I wish I had a place to stay in L.A. for a week or so.  
I feel like bein' jive, hangin' out, maybe go to Mexico.  
'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way I want to' be.  
Just want to' sit in a tree, sail out to sea, live like some fantasy, ahh

'Cause I'm tired of thinkin', and too much drinkin', all my troubles away.  
Tired of goin' to get laid at the lost and found.  
Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,  
In view of all that's been goin' down,  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.  
  
I wonder why I'm doin', what I've been doin' for a while.  
Can't say it's the money, no, so maybe it's the style.  
'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way that I like it.  
Just want to' get on a plane, go some place insane, throw myself one real good
fit.

Tired of dealin' with love hurt feelings, and all I got to say,  
I want to pass it around.  
In view of all that's been goin' down,  
I think I'll go on out and pass it around.

Five million guys have tried to reduce her,  
To another girl out in the street.  
All those pretty eyes, have lied to seduce her,  
But they come crawlin' back at her feet.  
  
Too many times, I've seen them abuse her,  
Just like the times I've been deceived.  
The touch of her starlight makes me happy,  
I can see her shinin' through in my dreams.  
  
And I wake up cryin' ...

When to believe in you.  
  
Oh won't you tell me oh who we're lookin' out for?  
Mr. politician could be perfect but people it's doubtful.  
We want a leader who'll fight for the people.  
We want somebody to take us to the steeple.  
  
We'd like to point him out to you people,  
But don't look now.

We want a leader of the people,  
We want him honest, not deceitful.  
We want an angel in the public eye,  
And we won't give it up lord until we die.

I remember the night so well.  
The rain was fallin' but I just couldn't tell,  
If it was you that was callin' to my love-sick brain.  
But the rain kept fallin' on my window pane.  
  
Out of the night the thunder rang in my ear.  
I can't fight the feelin', Lord, that brings forth my fears.  
I wish it was over, Lord, please stop the rain.  
The rain that's fallin' on my window pane.  
  
The rain that's fallin' on my window pane.  
Every night the rain's on time, I can feel it in this heart of mine.  
But I don't know what to do.  
Well, I guess I could go back home, 'cause you know back home is where I
belong.  
But it just ain't home without you.  
  
And I don't know what to do, baby.  
Well, I guess I'm a looser but it just don't seem fair.  
I lost all my life so tell me, why should I care?  
The night that you left me is the night that it came.  
And the rain's still fallin' on my window pane.  
  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
I said the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
I said the rain.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
You know the rain  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.  
Keeps right on fallin'.  
The rain keeps fallin' on my window pane.

The way of life is tough these days, it's hard to get along.  
But Jesus came and he talked to me, and that's why I wrote this song.  
He told me of my brothers in a far and distant land.  
He said that it's gettin' crowded on Earth, and it's time we made some plans.  
Time we made some plans.  
  
He said overpopulation is the problem of today.  
There's too many children on the Earth, and more on the way.  
If you don't start some birth control, then you won't last too much longer.  
It's best that we let it save our souls, so we can get much stronger.  
Get much stronger.  
  
Ahhh  
I'm afraid of overpopulation.  
I don't want to die of suffocation.  
The world is full of pollution.  
And Jesus is the solution.  
  
He said we're gettin' near the end, and I'm as close as you are.  
If you take Jesus as a friend, you're gonna' be a big star.  
Star that shiness in the sky above, a light you cannot sever.  
You will be with him above, and you will shine forever.  
Shine forever.  
  
Ahhh  
He trys to be with me.  
He's tryin to set me free.  
He wants to be with you.  
So you won't have to die.

Knockin' at your door

You don't love me no more.  
  
If you don't want to lay there,  
With your mouth shut tight  
I'm gettin' myself together,  
Yes I'm leavin' tonight  
  
You ain't gonna' find nobody,  
To treat you like I do

Come on, take me, take me, and make me feel your music.  
want to get in deep when it tastes so sweet,  
want to lose my head tonight.  
Come on, take me, take me, make me feel your music.  
Well we ain't gonna stop if we're feelin' hot,  
Gotta' lose our heads tonight.  
  
How many times I tried to make it happen?  
But you always find a way to say good-night.  
Tonight we're here alone, your mama's out, there's nobody home,  
I'm a harmless kinda crazy so it's alright.  
  
CHORUS  
  
I've seen you give me looks that I've read about in books,  
And I finally had to make you play your hand.  
There's a reason that you're here, and I think it's perfectly clear.  
But it don't take much to make me understand.  
  
Come and dance with me, take me all the higher.  
Put your arms around me, make me feel much righter.  
Come and love with me, we can move real slow to the music.  
Come make love with me, come make love, make love with me.  
  
Oh ...  
CHORUS

Up each morning at five o'clock,  
Seem like the noon-day sun ain't never gonna' stop.  
The work is hard in a railroad yard,  
Hey, hey, gotta' make it today to punch a time card.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
  
Dirt and sweat, runnin' down my back,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Work all day long up and down the railroad tracks.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
I'm a God fearing man, and with many I stand,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
And with God we've been working, all hand in hand.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  
Workin' on the railroad.  
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,  
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.  

Well a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?  
I said a-hey there baby, do you want to make the scene?  
Aw well come on over baby, step into my time machine  
You best jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right  
Aw, jump into my action, I'm gonna make you feel right  
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm gonna love you tonight  
Step into the front row, I'm gonna show you how  
Step into the front row, I wanna show you how  
Don't worry 'bout no time we can always come back to right now  
Aw and I'm gonna' give it to you  
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about  
When you wanna come back, we just a turn about  
But we ain't gonna' come back 'till there ain't no doubt  
Now don't it get good to you, ah-do you know what I mean?  
Said don't it get good to you, don't you know what I mean?  
Well come on over baby, jump into my time machine

Don't really want to fall out of love,  
And baby I need a lovin' shove,  
To get back in, lord, to get back in.  
To get back in once again, baby.  
  
Oooo, baby when times are good,  
You know they couldn't get no better if they tried to.  
But there's a question standing where I stood,  
You know you act just like the person that's been lied to.  
  
You ain't been treatin' me like you know you should,  
There's been a change in your way.  
Remember what it's like when love is good,  
And remember the chorus 'cause I wrote it for us.  
  
Don't really want to fall out of love,  
And baby I need a lovin' shove,  
To get back in, oh, to get back in.  
To get back in once again.  
  
You know I love that girl with all my heart,  
And, like wine, with age it gets better.  
But I don't like trouble, and when trouble starts,  
It's the times I wish I could forget her.  
  
If you give 'em an inch, boy, then they'll take a mile,  
And gettin' it back's so hard to do.  
They'll take advantage of your gentle style,  
But you've got to forgive them, 'cause you're tryin' to live with them.  
  
Woah ... woah  
Woah, woah ... woah  
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again.  
To get back in, to get back in, to get back in once again, babe.  
  
To get back in ...  

I been out on the road with my thumb in the air,

Tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah.

'Cause that's the way it's got to be.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
It's comin' down and I ain't buyin',  
It's gonna' take a long time, to catch up with me.  
And when you notice your condition,  
Maybe you'll want to stay with me.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Then we can find the true definition,  
The answer's here, right here with me.

In this dirty old part of the city  
Where the sun refuse to shine  
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'  
  
My little girl you're so young and pretty, yeah  
And one thing I know is true  
You're gonna die before your time is through

Out on the road for forty days  
Last night in Little Rock, put me in a haze  
Sweet, sweet Connie was doin' her act  
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact  
  
Up all night with Freddie King

Booze and ladies, keep me right

Four young chiquitas in Omaha  
Waitin' for the band to return from the show  
A feelin' good, feelin' right and it's Saturday night  
The hotel detective, he was outta sight  
  
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan  
They was out to meet the boys in the band  
They said, "Come on dudes, let's get it on!"  
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

I see a pear falling down from the tree  
Winter is coming and it's plain to see  
I spend the cold nights in my lonely room  
Is it the winter to which I am doomed?  
Cold is the snow that will cover the ground  
I feel the presence of tears falling down  
Is it for pity or vain that I cry?  
Color is gone and the grass it must die  
Winter brings sadness that empties my soul  
Life is too short for a dog growing old  
He used to follow and play at my heel  
Love from his heart I no longer can feel

Mark: We ... we have a new album out, it was released the fifteenth. It's
called Closer To Home. We'd like to do one ... we'd like to do one from the
album. Ah ..., but before we do, I feel that ah ..., I have to tell you
something because I know that if you were in my place that you would do it for
me.  
Mark: Ah ... brothers and sisters, there are people out there that look just
like you or maybe ah ..., your brother ah ..., but they're not. And, when they
hand you something, don't take it -- don't take it, okay?  
Mark: This is Mean Mistreater ...
