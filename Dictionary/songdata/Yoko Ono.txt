You're a beautiful boy  
With all your little toys  
Your eyes have seen the world  
Though you're only four years old  
And your tears are streaming  
Even when you're smiling  
Please never be afraid to cry  
  
You're a beautiful boy  
With all your little ploys  
Your mind has changed the world  
And you're now forty years old  
You got all you can carry  
And still feel somehow empty  
Don't ever be afraid to fly  
  
All you beautiful boys  
Creating multiple plays  
You like to fence in your world  
And settle down when you're old  
You can run from pole to pole  
And never scratch your soul  
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back  
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back  
Don't be afraid to be afraid

We're born in a prison  
Raised in a prison  
Sent to a prison called school  
  
We cry in a prison  
We love in a prison  
We dream in a prison like fools  
  
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate  
  
We live with no reason  
Kicked around for no reason  
Thrown out without reason like tools  
  
We work in a prison  
And hate in a prison  
And die in a prison as a rule  
  
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate  
  
We live in a prison  
Among judges and wardens  
And wait for no reason for you  
We laugh in a prison  
Go through all four seasons  
And die with no vision of truth  
  
Wood becomes a flute when it's loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when it's broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate

In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying.  
She said she lost her teddy bear.  
Oh, then, I can get you another one,  
(No) no, (no) no, (no) no,  
(It was) it was (my) teddy bear.  
  
As we were talking  
A cloud passed and cast a pool of light around her.  
I saw that she was not a little girl. (oh)  
(No) no, (no) no, (no) no,  
(But you are) but you are.  
  
All my life I felt like I was in the middle of an ocean,  
Unable to touch the horizon.  
All my life I was floating on my emotion,  
Not knowing life had it's own motion.  
  
In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying.

Coffin car, she's riding a coffin car  
People watching her with tender eyes  
Friends whispering in kindly words  
Children running, waving hands  
Telling each other, how pretty she is  
  
Coffin car, she likes to ride a coffin car  
Friends making ways for the first time  
People throwing kisses for the first time  
Showering flowers, ringing bells  
Telling each other, how nice she is  
  
Coffin car, she's riding a coffin car  
Wives showing tears for the first time  
Husband taking their hats off for the first time  
Crushing their handkerchiefs, rubbing their nose  
Telling each other, how good she is  
  
Half the world is dead anyway  
The other half is asleep and life is killing her  
Telling her to join the dead  
  
So ev'ry day, she likes to ride a coffin car  
A flower covered coffin car  
Pretending she was dead

Two, one, two, three, four.  
People say I'm cool,  
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.  
Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
When I'm on the phone, I thank god,  
My voice sounds smooth and clear without a trace of tear.  
When I'm at work, I thank god,  
I still have that smile ma used to say lit her day.  
  
But something inside me, something inside me died that day.  
People say I'm cool,  
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.  
Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
When I'm with people, I thank god,  
I can talk hip when I'm crying inside.  
  
When I'm with friends, I thank god,  
I can lit a cigarette when I'm choking inside.  
  
People say I'm cool,  
Ya', I'm a cool, chick baby.  
Ev'ry day I thank god  
That I'm such a cool, chick baby.  
  
A friend lent me shades  
So I could hide my eyes that day.  
Was a snowy day,  
The shades have seen a lot of things I didn't want to know myself.  
  
Was like an accident, part of growing up,  
People tell me.  
  
But something inside me, something inside me died that day.  
What do you do-oo? what can you do?  
What do you do-oo? what can you do?

Dream love, dream universe, dream come true.  
Dream power, dream energy, dream eternity.  
  
In dream you can fly forever  
And never miss a turn,  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn.  
  
Dream sunrise, dream sunset, dream together.  
Dream you, dream me, dream each other.  
  
In dream the world is clear forever  
And there's no return.  
In dream you can love forever  
And there's no return.  
  
Dream power,

Dream together. (there's no return)

And never miss a turn,  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn.  
  
Dream, dream, dream.

I wonder why  
I could never hate you  
Even when you look away,  
I always love you in my soul.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
I tell you why  
I could never hate you  
Even when you're far away,  
I know you love me in your soul.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
Part of me will always be with you,  
Part of you is growing in me.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We don't know how to love, love without fear.  
  
We don't know how,  
How to tell each other,  
There's nothing we can do.  
I saw your soul and you saw mine.  
It's just the way we happen to be,  
It's just the way it happens to be.  
We always know inside our soul that love is there.

Forgive me, my love,  
For hiding my soul from you.  
It seems easier for us  
If I don't show all of myself.  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you?  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you?  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We lay an ocean between us.  
  
Forgive me, my love,  
For closing my eyes to our love.  
It seems easier for us  
If we thought this was just a play.  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you?  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you?  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We hold an ocean inside us.  
  
Let me take your hand  
And press it on my breast  
And you will know that  
The ocean is for you.

The food is cold  
Your eyes are cold  
The window's cold  
The bed's cold  
  
Give me something that's not cold, come on, come on  
Give me something that's not cold, come on, come on  
Give me something that's not cold, come on, come on  
Give me, give me, give me  
  
The chair's hard  
Your voice is hard  
The money's hard  
The living's hard  
  
Give me something that's not hard, come on, come on  
Give me something that's not hard, come on, come on  
Give me something that's not hard, come on, come on  
Give me, give me, give me  
  
I'll give you my heartbeat  
And a bit of tear and flesh  
It's not very much but while it's there  
You can have it, you can have it

Everything on earth has his own right to live  
Whether you unlock and whether you await  
Stop this and let us unite  
All we are saying is give peace a chance

I'm a battleship, frozen by my mothers anger  
Anchored in the North Pole Sea  
I'm a sphinx, stamped on the Hilton poster  
Hoping to see the desert  
  
I'm a woman without country or state  
Opening her head to the universe  
Hundred thousand people in me  
Everyday they're growing, everyday they're feeling  
  
He's an infant, blinded from his mothers sorrow  
Crawling in the bleeding sky  
He's a building, floating in spring air  
Hoping to open his windows  
  
He's a man, bound on earth soil  
Reaching his hands to the universe  
Hundred thousand people in him  
Everyday they're feeling, everyday they're growing  
  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing together  
Reaching each other  
  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing pain, growing joy  
Growing together  
Reaching each other

It's been very hard  
But it's getting easier now  
Hard times are over, over for a while  
  
The leaves are shining in the sun  
And smiling inside  
You and I watching each other on a street corner  
Cars and buses and planes and people go by  
  
But we don't care  
We want to know  
We want to know in each other's eyes  
That hard times are over, over for sometime  
  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over, over for a while  
  
It's been very rough  
But it's getting easier now  
Hard times are over, over for a while  
  
The streams are twinkling in the sun  
And I'm smiling inside  
You and I walking together 'round the street corner  
  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over  
Hard times are over, over for a while  

Have you seen a horizon lately,  
If you have, watch it for a while.  
For you never know,  
It may not last so long.  
  
Have you seen an evening light lately?  
If you have, watch it for a while.  
For you never know,  
It may not be the same.  
  
Have you seen a snowflake lately?  
If you have, hold it in your hand.  
For you never know,  
It may melt away.  
  
Have you been in love lately?  
If you have, hold it in your heart.  
For you never know,  
It may be the last.

Ah -  
Ah -  
  
This is hell in paradise,  
We're all asleep or paralyzed.  
Why are we scared to verbalize  
Our multicolor dreams?  
  
When will we come to realize,  
We're all stoned or pacified,  
While the boogie men organize  
Their multilevel schemes?  
  
Underqualified for love,  
Overqualified for life,  
Sticking our heads in slime,  
Thinking we're in our prime.  
  
Mesmerized by mythology,  
Hypnotized by ideology,  
Antagonized by reality,  
Vandalized by insanity,  
Desensitized by fraternity,  
Sanitized by policy,  
Jeopardized by lunacy.  
  
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh....  
This is hell!  
Penalized by apathy  
And living in the world of fantasy.  
Dancing on hot coal, waiting for the last call,  
It's adam's ball, eve's call.  
  
Wake up, shake up, check out, work out, speak out,  
Reach out, it's time to, time to, time to,  
To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to.  
  
This is hell in paradise,  
None of us wish to recognize.  
But do we want them to materialize  
An endangered species?  
  
Mobilize transition,  
With inspiration for life.

I don't know why, was getting so good with us,  
I don't know why, was getting so good with us,  
I don't know why, was getting so good,  
Was getting so good with us.  
  
I don't know why, was so good with us.  
  
The room's so empty, the room's empty without you,  
My body's so empty, the world's so empty without you.  
  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why,  
I don't know why, 'twas so good with us.  
  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words,  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words,  
You left me, you left me, you left me without words.  
  
You bastards!  
Hate us! hate me! we had ev'rything you

I have a woman inside my soul,  
Her eyes sombre and sad.  
She waves her hand to try to reach me,  
But I can't hear what she says.  
  
I wish I knew what she says,  
I wish I knew what she wants,  
I wish I knew what she says to me,  
I wish I knew what she means to me.  
  
I see an asphalt road inside my soul,  
It's pale even in a warm summer's day.  
It stretches into the mist and calls me,  
But I don't know what it takes.  
  
I wish I knew what it takes, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it gives, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says to me, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
I see a tombstone inside my soul,  
It's old and mossy, covered in dead leaves.  
It stands with an engraving on it surface,  
But I don't know what it reads.  
  
I wish I knew what it reads, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it says to me, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey)  
  
I feel snow covering inside my soul,  
It's hard and shining in shades of grey.  
No footsteps ever made their marks,  
And I don't know when it melts.  
  
I wish I knew when it melts, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew when it happens, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew if it happens at all, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it means to me. (I wish I knew)  
  
I hear a stream running inside my soul,  
It's cold and clear and carries a tune.  
But I don't know what it sings and tells,  
I don't know where it goes.  
  
I wish I knew what it sings,  
I wish I knew where it goes,  
I wish I knew what it sings, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew where it goes, (I wish I knew)  
I wish I knew what it sings. (I wish I knew)  
  
(I wish I knew)  
(I wish I knew) (yeah!)  
(I wish I knew)  
(I wish I knew)

When I come to the dock and sit very still,  
I wonder why on earth we fight and kill.  
I see a light on the other side flickering to me,  
As if to say, you're alright, you'll find your way.  
  
The world is so beautiful when I'm out here,  
Why can't it be the same when we're back there?  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.  
  
Windows are shattered,  
Streets are battered,  
Kids are frightened,  
Men are still at war.  
  
Moms are feeling sad,  
Dads are feeling bad.  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
If the world's gone mad.  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.

Telling me all sorts of hurt of his own  
Although his voice was sweet to me  
I wondered if we could ever be  
  
He was a mindbeater, always on the phone  
Telling me all sorts of what I did wrong  
Although his voice was sweet to me  
I wondered if we could ever be  
  
He was a mindbender, always on the phone  
Telling me all sorts of dream he has sewn  
Although his voice was sweet to me  
I wondered if we could ever be

Our mother who art of the universe,  
Hallow be thy name.  
Thy wisdom reign, thy will is done,  
As it is to be.  
  
You gave us life and protection,  
And see us through our confusion.  
Teach us love and freedom,  
As it is to be.  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory.

Mrs. Lennon, o' Mrs. Lennon,

There's no clouds,  
O' then, I guess it must be alright.

Silver spoon, o' silver spoon,  
I lost my silver spoon.  
  
And our children, o' our children,  
Did they have to go to war?  
Yes, my love, it's okay,  
Half the world is always killed you know.

My man is the best in the world,

His head's in the clouds, but his feet on the ground,  
And when he speaks, all the birds come around.  
I love you, I love you.  
  
My man is the best in the world,  
His eyes got the shine of the ancient stars,

Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
You say tomorrow's another day,  
All I know is we're here today.  
I've got nightmares I could never share with you,  
The kind that keeps me up all night.  
So hold me tight till the room is light  
And tell me that it's all right.  
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - oh-oh-oh)  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye,  
We may go our separate ways some day,  
But we know we shared our dreams today.  
I've got nightmares I would never wish on you,  
The kind that keeps me down all day.  
So hold me tight till the sky is light  
And tell me that it's all right.  
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh - oh-oh-oh)  
Never say goodbye,  
Never say goodbye.

It was getting dark in a snow-covered park  
I thought I saw you smiling  
You left town to marry a Texas millionaire  
I wonder how you are doing  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I love you  
  
I heard him on the air discussing world affairs  
And something about his global vision  
That's when I wondered if you made the right decision  
I want to know what you're thinking  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I miss you  
  
You were a New York woman  
New York woman  
New York woman  
I miss you  
  
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, my friend  
  
I miss you  
Oh, I miss you  
Oh, I miss you  
Oh, I miss you

No bed for Beatle John!  
Beatle John Lennon lost his hospital bed yesterday to a patient  
It happened at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, London  
Where John was keeping vigil in the room  
Where his girlfriend, Yoko Ono  
Is being kept under observation  
  
When he realized his bed was needed for an urgent case  
John sent out for a sleeping bag  
And last night  
He was once more happily kicked out alongside Yoko  
In the sleeping bag  
  
Yoko who expects her baby next February  
Will remain in the hospital for another few days  
A Beatles spokesman said  
There is a good chance for the baby's survival  
  
The Beatles win battle of the nude LP!  
The Beatles have won their fight to put out an LP record  
With a sleeve showing John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the nude!  
  
EMI, the world's biggest recording company  
Whose artists includes the Beatles  
Refused to handle the LP called 'Two Virgins'  
Because of the sleeve  
So did the group's American outlet, Capitol Records  
  
But the record with its controversial sleeve  
Will be released in both countries next month  
An official of The Beatles Apple company said last night  
The sleeve has not been censored or altered in any way  
  
We are pleased it is being distributed  
But it may be that some record shops  
Will still refuse to handle it

I see your face looking into the space,  
All tired and worried.  
Why does it have to be like this, you and I,  
I wanted us to be happy.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
I see your face with a trace of life,  
Being a wife and a woman.  
If I ever hurt you, please, remember,  
I wanted you to be happy.  
  
Is there anything I want more,  
More than your trust and understanding?  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
I wanna quit moving,  
I wanna quit running,  
I wanna relax and be tender.  
I wanna see us together again,  
Rocking away in our walnut chairs.  
  
Even with your warmth and closeness,  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
Even with our dreams and yearnings,  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a thirst.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.  
  
No one can see me like you do.  
No one can see you like I do.

She gets down on her knees to throw up life,  
She gets down on her knees to throw up life,  
She gets down on her knees to throw up life,  
That's the only thing she does it good.  
  
Mm -  
Mm -  
  
Room to room, flushing away her memory,  
Bay to bay, washing out her history.  
  
Ah-ah!  
She gets down on her knees to make up life,  
She gets down on her knees to make up life,  
She gets down on her knees to make up life,  
That's the only way she has it good.  
  
She's a mainliner who's never took a main line,  
She's a one liner who's never found the one line,  
She goes from one bay to another looking for a liner.  
  
Going down, down, down, down to feel the ground,  
Coming up, up, up, up to make the flight.  
  
Mm -  
Mm -  
  
She's a line thrower, dip it in a honey bowl,  
She's a line burner, rub it in with vinegar and oil,  
She goes from one sky to another looking for a liner.  
  
Going down, down, down, down to feel the ground,  
Coming up, up, up, up to make the flight.  
Going down, down, down, down to feel the ground,  
Coming up, up, up, up to make the flight.  
  
Ah!  
Ah!  
  
Ah -  
Blur patches in the clouded sky,  
Too high to catch her tears and sighs,  
Looking over tenderly.

Ah! ah!

Doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh

My ears getting tired of listening all the time  
They've been talking lots of garbage all their lives  
And suddenly they decided to ring one back  
Ring-ring, ring-ring, my ears are ringing like a warning  
  
My eyes getting tired of looking all the time  
They've been talking a lot of winking all their lives  
And finally they decided to flash one back  
Flash-flash, flash-flash, my eyes are flashing like a warning  
  
My nose is getting tired of sniffing all the time  
She's been taking Memphis blues all her life  
And surely she decided to sneeze one back  
Sneeze-sneeze, sneeze-sneeze, my nose is sneezing like a warning  
  
My body's getting tired of taking all the time  
She's been taking lot of cornballs all her life  
Suddenly she decided to hit one back  
Bang-bang, bang-bang, she hits back like a warning  
  
She hits back like a warning  
Ring-ring, flash-flash  
Sneeze-sneeze, bang-bang  
She hits back like a warning  
  
She's gonna hit back  
(Yeah)  
She's gonna kick back  
(Yeah)  
You won't know what hit you  
Till you see her flashing  
(Yeah)  
  
She's gonna hit back  
(Yeah)  
She's gonna kick back  
(Yeah)  
You won't know what hit you  
Till you see her head flashing

When I come in my dream to a house I've never seen before,  
I have a tendency to look for the exit door.  
Cause I never know it may be that house again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
When I come in my mind to a stream that's running gently,  
I have a tendency to run like a frightened deer.  
Cause I never know it may take me to that ocean again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
I usually stay away from being carried away,  
But one day I saw a silver horse.  
I though he might take me to that somewhere high,  
I thought he might take me to that deep blue sky.  
  
I came to realize that the horse had no wings.  
"No wings, well, it wasn't so bad, you know."  
  
I learnt to travel the world around  
And run on the ground in the morning.  
And that's the story of a wandering soul,  
A story of a dreamer.

I stopped flying a long time ago,  
Thinking that's just for the birds and bees.  
But when I look up (I look up)  
And see the sky, (see the sky)  
I like the blue and I know why.  
  
You came from Zeus, we come from Uranus,  
Hoping to meet soul to soul.  
We see you clearly, (clearly)  
With our third eye, (with our third eye)  
There's no more fear and I know why.  
  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are.  
One day we'll fly and leap through the sky  
To look for a good land hand in hand.  
  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are,  
Sky people, that's what we are.

On a windy day, let's go on flying.  
There may be no trees to rest on,  
There may be no clouds to ride.  
But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us,  
That's enough for me,  
That's enough for me.  
  
On a windy day, we went flying.  
There was no sea to rest on,  
There were no hills to glide.  
We saw an empty bottle rolling down the street  
And on a cupboard stand at the corner of the street,  
Wrinkled souls piled up like grapefruits.

In the middle of the night,  
I'm lying in your bed.  
Thinking of you and me in the universe.  
  
Stars are moving like the night we met,  
The earth is turning like the time we said.  
In my mind I'm searching for you, billion miles away.  
  
Why do I miss you so if you're just a spec of dust,  
Floating endlessly amongst the billion stars?  
  
Knowing that one day we may float apart,  
Meeting each other in memories.  
  
Why do I love you so if you're just a spec of dust,  
Floating endlessly amongst the trillion stars?  
Knowing that one day we may float apart,  
Meeting each other in universe.

"Calling earth! calling earth!"  
"Eh...who? "  
"Are you listening? are you listening? "  
"Is this a long distance call? "  
"Mommy? "  
"Oh, good, you're on, too, sean, stay on, something's wrong with this"  
"Don't be afraid! don't be afraid!"  
"You sound familiar, you sound like...sound like me actually."  
"That's because we conditioned our vibrations to yours."  
"Aha! are you getting that, Sean? "  
"You will not blow up earth! you will not blow up earth!"  
"Oh, that's good to know."  
"You are wisdom, you are love."  
  
Human civilization is in a state of hibernation,  
We'll grow to know the planets full distribution.  
The world as our reflection will regain it's circulation,  
Our life span will meet our life plan of starpeace.  
  
Human civilization is in a state of isolation,  
We'll learn to reach out for terrestrial communications.  
We'll make our first migration from earth to other constellations,  
Our life span will meet out life plane of starpeace.  
  
Love is our energy source, wisdom is our power source.  
Health is our nature resource,  
Growth is our future resource.  
  
Join the state of the universe,  
United state of peace.  
Join the state of the universe,  
United state of peace.  
  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace, I see you growing,  
Starpeace.

I walked through the park and saw a young oak tree growing,  
Growing beside an old bark hit by lightning.  
I asked the young tree how he wished to be,  
He shook his leaves and sung to me:  
  
I'm a strong oak tree like my father used to be,  
Though deep in my heart, the memory's still there.  
The sky is clearer now and the wind is fair,  
The world is beautiful and I like it out here.  
  
When I hear thunder, I think of my father,  
He taughtme about life, that was when I was five.  
It's true that some days are more than grey,  
But we learn to get by day by day.  
  
I'm a strong oak tree like my father used to be,  
Though deep in my heart, the memory's still there.  
The sky is clearer now and the wind is fair,  
The world is beautiful and I like it out here.

You say you're well and satisfied  
But your body tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know what you think  
Or what you want  
  
She says she's truly gratified  
But her voice tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know how you feel  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together?  
  
He says he's never petrified  
But his eyes tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know what you need  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together?  
  
I'm watching your body talk  
I'm listening to your double talk  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way for you and I  
  
I'm watching your body talk  
I'm listening to your double talk  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way, then the world is one  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way

Well it was Sunday bloody Sunday  
When they shot the people there  
The cries of thirteen martyrs  
Filled the Free Derry air  
Is there any one amongst you  
Dare to blame it on the kids?  
Not a soldier boy was bleeding  
When they nailed the coffin lids!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sunday bloody Sunday  
Bloody Sunday's the day  
  
You claim to be majority  
Well you know that it's a lie  
You're really a minority  
On this sweet emerald isle  
When Stormont bans our marches  
They've got a lot to learn  
Internment is no answer  
It's those mothers' turn to burn!  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
You anglo pigs and scotties  
Sent to colonize the North  
You wave your bloody Union Jack  
And you know what it's worth!  
How dare you hold to ransom  
A people proud and free  
Keep Ireland for the Irish  
Put the English back to sea!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, it's always bloody Sunday  
In the concentration camps  
Keep Falls Road free forever  
From the bloody English hands  
Repatriate to Britain  
All of you who call it home  
Leave Ireland to the Irish  
Not for London or for Rome  
  
[Chorus x4]

Hey, Yoko, imagine a grapefruit and squeeze it on me  
Ah  
  
You say mustn't do this and that  
You say can't do this and that  
While you're losing your pants in a bullet proof car  
Losing your hair in a downtown bar  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you're my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh, listen  
  
You say mustn't have this and that  
You say can't have this and that  
While you're losing your apple and squeezing our balls  
Losing your mind and crawling up the walls  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you're my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe, ooh, listen  
  
Ooh, yeah, do you wanna touch me? Oh yeah  
Do you wanna break your mind, boy?  
  
You're a dildo, I'm a whore  
I'm a Barbie, you're a whore  
Living in a glass house, having fun  
Lying in a glass house watching the sun  
Forget it, just forget it  
It's the curse, you are my curse, it could be worse  
  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
I'm just talking to the universe  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh
