What did I do to deserve this?  
Tell me the truth and don't lie  
You're pretty good at that but, no not this time  
You walk around like you run the world  
Running your mouth, and talking about me now,  
They think that you're the perfect girl,  
They're gonna see everything so get back  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this
again  
Your dressed to impress but I have got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.  
I'm feeling bad for,  
You are alone and nobody cares that you are  
One look into your eyes,  
Easy to see what you could be but you're not  
I say it's time that you give in,  
Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over  
You feel your heart beat deep down  
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain,  
Just get out  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this
again  
You dress to impress but I got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.  
Someway  
You keep hearing everything that people say  
And you can't take the pain another day  
It's coming back around  
I told you this town was just small  
You dress to impress but you can stop now  
Cuz it's gonna come back around  
And around and around and around and around  
Yeah yeah  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong (Too strong)  
To take this, take this again [Whoa]  
You dress to impress but I've got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.

There's a new bee and it's kind of hard to fit in  
When the queen has the thinness skin  
No matter how nice you try to be  
She's always me me mean to me me me  
(Sorry)  
I try to be nice but you see what it gets  
It's like jamming a stick in a hornet's nest  
  
Sis boom buzz

(No)  
A stumbling bee

Guess the only bee that I can be is me  
(Ya)  
  
Word to the hiiive!  
(Ya)  
Ok  
(What?)

And I feel, I feel a deep connection  
And I think, that we might be onto somethin', no  
And I know it's somethin' special  
Seein' you here is not coincidental, mhmm  
  
Well I've been walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And I've been fightin', fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' that I won't fall this time  
But now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines  
  
Ooh, oh  
  
See I was tryin' to be everything you weren't expecting  
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing  
But I'm falling way too fast  
I just want this love to last forever, forever  
And every time I feel this way  
Oh, somethings changed for the better  
(Whoa whoa whoa ooh)  
  
And I've been walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And I've been fightin', fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' that I won't fall this time  
But now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines  
  
And now I'm walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And now I'm fightin, fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' I won't fall this time  
Now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines

I'm losing myself, trying to compete  
With everyone else  
Instead of just being me  
Don't know where to turn  
I've been stuck in this routine  
I need to change my ways instead of always being weak  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be afraid I want to wake up feeling beautiful today  
And know that I'm okay cause everyone's perfect in an usual way  
So see I just want to believe in me  
  
The mirror can lie doesn't show you what's inside  
And it can tell you your full of life its amazing what you can hide  
Just by putting on a smile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm quickly finding out  
I'm not about to break down  
Not today  
  
I guess I always knew that I had all the strength to make it through  
I cannot be afraid I want to wake feeling beautiful today  
And know that I'm okay cause everyone's perfect in an usual way  
You see, now, now I believe in me  
  
Now I believe in me

One time in South America  
Met a boy in Colombia  
Couldn't understand a word he said  
So he took my hand instead  
It was late as we ignored the time  
Now I can't get this stranger off my mind  
I think about him when I wear this dress  
I still smell him in my hair  
  
Was it that him making you sweat  
Was it the beat of the drum on my heart and my chest  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said, besame mucho,  
He kisses my head and we dance  
  
It was time for me to say goodbye  
Couldn't stand to look him in the eye  
Would've kissed him if I had the time  
Could've have sworn it was on his mind  
Was it his lips, the way he moves his ways  
Hands on my hips,  
Oh just a look of desire on his face  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said, besame mucho,  
He kisses my head  
And then I  
I close my eyes  
For a moment in time  
In the blink of the night  
I submit the crown  
He was young until it found  
When I turned around  
But I swear I can still hear him now  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I can't wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said, besame mucho,  
He kisses my head and then we dance  
We dance  
Eres muy bonita y sed

[Verse]  
If I had it my way, I would take you down  
If I had it my way, I would turn you out  
And if my body had a say, I would come again  
Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
[Verse]  
If I had it my way, I would take the lead  
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep  
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest  
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress  
  
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
[Bridge]  
My mind's getting in the way  
Can't feel what my body say  
I'mma tell you anyway  
I'mma tell you anyway  
My mind's getting in the way  
Can't feel what my body say  
I'mma show you anyway  
I'mma show you anyway  
  
There's only one thing left for us to do  
Oh, you can  
  
[Chorus]  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat  
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to  
  
You can touch me with slow hands  
Dreamland  
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away  
Touch, make love, taste you  
If my body told the truth, baby I would do  
Just what I want to

We can't  
We can't back down  
We can't back down  
We can't back down  
We can't back down  
  
Not right now  
We can't back down  
Not right now  
We can't back down  
We can't back down  
  
Don't close your eyes  
We're all in this together  
Wherever we draw the line  
We're not gonna straddle across it  
Or lose it  
  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
This is serious  
Don't walk away  
We can't pretend it's not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
(No way)  
We've been called out  
(We've been called out)  
  
Do you hear your name?  
(Yeah)  
I'm not confused  
Let's win this thing  
(Let's do it)  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away, yeah  
  
Don't get me wrong  
I don't like confrontation  
I'd rather we all just get along  
Music should be undivided, united  
  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
This is serious  
Don't walk away  
We can't pretend it's not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
  
(No way)  
We've been called out  
(We've been called out)  
Do you hear your name?

(Let's do it)  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away, yeah  
  
We got a situation that we can't ignore  
'Cause ignorance is not bliss  
We don't have to take this, no  
With every big decision  
Comes an equally important share of the risk  
We gotta take this  
  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
This is serious  
Don't walk away  
We can't pretend, it's not happening  
In our backyard  
Our own home plate  
We've been called out  
  
Do you hear your name?  
I'm not confused  
Let's win this thing  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
Don't walk away  
Don't walk away, yeah  
We can't back down  
  
We can't back down  
Not right now  
We can't back down

Before I fall too fast  
Kiss me quick but make it last  
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye  
  
Keep it sweet  
Keep it slow  
Let the future pass but don't let go  
But tonight I could fall too soon into this beautiful moonlight  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
See this heart won't settle down  
Like a child running scared from a clown  
I'm terrified of what you do  
My stomach screams just when I look at you  
  
Run far away so I can breathe  
Even though you're far from suffocating me  
But I can't get my hopes too high  
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
Now you see why I'm scared  
I can't open up my heart without care  
So here I go  
It's what I feel  
For the first time in my life I know it's real  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
If this is love please don't break me  
I'm giving up so just catch me

I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't want to go there anymore and I  
Know all the steps up to your door  
But I don't want to go there anymore  
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky  
Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up and sing you a song  
But I don't want to have to go that far and I  
I've got you down, I know you by heart  
And you don't even know where I start  
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
Don't wait for the sky to clear  
  
I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I've watched you so long  
Screamed your name  
I don't know what else  
I can say  
  
But I'll leave my window open  
Cause I'm too tired tonight  
For all these games  
Just know I'm right here hoping  
You'll come in with the rain  
  
I could go back to every laugh  
But I don't want to go there  
Anymore...

Are you ready? Ha! x3  
  
It's time for me to take it  
I'm the boss right now  
Not gonna fake it  
Not when you go down  
Cause this is my game  
And you better come to play. ha

Now I'm letting go

Lalala-a  
Yeah  
Lalala-a  
  
I coulda been the one you noticed  
I coulda been the one for you  
I coulda been like all the others  
Is that what I'm supposed to do?  
I don't wanna be disappointing  
I don't wanna have to prove  
How I really feel about you  
But you don't even have a clue  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream  
  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doing it again  
  
If I tell you what I'm thinking,  
If I let myself trust you  
Can you give me what I'm missing  
Can you make my dreams come true  
  
I try to be sensitive  
I try to be tough  
I try to walk away,  
I try to be innocent  
I try to be rough  
But I just wanna play  
  
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you lately  
And every time I look at you  
I can't explain how I feel insane, I can't get away  
You're my daydream, yeah  
  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doing it again  
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're making me insane  
And you know, and you know, and you know,  
You're doin' it again

We're like a melody with no words  
Until we figure it out  
We sing  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
I know it's simple yeah, but it's worked right up 'til now  
It's up to now  
Yeah, every day's been like a dream world  
Oh but now your not just  
In my head, oh no  
  
Will we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your heart to see where it land  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again, and again, and again, oh  
  
You know that I can't help but wonder  
What's gonna happen next  
I'm a little curious, oh yeah  
Every star that I stood under  
When you were under it too  
Did you ever think about us?  
I hope you did, 'cause I can tell you  
That's something I'll never forget  
I won't forget  
  
If we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again  
  
Don't need friends just beginning  
But I hope that we will find it again  
So we can go from here, oh  
  
Will we remember different summers  
It's like tossing your hearts to see where it lands  
Heads is easy  
Tails is harder to plan  
If we're starting all over again, again, and again, and again, and again  
And again, and again, and again  
Will we remember different summers

Did you forget  
That I was even alive  
Did you forget  
Everything we ever had  
Did you forget  
Did you forget  
'Bout me  
  
Did you regret  
Ever standing by my side  
Did you forget  
What we were feeling inside  
Now I'm left to forget  
About us  
  
[Chorus]  
But somewhere we went wrong  
We were once so strong  
Our love is like a song  
You can't forget it  
  
So now I guess  
This is where we have to stand  
Did you regret  
Ever holding my hand  
Never again  
Please don't forget  
Don't forget  
  
We had it all  
We were just about to fall  
Even more in love  
Than we were before  
I won't forget  
I won't forget  
About us  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
At all  
  
And at last  
All the pictures have been burned  
And all the past  
Is just a lesson that we've learned  
I won't forget  
Please don't forget about us  
  
But somewhere we went wrong  
Our love is like a song  
But you won't sing along  
You've forgotten  
About us  
Don't forget

Now you told me on a Sunday that it wasn't gonna work  
I tried to cry myself to sleep 'cause it was supposed to hurt  
We sat next to the fire as the flame was burning out  
I knew what you were thinkin' before you'd say it aloud  
  
Don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm not even breaking  
You're not worth the time that this is taking  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Every time you lie  
  
I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face  
And a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place  
Less trashier, much classier then who you prove to be  
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me, oh no  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
At night awake  
I won't be sleeping 'til morning breaks  
That's the price you pay, for your mistakes  
Goodbye to dreaming  
  
So don't say you're sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen  
  
I knew better than to let you break my heart  
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no  
You still love her, I can see it in your eyes  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie  
  
Every time you lie  
Don't say you're sorry  
Every time you lie  
Don't say you're sorry  
The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie

Everyone says they know who I am  
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out  
But they only see me when I'm not afraid  
They only see who I wanna be  
  
We all run and hide every once and a while  
We all let go and run never letting it show  
  
Everyone says they know who I am  
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out  
But they only see me when I'm not afraid  
They only see who I wanna be  
  
They think they found their homecoming queen  
But baby  
Ohh  
But baby I'm just me  
  
We all run and hide every once and a while  
And we all let go and run never letting it show  
  
So look at me right now  
Take a good look  
Cus I'm not scared to frown  
No oh  
This is who I am  
Ill never change a thing not for you  
I'm just me

I'm standing in the center of the room  
I'm watching boys follow girls perfume  
All is as it should be I assume  
Except for the distance between me and you  
  
You're standing as a flower on the wall  
The room is still but we're about to fall  
And all the names that brought us here  
Simply fade away  
  
[Chorus]  
Who you are is falling over me  
(Who you are is falling over me)  
Who you are is everything I need  
(Who you are is everything I need)  
I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one  
I'm hoping  
I'm waiting  
I'm praying you are the one  
  
I can't believe that night turned into today  
I used the line you were supposed to say  
And all the names that brought us here  
And now we have to thank  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you are I will wait I will follow  
I'm here to stay  
As long as we're promised tomorrow  
I promise you today I'll wait  
I'll wait  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are the one

There's an S under my clothes  
On my chest where nobody else can see  
I light up when the doors are closed  
I am free, yeah  
And I wish I could make my move  
I can tell that you're really into me  
And I don't got a thing to lose  
In my dreams, in my dreams  
  
I'm a badass  
Jumping off the moving train  
I'm a Jane Bond  
Putting all them guys to shame  
I'm a wild card  
And I'm gonna steal your game  
You better watch out  
  
I'm a fire starter  
Make your blood run faster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
I'm a fire starter  
I'm a sweet disaster  
I'm that hearts like water  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh oh oh oh)  
  
I might look all in innocent  
But the embers are burning inside of me  
And I'm ready to take that step  
Can't you see, can't you see  
  
I'm a badass  
Jumping off the moving train  
I'm a Jane Bond  
Putting all them guys to shame  
I'm a wild card  
I'm about take my aim  
You better watch out  
  
I'm a fire starter

Kiss your lips I'm waking up  
There's nothing murder be a fighter  
  
There's an S under my clothes  
On my chest where nobody else can see  
Yeah

It's probably what's best for you,  
I only want the best for you  
And if I'm not the best then you're stuck  
  
I tried to sever ties and I  
Ended up with wounds to bind  
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts  
  
And I just ran out of band-aids  
I don't even know where to start  
'Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Even though I know it's wrong  
How could I be so sure  
If you never say what you feel feel  
I must have held your hand so tight  
You didn't have the will to fight  
I guess you needed more time to heal  
  
Baby I just ran out of band-aids  
I don't even know where to start  
'Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yea  
Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah  
Oh oh yah ya ya  
Yah  
  
You must be a miracle worker  
Swearing up and down that you can fix what's broken yeah  
Please don't get my hopes up no no  
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel  
  
It's like you pouring salt on my cuts  
  
Baby I just ran out of band-aids  
I don't even know where to start  
'Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Baby I just ran out of band-aids  
I don't even know where to start  
'Cause you can bandage the damage  
You never really can fix a heart  
Oh no no no  
You never really can fix a heart  
Oh no no no  
You never really can fix a heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh ya oh ah  
Oh oh oh oh  
You never really can fix my heart

Four years old  
With my back to the door  
All I could hear  
Was the family war  
Your selfish hands  
Always expecting more  
Am I your child?  
Or jut a charity award?  
  
[Chorus]  
You have a hollowed out heart  
But it's heavy in your chest  
I tried so hard to fight it but it's hopeless,  
Hopeless  
You're hopeless  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
I'd love to leave you alone  
But I can't let you go  
Oh father,  
Please father  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
  
It's been five years  
Since we've spoken last  
And you can't take back  
What we never had  
I can be manipulated  
Only so many times  
Before even "I Love You"  
Starts to sound like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?  
How you push me our of your world?  
Lied to your flesh and your blood  
Put your hands on the ones that you swore ou loved  
Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?  
How could you throw me right out of your world?  
So young when the pain had begun  
Now forever afraid of being loved  
  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't let you go  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
For the love of a daughter

Reasons why you ran  
Don't make you a good man  
Yes, I understand  
You were on time at the wrong time  
I was there (?) tried  
And I don't know why you can act cold on a diamond so out of line  
For you (for you)  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (How come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)  
But I get nothing at all  
  
Reasons for my hope  
All make me a big joke  
I already know  
You were just fine  
I was just fine  
Why did we turn a good time to a dark one?  
I gave you a chance  
But the better man never called  
Oh, oh  
  
For you (For you)  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (how come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion champion)  
But I get nothing at all  
But I get nothing at all  
But I get nothing at all  
For you (for you)  
I'd do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I'd do anything for you (for you, for you)  
Nail my heart to the ceiling (ceiling, ceiling)  
I'd put my fist through a wall  
How come (How come)  
I stick around when I break down (break down, break down)  
I take the blows like a champion (champion, champion)  
But I get nothing at all (but I get nothing, but I get nothing at all)  
I get nothing at all  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything for you  
I would do anything

Don't walk away like you always do  
This time  
Baby you're the only thing that's been  
On my mind  
Ever since you left I've been a mess  
(You won't answer your phone)  
I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone  
But I gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna get back  
To the old days  
When the phone would ring  
And I knew it was you  
I wanna talk back  
And get yelled at  
Fight for nothing  
Like we used to  
Oh, kiss me  
Like you mean it  
Like you miss me  
Cause I know you do  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
With you  
  
Don't look at me that way  
I see it in your  
Eyes  
Don't worry about me  
I've been  
Fine  
I'm not gonna lie  
I've been a mess  
Since you left  
And every time I see you  
It gets more and more intense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You were the only one I wanted  
And you were the first one I fell for  
You're the only one that im in need of  
And I don't want to be lonely anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
  
Oh, kiss me  
Like you mean it  
Like you miss me  
Cause I know that you do  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
Get back  
Yeah!

Sometimes you think you'll be fine by yourself  
'Cause a dream is a wish you make all alone  
It's easy to feel like you don't need help  
But it's harder to walk on your own  
  
You'll change  
Inside  
When you  
Realize  
  
The world comes to life  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
The gift of a friend  
  
Someone who knows when your lost and your scared  
There through the highs and the lows  
Someone you can count on, someone who cares  
Besides you where ever you go  
  
You'll change inside  
When you  
Realize  
The world comes to life  
  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
By your side  
  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
Believe in  
The gift of a friend  
  
And when your hope crashes down  
Shattering to the ground  
You'll, you'll feel all alone  
When you don't know which way to go  
And there's no signs leading you home  
You're not alone  
  
The world comes to life  
And everything's bright  
From beginning to end  
When you have a friend  
  
By your side  
That helps you to find  
The beauty of all  
When you'll open your heart and  
  
Believe in  
When you believe in  
You can believe in

The day I first met you  
You told me you never fall in love  
But now that I get you  
I know fear is what it really was  
  
Now here we are so close yet so far  
Haven't I passed the test?  
When will you realize  
Baby I'm not like the rest  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know your scared it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait to waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
A Sunday you went home alone  
There were tears in your eyes  
I called your cell phone, my love  
But you did not reply  
  
The world is ours if you want it  
We can take it, if you just take my hand  
There's no turning back now  
Baby try to understand  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know you're scared it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait to waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
When your lips are on my lips  
And our hearts beat as one  
But you slip out of my fingertips  
Every time you run  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know your scared it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait to waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
'Cause you been hurt before  
I can see it in your eyes  
You try to smile it away  
Some things you can't disguise  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Baby I can ease the ache, the ache  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
The day I first met you  
You told me you never fall in love

You pull me in with your smile  
You make me melt with your voice  
Now I've been gone now for awhile  
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice  
And I don't wanna pay the cost  
But it be best if you get lost  
Cause you know you'll never change  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't say that you need me  
And don't play these games in my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And don't say its forever  
And don't play cause you had your shot  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught  
  
You promise me all of your time  
I guess I'm not they only one  
The thing its my heart on the line this time  
I'm your number one or I'm gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No don't try to get me back  
I wont forget about our past  
I never had the guts to leave  
Now your making it  
Now your making it much easier for me to see  
  
And don't say that you sorry  
Your breaking every inch of my heart  
I should've known from the start now it's time to get lost  
And don't say that you need me  
And don't play these games in my mind  
You better get out of my head cause your wasting your time  
And don't say its forever  
And don't play cause you had you shot  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught  
You better stop messing around cause you gonna get caught.

I can't take your hand  
And lead you to the water  
I can't make you feel  
What you don't feel but you know you wanna  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
  
Underneath the surface  
There so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
And that's what I need to let go  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
Kick senseless my defenses  
Tell me what your gonna do  
I need you to light the fuse  
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls  
You just might need dynamite  
  
Got dynamite?  
  
I can't paint this picture  
Just so you can hang it  
  
I can't wait  
For you to understand  
If you just don't get it  
  
Find out how to crack me  
Log in try to hack me  
Underneath the surface  
There is so much you need to know  
And you might feel like your drowning  
But that's what I need to let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the walls come crashing down  
I hope you're standing right in front of me  
Where my past lies all around  
Cause all you need to save me is to intervene  
And make the walls come crashing down  
  
Got dynamite!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got dynamite  
I got dynamite

[Verse:]  
You think that you're so slick  
I got something for you  
Hold that thought- you're old news, older than my old shoes  
Since you like to play games, grow up, act your damn age  
Tricks for kids, you're so lame, but you never really loved me the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out

Ha, ay  
Ha, ay

We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"

Go home to your mother 'cause you're just another sucker

We in the party like, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You dress like a corn fall  
Smiley faces on your drawls  
Immature, you're so wrong  
Don't come back 'till long gone  
Can't you see I'm priceless?  
Don't have sense to notice it  
Thought you had a hold of it, but you never really loved me the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out

Don't wanna see your face no more  
Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut the front door (x3)

When your soul finds the soul it was waiting for  
When someone walks into your heart through an open door  
When your hand finds the hand it was meant to hold  
Don't let go  
Someone comes into your world  
Suddenly your world has changed forever  
  
No there's no one else's eyes  
That could see into me  
No one else's arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
When you're one with the one you were meant to be find  
Everything falls in place, all the stars align  
When you're touched by the cloud that has touched your soul  
Don't let go  
Someone comes into your life  
It's like they've been in your life forever  
  
No there's no one else's eyes  
That could see into me  
No one else's arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
So now we've found our way to find each other  
So now I found my way, to you  
  
No there's no one else's eyes  
That could see into me  
  
No there's no one else's eyes  
That could see into me  
No one else's arms can lift  
Lift me up so high  
Your love lifts me out of time  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart  
  
And you know my heart by heart

Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)  
Here comes the sun, and I say  
It's all right  
  
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter  
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, and I say  
It's all right  
  
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces  
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, and I say  
It's all right  
  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes  
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

It's all right  
  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun, and I say

I throw all of your stuff away  
Then I clear you out of my head  
I tear you out of my heart  
And ignore all your messages  
  
I tell everyone we are through  
Cause I'm so much better without you  
But it's just another pretty lie  
Cause I break down  
  
Every time you come around  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
So how did you get here  
Under my skin?  
I swore that I'd never let you back in  
Should have known better  
Than trying to let you go  
Cause here we go go go again  
Hard as I try I know I can't quit  
Something about you  
Is so addictive  
We're falling together  
You'd think that by now I'd know  
Cause here we go go go again  
  
You never know what you want  
And you never say what you mean  
But I start to go insane  
Every time that you look at me  
  
You only hear half of what I say  
And you're always showing up too late  
And I know that I should say goodbye  
But it's no use  
  
Can't be with or without you  
O oh o oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
And again (and again)  
And again (and again)  
And again  
  
I threw all of your stuff away  
And I cleared you out of my head  
And I tore you out of my heart  
O oh o oh  
O oh o oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause here we go go go again  
Again (again) again and again and again  
And again and again and again and again  
And again and again and again and again and again

I know that you think that this is probably my fault!  
(We do!)  
The catty comments, and the constant assaults!  
(It's cool!)  
I was here once, and seen a lot!  
So listen if you wanna survive  
  
Inside this High School Miserable  
I never thought I'd be invisible  
In this High School Miserable  
You gotta keep being indivisible  
In this High School Miserable  
Don't understand what is happening to me  
In this High School Miserable  
Someone get me back on tv!  
  
I thought the girls here would go crazy for me  
I flubbed a test, I'm clearly getting a D  
I never knew how high my undies would go  
There's tons of wedgies, I didn't know  
Like the the hoodie the Hourglass (ow!)  
The 360 spin! (that hurt)  
The fig leg, The bat the bowling pin (strike)  
The donkey, The monkey, man am I sore  
I can't believe their's 28 more  
Neat!  
  
Someone get me back on tv

When a cowboy loves a cowgirl  
They attract together  
But when a forcefield breaks them apart  
They won't survive forever  
It's like "It's over", We're done", "Forget about me"  
It's like "My first boy friend already dumped me"  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
  
At our first wedding  
You took the flowers from the vase  
You hit me with those flowers  
And I hit you with your case  
It's like "I don't", It's over", "I was wrong"  
The relationship is why I'm writing this song  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
It's a country thing  
When I write a song for you,  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
  
It's like "I don't wanna be with you"  
It's like "We're done and over this time"  
It's like "We don't have nothing in common"  
It's like Uh... I ran out of rhymes  
  
That's hillbilly love  
That's country you see  
Let's pretend that couple  
Was You and Me  
But then we broke up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
  
Hillbilly love  
It's a country thing  
When I write a song for you,  
I gotta sing  
But when we break up  
It's not pretty like a dove  
And that's hillbilly love  
Hillbilly Love  
Hillbilly Love

If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
  
I'd say hold up  
Broken out of nowhere, showed up  
I'm in love  
This heist got me skipping a heart beat  
I'm giving up  
  
I wanna run, run, run away  
In your getaway car, make a getaway  
  
[Chorus]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender  
I'll give you anything you want  
Just don't leave me alone  
This is a hold up, this is a hold up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
  
Hey, stranger  
I'm addicted to the danger of the touch  
Now you're wanted  
Better keep me as your hostage  
Tie me up  
  
I wanna run, run, run away  
In your getaway car, make a getaway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody get down  
Get down on the floor, floor  
Everybody get down  
Nobody gets hurt, hurt  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If you're gonna take me down, I surrender  
I'll give you anything you want  
Just don't leave me alone  
This is a hold up, this is a hold up  
  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up

I can only imagine  
Surrounded by your glory,  
What will my heart feel  
  
Will I dance for you Jesus  
Or in awe of you be still  
Will I stand in your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall  
  
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speek at all  
I can only imagine  
Yeah, I can only imagine  
  
I can only imagine  
Surrounded by your glory,  
What will my heart feel  
  
Will I dance for you Jesus  
Or in awe of you be still  
Will I stand in your presence  
Or to my knees will I fall  
  
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speek at all  
I can only imagine  
Yeah, I can only imagine

Pictures in my pocket  
Are faded from the washer  
I can barely just make out your face  
Food you saved for later  
In my refrigerator  
It's been too long since later never came  
  
I know  
One day eventually  
Yeah, I know  
One day I'll have to let it all go  
But I keep it just in case  
Yeah, I keep it just in case  
  
In case  
You don't find what you're looking for  
In case  
You're missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind, I'll be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
  
Strong enough to leave you  
But weak enough to need you  
Cared enough to let you walk away  
I took that dirty jacket  
From the trash right where you left it  
'Cause I couldn't stand to see it go to waste  
  
I know  
One day eventually  
Yeah, I know  
One day I'll have to let it all go  
But I keep it just in case  
Yeah, I keep it just in case  
  
In case  
You don't find what you're looking for  
In case  
You're missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind, I'll be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
In case  
  
You're looking in that mirror one day  
And miss my arms  
How they wrapped around your waist  
I say that you can love me again  
Even if it isn't the case  
  
Ohh  
You don't find what you're looking for  
Ohh  
You're missing my love  
You don't find what you're looking for  
In case  
You're missing what you had before  
In case  
You change your mind, I'll be waiting here  
In case  
You just want to come home  
In case  
Yeah, ooh

In real life I'm waking up alone  
It's one more night you didn't make it home  
And one more time you won't pick up the phone  
In real life you never bring me flowers  
When you're here it's only for an hour  
I'm getting used to being on my own  
  
Because in real life you're not what I thought  
Real life, this isn't what I want  
Guess things aren't always what they seem  
  
[Chorus]  
But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses  
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always  
Gonna be, gonna be this way  
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me  
Two hearts finally colliding  
Then I wake up and realize, realize this is real life  
  
Real life, this is real life, real life, real life  
Real life, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh, real life  
  
In real life it doesn't always work out  
People fall in love and then they fall out  
Hearts can break and never make a sound  
  
Because in real life you're not what I thought  
Real life, this isn't what I want  
Guess things aren't always what they seem  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just when I thought this was all real life could be  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Somebody came along and made my dream reality  
  
And now in real life, waking up to roses  
Champagne, kisses and I know it's always, always  
Gonna be, gonna be this way  
In my dreams, he's standing right beside me  
Two hearts finally colliding  
When I wake up, I realize, realize this is real life

Oh  
Here I am  
Feels like the walls are closing in  
Once again it's time to face it and be strong  
I wanna do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I've lost my way  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up this mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
Maybe it's not to late, oh  
  
So I'll take a stand  
Even though it's complicated  
If I can I wanna change the way I've made it  
I've gotta do the right thing now  
I know it's up to me somehow  
I'll find my way  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around, yeah  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
  
I'm gonna find the strength  
To be the one who that holds it all together  
Show you that I'm sorry  
But I know that we can make it better  
  
If I could take it all back I would now  
I never meant to let you all down  
And now I've got to try to turn it all around  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise  
I'm gonna clean up the mess I made  
(Mess I made)  
Maybe it's not to late  
  
I never meant to let you all down  
Now I've got to try (got to try) to turn it all around (all around)  
And figure out how to fix this  
I know there's a way so I promise (promise)  
I'm gonna clean up this mess I made  
Maybe it's not to late  
Maybe it's not to late

I saw you on the front page of the letter  
She had to run away but you just wouldn't let her  
So what is she supposed to do  
She can't do anything when she's with you  
Try to find her heart but it's so lost  
Now it's time to show you who's boss  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be'  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
When she finds the one  
Her heart starts to jump  
She thinks he's never gone  
He's says hell never run  
Away with her heart  
It's no longer lost  
It's time to show you who's boss  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things  
She can be  
Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhhh  
Gotta get back to her heart  
Tell her where to go when she starts  
To cry and ask  
The world why  
  
Well baby... Here it comes  
  
123 she doesn't wanna be  
Held down so she can't see  
All of the coolest things

Nobody knows but me  
Take a chance a see  
She gonna make wish  
So kiss this  
2x  
  
C'mon c'mon and kiss this you can't c'mon and kiss this  
  
Ohhh

I am confident, but  
I still have my moments.  
Baby, that's just me.  
  
I'm not a supermodel  
I still eat McDonald's.  
Baby, that's just me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, some may say I need to be afraid  
Of losing everything.  
Because of where I  
Had my start and,  
Where I made my name.  
But everything's the same  
In a la la land machine. Machine.  
  
Who said I can't wear my  
Converse with my dress?  
Oh, baby, that's just me!  
  
And who said I can't be single  
I have to go out and mingle  
Baby, that's not me.  
No, no.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me do you feel the way I feel  
Cause nothing else is real  
In the la-la land appeal.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I'm not gonna change  
In a la la land machine  
Well I will stay the same  
In la la land  
  
Machine  
  
I won't change anything of my life  
(I won't change anything of my life)  
I'm staying myself tonight  
(I'm staying myself tonight)

Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold you back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
  
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight  
Not a footprint to be seen  
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen  
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside  
Couldn't keep it in  
Heaven knows I try  
  
Don't let them in, don't let them see  
Be the good girl you always have to be  
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know  
Well now they know  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small  
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all  
Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe  
I know left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Standing frozen in the life I've chosen  
You won't find me, the past is all behind me  
Buried in the snow  
  
Let it go, let it go  
Can't hold it back anymore  
Let it go, let it go  
Turn my back and slam the door  
And here I stand  
And here I'll stay  
Let it go, let it go  
The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Let it go  
Here I stand  
Let it go, let it go  
Let it go

The slightest words you said  
Have all gone to my head  
I hear angels sing in your voice  
When you pull me close  
Feelings I've never known  
They mean everything  
And leave me no choice  
  
Light on my heart, light on my feet  
Light in your eyes I can't even speak  
Do you even know how you make me weak  
  
I'm a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word I'm blown away  
You're in control of my heart  
I'm a lightweight  
Easy to fall, easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
  
Make a promise, please  
You'll always be in reach  
Just in case I need  
You there when I call  
This is all so new  
Seems too good to be true  
Could this really be  
A safe place to fall  
  
Light on my heart, light on my feet  
Light in your eyes I can't even speak  
Do you even know how you make me weak, oh whoa?  
  
I'm a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word I'm blown away  
You're in control of my heart  
I'm a lightweight  
Easy to fall, easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling down  
  
Drowned in your love  
It's almost all too much  
Handle with care  
Say you'll be there  
  
Oh, I'm a lightweight  
Better be careful what you say  
With every word I'm blown away  
You're in control of my heart  
I'm a lightweight  
Easy to fall, easy to break  
With every move my whole world shakes  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling apart  
Keep me from falling apart, oh  
Falling apart

Our love runs deep like a chevy  
If you fall I'll fall with you baby  
'Cause that's the way we like to do it  
That's the way we like  
  
You run around open doors like a gentleman  
Tell me girl every day you're my everything  
'Cause that's the way you like to do it  
That's the way you like  
  
Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine  
Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time  
Just you and I, just you and I  
Woah, woah  
  
No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say,  
I know that we'll never break  
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA  
Made in the USA, yeah  
  
You always reading my mind like a letter  
When I'm cold, you're there like a sweater  
'Cause that's the way we like to do it  
That's the way we like  
And never ever let the world get the best of you  
Every night we're apart, I'm still next to you  
'Cause that's the way I like to do it  
That's the way I like  
  
We touch down on the east coast  
Dinner in the sky rise, winter is the best time for walking in the city lights  
You and I, you and I  
Woah woah  
  
No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say,  
I know that we'll never break  
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA  
  
'Cause baby I'll break the bullet  
And take the blow for love  
Woah, our love was made in the USA  
Made in the USA, made in the USA  
  
No matter how far we go, I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad, and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say,  
I know that we'll never break  
'Cause our love was made, made in the USA  
Made in the USA, yeah  
  
Made in the U.S.  
Made in the U.S.  
Made in the U.S.A.

They say the beat of a butterflie's wings  
Can set off a storm in the world away  
What if that ride in the smallest of things  
Can power the strongest hurricane?  
What if it all begins inside?  
We hold the key that turns the tide.  
  
Chorus:  
Just a pebble in the water (ohh)  
Can set the sea in motion (ohh)  
A simple act of kindness (ohh)  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love  
Heaven knows what we could change (oh yeah)  
So throw a pebble in the water (oh yeah)  
And make a wave, make a wave.  
Make a wave, make a wave.  
  
The single joys that you take and send  
And you can thrust your hand with someone in need (help somebody)  
Don't fool yourself and say you can't  
You never know what can grow from just one seed (yeah).  
  
So come with me and seize the day  
This world may never be the same.  
  
Chorus:  
Just a pebble in the water,  
(Just a pebble in the water)  
Can set the sea in motion,  
(Can set the sea in motion)  
A simple act of kindness (ohh)  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love,  
(If we show a little love)  
Heaven knows what we can change,  
(Heaven knows what we can change)  
So throw a pebble in the water,  
(So throw a pebble in the water)  
Make a wave, make a wave.  
  
Just show a little love  
You never know what we can change  
Just throw a pebble in the water (ohh)  
Make a wave, make a wave.

I can make the rain stop if I wanna,  
Just like my attitude  
I can take my laptop record a snapshot  
And change your point of view  
  
I just entered this brand new world  
And I'm so open hearted  
I know I've got a long way to go but I  
I'm I'm just getting started  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
I go where life takes me,  
But some days it makes me want to change my direction  
Sometimes it gets lonely,  
But I know that it's only a matter of my perception  
I just entered this brand new world  
And I'm so open hearted  
I know I've got a long way to go but I'm  
I'm just getting started  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
And baby there is nothing like this moment  
To just be real and let the truth be spoken  
Whatever's broke I can make it unbroken  
Turn the lead in my hand into something golden  
Just try more love, if I try more love then I'll find  
Myself and time.  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
I'll find myself in time,  
I know I'll find myself in time

I knew where I was going when you left the room  
You're the kinda guy that makes me want to  
Follow through to you  
I've been trying to leave you for the longest time  
The second that I saw you I just knew I found my right guy  
  
I like it [Repeat: x6]  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna crash  
I wanna fall  
I wanna be somewhere in the middle.  
Somewhere in the middle  
Something  
It's better than nothing  
I just need a little  
I just need a little cause I  
Don't wanna be nowhere  
But somethings makin' me go there  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
I like it [Repeat: x6]  
  
Losing my direction,  
That's the way it should be  
Feeling a connection  
When you're standing next to me  
I wanna be rolling  
I just wanna be rolling with you.  
  
All of the things you say  
I like it  
Taking me far away  
I like it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you take me  
You wanna take me from this crazy place  
Baby  
Cause I just need a little  
I just need a little  
Somewhere in the middle with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Crash  
Fall  
I like it I like it  
Somewhere in the middle with you

Now that I'm thinking sober  
Don't you try to get no closer  
I'm just gonna get my car and drive, and drive  
Looking in the rear view mirror  
Everything is so much clearer  
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye  
  
The lights flashing giving me all the danger signs  
Someone to save, to save but it don't work that way  
  
[Chorus]  
Think you made your greatest mistake  
I'm not gonna call this a break  
Think you really blew it this time  
Think you could walk on such a thin line  
Won't be taking your midnight calls  
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall  
I see it written on your face  
You know you made it, your greatest mistake  
  
When the last straw is broken  
When the last door is closing  
I ain't that dumb to stick around, stick around  
I ain't got the time for looking back  
When you let yourself slip through the cracks  
And you just keep going down, down, down  
  
I must stay undercover, lay low, need some time  
No one to save, to save these sick cycles over me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why you looking at me, spitting the same old line  
Trying bring back ain't no flipping my mind  
Don't you get it by now the story's over, over  
Still calling my name outside my house  
I'm hitting the switch, watch the lights go out  
Watch the lights go out  
  
I hope you ache, ache, ache, ah-oh-oh  
I hope you ache, ache, ache, ah-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
[Chorus]

I can't help myself but think of what you've done for me  
Day or night it seems that you are always on my mind  
And I know whenever I need you near  
I always feel that you will be there right by my side  
  
Your love runs deep within my soul, and I can't let go  
You'll never leave me, because I know  
That you are the one for me  
  
You're the one who moves me  
You're the one who sees right through me  
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday  
You're the one who makes feel a brand new life that's so unreal  
When I think of you and I, you do  
You're the one who moves me  
Moves me, oh, you move me, you move me  
  
What I did without your love is a mystery  
Now I have you, oh I don't, wanna let you down  
Everyday it feels like a dream come true  
And I pray that you will always be around  
  
Your love runs deep within my soul, and I can't let go  
You'll never leave me, because I know  
That you are the one for me  
  
You're the one who moves me  
You're the one who sees right through me,  
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday  
You're the one who makes me feel, a brand new life that's so unreal  
When I think of you and I, you do  
You're the one that moves me,  
  
When I am down and all alone  
You are the one who cares  
When I am weak, you make me strong  
And I know that you'll always be there, yeah  
Moves me, moves me  
  
You're the one who moves me  
You're the one who sees right through me,  
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday  
You're the one who makes me feel, a brand new life that's so unreal  
When I think of you and I, you do  
You're the one that moves me,  
  
You're the one who moves me  
You're the one who sees right through me,  
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday  
You're the one who makes me feel, a brand new life that's so unreal  
When I think of you and I, you do  
You're the one that moves me

The space in between us  
Starts to feel like the world's apart  
Like I'm going crazy  
And you say it's raining in your heart  
You're telling me nobody's there  
To try and fly  
Oh but that's just crazy  
'Cause baby I told ya I'm here for good  
  
My love's like a star, yeah  
You can't always see me  
But you know that I'm always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember I'm always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby I'm on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow yeah  
It won't be long  
Just know that you're not alone  
  
I tried to build the walls  
To keep you safe when I'm not around  
But as soon as I'm away from you  
You say they come tumbling down  
But it's not about the time  
That we don't get to spend together  
It's about how strong our love is  
When I'm gone and it feels like forever  
  
My love's like a star yeah  
You can't always see me  
But you know that I'm always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember I'm always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby I'm on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow yeah  
It won't be long  
Just know that you're not alone  
  
You say that time away makes your heart grow out  
But I can stay just to prove you wrong  
Oh look at how far we've come  
Don't you know  
Don't know that you're the one  
  
My love's like a star yeah  
You can't always see me  
But you know that I'm always there  
When you see one shining  
Take it as mine  
And remember I'm always near  
If you see a comet  
Baby I'm on it  
Making my way back home  
Just follow the glow, yeah  
It won't be long  
Just know that you're not alone

[Verse 1]  
Last night was crazy  
And today it's setting in  
Did you really mean it and  
Could you say it again?  
Oh, Oh  
Even if you say it over the phone (Come on and make it real)  
  
Love makes me crazy, dumb, restless, and paranoid  
But I'll take a chance on us and  
Hope you don't destroy my heart  
Just give me one guarantee  
I'm the only girl you see what you say boy?  
  
[Chorus]  
Your my only shorty,  
Your my only shorty  
I'm telling you the truth, girl,  
It's only you  
You're my only, you're my only,  
You're my only, one and only  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Verse 2]  
Every night and day  
You got an open invitation, whoa  
As long as I'm your one and only destination  
Fly with me,  
I'll be your fantasy  
You're in demand  
But baby, baby, so am I  
But if you're weak and try to sneak  
I'll have to tell you bye, bye  
  
I'm gonna put you on the spot  
Am I your only girl or not?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
What you say boy?  
  
[Chorus]  
You're my only shorty,  
You're my only shorty  
I'm telling you the truth, girl,  
It's only you  
You're my only, you're my only,  
You're my only, one and only  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Bridge]  
Please, baby, please, give me  
All your attention, say it  
Don't let my heart go  
Seeking no other direction  
I've gotta be the only one for your affection,  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention  
  
[Chorus]  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)  
You're my only shorty  
(Baby, come clean)  
I'm telling you the truth, oh, girl,  
It's only you, oh  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
You're my only shorty  
(Am I your only shorty?)(x2)  
I'm telling you the truth,  
Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa  
You're my only(x3)  
You're my only shorty  
  
[Outro]  
Am I your only? (x2)  
(Yeah)Tell me,  
Am I your only (Yeah) shorty?  
Yes you are (I want to hear you say yeah)  
Yes you are.  
Am I your only shorty?

Be still my heart 'cause it's freaking out

I felt picture perfect  
On and off a shelf to a broken frame of mind, a broken frame of mind  
It comes back and haunts me  
A bullet undercover, it fooled me every time, it fooled me every time  
  
But even if I lose it all  
I've got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no  
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid  
  
I will love you  
Like I've never been hurt  
Run through fire for you  
Like I've never been burned.  
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost  
Gonna give it all I've got  
I will love you,  
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt  
  
You set fire to ashes  
You fought through the darkness and brought me back to life, you brought me
back to life  
  
So even if I lose it all  
I got so much left to give, I won't give up, no, no  
My heart's on the front-line, I'm not afraid  
  
I will love you,  
Like I've never been hurt  
Run through fire for you,  
Like I've never been burned  
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost  
Gonna give it all I've got  
I will love you,  
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt  
  
I will love you and forever  
I will love you like I never  
Like I never heard goodbye  
Like I never heard a lie  
Like I'm falling into love for the first time  
Yeah  
  
I will love you,  
Like I've never been hurt  
Run through fire for you,  
Like I've never been burned  
I'm gonna risk it all like I've never lost  
Gonna give it all I've got  
I will love you,  
I will love like I've never been hurt, never been hurt

My state of mind  
Has finally got the best of me  
I need you next to me  
I'll try to find a way that I can  
Get to you  
Just wanna to get to you  
  
The world I see is perfect now  
You're all around  
With you I can breath  
  
Until You're Mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until You're Mine  
Not gonna be even  
Close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)  
  
Alone inside, I can  
Only hear your voice  
Ringing through the noise  
Can't find my mind  
Keeps on coming back to you  
Always back to you  
  
Wanted something out of reach  
It's killing me  
You're all I see, yeah  
  
Until You're Mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until You're Mine  
Not gonna be  
Even close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)  
  
Just stop wondering  
If we were meant to be  
Forget about fate and just hold me  
Ready to begin  
The waiting has to end  
Right now, today  
I've gotta find a way  
Mine!  
Until You're Mine  
  
Until you're mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until you're mine  
Not gonna be even close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine  
  
My state of mind  
Has finally got the best of me  
I need you next to me

I can't sleep tonight  
Wide awake and so confused  
Everything's in line  
But I am bruised  
I need a voice to echo  
I need a light to take me home  
I kinda need a hero  
Is it you?  
  
I never see the forest for the trees  
I could really use your melody  
Baby I'm a little blind  
I think it's time for you to find me  
  
Can you be my nightingale?  
Sing to me  
I know you're there  
You could be my sanity  
Bring me peace  
Sing me to sleep  
Say you'll be my nightingale  
  
Somebody speak to me  
'Cause I'm feeling like hell  
Need you to answer me  
I'm overwhelmed  
I need a voice to echo  
I need a light to take me home  
I need a star to follow  
I don't know  
  
I never see the forest for the trees  
I could really use your melody  
Baby I'm a little blind  
I think it's time for you to find me  
  
Can you be my nightingale?  
Sing to me  
I know you're there  
You could be my sanity  
Bring me peace  
Sing me to sleep  
Say you'll be my nightingale  
  
I don't know what I'd do without you  
Your words are like a whisper come through  
As long as you are with me here tonight  
I'm good  
  
Can you be my nightingale?  
Still so close  
I know you're there  
Oh, nightingale  
You sing to me  
I know you're there  
'Cause baby you're my sanity  
You bring me peace  
Sing me to sleep  
Say you'll be my nightingale  
  
Oh  
Mm, mm  
Mm

I didn't wanna say I'm sorry  
For breaking us apart  
I didn't wanna say It was my fault  
Even though I knew it was  
  
I didn't wanna call you back  
Cause I knew that I was wrong  
Yeah, I knew I was wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
Wanted to call  
No need to fight  
You know I wouldn't lie  
But tonight  
We'll leave it on the line  
  
Listen baby,  
  
Never would've said forever  
If we knew it ends so fast  
Why did you say I love you  
If you knew that it wouldn't last?  
  
Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying  
The line is breaking up  
Or is that just us?  
Or is that just us?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I try to call again, I get your mailbox  
Like a letter left unread  
Apologies are often open ended  
But this one's better left unsaid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We'll leave it on the line  
Yeah, oh yeah  
We'll leave it on the line, tonight

We're done, but it's not over. we'll start it again  
After the end of the day, it keeps getting better  
Don't be afraid, we'll do it together.  
  
Come on, come on, you know  
It's your time to move it's my time to move  
Come on, come on, let go  
Leave it all behind, your past and mine  
  
[Chorus]  
Gone are the days of summer  
We couldn't change it if we tried  
Why would we want to, let's go where we got to  
Out paths will cross again in time  
It's never the same tomorrow,  
And tomorrow is never clear  
  
So come on, come on, you know  
Our time, our time is here  
  
We know, but were not certain  
How can we be, how can we see what's ahead  
The road keeps on turning  
And all we can do, is travel each day to the next  
  
Come on, come on, you know  
It's your time to move it's my time to move  
Come on, come on let go,  
Leave it all behind, your past and mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
Gone are the days of summer  
We couldn't change it if we tried  
(If we tried)  
So come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on  
So come on, come on you know  
Our time, our time  
Is here, yeah-oh

Saw you lookin at me  
Now I think you  
Moving this way  
Your pushing  
Through the crowd  
Like you got  
Something to say  
But you  
Couldn't get to me  
'Cause the music's  
Taking over your feet  
I can tell by your toes  
That you're rocking  
To this beat  
You gotta dance and sway  
Til you drop and break  
Free your soul  
Let me see you shake  
One by one  
We're stealing the stage  
Here we come so get  
Out of our way  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud  
  
Now it's going strait  
To your head  
Hanging in red, yea  
But your learn  
How to move  
To the grove  
Again and again  
Raise your hands  
In the are  
I'm a champion  
  
Were all dolled up  
With no where to go  
You want to get out  
And lose up the show  
Rock and roll  
Is staying home  
As long as you catch  
Your ready to go  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get you party on  
And were screaming  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
Don't wait  
Don't you be late  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud  
  
You can learn it too  
Don't follow the rules  
I've seen those moves  
There in the way  
You make me move  
  
It won't be long  
Till the summers gone  
Get you party on  
And were screaming  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
Don't wait  
Don't you be late  
Get your party on  
Now were singin'  
Hold on tight  
It's a crazy night  
Get your party on  
And were screaming  
Out loud

I hear what you're not saying  
It's driving me crazy  
It's like we stopped breathing in this room  
  
We're both the last to be leaving  
I know what you're thinking  
I wish you'd make your move  
  
[Chorus]  
It's much too quiet in here  
I wanna disappear  
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear  
It's too quiet in here  
Make it all go away  
Why can't we break this silence finally  
  
It's like you know where I'm going  
You follow me home  
But I never invite you inside  
  
I see what you're not showing  
I got you alone but  
The air is so still it's weird  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop don't stop  
Telling me goodnight  
Just promise you'll kiss me goodbye  
What's taking so long  
  
Don't tell me you're not goin' try  
The tensions building in my mind  
I want to scream and I know why  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Make it all go away  
It's too quiet in here

You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all  
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall  
Maybe I shoulda known, maybe I shoulda known  
That you would walk, you would walk out the door  
  
Hey!  
  
Said we were done, you met someone and rubbed it in my face  
Cut to the punch, she broke your heart, and then she ran away  
I guess you shoulda known, I guess you shoulda known  
That I would talk, I would talk  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
Even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
  
I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you  
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you  
Oh no not anymore, oh no not anymore  
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go  
  
Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared  
I'll walk right up to you and put one finger in the air  
And make you understand, and make you understand  
You had your chance, had your chance  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
Even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really don't care  
Oh oh oh I really don't care

I feel a separation coming on.  
Cause I know that you want to be moving on.  
  
And I wish that it would snow tonight  
You pull me in, avoid a fight.  
Cause I feel,  
A separation coming on.  
  
Just prove that there is nothing left to try.  
Cause the truth.  
I'd rather we'd just both deny  
  
You kiss me with those open eyes.  
It says so much.  
It's no surprise, to you,  
But I've got something left to say.  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender,  
Please remember, remember December.  
We were so in love back then.  
Are you listening  
To what they say?  
Don't go that way.  
Remember, remember, December.  
Please remember.  
  
Don't surrender.  
  
You said, you wouldn't let them change your mind.  
Cause when we're together fire melts the ice.  
Our hearts are both on overdrive,  
Come with me let's run tonight.  
Don't let,  
These memories be left behind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I remember, us together,  
With the promise, of forever.  
We can do this,  
Fight the pressure.  
Please remember December.  
  
Don't surrender.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't surrender.

I'm gonna rock this place like outta space  
Give you something that you never had  
I'm gonna paint my nails  
And style my hair  
And save me a strawberry bubble bath  
  
I'm gonna sweep my mind  
And the time I'll find  
That I got summet to say  
I'm gonna jump around  
And paint this town  
Let me hear you say  
Hey  
  
Take me, take me down, take me down  
Ride  
Now follow, follow me now, follow me now  
Ride  
  
Turn it up

I glanced upon the ground today I noticed something,  
It followed me  
Along the way, a figure of gray,  
Impersonating every move I make  
  
For now we'll call it my shadow,  
And it said will you replace it,  
So you'll be with me every where I go...  
  
Sentences of yours,  
Running throughout my head,  
Searching for a chance  
To catch my breath,  
A never-ending dream,  
You'll become a part of me,  
Day or night,  
Dark or light you'll be,  
Taking over that thing called my  
Shadow  
  
And what happens on the days when,  
The clouds appear and fade away my  
Shade, oh, that's our cue babe,  
We'll run away to a place where the sun  
Always shines  
  
That not even time could erase,  
You're my weakness babe but you give me  
Strength, I need you,  
I need you like the blood in my veins.  
  
Sentences of yours,  
Running throughout my head,  
Searching for a chance  
To catch my breath,  
A never-ending dream,  
You'll become a part of me,  
Day or night, dark or light you'll be,  
Taking over that thing called my  
Shadow

See you calling again  
I don't wanna pick up, no oh  
I've been laying in bed  
Probably thinking too much, oh oh  
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times  
I don't reply, you know the reason why  
  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby  
Stop right now, you'll only let me down, oh oh  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
  
Trying not to forget, should be easier than this oh oh  
And all the birthdays you've missed  
I was only a kid oh oh  
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times  
I don't reply, you know the reason why  
  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby  
Stop right now, you'll only let me down, oh oh  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
To me  
  
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times  
  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby  
Stop right now, you'll only let me down, oh oh  
Maybe you shouldn't come back  
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me  
Baby you shouldn't come back to me

Skies are crying  
I am watching  
Catching tear drops in my hands  
Only silence  
Has an ending  
Like we never had a chance  
  
Do you have to  
Make me feel like  
There is nothing left of me  
  
[Chorus]  
You can take everything I have  
You can break everything I am  
Like I'm made of glass  
Like I'm made of paper  
Go on and try to tear me down  
I will be rising from the ground  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper  
  
As the smoke clears  
I awaken  
And untangle you from me  
Would it make you  
Feel better  
To watch me while I bleed  
  
All my windows  
Still are broken  
But I'm standing on my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go run run run  
I'm gonna stay right here  
Watch you disappear ya yaa  
Go run run run  
Ya it's a long way down  
But I am closer to the clouds up here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Like a skyscraper)  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper

Off to the races, I'm going places  
Might be a long shot, not gonna waste it  
This is the big break,  
And it's callin' my name, yeah  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
I can't wait, so far, so great  
  
Might need to wing it, still gonna bring it  
Not gonna sink, no, I'm going swimming  
Swing for the fences, sky's not the limit today  
Yeah  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
I can't wait, so far, so great  
  
Everyone says don't get your hopes up  
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder  
I know in the end, just being here is the best  
And it only gets better  
It only gets better! Yeah yeah!  
  
So far, so great, get with it  
At least that's how I see it  
Having a dream's just the beginning  
  
So far, so great, believe it  
Can't take away this feeling  
Takin' a ride with chance on my side  
Yeah, I can't wait, so far, so great  
I can't wait, so far, so great  
  
Ba, ba da da da  
Da, da, da, da, da  
Ba, ba, da, da, da,  
Ba, da, da, da, da, yow!

I shoulda known when I got you alone  
That you were way too into me to know  
This isn't love boy, this ain't even close  
But you always think we're something that we're not  
And now you call me every single night  
I only answer 'cause I'm too polite  
We happened once, or maybe it was twice  
Yeah you always make it hard for me to stop  
But you always think we're something that we're not  
  
Hey!  
  
You wanna be more than just friends  
I can't go through this again  
Stop trying get inside my head  
Don't wanna do more than hookup  
It's getting stupid 'cause  
I shoulda known but I forgot  
That you think we're something that we're not  
  
Hey!  
  
I hear you're telling every one you know  
That I'm the one like you can't let me go  
And you just keep on blowing up my phone  
'Cause you never seem to know when you should stop  
Don't introduce me to any of your friends  
Delete my number, don't call me again  
We had some fun, but now it's gonna end  
But you always made it hard for me to stop  
Now you always think we're something that we're not  
  
Hey!  
  
You wanna be more than just friends  
I can't go through this again  
Stop trying get inside my head  
Don't wanna do more than hookup  
It's getting stupid 'cause  
I shoulda known but I forgot  
That you think we're something that we're not  
  
Hey!  
  
Something that we're not  
Hey!  
You think we're something that we're not  
Yeah, you think we're something that we're  
  
Not gonna happen dude  
  
You wanna be more than just friends  
I can't go through this again  
Stop trying get inside my head  
Don't wanna do more than hookup  
It's getting stupid 'cause  
I shoulda known but I forgot  
That you think we're something that we're not  
  
Hey!  
  
Something that we're not  
You think we're something that we're not  
Something that we're not  
Something  
You think we're something that we're not  
But you think we're something that we're not

[Intro]  
Stone cold, stone cold  
You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor  
Stone cold, stone cold  
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore  
  
Stone cold, baby  
God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain  
Give me the truth, me and my heart  
We'll make it through  
If happy is her, I'm happy for you  
  
Hmmmm  
  
Stone cold, stone cold  
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone  
Stone cold, stone cold  
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold  
  
Stone cold, baby  
God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain  
Give me the truth, me and my heart  
We'll make it through  
If happy is her, I'm happy for you  
  
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone  
I wish I could mend this but here's my goodbye  
Oh, I'm happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand  
If happy is her, If happy is her  
I'm happy for you

The night is getting darker  
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us,  
Sing a song for me,  
Lift me higher with your words,  
Sing that cold melody.  
  
So follow me  
Onto the moonlit sidewalk  
And take my hand  
Grip it tighter, and don't let it go  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They only make us stronger.  
  
Did you feel that breeze?  
A tide of chills just swept over me  
It must of been from the brush of your hand  
Pull me into your arms  
A little closer baby  
I wanna see you standing  
Next to me  
  
So take a walk with me,  
But keep the pace down  
I don't want this night to end  
Can't we runaway together?  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word...  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind in the wind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They all make us stronger  
  
The night is getting darker  
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us.

Like a sunset on a hot summer night, like making up after our first big fight  
Wind swept hair, when the moons just right  
Ohh, your a perfect sight  
Come on baby, let me take that wheel  
I'm ready to show you how I fell  
If waht I'm dreaming might be real  
Then I don't wanna waste time, I just wanna make you mine  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
-Music- (For six seconds)  
  
Your oh so sweet, just my luck  
Like a extra marshmellow in my cocoa cup  
Oh no, I can never get enough  
I wonder if you realize, don't need a crown to be my king your already my
Everything  
The words I write and the songs I sing  
The lullaby here inside the melody, I can't deny  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
-Music- (For seven seconds)  
  
My whole worlds turnin' upside down  
Standing still on a merry go round  
Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby  
Ain't got no if's, no and's, no doubts, no maybes  
Well I knew at once, when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said "goodnight, love"  
(Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby)  
(Sure feels like love, sure feels like the right thing baby)  
Sure feels like love tonight  
Sure feels like love!

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Though it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

I've always been the kind of girl  
That hid my face  
So afraid to tell the world  
What I've got to say  
  
But I have this dream  
Bright inside of me  
I'm gonna let it show  
It's time to let you know  
To let you know  
  
This is real, this is me  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed  
To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me  
  
Do you know what it's like  
To feel so in the dark  
To dream about a life  
Where you're the shining star  
  
Even though it seems  
Like it's too far away  
I have to believe in myself  
It's the only way  
  
This is real, this is me  
I'm exactly where I'm supposed  
To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me  
Now I've found who I am  
There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be  
This is me  
  
You're the voice I hear inside my head  
The reason that I'm singin'  
I need to find you  
I gotta find you  
  
You're the missing piece I need  
The song inside of me  
I need to find you  
I gotta find you

To be now gonna let  
The light shine on me

The song inside of me  
  
You're the voice I hear inside my head  
The reason that I'm singin'

There's no way to hold it in  
No more hiding who I want to be

Oh-oh, oh yeah  
Remember love, remember you and me  
Remember everything we shared  
On this planet when we cared  
Remember hearts, remember unity  
Remember loving neighbors without expecting favors  
  
Why be afraid to make an honest mistake  
If you acknowledge the pain  
And you wanna change, you can get through anything  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again  
Can you imagine at all  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song together  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Look at me and look at you  
Now look at me again  
See, we're not so different  
Look around, what do you see  
Were throwing thinks outside our window  
We don't care to keep it clean  
  
I had a dream that beauty was only skin deep  
And if we all just believe  
Love is all we need, nothing else can set you free, yeah  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand, hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again, can we feel love again  
Can you imagine at all, imagine at all  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song together  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh yeah  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, aye  
Singing, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh, oh-whoa-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah  
  
If we could through away the hate  
And make it last another day  
Don't give up just for today  
Life would be so simple  
And then they'd talk about us  
But they will never stop us  
We'll keep singing  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woo  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, come on, we'll keep singing  
Singing, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-yeah, whoa yeah  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh  
  
Do you remember at all  
People walking hand-in-hand, walking hand-in-hand  
Can we feel that love again  
Can you imagine it all, imagine, yeah  
If we all could get along  
Then we all could sing this song  
Together  
  
Ooh, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah  
Hold your hand with your neighbors  
Together, together  
No, da, da-da-da, oh-yeah, oh  
Come and sing it with  
Looking at you, baby, oh, ooh-oh

Don't try to cover up your, your new flame  
That's seething through your eyes.  
I can see it from 10 feet away and I know  
Just who is burning.  
With every kiss you deny  
So what makes you think, that I  
Still care or still want you anymore  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
You can call it pure torture  
Watching your every move with her  
Oh, just the thought of it,  
Knowing what goes on between you  
Makes me sick  
I should've noticed, I should've noticed  
When she came into the picture  
You were always with her  
And she's not leaving.  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
You called me shady  
And now she's your baby doll  
She drove you over,  
Over to break it off  
And this time just maybe  
Maybe you went a little far  
I'm sick of crying about,  
About your new flame  
That's soon to burn out.  
  
So how long has this been  
Going on and one more thing tell me  
Was she the reason you stomped on my heart  
And moved on so quickly  
  
I'm done.

There's a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play  
There's a girl in the window tears rolling down her face  
We're only lost children, trying to find a friend  
Trying to find our way back home  
  
We don't know where to go, so I'll just get lost with you  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together right, we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me, rain down and roll away  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
I know where we could go and never feel let down again  
We could build sandcastles, I'll be the queen, you'll be my king  
We're only lost children, trying to find a friend  
Trying to find our way back home  
  
We don't know where to go, so I'll just get lost with you  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together right, we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me, rain down and roll away  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
Now I can lay my head down and fall asleep  
Oh, but I don't have to fall asleep to see my dreams  
'Cause right there in front of me (right there in front of me)  
There's a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play  
  
We don't know where to go, so I'll just get lost with you  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together right, we fit together right  
These dark clouds over me, rain down and roll away  
We'll never fall apart, 'cause we fit together like  
We fit together like  
Two pieces of a broken heart  
  
There's a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play

Summer came and took me by surprise  
California sunshine in my eyes  
Driving with the top down  
We sing along  
To our favorite song  
Nothing could go wrong  
  
Laughing as we gazed under the moon  
You kissed me and it never felt too soon  
Hard to believe that anything  
Could tear us apart  
I won't let you break my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I know who you are  
You got nothin' on me  
I see I should have known it from the start  
You cant tell me lies don't even try  
Cause this is goodbye  
  
Goodbye  
  
Caught you from the corner of my eye  
You smiled at a girl while passing by  
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong  
I know what's going on  
And it didn't take me long  
  
It wasn't hard to read between the lines  
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine  
Nothing left for you to do or say  
Now I'm on my way  
Now it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say goodbye to broken promises  
Time to face your carelessness  
Don't bore me with apologies  
And come crawling back on your knees  
  
You got nothin' on me  
You got nothin' on me  
You got nothin' on me  
  
I know who you are  
Now I see I should have known it from the start  
  
You cant tell me lies, don't even try  
Cause this is goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodbye

Locked up tight  
Like I would never feel again  
Stuck in some kind of love prison  
And threw away the key (Oh Oh)  
  
Terrified  
Until I stared into your eyes  
Made me start to realize  
The possibilities (So So)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna love you like I've never been broken  
I'm gonna say it like it's never been spoken  
Tonight tonight  
I'm letting go,go,go,go  
I'm gonna give it like it's never been taken  
I'm gonna fall like I don't need saving  
Tonight tonight  
I'm letting go, go, go, go  
  
So played out  
The same lies with a different face  
But there's something in the words you say  
That makes it feel all so real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No need for me to run, run, run  
You makin' me believe in everything  
No need to go and hide, hide, hide  
Gonna give you every little piece of me

'Cause it's been a long time comin'  
So where you runnin' to?

You could be anything  
But you don't know what to believe in  
You got the world before you  
If I could only show you  
That you don't know what to do  
  
You think about it  
Can you ever change, finish what you've started  
Make me wanna stay, tied up conversation  
Show me something real, find out what your part is  
Play it how you feel  
  
Tell me what to do, ooh, about you

His smile, it glows  
He's perfect, it shows, let's go  
  
I've been starin' at ya  
And I could do it all night  
You're looking like an angel  
With that kinda body needs a spotlight  
  
Ain't no body know your name  
But looking like you do could be famous  
I could see us makin' waves  
From the back of the club  
To a bed in the shade  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I don't know who you are  
But you look like a star  
And everybody here be thinkin'  
Who's that boy?  
Wanna take you home  
And get you all alone  
And everybody here is thinkin'  
Who's that boy?  
  
Oh he got me  
No, I've never seen,  
No one like him  
Damn he's everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Who's that boy, who's that boy  
  
You could say that I'm distracted  
But ah you got me so attracted  
But boy I'll tell you what the fact is  
Is no one else in this room  
That could rock it like you, you do  
  
Ain't no body know your name  
But looking like you do could be famous  
I could see us makin' waves  
From the back of the club  
To a bed in the shade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh he got me  
No, I've never seen,  
No one like him  
Damn he's everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Who's that boy, who's that boy  
  
Everybody in the club turn around sayin'  
Who's that, who's that  
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes, tell me  
Who's that, who's that  
  
I got my eyes on this boy  
Can't get him off my mind  
He's one of a kind  
The cherry to my pie  
I just wanna get him close  
  
Wanna make him mine  
Come hold my hand and dance away the night  
Give me the green light, kiss my lips  
Who's that boy watching my hips?  
I- I- I wanna know who you are  
My name is Dev and you can be my star  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh he got me  
No, I've never seen,  
No one like him  
Damn he's everything  
Girls they want him  
Guys they want to be  
Who's that boy, who's that boy

You pull my strings and push my soul  
You fool my heart with every note  
You drop a beat and kiss my face  
You make me move then cut the base  
  
And you work so hard to get me just to let me go  
Yeah, you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show  
And you try to take me home like you're DiMaggio  
Oh (oh, oh) it's such a joke  
  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are we acting like lovers?  
We don't know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
A love song without the love  
  
You're so confused its getting old  
You wear your ring but leave me cold  
You're beautiful but cause me pain  
You played my heart like it's a game  
  
And you work so hard to get me just to let me go  
Yeah, you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show  
And you try to take me home like you're DiMaggio  
Oh (oh, oh) it's criminal  
  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are we acting like lovers?  
We don't know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
A love song without the love  
  
This is the bend before the break  
When we forget the harmony  
This is how water colors fade  
Into distant memories  
  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
What good is a love song without the love?  
Why are we acting like lovers?  
We don't know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs?  
What good is a love song?  
A love song without the love  
  
(Ooh) Without the love  
(Ooh) Without the love  
(Ooh) Without the love  
(Ooh) Without the love

Everyday is like a blank canvas  
You know you can paint it anyway you want it  
You can draw black clouds, you can make the sun shine  
Color in a rainbow, or use black and white  
Open up your eyes and, your imagination  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Ooh every night's like looking at a dark screen  
You're never too young or too old to dream  
You can make your fantasy into a reality  
Cause you're creating your own masterpiece  
Close your eyes and dream it, seeing is believing  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Trying to simplify into philosophy  
Turn the star into a galaxy  
Make a little noise into a symphony  
You're creating a masterpiece  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art

Sometimes I don't know whether I should wish for a new one  
Sometimes I wanna be alone  
Yet others I wanna be with you  
And I hear those things you say about me  
And I know just who's gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong  
  
Sometimes I want you to know that I'd wish you away  
Sometimes I don't know yeah  
Yet others I know just what I want and what I need yeah  
And I hear all the names you call me  
And I know just who's gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong  
  
Sometimes I can't see  
At others it all comes so clearly  
Yeah sometimes I can't breath like when you are next to me  
I know just who is gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong
