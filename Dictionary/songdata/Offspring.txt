80 times was all it took for him he has no more tries  
No one seems to care too much for him  
You can see it in his eyes  
  
Drive down the street that he's on  
Don't look his way  
You keep going on and on and on  
But you can't hear him say  
  
Help Help  
Help Me  
Help Help

How can you live?  
With nothing at all?  
  
Where do you run?  
Where do you go?  
When the holes in your truth  
Are starting to show?  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
How can you take?  
Without giving back?  
How does it work?  
When it's really cracked?  
  
How does it feel...  
And no wonder  
Hearts and minds have  
been won  
How does it feel...  
And I wonder  
How it's all come undone  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
How can you take?  
Without giving back?  
Who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
  
And the rain comes  
And the world is on my head  
Crave the sun  
But I can't get out of bed  
  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it you're sliding  
Want it you got it you're sorry  
You bought it can't hide it  
Tell me who do you see  
Cause you look a lot like me  
  
You look a lot like me  
You look a lot you look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah  
You look a lot like me, whoah

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you  
I'll tell you no lies  
When all is said and done  
Does it really matter who's wrong or right  
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
As I lie bleeding here I still  
I still reach for you  
  
A thousand days  
Have passed away  
A thousand days  
Were captured in her eyes  
  
Your eyes are open now but you know  
It's still hard to see inside  
When action and intention  
Are two separate things  
Now I somehow wish I could explain  
Why we hurt each other again and again  
Like someone on his dying breath  
I still reach for you  
  
A thousand days  
Have passed away  
A thousand days  
Were captured in her eyes  
  
Forever we've been  
Trapped by our hearts  
Trapped by our minds  
I'd like to leave  
I'd like to win at love  
  
But I just can't let it go  
And I just can't watch it slipping away  
And I just can't let it go  
And I just can't stand another minute  
  
Maybe now someday our shattered live  
Will mend themselves again  
But now a million miles away  
I still wish I could  
And though I somehow know, I can't explain  
Why we hurt one another again and again  
Like someone on his dying breath  
I still reach for you

Hey man you know I'm really okay  
The gun in my hand will tell you the same  
But when I'm in my car  
Don't give me no crap  
  
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap  
When I go driving I stay in my lane  
But getting cut off makes me insane  
I open the glove box  
  
Reach inside  
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride  
I guess I got a bad habit  
And it ain't goin' away Yeah  
  
Well they say the road's a dangerous place  
If you flip me off I'm the danger you'll face  
You drive on my ass  
You're foot's on the gas  
  
And your next breath is your last  
Drivers are rude  
Such attitudes  
But when I show my piece  
  
Complaints cease  
Something's odd  
I feel like I'm God  
You stupid dumb shit god damn mother fucker  
  
I open the glove box  
Reach inside  
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

Mommy doesn't have a head any more  
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor  
Well that's alright, that's OK  
She never really used her head anyway  
  
Daddy called me a silly bore  
Bet he won't say that any more  
Because the way his body is severed too  
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use  
  
Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes  
  
Watch my girl friend come to the door  
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor  
Now watching my baby's jugular flow  
Really makes my motor go  
  
Wrap a towel round the bloody stump  
Take my baby's body to the city dump  
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe  
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack  
  
Beheaded, watch her spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes  
  
All my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles  
Use to be a little, but a little got more and more  
Now I'm craving yours  
  
Night brings bad dreams, bad dreams and guillotines  
  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
  
Find another victim for my machine  
Put him in a home-made guillotine  
Blade falls, gonna need a casket  
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket  
  
Leave the house at a quarter to four  
Come back with sixteen or more  
Cause the more I want, the more I see  
I got a funny feeling coming over me  
  
Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

I woke the other day  
And saw my world has changed  
The past is over but tomorrow's wishful thinking  
I can't hold onto what's been done  
I can't grab onto what's to come  
And I'm just wishing I could stop, but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
Memories are bittersweet  
The good times we can't repeat  
Those days are gone and we can never get them back  
Now we must move ahead  
Despite our fear and dread  
We're all just wishing we could stop, but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe your eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
With all our joys and fears  
Wrapped in forgotten years  
The past is laughing as today just slips away  
Time tears down what we've made  
And sets another stage  
And I'm just wishing we could stop  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Can't hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries

I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun  
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one  
And everyone's so blind  
They're not to help mankind  
  
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one  
You don't want to change the world  
Like you say  
You're in it for yourself  
  
No one else  
You're ready  
Saving yourself  
You're gonna change the world  
  
You're ready  
Saving yourself  
You're gonna change the world  
Now when the day is set they'll line up all the same

When building a molotov cocktail,  
Don't think of it as "Just a bomb".  
Be creative, express yourself  
Put a little bit of yourself in each one  
But remember kids, safety first.... Ok! Lets get started!  
Take an empty milk bottle  
Full it full with gasoline  
Stuff a gassed soap rag into the mouth of the bottle  
You cork the top and presto!  
You're gonna have a fun-filled night tonight, believe me  
You're gonna be the life of the party,  
With this little goodie.  
Be safe kids, and have a blast

Three in the morning and I gotta be someplace,  
I don't remember where  
friends try to make me stay, or call me a cab home,  
I grab my keys and a beer  
  
Cops they took my license away,  
got my car out of impound today  
I've been drunk since last Saturday,  
better stay out of my way  
  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
Never take that dive  
Feel so alive  
Doing 95  
I drink and drive  
Feel so alive  
I drink and drive  
  
Early in the morning and the freeway's deserted, like its all mine  
I'm trying to set a new drunken speed record,  
but I can't drive a straight line  
Flashing lights, split the night  
I'm tossing bottles as I swerve to the right  
now I've slammed my face into the back of a big rig  
At least you'll never get me, you fucking pigs!  
Designate someone other than me,  
I'm so drunk I can hardly see  
Another shot of Jager and I turn the key,  
I got so many places to be  
  
When I'm on a binge, my friends all cringe  
They won't drive at night  
'Cause way down on the freeway it's such a fright  
But I think I drive alright

Feelings  
Nothing more than feelings  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Imagine  
Beating on your face  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of hate  
  
Feelings  
For all my life i'll feel it  
I wish I'd never met you  
You'll make me sick again  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
Of hate on my mind  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I never liked you  
Feelings like I want to kill you  
Live in my heart  
  
Feelings  
Feelings like I want to deck you  
Feelings like I've gotta get you  
Out of my life  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
The hate's in my eyes  
  
Feelings, oh oh feelings  
You're not very nice

Look at me while I look at you  
Seeing eye to eye we can never do  
You try to tell me what is right  
I may not know a lot but I know one thing  
  
[Chorus]  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just keep it your own  
  
I wonder why our world is ablaze  
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say  
I try to have an open mind  
But your brain and mouth must not be connected  
  
If you've got the answer  
Then I don't want to know  
If you've got the answer  
Just leave me alone  
  
I would be patient but it takes so long  
I don't want all this misinformation  
All the words that you say  
Lean on me while I lean on you  
If we destroy each other  
We might save a life or two  
A little sun, a little shine  
Separates us both by forever and a day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you've got a vision  
Then I don't want to see  
If you've got a notion  
Don't waste it on me

Our lives run different ways  
Through the rain I see you in the sun  
Our star shines anyway  
If you wish upon it we are one  
  
Dog eat dog  
To get by  
Hope you like my genocide  
I find it such a shame  
  
Through the pain I see things as they are  
We're served up on a plate  
The pedestal is high enough to fall  
And if in time  
We can see the errors of our ways  
  
Would anyone change it anyhow  
Our time is up  
I bet you'd only run  
If you saw what goes inside our own  
  
I bet you'd lead the way  
If it were up to you to decide  
But it's not

I'm getting edgy all the time  
There's someone around me just a step behind  
It's kinda scary, the shape I'm in  
The walls are shakin' and they're closing in  
  
Too fast or a bit too slow  
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show  
There's one guy that I can't shake  
Over my shoulder is a big mistake  
  
Sitting on the bed  
Or lying wide awake  
There's demons in my head  
And it's more than I can take  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I'm on a roll  
But I think it's kinda weak  
Saying all I know is  
I gotta get away from me  
  
I tell you something just ain't right  
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight  
Avoiding my friends cause they all bug  
Life is a riddle and I'm really stumped  
  
If you reason, don't you know  
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go  
I think I'm being followed, I look around  
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground  
  
[Chorus]

One is for envy and one just for spite  
The cuts in my heart, they show me your eyes  
Don't make it better by twisting knife,  
Turns all by itself, on to someone else  
  
Your self-liberation, we'll leave this behind,  
Beyond slings and arrows that rain on our minds  
You'll make it better shaking it off  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
If we don't make it alive, it's a hell of a good day to die  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
And it's ashes to ashes again, should we even try to pretend?  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red  
It's blocking the sun light that shines overhead  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls,  
Voices inside you churn, watch the city burn  
  
Your own liberation will leave them behind  
All the slings and arrows that rain on your mind,  
Don't make it better break it 'cause  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't calm down  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red,  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls  
It never mattered, mattered,  
Mattered anyway!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long!

I'm gonna be a slam-er,  
I'm gonna be the wildest,  
I'm gonna be your hammer,  
No one's the nicest,  
But me!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm a man who is dropin,  
Dropin', is dropin' a Hammerdown on you!  
I'm fightin' against you,  
I'm Bombin' your House  
O-you-T!!!  
Come on let'me kill ya!!!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm a man who is dropin,  
Dropin, is dropin' a Hammer  
Down on you!  
I've fighted against you,  
I've bombed your houseo-you-T!!!  
And I've killed ya!!!  
But what did I do?  
I've killed my soul!  
I'm not a worker,  
I'm not a joker,  
I'm the sadest man alive!!!

I am the one  
Camouflage and guns  
Risk my life  
To keep my people from harm  
  
Authority  
Vested in me  
I sacrifice  
With my brothers in arms  
  
Trough this doorway  
What's on the other side  
Never knowing  
Exactly what I'll find  
Locked and loaded  
Voices screaming  
Let's go!  
Come on do it!  
Here we go  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Take a life  
That others may live  
Oh that's just the way it goes  
It's playing over and over in my head  
Where it'll end  
Nobody knows  
  
Stay the course  
Reasonable force  
I believe I serve a greater good  
  
Smoke and dust  
Enemies are crushed  
Nothing left  
Where a man once stood  
  
Trough this doorway  
What's on the other side  
Never knowing  
Exactly what I'll find  
Locked and loaded  
Voices screaming  
Let's go  
But I'm just doing what I'm told  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
Bang bang it hammers in my head  
In my head  
In my head  
  
Yeah though I walk to the through the valley of the  
Shadow of death , I will fear no evil:  
For Thou art with me  
  
Locked and loaded  
Gonna find my truth  
Now I'm busting trough  
All hell breaks loose  
  
And you can all hide behind your desks now  
And you can cry 'teacher come help me!'  
Through you all  
My aim is true

Let's make hand grenades  
From common things around the house  
Let's make hand grenades  
Listen up, we'll show you how  
  
Ok now take an old beer bottle  
Fill it up with gasoline  
Some paint thinner for good measure  
And a sprinkle of maganese  
Now stuff a sock into the top  
With a zippo you'll be king  
  
Lets make hand grenades  
It's hours of fun in a little jar  
Let's make hand grenades  
Try one out on your neighbors car

Falling, I'm falling  
  
Have you ever walked through a room  
But it was more like the room passed around you  
Like there was a leash around your neck that pulled you through  
  
Have you ever been at someplace  
Recognizing everybody's face  
Until you realized that there was no one there you knew  
Well I know  
  
Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind  
Sleep forever  
Some days, I'm so outshined and out of time  
Have you ever  
  
Falling, I'm falling  
  
Have you ever buried your face in your hands  
'Cause no one around you understands  
Or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be  
  
Have you ever felt like there was more  
Like someone else was keeping score  
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach  
Well I know  
  
Someday I'll try again and not pretend  
This time forever  
Someday I'll get it straight but not today  
Have you ever  
  
Falling, I'm falling  
  
Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind  
Sleep forever  
Some days, my darkest friend is me again  
Have you ever  
Someday I'll try again and not pretend  
This time forever  
Someday I'll get it straight but not today  
Have you ever  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to think the world is a better place  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to make the world be a better place  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to think the world is a better place  
I'd like to leave the world as a better place  
I'd like to think the world

(You gotta keep'em separated)  
  
You like the latest fashions  
You'd like to keep'em clean  
You take a trip every week to the laundromat  
Throw a load in the washing machine  
  
But if you don't wanna ruin your clothes  
You gotta sort'em out first as everyone knows  
Remember bright colors and the other don't mix  
Before you wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up...  
Hey!!!  
  
Are your undies turning pink?  
Take'em out! (You gotta keep'em separated)  
Hey-ay... Are your cottons gonna shrink?

Hey-ay! It's Laundry Day!

Rage burns can't push it aside now  
Can't forgive this grudge is alive now  
All the rage eats you up inside  
Can you leave it behind  
  
What a surprise --  
You're fucked with again Yeah  
It's a way of life you need to get over  
All the rage just eats you alive  
  
Can you leave it behind  
I don't know where it'll end  
The sun has set  
And I can't be friends  
  
I don't know if I can forgive  
The day is long  
But you were so dead wrong

In my perfect isolation  
I can stay here for awhile  
Antidotes and revelations  
Just extend my own exile  
  
Wasting away  
The world's right in front of me  
Funny you should say  
That it's all in my head  
Wasting away  
We're hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well it's not that bad  
  
With my lack of observation  
I can stay in here for days  
Could you find my motivation  
I can't see it through this haze  
  
Wasting away  
The world's right in front of me  
Funny you should say  
That it's all in my head  
Wasting away  
We're hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well it's not that bad  
  
Wishing away  
The world's right in front of me  
Call me anyway  
Cause it's all in my head  
Wasting away  
We're hitting rock bottom  
And going down in flames  
Well it's not that bad  
  
Wasting all my days  
What would Ivan say  
Wasting all my days  
What would Ivan say  
  
Wasting away  
We're hitting rock bottom  
Call me anyway  
Cause I got two friends  
Wasting away  
We're going down together  
And all in all it's not so bad  
All in all it's not so bad  
  
It's hard to know  
Where to start and where to go  
I will never say these words again

I am waiting  
On a mountaintop  
For the moment that the sky will strike  
My apologies  
Are forever lost  
Soon to ashes in a flash of light  
  
Miles from away from me  
Hope is fading soon  
Gone forever it's a waste of time  
My intentions  
Like a sweeter room  
Only bring to me a fading light  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just teach my dark heart to feel  
All I've saved - why  
Is thrown away  
  
I am waning  
Like a single bloom  
Lost forever in the storm of life  
My intentions  
Like a sweeter room  
Only bring to me a fading light  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just show these wounds how to heal  
Here I am - oh why  
My last stand - oh why  
And I know For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show  
  
Throw me down  
  
It's been raining  
And now I will pay  
Woe is come to me  
  
I am the lightning rod  
  
I am waiting  
On a mountaintop  
Oh above me  
He will strike me!  
  
Locked up forever inside  
I look to the stars and ask why  
If they could just teach my dark heart to feel  
All I am - oh why  
My last stand - oh why  
And I know  
For all the rising and falling there's nothing to show

Got a soul poem, and it goes like this  
  
Somewhere the time was right  
Could have been gone in ten  
This world is hard to fight  
Hitting you once  
  
Hit it again  
To know the way it feels  
Everyone gets knocked down  
When you get up it's real  
  
By taking it back  
Turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - wouldn't want to be you  
Get on it, out on it  
Get on it - no one's gonna free you  
You know, when you're keeping it slow  
No matter where you want to go - wouldn't want to be you  
Get on it, up on it  
It's on - we're living in chaos  
  
Somewhere along the line  
Things get chipped away  
This place keeps going down  
Gets a little worse every day  
I see hate and greed  
This world's a messed up town  
Embrace the pain and see  
By taking it back  
You turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fall-ing... falling [Repeat: x 2]  
(Ya, ya, ya) [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Got a soul poem and it goes like this  
  
repeat 1st verse  
  
Fall-ing...falling [Repeat: x 2]  
  
(ya, ya, ya)  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - (ya, ya, ya)  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - no one's gonna free you  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - (ya, ya, ya)

Me And My Old Lady  
Lay in bed all day  
And when I say I love her  
Well she rolls the other way  
But really she don't mean it  
Everything she says  
Still if I believe in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with my head  
Me and my old lady  
Sit and sip on wine  
And when she says she loves me  
Will I say that love is blind  
But really I don't mean it  
Everything I say  
Still if she believes in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with her head  
So what if we're making a scene now  
You know she don't give a shit  
When she's pawin' and grabbin' on me now  
You know I don't mind a bit  
It's all good and we  
Ain't gonna change now  
The world is unaware  
So if you want, go on and stare  
Cause we don't care  
She ain't no ball and chain  
Me and my old lady  
Suck each other dry  
And when in that position  
I'm the luckiest man alive  
Quenching our libidos  
Passing time away  
Now that we believe in love  
There's nothing wrong  
There's nothing wrong with our head

There was a time  
Looking through myself  
Wanted to pretend  
If I escaped  
I could feel myself  
I don't think you can  
Been far and wide  
But that hole inside  
Never really leaves  
  
I went away  
But I really lost  
Left behind was me  
  
Install in me  
Clear me on my way  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
A Million Miles Away  
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't stay  
I can't stay  
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Each passing day  
Every passing face  
Seems like such a gloom  
I long to be  
Home silently  
Lying next to her  
  
Just to get back  
By her side is all,  
All I need to be  
  
I went away  
What I really lost  
Left behind was me  
  
I need to be  
Getting on my way  
  
Ohhhh oh oh oh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh  
A Million Miles Away  
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take  
I can't take  
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Install in me  
Turn me on my way  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
I can't take, I can't take  
A Million Miles Away  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
I can't take  
I can't take  
A Million Miles Away

Never knew where to go  
Never used to go to at night  
Thinking but I didn't know  
Never could seem to get it right  
But I've made up my mind  
Yeah I've made up my mind  
  
I wanna feel important  
I wanna feel alive  
Don't talk to me  
Don't talk to you  
You know I'm lying  
You know the truth  
  
Yeah, I'm on a Mission From God  
It sounds kinda crazy but I like it a lot  
I'm an answer to the man up above  
It's me he's speaking of  
Yeah, so I'm just a fortunate son?  
Everybody wants to be the chosen one  
I'm on a mission  
I'm on a mission from God  
  
I went to Pensacola just to get an opinion  
A perfect California get it straight in my mind  
Take a new road, take a new direction  
Maybe going to get it right  
But I've made up my mind  
Yeah I've made up my mind  
I wanna feel important  
I wanna feel alive  
  
Don't talk to me  
Don't talk to you  
You know I'm lying  
You know the truth  
  
Yeah, I'm on a mission from God  
It sounds kinda crazy but I like it a lot  
I'm an answer to the man up above  
It's me he's speaking of  
Yeah, so I'm just a fortunate son?  
Everybody wants to be the chosen one  
I'm on a mission  
I'm on a mission from God  
  
If I could save the world  
I might do it  
I just might do it  
Now it's up to me  
So are you worth it?  
Are you really worth it?  
If I can save the world  
  
Yeah I'm on a Mission From God  
Sounds kinda crazy but I like it a lot  
I'm an answer to the man up above  
It's me he's speaking of  
On a mission, on a mission, on a mission, a mission, a mission, mission,
mission, mission  
Yeah I'm on a mission

On a mission started by my own admission  
I will leave you all behind  
By direction I'll create my own protection  
The real me you'll never find  
  
Aspirations turn to fear and desperation  
Nothing's ever good enough for you  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
You'll only see what I want you to  
  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside there is a real me  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll see  
Never gonna find me  
Never gonna find me  
Way down deep inside they haven't found me yet  
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll get  
  
On a mission to establish my attrition  
You may think that you have won  
Your rejection has brought on my introspection  
I'll escape I'll only run  
  
Accusations may destroy my motivation  
I can feel it when you're pushing me  
Burn in sorrow 'cause I see there's no tomorrow  
Only I know which me you'll see  
  
Break away!  
Run!  
Down inside!  
I've got to!  
Push it way!  
Down!  
I did not choose this!  
  
I don't really know  
What I want to say  
I can't afford the throw  
Can't make it go away  
Try to make it through  
Fuck your decision  
I can't feel myself  
But I'm burning up now!  
  
Never gonna find me

Our generations  
Sees the world not the same as before  
We might as well just throw it all  
And live like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow  
  
We are the ones  
Who are living under the gun everyday  
You might be gone before you know  
So live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
  
Believe it  
The official view of the world has changed  
In a whole new way  
Live fast cause if you don't take it  
You'll never make it  
  
So if you understand me  
And if you feel the same  
Then you will know what nitro means  
You'll live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
There's no tomorrow

Lay awake  
I don't give a shit  
If I even ever wake up in the morning  
Down below  
There's a pile of sin  
Always waiting for a  
Waiting for a warning  
  
Burned at the stake  
Inside I'm blistering  
Not a whisper  
Looking in you'd never know it  
Miles below  
I look up again  
When you snap they say  
Before you never show it  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes  
  
Fuses glow  
Wounds festering  
Till the wind comes up  
And takes it to the last pow  
Back and forth  
Staring at the wall  
This room's a cage  
I know that something's got to give now  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes  
  
No brakes

I'm not the one who made the world what it is today  
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago  
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times  
I carry on and never once have even questioned why  
  
I'm innocent  
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders  
I'm innocent  
But the battles started are far from over  
  
We 're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night  
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down  
Still we grow and then the problems they become our own  
We carry on without even realizing why  
  
We're innocent  
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders  
We're innocent  
But the battles left us are far from over  
  
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies  
And ruined our streams  
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs  
That threaten our lives  
  
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands  
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night  
And even if we try and not become so overwhelmed  
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see  
  
Still our descendants will inherit our mistakes of today  
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why

Things are coming down on me  
They never seem to let it be  
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight  
The pressure's building up inside  
  
I gotta let it out tonight  
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Gonna break it  
And never stop running  
Making nothing from something  
Making nothing from something  
  
Cut me for the lion's share  
It's mindless but I don't care  
'Cause no matter what I say  
I'm in a another fight  
  
Take more shit, I've had enough  
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up  
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright  
  
[Chorus]

Let's make this complicated  
Thinking is overrated  
We're busting out  
Of this shitty little town  
  
Green grass and colored lenses  
Tear down these picket fences  
Burn in our beds  
While the city lies sleeping  
  
Why oh why?  
Are we starting up and going down?  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
We'll leave this town today  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
These city streets are burning  
Rose red your wheels are turning  
Make me believe  
Someday we could really leave  
  
Blindfold a new direction  
Stop asking better questions  
Don't figure out  
That we're never getting out  
  
Why oh why?  
Are we starting up and going down?  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
We'll leave this town today  
And I'll row it if you steer it  
I'll yell until you hear it  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
Why oh why?  
Are we starting up and going down?  
My oh my  
Just the two of us in Nothingtown  
Our superhero play  
Our dreams get in the way  
And I'll row it if you steer it  
I'll yell until you hear it  
Hold on tighter  
With my lighter  
Shining through  
  
Still stuck in Nothingtown  
Still stuck in Nothingtown  
Come on let's go

Shoot them in the back, I shoot them in the back

I'm going down, down, down

Wannabe a member, wannabe a name  
Wannabe a local face that plays the social games  
Dancing through a time will bring you dinosaur trends  
The limits of your mind is where the county line ends  
Listen to the media present it all as fact  
Following the lead cause you don't know how to act  
Travel in a straight line cause you don't know your own way  
They'll get you in the end before you know you'll have a say  
  
This O. C. Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world, trade your happy thoughts  
O. C. Life is not the life so free  
... For you girls and boys  
  
Wannabe a member, wanna have some fame  
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game  
Atm and starbucks (on) every corner are the norm  
Environment so sterile, it'll get you to conform  
714, wear it like a brand  
Contaminated future is [...]  
Fight all their rules, I don't see a better way  
Guess you're really in before you know you'll have a say  
  
This O. C. Life is not the life for me  
Insulated world, riot out your thoughts  
O. C. Life is not the life so free  
Pressure is for real, with artificial joys  
... For you girls and boys  
  
Check you out  
You're all [...] fiend

If I had a perfect day  
I would have it start this way  
Open up the fridge and have a tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Then I'd meet up with my friends  
Head out to the game again  
We don't even really care who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
Now excitement seems to grow  
When we're hangin' with the bro's  
When we're chillin' and we pound  
A case of stroh's  
Now the game is cool to see  
You can high five on TV  
Count the riot on the 1, 2, 3  
Operation is in sight  
And the field is open wide  
When you break it then you know you're still alive  
If the cops don't make you pay  
And you make your getaway  
Then you know  
That's one fine day  
  
On that day before we're through  
We could torch a car or two  
Then have ourselves another tall boy  
Yeah  
  
Water hoses and batons  
That's the real game that's on  
I don't really give a shit who wins (hey) wins (hey) 1, 2, 3  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I believe it's my God-given right  
To destroy everything in my sight  
'cause it never gets dull  
It never gets old (whoa-oh)  
The only thing it gets is more bold (whoa-oh-oh)  
Drinkin', fightin', going to the game (whoa-oh)  
In our world it's a way to stay sane (whoa-oh-oh)  
If you're asking me (whoa-oh-oh-oh)  
To have it my way (whoa-oh)  
I'd say that's one fine day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then you know that it's one fine day  
(Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey)

They customised their gear and synchronised  
They flame out in the streets with flame in their eyes  
Guerilla operator ain't heard of cool  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
A hundred punks run with London town  
Down "Wardour Street" to "Soho Sound"  
Don't sleep all day only when they fall down  
  
A hundred rumble boys and tumble girls  
Protected by steel in a private world  
Tomorrow's famous faces advertise today  
And the studs on their back say  
One hundred punks rule.... One hundred punks rule!  
  
A hundred punks run the loaded gun  
They look so sharp they look like one  
If you ain't got the look you'll never be one  
  
A hundred punks run with total suss  
A hundred good mates you know you can trust  
There's never no bother and there's no fuss  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
And Jimmy's number 101 knows one day he'll be one  
Watch him..... Watch him go!  
  
A hundred punks run the leather army  
I know whose by my side not at home with tv  
Even when I'm down I hear them sing for me  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
And check out the walls... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!... Ok

You can do it!  
Until the break of dawn

Tag team, the double header  
Son of Sam, fire always makes it better  
Navigate with style and aplomb  
'Cause wherever you're at  
  
Lies, Lies, says he's down at the Bahamas  
Tries, Tries, all you little hoochie mamas  
No way, none of this is true  
When you see it coming down when the joke's on you  
  
Knock down the walls

Look at my soldier boy now  
With that big gun in your little hand  
As you patrol this foreign land  
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet  
  
Now do you see the light  
Fading while your world is crumbling  
Out on patrol  
And all you can do is sit and stare  
What revelation have you now  
What culmination to your speck of life  
Your moment in time  
  
As you sit here all alone  
Will your buddies come and save your life  
But as the enemy appears  
See your life flash before your eyes

I wrote her off for the tenth time today  
And practiced all the things I would say  
But she came over  
I lost my nerve  
I took her back and made her dessert  
  
Now I know I'm being used  
That's okay because I like the abuse  
I know she's playing with me  
That's okay cause I've got no self-esteem  
  
We make plans to go out at night  
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light  
All this rejection's got me so low  
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so  
  
When she's saying that she wants only me  
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends  
When she's saying that I'm like a disease  
Then I wonder how much more I can spend  
Well I guess I should stick up for myself  
But I really think it's better this way  
The more you suffer  
The more it shows you really care, Right?  
  
Now I'll relate this a little bit  
That happens more than I'd like to admit  
Late at night she knocks on my door  
Drunk again and looking to score  
Now I know I should say no  
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go  
I may be dumb  
But I'm not a dweeb  
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

I don't know when it got this way  
I don't know how long she's gonna stay  
Every week it's the same in her room  
That's why I came  
  
Here I go, I go again  
Our rendezvous never seem to end  
I know where I'll be, I'll make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never learn  
God knows I try  
Keep coming back for session  
And I don't know why  
I'll never learn, I'll never see  
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me  
  
Some might say it's a fling  
For all I know it don't mean a thing  
Either way I can't complain  
Ain't no strings  
Guess I got it made  
  
Here I go, I go again  
Our rendezvous' never seem to end  
I know where I'll be  
I'll make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
[Chorus]

I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind  
Well she's got baggage and it's all the emotional kind  
She talks about closure and that validation bit  
I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She thinks she's the victim  
Yeah  
  
Now I know she'll feel abandoned  
If I don't stay over late  
And I know she's afraid to commit  
But it's only our second date  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She thinks she's the victim  
But she takes it all out on me  
  
I don't know why you're messed up  
I don't know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door  
  
Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind  
But when she calls out his name in bed  
That's where I draw the line  
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone  
But I wish you wouldn't call me daddy  
When we're gettin' it on  
  
Oh man she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
She's playing the victim  
And taking it all out on me  
My god she's got issues  
And I'm gonna pay  
  
If you think I'm controlling  
Then why do you follow me around  
If you're not co-dependent  
Then why do you let others drag you down  
  
I don't know why you're messed up  
I don't know why your whole life is a chore  
Just do me a favor  
And check your baggage at the door

Diamonds and dust  
(home at last) Poor man last, rich man first  
Lamborghini's, caviar  
Dry martinis, Shangri-la  
I got a burning feeling  
Deep inside of me  
It's yearning  
But I'm going to set it free  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
  
(I'm gonna rule you baby)  
Ladders and snakes  
Ladders give, snakes take  
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief  
Ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief  
  
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim  
They're getting ready, (Better get ready,)  
Look out I'm coming in ('cause I'm coming in)  
So spin that wheel, cut that pack  
And roll those loaded dice  
Bring on the dancing girls  
And put the champagne on ice

Head over heals I've fit in before  
Now I don't want to do it no more  
I've held it all in with blood on my face  
Built it up man so bad you can taste  
  
I don't slag no one  
I don't even judge  
Don't give a shit cause I'm not gonna budge  
I just want to be who I want to be  
  
Guess that's hard for others to see  
I'm not a trendy asshole  
I do what I want  
I do what I feel like  
  
I'm not a trendy asshole  
I don't fuck if it's good enough for you  
'Cause I'm alive  
Smash is the way you feel all alone  
  
Like an outcast you're out on your own  
Smash is the way you deal with your life  
Like an outcast you're smashing your strife  
Head over heals I've fit in before  
  
Now I don't want to do it no more  
I just want to be who I want to be  
Guess that's hard for others to see

We've been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
I'm gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
I'm gonna smash it up till there's nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
  
People call me weird, oh it's such a shame  
Maybe it's my clothes, must be to blame  
I don't even care if I look a mess  
Don't want to be a sucker like all the rest  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
Smash it up  
And you can keep your crystal glasses  
Smash it up  
And you can see a very dead-way end  
Smash it up  
And you can stick a frothy lager  
Smash it up  
Up the fuck with your lesson  
  
We've been playing now for much too long  
And never gonna dance to a different song  
I'm gonna scream and shout till my dying breath  
I'm gonna smash it up till there's nothing left  
  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Oh smash it up  
Smash it up smash it up  
Smash it up  
  
And everybody's smashing things down  
I said everybody's smashing things down

I believe that reality's gone  
Disillusion's real  
I believe that morality's gone  
And there's nothing to feel  
  
If you take the sacred things  
The things that we hold dear  
Empty promise is all you'll find  
So give me something  
  
Something to believe in  
I believe in a changing of the guard  
Put our feet on the ground  
See it happen in your own backyard  
  
Everything breaks down  
Do you accept what you are told  
Without even thinking  
Throw it all and make your own  
  
And give me something  
Something to believe in  
Where they lead  
You will follow  
  
Well I guess that's just the way it goes  
And if you look away  
You'll be doing what they say  
An if you look alive  
  
You'll be singled out and tried  
If you take home anything  
Let it be your will to think  
The more cynical you become  
  
The better off you'll be

My girlfriend, my dumb donut  
Went out to a party just the other night  
But three hours later, and seven shots of Jager  
She was in the bedroom with another guy  
  
And I don't really want to know  
So don't tell me anymore  
And I really don't want to hear  
About her feet all up in the air  
  
I'm not the one who acted like a ho  
Why must I be the one who has to know  
I'm not the one who messed up big time  
So spare me the details if you don't mind  
  
Now I can understand  
Friends who want to tell me  
Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes  
But the play-by-play  
Makes me want to lose it  
Every time you do it man it turns the knife  
  
Now I don't need to hear  
About the sounds they were making  
And I don't need to hear  
About how long it was taking  
Or how the walls they were shaking  
  
Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow  
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had  
Running through my head, over and over  
Things I never told her now just make me sad  
  
And it drives me insane  
Sitting with the vision  
Stuck with that image burned into my brain  
And I feel so dumb  
That I could ever trust her  
While someone else fucked her  
Then walked away

Hey now do you see me down the way  
Been watching you everyday  
In my car on your street is where I stay  
I know you better that way  
One day I'll be meeting you for real  
You'll feel bad like I feel  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
Hey now well I'm kncking on your door  
This special delivery is yours  
My infatuation it's true  
Hello, I got something for you  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]  
Then, I'll be on my way  
Breathing you okay  
  
Can't break from my sins  
Cannot pray [Repeat: x 2]  
  
But you can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's...OH GOD, HELP ME!  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]  
Then, I'll be on my way  
You breathe onto me

Maybe life is like a ride on a freeway  
Dodging bullets while you're trying to find your way  
Everyone's around, but no one does a damn thing  
It brings me down, but I won't let them  
  
If I seem bleak  
Well you'd be correct  
And if I don't speak  
It's cause I can't disconnect  
But I won't be burned by the reflection  
Of the fire in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun  
  
When I ran I didn't feel like a runaway  
When I escaped I didn't feel like I got away  
There's more to living than only surviving  
Maybe I'm not there, but I'm still trying  
  
Though you hear me  
I don't think that you relate  
My will is something  
That you can't confiscate  
So forgive me, but I won't be frustrated  
By destruction in your eyes  
As you're staring at the sun

When you won't go along  
Some will feel like you can't find your way  
Heaven knows  
Heaven knows I've seen it all before  
Now don't get me wrong  
I've seen many a life gone astray  
When someone goes  
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Shut up and take it like a man  
You need us to get a life  
For your own good we'll take you by the hand  
'Cause you need a little more  
  
Maybe no one will say it  
Maybe no one's aware it goes on  
All I know  
All I know it's like going off the deep end  
Could you make a decision?  
Could you think for yourself and go on?  
Everyone knows  
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes  
Look away now  
Make believe while you can  
So you'd best go along  
Don't let on if you can't find your way  
Many more  
Many more do it for you  
Because heaven knows  
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire  
Your life's a throw  
  
[Chorus]

In your plane in the blue sky  
You roam again  
Words that echo in your mind  
Make your heart beat faster  
This is no Vietnam  
We will win in Iran  
  
The Captain said kill or die  
Islam be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran  
  
Warrior, the time bombs  
About to go  
What will you feel  
Will you even wonder  
If the man that's in your sights  
Ever kissed his girl goodbye  
  
The President said let it ride  
Islam be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran  
  
Great Satan  
Our flags our burning  
  
Soon America may find  
Its young men in the sand  
Where there casualty  
Is just a number  
In Iran  
  
The President said let it ride  
You will be damned  
Make your last stand  
In Tehran

This city's made of diamonds  
And tomorrow glass will grow  
On the freedoms that divide us  
They're coming after me  
Flashback nineteen eighty-four  
Now who's knock-knocking at your door?  
A thought that starts a riot  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is not the same  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light?  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
Running down a spiral  
With the light of better men  
Shouting progress is survival  
Take one last look and see me  
Now you see me, now you don't  
No vow to break  
No string of hope  
My hero, your pariah  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is just God's game  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
And you get what you deserve  
When revenge is what you serve  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
I'll sink into the night  
And I'm turning off the lights  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
So the end's what you make it  
And that's what you're looking for  
This is the future  
The future is now  
  
Disappear, disappear  
Disappear, disappear  
  
Now turn off the lights  
The skies are blue inside you  
Turn off the lights  
They'll get inside of you  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light?  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

When we were young the future was so bright  
The old neighborhood was so alive  
And every kid on the whole damn street  
Was gonna make it big and not be beat  
  
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn  
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn  
How can one little street  
Swallow so many lives  
  
Chances thrown  
Nothing's free  
Longing for what used to be  
Still it's hard  
Hard to see  
Fragile lives, shattered dreams  
  
Jamie had a chance, well she really did  
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids  
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job  
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot  
  
Jay committed suicide  
Brandon OD'd and died  
What the hell is going on  
The cruelest dream, reality

On the way  
Trying to get where I'd like to say  
I'm always feeling steered away  
By someone trying to tell me  
  
What to say and do  
I don't want it  
I gotta go find my own way  
I gotta go make my own mistakes  
  
Sorry man for feeling  
Feeling the way I do  
On yeah, Oh yeah  
Open wide and they'll shove in  
  
Their meaning of life  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah  
But not for me I'll do it on my own  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah  
  
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life  
I can't make it work your way  
Thanks but no thanks  
By the way  
  
I know your path has been tried and so  
It may seem like the way to go  
Me, I'd rather be found  
Trying something new  
  
And the bottom line  
In all of this seems to say  
There's no right and wrong way  
Sorry if I don't feel like  
  
Living the way you do

Well our souls are all mistaken in the same misguided way  
We all end up forsaken, we're just choosing our own way  
The future now incinerates before our very eyes  
And leaves us with emptiness of no more tries  
  
Well our visions of glory have spiraled down the drain  
The best of our intentions come crashing down in flames  
The depths of our despair we are unable to contain  
It's shallow living  
  
The noose is falling  
And all my friends are crawling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
A truth appalling  
Our mak'are comes a calling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
  
Well the tracers from yesteryear are burning in the dust  
Your bruises are reminders of naivete and trust  
You're only feeling stronger cause your body's getting numb  
Now I lay you down  
Put the coins in your eyes  
And blow the candles out  
  
The noose is falling  
And all my friends are crawling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
A truth appalling  
Our mak'are comes a calling  
The noose is falling  
And enemies are rising  
  
No more!  
No more!  
Nothing!  
  
No more!  
No more!  
Ever!  
No!  
More!

Hope unkown. Sometimes just waking is surreal.  
I walk right through the nameless ones.  
I know that hope's unknown.  
Sometimes the water feels so real.  
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go.  
  
I hear them calling.  
I feel them gnawing out holes through flawless souls.  
  
So alone. Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless
ones.  
I fear that I alone fear those ceased to feel they're alone inside of this
place.  
I am the misplaced.  
This day never seems  
This pain, never.  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go.  
  
Now everything, looks familiar...  
Then every face would melt away until..  
Now everyone, do you know, I know your deception.

I am the one, your help I've refused  
Your offering hand just set off the fuse  
I am the rock that pushes away  
I gave up tomorrow to spite today  
  
Too proud to beg  
Too stubborn to try  
I?d look in your face  
And spit in your eye  
  
But I'm willing to find what's really inside  
And show I am strong enough to  
  
Trust in you.  
Trust in you.  
Trust in you.  
Pull me up  
Quo modo ? shadow to light  
Quo modo ? shadow to light  
Quo modo ? pull me up  
Pull me up  
Cause I am ready  
  
I am the one who blames only you  
The flame in my eyes now blackens my view  
I am the one who wanders alone  
Darkness inside blocks how you've shone  
  
Who tied the other  
End of my rope?  
I want to move on  
I want to have hope  
  
So I'm willing to change  
I'm going to try  
To show I am strong enough to

Try to remember, the echoes and embers  
Are heavy on my mind  
The pictures are broken, the front door is open  
The scars are left behind  
Tables turn you once they burning  
Leaving me undone  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words, could you just hear me  
Just really hear me  
  
I've been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
  
Music is hurting, the drugs aren't working  
Walls come crushing down  
Another rejection, my insurrection  
It's crawling back somehow  
Tables turn these words they burn I  
Never should have come  
A vision shaking till I break I  
Swear to God more words, could you just hear me  
No, really hear me  
  
I've been drowning in the sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
I'm not how I used to be,  
I'm changing 'cause of you  
I'm screaming just to breathe  
It's all I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
Anymore, find a way, hey, hey  
Anymore, find a way to bear  
It's all that I can see, it's all that I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
  
I've been drowning in a sea  
Of tryna please you  
It's all I'll ever be, it's all I ever knew  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you  
  
I'm not how I used to be,  
I'm changing 'cause of you  
I'm screaming just to breathe  
It's all I can do  
I try to be me, but I'm turning into you  
Turning into you

I heard you on my wireless back in '52  
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you  
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through  
Oh-a-oh  
They took the credit for your second symphony  
Rewritten by machine on new technology  
And now I understand the supernova scene  
Oh-a-oh  
I met your children  
Oh-a-oh  
What did you tell them?  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
Wow  
And now we meet in an abandoned studio  
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago  
And you remember, the jingles used to go,  
Oh-a-oh  
You were the first one  
Oh-a-oh  
You were the last one  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
To far!  
Alright  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Cause in my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far  
Pictures came and broke your heart  
So put all the blame on vcr  
You are the radio star  
You are the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed the radio star  
Video killed that radio star yes it did

Now I could lie by your side  
All serrated for you  
Down below cancer grows  
Weeping waits inside you too  
All our rage begs a stage  
It's a waste of time though  
And you style seems worthwhile  
But this lonely road has turned  
  
And you faded there  
They pretend to care  
Vultures waiting  
If you don't like me  
Certify Me  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah - I don't know  
Yeah - I won't go  
Yeah - save it I'm okay  
  
And in the sun a loaded gun  
Makes for conversation  
All the while in denial  
It's too late for me to change  
  
And you were unchained  
Nothing more had changed  
I could fake it  
If you still hate me  
Confiscate me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah - I won't play yeah  
Yeah - Go away yeah  
Yeah - Save it I'm okay  
  
And you were unchained  
Nothing more had changed  
I could fake it  
If you still hate me  
Confiscate me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah - I won't play yeah  
Yeah - Go away yeah  
Yeah - Save it I'm okay

Goodbye my friend, you've messed up again  
You're going to prison, you're off to the pen  
You've gotten off easy so many times  
But I guess no one told you how to get a life  
  
The judge wasn't lenient like he was before  
You got three to five and a kick out the door  
The public defender really did try  
Too little, too late, you didn't get a life  
  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Folsom prison is the destination  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time  
In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers  
Rehabilitate with all the others  
Well, I'll see ya  
  
That car looked so tempting, so easy to drive  
Just like that apartment that you burglarized  
You started to run, but didn't get far  
Cause under your arm was a VCR  
  
Ho ho, not this time my friend  
You'll be in lockdown by ten  
I'm afraid you can't talk your way out of this one, son  
Now four walls are your 24-hour-a-day, constant companions.  
  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Folsom prison is the destination  
Hey, in Walla  
I'll see you in Walla Walla  
Slap on the wrist? Well, not this time  
In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers  
Rehabilitate with all the others  
Well, I'll see ya  
  
Have a nice life

Nothing changes cause it's all the same  
The world you get's the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
There is a chain that's never broken  
You know the story it's sad but true  
An angry man gets drunk and beats his kids  
The same old way his drunken father did  
  
What comes around well it goes around  
Nothing changes cause it's all the same  
The world you get's the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
At 17 Shannon is pregnant  
As young as her mom when she had her  
Her kid is never gonna have a dad  
The same old way that Shannon never had  
  
What comes around well it goes around  
Nothing changes cause it's all the same  
The world you get's the one you give away  
It all just happens again  
  
Way down the line  
And all the things you learn when you're a kid  
You'll fuck up just like your parents did  
It all just happens again  
Way down the line  
  
And welfare moms have kids on welfare  
And fat parents they have fat kids too  
You know it's never gonna end  
The same old cycle's gonna start again  
What comes around well it goes around

Show me how to lie  
You're getting better all the time  
And turning all against the one  
Is an art that's hard to teach  
Another clever word  
Sets off an unsuspecting herd  
And as you step back into line  
A mob jumps to their feet  
  
Now dance, fucker, dance  
Man, he never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
And now you steal away  
Take him out today  
Nice work you did  
You're gonna go far, kid  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See 'em running for their lives  
  
Slowly out of line  
And drifting closer in your sights  
So play it out I'm wide awake  
It's a scene about me  
There's something in your way  
And now someone is gonna pay  
And if you can't get what you want  
Well it's all because of me  
  
Now dance, fucker, dance  
Man, I never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
And now you'll lead the way  
Show the light of day  
Nice work you did  
You're gonna go far, kid, trust, deceived!  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See 'em running for their lives  
  
Now dance, fucker, dance  
He never had a chance  
And no one even knew  
It was really only you  
  
So dance, fucker, dance  
I never had a chance  
It was really only you  
  
With a thousand lies  
And a good disguise  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See 'em running for their lives  
  
Clever alibis, Lord of the flies  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
Hit 'em right between the eyes  
When you walk away  
Nothing more to say  
See the lightning in your eyes  
See 'em running for their lives
