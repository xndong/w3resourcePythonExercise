Is there no sign of light as we stand here in the darkness?  
Watching the sun arise  
Is there no sign of life as we gaze at the waters?  
Into the strangers eyes  
  
And who are we to criticize or scorn the things that they do?  
For we shall seek and we shall find Ammonia Avenue  
  
If we call for the proof and we question the answers  
Only the doubt will grow  
Are we blind to the truth or a sign to believe in?  
Only the wise will know  
  
And word by word they handed down the light that shines today  
And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray  
And those who came at first to scoff, remained behind to pray  
  
When you can't hear the rhyme and you can't see the reason  
Why should the hope remain?  
For a man will be tired and his soul will grow weary  
Living his life in vain  
  
And who are we to justify the right in all we do?  
Until we seek until we find Ammonia Avenue  
  
Through all the doubt somehow they knew  
And stone by stone they built it high  
Until the sun broke through  
A ray of hope, a shining light Ammonia Avenue

Stand up, and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
'Cause you know that feeling  
When you've got your back against the wall.  
My God, it's only Tuesday tomorrow  
And "Loved One's" gone and blown it all  
Now you've got no money and you feel your back against the wall.  
  
Well, if you talk to your brothers and they don't give a damn  
And you look like you're gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall.  
  
Some Tripper's got you right in a corner  
And you feel you're gonna lose it all  
Now you don't want trouble but you feel your back's against the wall.  
  
So the guy moves forward but you hold him away  
Shit there's no one there to hear you call  
So you take your chances and you push him back against the wall.  
  
Now the guy's in the gutter and you don't give a damn  
And he looks kind of weak and small  
'Cause you called his number when you felt your back against the wall.  
  
Stand up, and with your hand on the Bible  
Tell the truth to one and all  
'Cause you know that feeling  
When you've got your back against the wall.  
  
Well, if you talk to your brothers and they don't give a damn  
And you look like you're gonna fall  
You can call my number when you feel your back against the wall.

No clock beside my bed, don't try to wake me  
No phone upon my wall, who's going to call?  
No knock upon my door, no news to shake me  
Nights like the one before, I can't take no more  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais puts me to shame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais and I go crazy, Beaujolais, I can't explain  
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
One race that I can't win with an alter ego  
One chance to sink or swim, what am I to do?  
One tail that I can't shake, wherever I go, he go  
One circuit I can't break, it's a catch twenty two  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais, the one to blame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais will be my ruin, Beaujolais, I can't complain  
'Cause it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais puts me to shame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais and I go crazy, Beaujolais, I can't explain  
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais goes straight to my head  
Beaujolais, the one to blame and I don't know  
Why I'm in this place or how I came  
Beaujolais will be my ruin, Beaujolais, I can't complain  
'Cause it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  
Beaujolais, Beaujolais, Beaujolais  

(Bairnson)  
  
All along the shoreline  
There are footprints by the sea  
They head into the distance...  
Then they lead right back to me  
I made the break to freedom  
Now I'm following the dream  
You're never going to get here  
If you hold the old routine  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Call along the valley  
And you just may find us there  
I couldn't say for certain  
Cause we may be anywhere  
Head into the sunset  
Or just wander out to sea  
Wherever your heart leads you  
Is the place you're meant to be  
  
And someone who could be impressed  
With ordinary lies  
Could really use a little peace of mind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we'll go,  
But we'll get by  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again  
  
Now everything we possess  
That fills our empty lives  
Is only good for leaving far behind  
  
We are blown by the wind  
Just like clouds in the sky  
We don't know where we're going,  
Don't know why  
We just ride with the wind  
And we'll drive through the rain  
We don't where we'll get to  
Or if we'll get back again

I break down in the middle and lose my thread  
No one can understand a word that I say  
When I break down just a little and lose my head  
Nothing I try to do can work the same way  
  
Any time it happens I'd get over it  
With a little help from all my friends  
Anybody else could see what's wrong with me  
But they walk away and just pretend  
  
When I break down  
  
I break down in the middle and lose my thread  
No one can understand a word that I say  
When I break down just a little and lose my head  
Nothing I try to do can work the same way  
  
Where are all the friends who used to talk to me  
All they ever told me was good news  
People that I've never seen are kind to me  
Is it any wonder I'm confused  
  
When I break down  
When I break down  
  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take them all away  
  
Where are all of my friends  
My so called friends  
Take the wall away  
Take them all away  
Will somebody here me?

(bairnson)  
  
A boy flies for freedom  
But dies for the peace  
In the clouds, he waits for an answer  
But there's no release  
  
It's strange here without you  
And it's so hard to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
I still see his shadow  
His laugh lingers on  
When I dream, we're all back together  
When I wake, he's gone  
It's strange here without you  
This was not ment to be  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
And though we try to change the world  
A flower when it's cut will surely die  
So why do men with so much hate  
Destroy what they cannot create  
While we all stand by  
  
We will look back in anger  
But you helped us to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me

No one ever lived a thousand years  
Not like things we do or say  
Some of those who really changed this world  
We would welcome back today  
They could really light the way  
  
So call up Otis  
Call up Marvin  
Call for Buddy. Bring them on  
Call for Ludwig  
And for Johann  
We need Lennon. We mean john  
  
Words live longer than a thousand years  
Listen hard to what they say  
Single voices that would change this world  
We would welcome back today  
They would really light the way  
  
So call up Jimi  
Let's have Stevie  
Look for Miles to take the floor  
Call for Billie  
Yell for Ella  
Call up Elvis. We'll need more  
  
So call up Einstein  
Bring back Darwin  
Call for Newton, and Luther King  
We need Gandhi  
Call Da Vinci  
Call for Jesus. And ask him in  
  
If we live another thousand years  
Who could help along the way?  
Some of those who came and changed this world  
We would welcome back today  
They would really light the way  
  
So call up Garbo  
Let's have Mansfield  
Maybe Monroe, no she's for sure  
Call Sinatra  
Come on Crosby  
Is that Bogie at the door?  
  
Bring on Bergman  
How about Dietrich  
Let's have James Dean leave the car  
Call Picasso  
We need Monet  
Let's have Rembrandt and Renoir  
  
Call up Groucho  
Come on Gable  
Bring on Hitchcock and let's get Wilde  
Come on Gershwin  
Let's call Porter  
Maybe Duke could show some style  
  
Call up Shakespeare  
Bring on Byron  
We need Shelley, and maybe Keats  
Come on Wordsworth  
Bring on Browning  
Robert Burns, and HG Wells

Pay no attention to the writing on the wall  
The words seem Empty cause there's nothing there at all  
We let the wise men beat the Drums too soon  
We were just children of the moon  
  
No one to turn to  
Nowhere to Run to even if we could  
Too late to save us but try to understand  
The seas were empty there was hunger in the land  
  
We let the blind man lead the Way too long  
Easy to see where we went wrong  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to die for  
We're Lost in the middle of a hopeless world  
Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world  
  
Children children of the moon watch the world go by  
Children children of the moon are hiding from the sun and the sky  
Children Children of the moon watch it all go by  
Children children of the moon are Blinded by the light in their eyes  
  
No one to turn to  
Nowhere to run to even if we could  
Follow the pilgrim to the Temple of the dawn  
The altar's empty and the sacrifice is gone  
We let the Madmen write the golden rules  
We were no more than mortal fools  
  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to die for  
We're lost in the middle of a hopeless world  
Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world  
Children children of the moon watch the world go by  
Children children of the Moon hiding from the sky

Rising and falling lighter than air  
Silently calling no one is there  
Oh, bird that is flying so high and so free  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Voices of strangers keep me from sleep  
Guardian angels watch over the deep  
A ship that is sailing way out to the sea  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Visions of rain fall out of blue skies  
Rivers of tears fall out of dry eyes  
Answer my question tell me no lies  
Is this the real world or a fool's paradise?  
  
Wind that is blowing so wild and so free  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Closer to heaven longing to be  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Visions of rain fall out of blue skies  
Rivers of tears fall out of dry eyes  
Answer my question tell me no lies  
Is this the real world or a fool's paradise?  
  
Love that lies sleeping wakes in the night  
Secrets for keeping that won't see the light  
I look to the future and I hope it will be  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Closer to heaven longing to be  
Closer to heaven than you and me

I ain't got a heart of stone  
I'm hurtin' more now than I've ever known  
If you mean the things you said  
I'm gonna wind up out a my head  
Can't sleep alone at night  
I just can't seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you  
  
I don't want to tie you down  
Don't need a reason to have you around  
But each time you walk away  
Don't be surprised if I ask you to stay  
Can't sleep alone at night  
I just can't seem to get it right  
Damned if I do  
And I'm damned if I don't but I love you  
I said I'm damned if I do  
And I'm damned if I don't cause I love you  
  
I ain't got a heart of stone  
You haven't left me a mind of my own  
But it's got such a hold on me  
I don't think I could ever be free  
How can I survive  
I'm fighting to keep myself alive  
I'm damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you  
Can't seem to see the light  
I've done everything but I can't get it right  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't but I love you

We're living in a different reality, we're toeing the same line  
We give in we call it neutrality, a joke with no punchline  
The silver plated hero meets the golden hearted whore  
The odds'll give you zero, she'll be leaving in a few days more  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
We are the same with no similarity, talk at the same time  
We believe in freedom and charity as long as I get mine  
The ivory Madonna is walking through the door  
You watch her from a window, it doesn't matter anymore  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
Movin' on forever  
Maybe she don't care  
Holding on together  
Maybe it just ain't there  
You're dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore  
Dancing on a high wire  
You need to be so sure  
There used to be a lifeline  
There isn't anymore

Gaze at the sky  
And picture a memory  
Of days in your life  
You knew what it meant to be happy and free  
With time on your side  
  
Remember your daddy  
When no one was wiser  
Your ma used to say  
That you would go further than he ever could  
With time on your side  
  
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye  
Longing to reach them but frightened to try  
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday  
  
But day after day  
The show must go on  
And time slipped away  
Before you could build any castles in spain  
The chance had gone by  
  
With nothing to say  
And no one to say it to  
  
Nothing has changed  
You've still got it all to do  
Surely you know  
The chance has gone by  
  
Think of a boy with the stars in his eye  
Longing to reach them but frightened to try  
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday  
  
But, day after day  
The show must go on  
And you gaze at the sky  
And picture a memory of days in your life  
With time on your side  
  
With time on your side  
(day after day the show must go on)  
With time on your side  
(day after day the show must go on)

Some are born to lose their heads  
And some are born to use them  
And some will never know their ends  
And some are born to choose them  
  
Don't let your fantasies be blinded by the light  
You don't have to save your wildest dreams for the night  
  
Don't hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back, reach out  
Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out  
Some you win and some you lose  
And some will bring you sorrow  
Some are born to lead the rest  
And some are born to follow  
Don't rely on miracles to open any door  
And don't let a shadow be your guide anymore  
  
Don't hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back, reach out  
Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out  
Ride the wave of destiny  
Rise above the crest  
And believe everything that happens to you happens for the best  
Don't allow the world of men  
To turn your head no more  
Cause if you can't let yourself go  
What are you saving yourself for?  
  
Don't hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back, reach out  
Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out  
  
Don't let your fantasies be blinded by the light  
For you don't have to save your wildest dreams for the night  
  
Don't hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back, reach out  
Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out

If it's getting harder to face every day  
Don't let it show, don't let it show  
Though it's getting harder to take what they say  
Just let it go, just let it go  
  
And if it hurts when they mention my name  
Say you don't know me  
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame  
Say you don't own me  
  
Even if it's taking the easy way out  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in, don't tell them anything  
Don't let it,  
Don't let it show  
  
Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say  
Say you don't care, say you don't care  
Even if you want to believe there's a way  
I won't be there, I won't be there  
  
But if you smile when they mention my name  
They'll never know you  
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame  
They'll never own you  
  
Even if you feel you've got nothing to hide  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in, don't tell them anything  
Don't let it,  
Don't let it show

Dora, in the middle of the night  
Will you wait for me  
Till the morning sun shine bright  
For it's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Dora, oh it hurts to hear you say  
You're all alone  
And the pain won't go away  
But it's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Listening through the hours of the day  
Waiting for the night to end  
Thinking, though it's not for me to say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
Forget the lies they whisper in your ear  
And every superstitious word you hear  
Dora, though the truth is hard to face  
And the fantasy  
Is not easy to replace  
It's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Oh, I keep thinking  
Of the words I shouldn't say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
And every doubt they whisper in your ear  
And all the half-forgotten past you fear  
One day will fade away and disappear  
  
Dora, in the middle of the night  
Do you wait for me  
Where the morning sun shine bright  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe  
  
Is it all a thread  
Of the tangled web you weave  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe

Lead vocal: the flying pickets  
  
We've come so far  
To hear the words  
Of hope and consolation  
With no star to guide us through the night  
  
Through many realms of fantasy  
We wander and we roam  
Far away from home  
  
Then all of those  
We held so dear  
Grew tired of understanding  
And we dream through the endless night alone  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away, far away  
Like a leaf that the wind has blown  
Far away, far away  
Far away from home  
Far away from home  
  
All that I am  
What I've become  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away, far away  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
Far away  
  
I could be happy then  
Far away  
I'll find jerusalem  
Far away from home  
Far away from home

Lead vocal: eric woolfson  
  
I was alone in my room feeling sorry for myself.  
Call me a prophet of doom, I could think of nothing else.  
I found a freudian book gathering dust upon my shelf.  
I thought I'll give it a look, would it hurt or would it help?  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?  
  
I met the wolfman and the ratman, anna-o and little hans.  
They were walking on a tightrope, I never thought they had a chance.  
And then a hand reached out to hold them just before they tumbled down.  
But I was standing in a quicksand and I could not feel the ground.  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?  
  
I look back and try to find the part of me I don't know.  
I won't stop till I see the truth. There's such a long way to go.  
  
I saw a picture of a stranger but I don't understand.  
He had a ring around his finger and something burning in his hand.  
And I wanted him to teach me and I needed to believe.  
But the shadows that he threw me were intended to deceive.  
  
Freudiana, do you want to be somebody?  
Freudiana, do you want to change the world?

Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
I was talking to a man  
And I saw he wore a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I caught and ate a whale  
Then I woke up feeling hungry, he said  
That's a curious tale  
For a dream contains a wish  
In this case a giant fish  
As the pressure you were under  
Might have woken you from slumber  
To relieve the pangs of hunger  
You just dreamed yourself a dish  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
For I also met a man  
And he also wore a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where the sun was at it's height  
But my toes were blocks of ice, he said  
Let me get this right  
You are tall and so your feet  
Must protrude beyond the sheet  
While you sleep they're unprotected  
And it's just as I suspected  
You were trying to dream some heat  
  
But there are six white wolves  
In the dead of the night  
On the branch of a tree  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright  
All the better to see  
  
And they have such big ears  
All the better to hear  
And they're listening to me  
  
And they have such sharp teeth  
All the better to eat  
And they're looking at me  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
I was speaking to a man  
But I don't recall a ring  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
And I told him of a dream  
Where I turned into a snail  
And he said it is simplicity  
To follow such a trail  
For this creature takes his shell  
Anywhere that he may roam  
  
But work must keep you on the move  
You fear your wife may disapprove  
So in the dream you just remove  
And take along your home  
  
If I step on a line  
Something will happen  
There are rats in a jar  
Something will happen  
  
And they have such big eyes  
And they're shining so bright  
All the better to see  
  
And they have such sharp teeth  
All the better to eat  
And they're looking at me  
  
Tell me what they say  
Tell me what can they be  
Tell me what does it mean  
Tell me what do you see  
  
Fantasia  
Nothing is what it seems  
Fantasia  
A world that's made out of dreams  
Fantasia  
Nothing is what it seems  
Fantasia  
  
Well it's funny you should say that  
It's a most peculiar thing  
Yes it's funny you should say that  
  
Though I haven't met this man  
So he didn't wear a ring  
It's so funny you should say that  
  
I told him of a dream  
Where I turned into a hat  
That was round and made of fur, would he say  
Nothing wrong with that  
As I sit here in my chair  
I can see your growth is spare  
And it is my observation  
That this caused you much frustration  
So you dreamed a consolation  
To replace the loss of hair  
  
I'm going to be a mother  
I'm going to have a child  
  
There are wolves in the tree  
But the tree never grew  
There are rats in the jar  
But the curse wasn't true  
  
Fantasia  
Nothing is what it seems  
Fantasia  
A world that is made out of dreams

Lead vocal: leo sayer  
  
Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie.  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string.  
Do you feel anything?  
Would you laugh? Would you care? Would you cry?  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery, how can anyone disagree?  
And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
So if you are confused and don't know which way to go.  
You will certainly know. From the moment we're living we die.  
And if it's all a crazy game you don't want to play  
Tell me what you can say.  
It's a joke. It's the truth. It's a lie.  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery that we don't understand.  
And the music is a rhapsody if you're happy the way that you are.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day.  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.

Another passenger  
"your baggage thank you sir"  
I don't wanna go  
What am I doing here  
I feel so sick with fear  
God don't let it show  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
I'm scared to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
  
They say they'll care for me  
But I would rather be  
Both feet on the ground  
What if the engine dies  
These are no friendly skies'  
My head's spining round  
  
It's all a twist of fate  
But it's myself I hate  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
Afraid to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
  
I must control myself  
You must control me too  
  
Cover my eyes cause I'm so high  
I can't look down  
Afraid to fly and I'm so high  
I can't look down  
I can't look down.....

"Go back home", you damn fool  
Surely you know you can't win  
You should've never have come near this place  
You should have stayed outside  
(Lookin' up)  
It's too late to turn back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But they blinded you with diamonds  
And all the money that money can buy  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
"You can't win", you damn fool  
You drank all the wine from the cup  
And your painted lady's gone now  
And you're way back on the downside  
(Lookin' up)  
You can't catch the monkey on your back  
Nobody asked you to try  
But for every heart they held a spade  
And you lost more than money can buy  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a washed up rag, tattered and torn, yeah  
I wish I'd never been born  
And I'm so afraid of being on my own  
But I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a down and out just blowin' my horn  
Oh, I don't wanna go home  
I'm like a washed up rag, tattered and torn  
Oh, I don't wanna go home, yeah  

If I had a mind to  
I wouldn't wanna think like you  
And if I had a time to  
I wouldn't wanna talk to you  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you  
  
If I was high class  
I wouldn't need a buck to pass  
And if I was a fall guy  
I wouldn't need no alibi  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you  
  
Back on the bottom line  
Diggin' for a lousy dime  
If I hit a mother lode  
I'd cover anything that showed  
  
I don't care  
What you do  
I wouldn't want to be like you  

I prefer to spend my time in solitary ways  
Keeping myself to myself  
Can't pretend that it's been easy since you went away  
Living with somebody else  
  
If you should change your mind  
If you should turn around and look behind  
If you could see me the way I used to be  
At the risk of bringing back the sorrow and despair  
  
I would do it all again  
Holding on to memories and pretending not to care  
Knowing that the show was soon to end  
If only I could change your mind  
  
If only you would change  
If I had the chance I'd do it all again  
I would do it all again  
  
I remember windy shores on menancholy days  
Drifting along with the tide  
And the joy of simple things and ordinary ways  
Taking it all in my stride  
  
If you should change your mind  
If I could let you see what lies behind  
If you could see need me the way it used to be  
  
Even for the moment of the happy times we shared  
Living in my dreams since then  
At the risk of losing only castles in the air  
Come with me and we can try again  
Oh, if I could change your mind  
  
Can't pretend it's been lonely since you went away  
Oh, if I could change your mind

To touch the sky  
A dreamer must be  
Someone who has more imagination than me  
  
To reach the stars  
A dreamer must fly  
Somehow he must live more of a lifetime than I  
For sands of time won't wait  
And it may be too late  
  
Now is the hour and moment  
Don't let the chance go by  
Your ship is sailing with the high tide  
And all your dreams are on the inside  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
Looking out, looking out, looking out  
  
To change the world  
A dreamer must be  
Someone who has more determination than me  
  
To free his soul  
A dreamer must fly  
Somewhere he must find a better reason than I  
The hands of time won't wait  
And we may be too late  
  
Now is the hour and moment  
Don't let a day pass by  
Your ship is sailing with the high tide  
You could be standing on the inside  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
On the inside looking out, on the inside looking out  
Looking out, looking out, looking out

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say  
Who knows if we'll meet along the way  
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare  
What will we find when we get there  
  
La Sagrada Familia we pray the storm will soon be over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
  
Who knows where the winds will blow us, only a fool would say  
Who knows if we'll ever reach the shore  
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare  
What kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?  
Only a fool would say  
  
La Sagrada Falilia the wind has changed the storm is over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over  
La Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land  
  
Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory  
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears  
  
Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would say  
Who knows what the fates may have in store  
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see  
How should we know where that may be? How should we know?  
  
Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of glory  
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears  
  
Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say  
Who knows what's been lost along the way  
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share  
How will we know when we are there? How will we know?  
Only a fool would say  
  
La Sagrada Falilia the war is won the battle's over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over  
La Sagrada Familia behold the mighty hand  
La Sagrada Familia the night is gone the waiting's over  
La Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land  
  
Until the next time  
Until the next time  
  
La Sagrada Familia

Waiting till the sun goes down  
Shadows walk in the night  
Living in a fantasy  
In and out of dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own  
  
Every way I turn my eyes  
Shadows pass in the night  
Haunted by reality  
Living out of dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own  
  
I'm waiting till the sun goes down  
Shadows talk in the night  
Living out a fantasy  
Slipping into dreams  
Nothing is the way it seems  
  
Let me go home,  
I had a bad night leave me alone  
Let me go home,  
I've had a hard time being on my own

Maitre charcot he can send you where the winds blow  
Look in his eye and your mind goes into limbo  
They say, he's mad as a hatter  
He's no medicine man  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
Maitre charcot he can teach you what you don't know  
Look in his eye and the clock runs out of tempo  
He knows, it's mind over matter  
You'll fit in the palm of his hand  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
It doesn't need too much explaining  
It doesn't seem to be so hard  
You just count to ten and then back again  
And before long you won't know where you are  
  
Maitre charcot he will catch you if you let go  
Look in his eyes and your thoughts go into slow motion  
You glide, like birds of a feather  
He flies higher than you  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
For any doubt you have remaining  
Let me remind you once again  
You just close you eyes as the eagle flies  
And before you know it you won't feel any pain, any pain  
  
I'd like to stay here forever, who needs the hullabaloo?  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go

Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's been going on  
Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's gone wrong  
  
Let's talk about dreams  
I never learned to read the signs  
Let's think about what it all means  
I never seem to have the time  
  
Let's talk about you and your problems  
All that I seem to do is spend the night  
Just talking 'bout you and your problems  
No matter what I say I can't get it right  
  
Don't think about dreams  
Is it all a waste of time  
Don't think about what it all means  
If you are a friend of mine  
  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's losing  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's always losing out  
  
And how do you think  
I feel about what's been going on  
Let's talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about what's gone wrong  
  
Let's think about dreams  
We never seem to have the time  
Let's talk about what it all means  
If you are a friend of mine  
  
Let's talk about me  
I'm the one who's losing out  
I'm the one who's losing out  
I'm the one who's losing out, losing out  
  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's losing  
Talk about me, for a minute  
I'm the one who's always losing out  

I am just a stranger, in a promised land  
I am only learning a game with the rules i don't understand  
Going round in circles, I've been round before  
I can walk no more  
I can walk no more  
I am just a drifter, in an open sea  
But no matter how much i try, the tide will not turn for me  
Going round in circles, till i reach the shore  
I am blown by so many winds  
I can take no more  
I can take no more  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
I am just a dreamer, when i close my eyes  
I can fly so close to the sun, that i can not see it rise  
Going round in circles, in a silent sky  
I am lost for so many worlds  
I can not say why  
I can not say why  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
Just a traveler, on an endless flight  
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night  
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall  
To believe in so many truths  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense at all  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
I was afraid, cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye

I can see the glow of a distant sun  
I can feel it inside  
Maybe this day could be the one  
  
I can hear the roar of a distant crowd  
They are waiting for me  
Calling my name  
Shouting out loud  
  
Holding on isn't always easy  
I ain't gonna change my mind  
  
Limelight you were all I ever wanted  
Since it all began  
Limelight shining on me  
Telling the world who I am  
Limelight don't let me slip right through your fingers  
There's a long way to fall  
After the years of waiting  
I'm gonna show them all  
  
I can see the world in a different light  
Now it's easy to say  
Where I went wrong  
What I did right  
  
I can hear the beat of a different drum  
Take it all in my stride  
Hold my head high  
Second to none  
  
Holding on wasn't always easy  
Nothing can change my mind  
  
Limelight you were all I ever wanted since it all began  
Limelight shining on me telling the world who I am  
Limelight don't let it slip right through your fingers  
There's a long way to fall  
After all the years of waiting, I'm gonna show them all  
Maybe the role's not easy, maybe the prize is small  
After all the years of waiting, I'm gonna show them all

Little hans, little hans, what do you see?  
The worlds is full of big surprises  
Little hans, little hans, what can they be?  
They come in many shapes and sizes  
  
Little boys always love to play  
But something is not quite right  
Little hans won't come out today  
He's scared of a horse that might bite  
  
Little hans, little hans, what can it be?  
Your thoughts are filled with such confusion  
Little hans, little hans when will you see?  
You're barking up the wrong conclusion  
  
Professor man asks him oh so nicely  
Why will you not come out?  
Little hans tells him most politely  
What he is thinking about  
  
A ride in a tram, a lily white lamb, raspberry jam  
Little hans, little hans, where will you go?  
The world is full of compromises  
Little hans, little hans, how will you know?  
The come in many strange disguises  
  
Professor man shakes his head and wonders  
How will he work it out?  
Little hans tells him quite precisely  
What he's been dreaming about  
  
I jump in the bath, I make myself laugh, I ride a giraffe  
  
Little hans, little hans, I found a clue  
I think I've made the right connection  
Little hans, little hans, all I can do  
Is give a common sense injection  
  
Little boys grow up just like daddy  
Professor man has no doubt  
Little hans goes to sleep and wonders  
What he was talking about

Money don't grow on a money tree  
The more you take the less for me  
Money don't buy what you really need  
It make an iceman cry, a stoneman bleed  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter who you are  
It rules your life like a virgin queen  
One day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It rules the world like a green machine  
  
In the bank, in a box, money talks  
In the black, on the rocks, money talks, money talks  
  
Money don't lose in the money game  
It drags you down like a ball and chain  
So money don't come with a guarantee  
It make a fool of you, it make a fool of me  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you say  
It ties you down but it can set you free  
Some day you might get over it, but in the meantime  
It burns you up in the first degree  
  
Moscow, Bangkok, money talk  
Park Lane, Boardwalk, money talk  
  
But when you get right down to it, no matter what you try  
You deal the cards, give the wheel a spin  
One day you might get over it but everybody knows  
It's heads you lose and it's tails they win  
Don't have too much to show for it, that's the way it goes  
You roll the dice and they cash you in  
  
Pinball, jukebox, money talks  
Redskins, White Sox, money talks  
Billboard, Cash box, money talks

There's not a day  
I don't think of your name  
The state that I'm in  
You're completely to blame  
No words left to say  
Turn my dreams all to grey  
And I'm more and more lost without you  
  
You're a storm in my head  
That really blew a new day  
A liquid design  
Is what you do to my mind  
No words left to say  
Cause my mind's gone away  
And I'm more and more lost without you  
  
More and more lost without you  
I was found but then I totally lost you  
Don't know a soul that could ever doubt you  
That's why I'm more and more lost without you  
  
More and more

I am the universal mother  
The heart of the family  
When you are born in your innocent world  
You will depend on me  
Mine are the arms to rock you  
When you're scared of the dark of the night  
But soft though the lips of a girl might be  
No one can love you better than me  
  
But somewhere in the dark there is a wall of silence  
That hides the love away, that hides the love away  
  
I am the universal father  
The head of the family  
When you imagine a man of the world  
He will be just like me  
I am the lord and master  
My word is the royal decree  
I stand by the side of the woman I love  
No one can love her better than me  
  
I am the universal son  
The pride of the family  
I shine like the stars in my mother's eyes  
She can believe in me  
I am the young pretender  
With fire to bring to the fight  
But strong as anothers arms may be  
No one can love her better than me  
  
But somewhere in the dark there is a wall of silence  
And sometimes in the night there is a wall of silence  
Don't take the love away, don't take the love away  
No one can love you better than me  
No one can love you better than me  
  
No one can love you  
No one can love you better than me

Nothing's good the news is bad  
The heat goes on and it drives you mad  
Scornful thoughts that fly your way  
  
You should turn away cause there's nothing more to say  
You gave the best you had to give  
You only had one life to live  
You fought so hard you were a slave  
  
After all you gave there was nothing left to save  
You've got nothing left to lose (you've got nothing left to lose)  
No you've got nothing left to lose (who'd want to be standing in your shoes)  
Nothing ventured nothing gained  
  
No more lingering doubt remained  
Nothing sacred or profane  
Everything to gain  
Cause you've nothing left

As far as my eyes can see  
There are shadows approaching me  
And to those I left behind  
I wanted you to know  
You've always shared my deepest thoughts  
You follow where I go  
  
And oh when I'm old and wise  
Bitter words mean little to me  
Autumn winds will blow right through me  
And someday in the mist of time  
When they asked me if I knew you  
I'd smile and say you were a friend of mine  
And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes  
Oh when I'm old and wise  
  
As far as my eyes can see  
There are shadows surrounding me  
And to those I leave behind  
I want you all to know  
You've always shared my darkest hours  
I'll miss you when I go  
  
And oh, when I'm old and wise  
Heavy words that tossed and blew me  
Like autumn winds will blow right through me  
And someday in the mist of time  
When they ask you if you knew me  
Remember that you were a friend of mine  
As the final curtain falls before my eyes  
Oh when I'm Old and wise  
  
As far as my eyes can see

(elliott, english)  
  
Where does a dream belong  
Locked in the mind on the edge of time  
Like a ship lost in a storm  
How do we find the key  
Longing to see, through the artist's eye  
Maybe only birds can fly  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
One day to fly  
  
Someone said and I believe  
Try if you dare, you can walk on air  
A dream is all you need  
A circle that takes you high  
Lighter than air as the earth goes by  
Through a spiral in the sky  
  
The man must be insane who knows  
A mind alive with images so strange  
So close but never rode the sky  
  
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind  
Trying to figure out the reason why  
Picturing wings held together with string  
  
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas  
Made them laugh but now they see  
That the artist had a vision  
That the wind could set us free  
It's a bridge until tomarrow  
Taking us beyond the sun  
As the artist paints his picture  
The story's just begun  
  
Analyzing, criticizing  
Fear of the unknown  
Theorizing, visualizing  
The road to take us home  
If it takes forever  
Someone's gonna fly  
We may never get to heaven  
But still we're gonna try  
  
Watching the birds  
As they sail on the wind  
One day to fly

Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you  
I need one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Gimme some air or I can't breathe  
I can't see so I can't believe  
Show me just a little more  
Oh oh gimme one  
  
Gimme one good reason why I should listen to you  
I need one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Under your thumb ain't no place to hide  
I can't choose and I can't decide  
Gotta be a better way  
Oh oh gimme one  
  
I keep making the same mistake  
No win no lose no give and no take  
I'm just playing a simple game  
And I don't wanna ask you again and again  
  
For one good reason why I should listen to you  
Just one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Under your spell ain't no place to be  
Don't mess around with a fool like me  
Help me just a little more  
Oh oh gimme one, gimme one  
  
Well I keep making the same mistake  
No win no lose no give and no take  
And I'm just playing a simple game  
And I don't wanna ask you again and again  
  
For one good reason why I should listen to you  
Just one good reason why I should do  
What you want me to  
Pull on the string you hold in your hand  
Making me jump like a one man band  
Gotta be a better way  
Oh oh gimme one  

Don't look back 'cause there's one more river.  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross.  
No more fightin', no more dyin',  
No more cheatin', no more lyin'.  
  
Don't look back 'cause there's one more river.  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross.  
Don't start askin' the rhyme or reason,  
Don't hold back, it's the time of the season.  
  
One more mile and one more road...  
One last bridge and one less load...  
One  
More  
River...  
  
Don't look back you got one more river!  
Don't turn your back, you got one more river to cross...  
Don't start askin' the rhyme or reason,  
Don't hold back, it's the time of the season!  
  
One more mile and one more road...  
One last bridge and one less load...  
One more river.  
One more river!

Out of the blue  
I come sailing  
Through the years  
Through the years  
What do I do?  
Now that I've seen  
All our hopes  
And all of our fears  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
Yes I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
I travel far  
Yet no distance  
I'm still here  
Always here  
So follow the call  
To our senses  
Still there's hope  
Behind the fear  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
'cause I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
Yes I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue

If you could press rewind and do it all again  
Would you change your mind, would you change a thing  
Would you make it easy, would you make it hard  
Would you play the game under another name  
Or ask the dealer for one more card  
  
Bang your drum, sing your song  
Don't give up, keep the faith, it won't be long  
You've been high, you've been low  
Press rewind and let it go  
  
Have you had your say, seen all you wanted to see  
Or did your dream give way to reality  
Don't think it's all too late for you to even try  
Before you clip your wings, see what this life brings  
You've waited too long it's time to fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you believe in fate and what is meant to be  
Could you imagine life without a guarantee  
Would you appreciate that time was on your side  
A flash of second sight, a chance to do it right  
Is something money just can't buy  
  
Chorus

Well even the longest night won't last forever  
But too many hopes and dreams won't see the light  
And all of the plans I make won't come together  
  
Something in the air  
Maybe for the only time in my life  
Something in the air  
Turning me around and guiding me right  
  
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right  
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight  
  
Well even the brightest star won't shine forever  
But all of the hands I play are working out right  
And every move I make feels like a winner  
  
Something in the air  
Maybe for the only time in my life  
Something in the air  
Turning me around and guiding me right  
  
And it's a prime time, maybe the stars were right  
I had a premonition, it's gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight  
Gonna be my turn tonight  

Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night  
Tell you 'bout a Dream that I have every night  
It ain't kodachrome and it isn't black and white  
Take me for a fool if you feel that's right  
Well I'm Never on my own but there's nobody in sight  
  
I don't know if I'm scared of the Lightning  
Trying to reach me  
I can't turn to the left or the right  
I'm too scared to run and I'm too weak to fight  
But I don't Care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
  
Tell you 'bout a dream that I have every night  
It's in dolby stereo but I never hear it right  
Take me for a fool well that's alright  
Well I see the way to go But there isn't any light  
  
I don't know why I'm scared of the lightning  
Trying to reach me  
Help me to find what I don't want to know  
You're taking me There but I don't want to go  
I don't care it's all Psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
  
You're readin' my mind you won't look in my eyes  
You say I do things that I don't Realise  
But I don't care it's all psychobabble rap to me  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
Psychobabble all psychobabble  
You're lighting a scene that's faded to black  
I threw it away cause I don't want it back  
But I don't care it's all psychbabble rap

There are pyramids in my head!  
There's one underneath my bed!  
And my lady's getting cranky.  
Every possible location  
Has a simple explanation  
And it isn't hanky-panky.  
  
I have read, somewhere in a book,  
They improve all your food and your wine.  
It's said that everything you grow in your garden will taste pretty fine,  
Instead, all I ever get is a pain in the neck and a  
Yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap!  
  
I've consulted all the sages,  
I could find in the yellow pages,  
But there aren't many of them...  
And the mayan panoramas  
On my pyramid pajamas  
Haven't helped my little problem.  
  
I've been told someone in the know  
Can be sure that his luck is as good as gold,  
Money in the bank and you don't even pay for it if you fold  
A dollar in the shape of the pyramid that's printed on the back.  
  
It's no lie.  
You can keep the edge of a razor as sharp as an eagle's eye.  
You can grow a hedge that is vertically straight, over ten feet high.  
All you really need is a pyramid and just a little luck.  
  
I have read, somewhere in a book,  
They improve all your food and wine  
And I've been told,  
Someone in the know  
Can be sure of his good luck and it's no lie.  
All you really need is a little bit of pyramidic  
Help!

I was lonely and depressed  
Having fled the family home  
When I met an old acquaintance  
I had only barely known  
  
And I told her over tea  
Of my worries and my woes  
And a morbid fear of eating beans  
In tightly fitting clothes  
  
And she said psychoanalysis was just the thing for me  
And she knew a mayfair analyst I really ought to see  
  
So I went round to his rooms  
And he saw me right away  
Though he asked a sum of money I could I'll afford to pay  
  
But I lay down on the couch  
By a bowl of flaccid flowers  
And I talked and talked and talked and talked  
For hours and hours and hours  
And he told me tales of oedipus with great authority  
  
And he asked me if my mother  
Wore stiletto heels and rubber  
And I realised that this poor soul  
Was more confused than me  
  
Well the shock was so profound  
That I fled into the strand  
Where I saw a hare krishna group  
And joined in with the band  
  
This was just the life for me  
Free of worldly goods and care  
And I chanted and I ranted  
Round and round trafalgar square  
  
I converted tens of thousands and they joined us then and there  
  
But the bagwan was so jealous  
That he called me over zealous  
Then he threw me out  
When I refused to cut off all my hair  
  
(dr. Ruth, dr. Ruth, why not write to dr. Ruth?)  
  
So I wrote to dr. Ruth  
And she helpfully proposed  
I should join a nudist colony  
And throw away my clothes  
  
All that sun upon my flesh  
Would set my libido free  
And would guarentee much more of it  
Whatever 'it' may be  
  
But I don't feel that I was quite equipped for such a life  
  
Fair of skin just like my sisters  
Too much sun would give me blisters  
So I think I'll turn the whole thing in  
  
And go home to the wife

It's been a long road  
We've walked the last mile  
We reach the same conclusion  
And we stop for a while  
Together we know  
The way we must go  
We're leaving an illusion  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
We share the same thoughts  
We read the same lines  
We meet on sad occasions  
And in happier times  
A spoken goodbye  
And both of us try  
To walk away in silence  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
And always goodbye  
But heaven knows why  
I can't erase the memory  
That's for us to share  
Only for us to share  
Only for us to share  
Only for us to share  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  
We live our separate lives  
And go our different ways  
'Cause we don't see eye to eye  
And we can't stand face to face  
We live our separate lives  
While counting all the days  
Till the two of us arrive  
In another time and place  

Look at me now, a shadow of the man I used to be...  
Look through my eyes and through the years of loneliness you'll see...  
To the times in my life when I could not bear to lose  
A simple game.  
And the least of it all was the fortune and the fame...  
But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun...  
Was I to know?  
For the last thing of all that was on my mind  
Was the close at the end of the show.  
The shadow of a lonely man feels nobody else...  
  
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man  
I can see myself...  
  
(Looking out of nowhere...Looking out of nowhere...)  
  
But the sound of the crowds when they come to see me now,  
Is not the same.  
And the jest of it all is I can't recall my name.  
But I cling to a hope till I can't hold on anymore...anymore...  
And for all the acclaim, I am all alone!  
And I see as I look through the door,  
  
The shadow of a lonely man...There's nobody else...  
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man  
I can see myself!  
  
...Look at me now, a shadow of the man I used to be....  

If I cried out loud  
over sorrows I've Known  
And the secrets I've heard  
It would ease my mind  
Someone sharing the load  
But I won't breathe a word  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out  
  
While the children laughed  
I was always afraid  
of the Smile of the clown  
So I close my eyes  
Till I can't see the light  
And I hide from the sound  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out  
  
I can hear the cry  
Of the leaf on a tree  
As it Falls to the ground  
I can hear the call  
of an Echoing voice  
And there's no one around  
  
We're two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We need a chance to talk things over  
Two of a kind  
Silence and I  
We'll find a way to work it out

The hours, the minutes seem to fly  
And since the last goodbye  
You and I came a long way  
The nights, too short to fill with sleep  
Or falling in too deep  
Seem so far away now  
  
Memories, all we share between us  
Everything we were, all that we remain  
But memories somehow came between us  
Breaking up two minds that were one and the same  
  
The years are moments passing by  
No time to wonder why  
You and I went the wrong way  
The days too short to fill with dreams  
Or question what it means  
Are a part of me now  
  
Remember all the leaves were falling  
Walking hand in hand, standing in the rain  
Remember distant voices calling  
Whispers in the dark, I can hear them again  
  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
  
Memories, all we share between us  
Everything we were, all that we remain  
But memories somehow came between us  
Breaking up two minds that were one and the same  
  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round  
Since the last goodbye  
It's all the wrong way 'round

In a matter of a moment  
Lost till the end of time  
It's the evening of another day  
And the end of mine  
  
Now the starlight which has found me  
Lost for a million years  
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes  
'Till it disappears  
  
Could it be that somebody else is  
Looking into my mind  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Like a mirror held before me  
Large as the sky is wide  
And the image is reflected  
Back to the other side  
  
Could it be that somebody else is  
Looking into my mind  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time  
  
Some other place  
Somewhere  
Some other time

Oh what a price we pay  
For the things we say  
And the closer I get to you  
The further you move away  
  
All the lies we tell  
In the games we play  
And the longer I think it over  
The harder it is to stay  
  
Sooner or later I'll be free  
To leave the past behind  
Sooner or later you're gonna be  
The last thing on my mind  
Little by little I'm finding out  
The truth behind your eyes  
Maybe if I don't show  
I thought you might like to know  
You're gonna be the last thing on my mind  
  
You didn't want to know  
I could have told you so  
But the moment I think it's over  
The further there is to go  
  
Just a little word  
Such an easy way  
But the longer I think about it  
The harder it is to say  
  
Sooner or later I'll be free  
To leave the past behind  
Sooner or later you're gonna be  
The last thing on my mind  
Little by little I'm finding out  
The truth behind your eyes  
Maybe if I don't show  
I thought you might like to know  
You're gonna be the last thing on my mind  

I know the truth  
But I can't say  
And I have to turn my head  
And look the other way  
  
I'm not afraid  
And I won't lie  
As long as I see no wrong  
I won't need to testify  
  
I see the world  
And I'm looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While they're running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I feel the blow  
But I don't speak  
And I have to close my eyes  
Pretending I'm asleep  
  
Well I see the tears  
But I don't cry  
As long as I do no wrong  
I don't need an alibi  
  
I see the world  
And I'm looking from a high place  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground  
  
I breathe the air  
While they're running in a rat race  
Way above it all  
Standing on higher ground

I was just a joker in a serious game  
I Didn't have the Heart to play  
But sooner or later  
I'll find a reason to throw it away  
Risin' on the crest of a natural wave  
That Never seems to break my way  
I'm livin' without it  
  
But I got to Do something about it  
Step by step little by little  
Step by step take it line by line  
Move move move, move a Little closer  
  
I was Just a runner in a one horse race  
Livin' on the don't pass line  
Sooner or later  
I Got to lose cause I'm wasting my time  
Lady luck must have been a wonderful girl  
She's never been a Friend of mine  
I'm living without her  
But I still got that mountain to climb  
  
Step by step little by little  
Step by step rake it line by line  
Move move move, move a little closer  
  
Step by step the Deal is mine

There's a voice on the phone  
Who just called in to say  
"Mr. Jones isn't home  
He'll be gone for the day"  
  
So he pulls down the blind  
To adjust his disguise  
But it's all in his mind  
Which he proudly denies  
  
I turn the boat back from the weir  
Where to go from here  
I can't hide from each face I see  
Looking out from behind them is me  
  
I'm attempting to guess  
What they meant when they said  
"Mr. Jones and his guest  
Won't be using the bed"  
  
So if I take the rap  
While they stay out of sight  
I can spring from the trap  
When the timing is right  
  
One minute I think I know what I mean  
The next I hear voices inside disagree  
Why are they laughing at me?  
So I pick up the phone  
  
Someone's asking of me  
Is the real Mister Jones  
Mister One, Two or Three?  
So I say that they're not  
  
But it's not as I say  
'Cause they're all that I've got  
And I can't get away  
As Alice waves us through the glass  
  
Are we home at last  
For tomorrow they'll be here you see  
Locked away safe inside there with me  
'Cause tomorrow they'll be here you'll see  
  
Locked away safe inside they're with me  
One minute I think I know what I mean  
The next I hear voices inside disagree  
Why are they laughing at me?

If I could see the sky above  
And my mind could be set free  
As wild white horses reached the shore  
I'd stand alone and oversee  
  
And if the bush before me burns  
Should I turn my eyes away  
And still the voices I can hear  
As clear to me as light of day  
  
I believed in my dreams  
Nothing could change my mind  
Now I know what they mean  
How could I be so blind  
  
Cold sands of time  
(Winds that blow as cold as ice  
Sounds that come in the night)  
Shall hide what is left of me  
(Come from Paradise)  
  
I've been through times when no one cared  
(Words that were mine)  
I've seen clouds in empty skies  
When one kind word meant more to me  
(Shall last as a memory)  
Than all the love in Paradise  
  
I believed in my dreams  
Nothing could change my mind  
Till I found what they mean  
Nothing can save me now

(parsons, bairnson, elliott)  
  
There must be a thousand ways  
Holding us within this maze  
Every path we take leads us astray  
Comfort me my only son  
Till the day my work is done  
There's no earthly reason we should stay  
  
And when the wind gets under these wings  
You will feel what freedom brings  
Stay right by me, walk don't run  
I don't want you flying too close to the sun  
  
Turn your eyes towards the light  
Steal away in silent flight  
The skies are calling out to you and me  
Over sea and over land  
God protect us with your hand  
Bring us safely to our destiny  
  
And now the wind is under our wings  
We can taste what freedom brings  
Stay right by me, walk don't run  
I don't want you flying too close to the sun  
  
God forgive his fall from grace  
The sea conceals his resting place  
Can we learn to stay behind the line  
If we have the means to fly  
Some of us will surely die  
Being reckless was his only crime  
  
And now the wind is under our wings  
We can taste what freedom brings  
Stay right by me, walk don't run  
I don't want you flying too close to the sun

When you were standing in the rain I gave you shelter  
When I was knocking on your door you gave me none  
Well I don't make that kind of deal with anybody  
And I won't be that kind of fool for anyone  
  
How do you feel when the tables have been turned?  
What will you do now the bridges have been burned?  
  
Cause it's  
Too late now the magic's lost  
Too late now the spell is broken  
Too late now to count the cost  
Of words that should remain unspoken  
  
When I need you by my side you stand above me  
And when I look into your eyes you turn away  
Well if that's the best there is then I won't buy it  
Well if that's the only game then I won't play  
  
How many danger signs did you ignore?  
How many times have you heard it all before?  
  
Cause it's  
Too late now the magic's lost  
Too late now the spell is broken  
Too late now to count the cost  
Of words that should remain unspoken

The ego and the id  
  
Lead vocal: eric stewart  
  
The time has come the wild one said  
When we must all decide  
We cannot carry on this way  
And so we must divide  
The road before us runs both ways  
So which one do you choose  
But all will not go well if you refuse  
  
What becomes of the upper me when the fire burns in my mind  
How can I leave my ego behind  
I return to another me or I lose the will to survive  
How can I keep my hero alive  
  
It seems to me the wise one said  
That mountains are so high  
The river is too deep to cross  
And none of us can fly  
But I believe that compromise  
Is what is needed here  
Or surely we become the things we fear  
  
But the good in me don't wanna believe  
That the evil me is so  
And a voice somewhere said do as you please  
But the upper me said no, no, no, no, no, no  
  
What becomes of the upper me when the fire burns in my mind  
How can I leave my ego behind  
I return to another me or I lose the will to survive  
How can I keep my hero alive  
To survive  
How can I keep my hero alive

Somehow you made it in the big wide world  
And you're absolutely home and dry  
You got away from a one horse town  
And the only way out was to fly  
  
You heard a lot about an easy street  
And it seems like the place to be  
You heard some talk about a slippery slope  
But you think "it can't happen to me"  
  
Vulture culture  
Use it or you lose it  
Vulture culture  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywood is calling won't you join the dance  
Moving onto Wall Street why not take a chance  
It's a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
Just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land  
  
Nowhere to turn around and catch your breath  
It's all relatively trouble free  
No need to bother with the bottom line  
Or a money back guarantee  
  
You sign a deal that's been etched in stone  
It's absolutely cut and dry  
That's when they got you in the danger zone  
And the only way out is to die  
  
Vulture culture  
Use it or you lose it  
Vulture culture  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywood is waiting striking up the band  
Everyone on Wall Street shakes you by the hand  
Such a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
Just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land  
  
Use it or you lose it  
Choose it or refuse it  
Hollywood's a no go not a second chance  
Nobody on Wall Street gives a second glance  
It's a vulture culture  
Moving to the beat of the band  
It's a vulture culture  
Never lend a loser a hand  
It's just a vulture culture  
Living off the fat of the land

What goes up, must come down  
What must rise, must fall  
And what goes on in your life  
Is writing on the wall  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a miracle won't last  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What must stand alone?  
And what goes on, in your mind  
Is turning into stone  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a pyramid won't last  
  
How can you be so sure?  
How do you know what the earth will endure?  
How can you be so sure?  
That the wonders you've made in you life  
  
Will be seen  
By the millions who'll follow to visit the site  
Of your dream?  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What goes round, must come round  
What's been lost, must be found

Standing around for an hour in the rain  
The porcelin promise is breaking once again  
Fill me with everything I want to hear  
These are the same lines that I heard last year  
And you always seem to talk and walk away  
Saying things will start to happen anyday  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
I've heard so much about boats coming in  
Well I've seen no ships so I guess I should swim  
How did I come to get caught in your wake  
The more that I give you the more you still take  
And you always seem to talk and walk away  
Saying things will start to happen any day  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
Monday is tuesday then march becomes may  
The days of my life are just ticking away  
  
So I say when  
So tell me when  
I say when  
So tell me when

Well it was only a game she was mine for the asking  
And I'd figured the whole thing out  
When she told me her name it was more than a feeling  
There wasn't any doubt  
Well it felt so good it was hard to break it  
Too much for me to explain  
But in a matter of time I'm gonna be myself again  
You've been  
Winding me up too long  
I'm over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you ain't so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Well it was only a game she was only a number  
But I figured it out all wrong  
Every time that I said I'll move on tomorrow  
I hung around too long  
Well it felt so good it was too hard to break it  
Too much before me to face  
Now I got nowhere to run she knows my every hidin' place  
You've been  
Winding me up too long  
I'm over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you ain't so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Saw through my disguise  
Winding me up too long  
I'm over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you ain't so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Beat me to the prize  
Hurt me with your lies  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size

You can take me up, you can wind me down  
There's no escape, but I'll never drown  
No wires or strings, no rough and smooth  
Just fire and stings, watch me closely, watch my every move  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just can't lose  
Wine from the water, gold from a tree  
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror, there's nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air  
I can break these chains, while I'm upside down  
Well it may seem strange, I don't hit the ground  
Now you see my hand, is quicker than your eye  
You should know by now, what you see here, all of it's a lie  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just can't lose  
Wine from the water, gold from a tree  
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve  
Think of a number, I'll get it right  
Throw me in the river, tie my hands up tight  
I can wind you up, I can turn you round  
No cunning stunts, till the lady's found  
No coils or springs, just nice and smooth  
No knaves or kings, find the lady, watch my every move  
I can count your money while I check your hand  
And you know I just can't lose  
Wine from the water, gold from a tree  
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror, no, nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air  
Wine from the water, gold from a tree  
Now I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve  
Think of a number, I'll get it right  
You can throw me in the river, tie my hands up tight  
Wine from the water, gold from a tree  
Now I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve  
Look for a mirror, there's nothing there  
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air

I know you're out there  
'cause I can feel ya  
Yeah I can feel ya trying to pull me down  
I know your kind  
You kinda like it  
When people tell ya not to come around  
Here's looking at ya  
Been nice to know ya  
I see the lines written on your face  
I wish you well  
But I gotta tell ya  
Ain't nothing human 'bout the human race  
  
You can run  
But you can't look behind you  
You can hide  
But the truth's gonna find you  
  
Some people fight it like some disease  
They carry secrets to an early grave  
They try to fake it  
While on their knees  
Never knowing what they really crave  
They got no values  
They got no soul  
No sense of purpose  
Nothing to believe  
Call me your friend  
Then steal me blind  
To me you're nothing but a common thief  
  
You can run  
But you can't look behind  
You you can hide  
But the truth's gonna find you  
Holding us within this maze

My eyes with your vision  
My choice but always your decision  
My play with your direction  
Well it's my lead but always your connection  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
B  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe  
  
My words, your expression  
My land, always your possession  
My song, your production  
Moby expense is always your deduction  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe  
  
And the face I see before me  
Is both sides of a mirror  
You really know you've got a hold on me  
And the face you're looking into  
Is both sides of a window  
And any way you look you see through me  
  
My fame, your reflection  
My weakness always your protection  
Well it's my terms on your conditions  
And they're my tunes but they're your compositions  
  
But when I look into your eyes you don't believe me  
I can see it in your eyes you don't believe

You're such a cool woman but I love you  
Such a cruel woman but I love you  
Open up your eyes and realize  
You're such a fool woman but I love you  
But give me all that you've got to give  
Cause it sure feels good to me  
I'm not your only man I'm just your lover  
Not your only man just another  
Open up your eyes and realize  
I'm gonna take what I can like any other  
I'll say any damned thing that you want me to  
Cause it don't mean a thing to me  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
Get out and find yourself another lover  
Why don't you find yourself another lover  
Open up your eyes and realize  
You don't mean nothing to me I'm not your mother  
You gave me all that you had to give  
But there's a whole lotta fish in the sea  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
Ooo, you fall and you fall and you fall and you fall  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas

Show me a promised land and I will go anywhere  
And if you ask me to take my time I'll wait for years  
I'll hold on though the whole world tells me I'm wrong  
Someday, someday  
But it seems so long  
  
Ask me to prove my love and I will do anything  
So if they turn off the light of the sun why should I care  
I'll hold on thought the whole world tells me I'm wrong  
Then in the morning as you leave me  
You touch my hand to show how much you care  
But just when I need you  
You won't be there  
  
I'll hold on but I need a shoulder to lean on  
Why if you love me must you leave me  
Why are you going anywhere  
Why must our love be something in the air  
Cause just when I need you  
You won't be there  
You won't be there

Watch me closely catch my eye  
If you do I beg you to remind me  
Who is stronger who is weak of those who seek  
And don't know where to find me  
  
Ask me why, I don't know  
You ask me why and I say  
Now you see me now you don't  
I thourght by now you'd learned  
You're gonna get your fingers burned  
  
Watch me closely understand  
That what you see is only an illusion  
If I'm wrong and you are right  
Then I will light your darkness with confusion  
  
Ask me why I don't know  
You ask me why and I say  
Chances are you're playing with fire  
I thought by now you'd learned  
You're gonna get your fingers burned  
  
Watch me closely be aware  
That all I do is only to suprise you  
Every move is sleight of hand  
And every word is planned to mystify you  
  
You ask me why I don't know  
You ask me why and I say  
Don't get fooled a second time  
I thought by now you'd understand  
You're gonna get your fingers burned  

The mother and son relationship  
  
Lead Vocal: Kiki Dee  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you know where you are  
Are you where you want to be  
  
Do you see what you like  
Do you like what you see  
Do you think a need in you  
Can fulfill a need in me  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
In a no man's land  
In a danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And you can't turn back  
And you can't find your way home  
  
Do you know who you are  
Do you know what you want  
Can you see me as I am  
  
Do you think you're a lion  
And I'm a lamb  
That you came in here a boy  
And you're going out a man  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And there's no way out  
Of the Danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And your only friend  
Is a heart of stone  
  
And now you are alone my friend  
And I must set you free  
And you must face the world outside  
And find your destiny  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
In a no man's land  
In a danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And your only friend has a heart of stone  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And there's no way out  
Of the Danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
Just a lonely child  
And you can't find your way home
