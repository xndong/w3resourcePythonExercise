I remember so well  
The day that you came into my life  
You asked for my name  
You had the most beautiful smile  
  
My life started to change  
I'd wake up each day feeling alright  
With you right by my side  
Makes me feel things will work out just fine  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That there's an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life  
  
I'll never forget  
How you brought the sun to shine in my life  
And took all the worries and fears that I had  
I guess what I'm really trying to say  
It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  
No words can express how much I love you  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That there's an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life

When you wake up each morning  
And you feel like calling  
I'll be there for you  
When the road seems uncertain  
And you can't stop the hurtin'  
I'll be there for you  
  
When there's no one beside you  
I'll be there to guide you  
Catch you each time you fall  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
When the world's unkind  
And your dreams, they need more time  
I'll be there for you  
  
If the rules they keep breaking  
And the future is fading  
I'll be there... For you  
  
The rainbow will end  
In the palm of your hand  
Don't ever let it go  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
Who knows where we'll go  
What will tomorrow bring  
But we have each other, just hold on tight  
We can take to the skies and fly...  
  
I'll be there for you...  
I'll be there for you...  
  
The rainbow will end  
In the palm of your hand  
Don't ever let it go  
When the stars won't shine anymore  
I'll be there...  
  
I'll be there

There are places I remember  
All my life  
Though some have changed  
Some forever not for better  
Some have gone  
And some remain  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life  
I loved you more  
Though the music is sweet  
But the song ain't complete  
Now in my life  
Boy, in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
It's a tune, yes it's true  
Still there's no me and you  
Here in my life  
Boy, in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
In my life  
There ain't no melody, oh no  
In my life  
There ain't no harmony  
To help me sing a song  
Oh the music is sweet  
(There are places I remember)  
But the song ain't complete  
Now in my life  
(All my life)  
Somethin' is missing  
(Though some have changed)  
It's a tune, yes it's true  
(Some forever, not for better)  
Still there's no me and you  
(And some have gone)  
Here in my life  
Somethin' is missing  
(And some remain)  
In my life there ain't no melody oh no  
(All these places have their moments)  
(With lovers and friends)  
(I still can recall)  
In my life there ain't no harmony  
(Some are dead and some are living)  
To help me sing this song  
(In my life)  
(I loved them all)  
All I need is a cue  
Well, I'm waiting for you  
Here in my life  
(But of all these friends and lovers)  
Boy in my life  
(There is no one compares with you)  
You are the melody (melody)  
'Cause in my life  
(In my life)  
(I know I'll often stop and think about them)  
You are the song-ac

Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing  
And jingle bells ring  
Snowin' and blowin'  
Up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop  
Has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in  
Jingle bell time  
Dancin' and prancin'  
In jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
  
What a bright time  
It's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell, time  
Is a swell time  
To go glidin' in a  
One horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up, jingle horse  
Pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle  
In a jinglin' beat  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
What a bright time  
It's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell, time  
Is a swell time  
To go glidin' in a  
One horse sleigh  
  
One horse sleigh  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing  
And jingle bells ring  
Snowin' and blowin'  
Up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop  
Has begun  
  
Giddy-up, jingle horse  
Pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle  
In a jinglin' beat  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell rock

Even though it's been so long  
My love for you keeps going strong  
I remember the things that we used to do  
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through  
I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you  
  
Chorus:  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
Ever since you went away  
Every hour of every day  
  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do  
There's just no getting over you  
  
I can see the love shining in your eyes  
And there comes a such a sweet surprise  
If seeing's believing it's worth the wait  
So hold and tell me it's not too late  
We're so good together, we starting forever now  
  
Chorus  
  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you baby  
Love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and we're there again  
  
Just one night  
And we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do  
Hold on tight and whatever comes our way we gonna make it through  
It seems believing is worth the wait  
So hold and tell me it's not too late  
We're so good together, we starting forever now  
  
Chorus  
  
And I miss you, I missed you  
All the tender love you gave me  
A feeling gets this strong  
You know the real thing's come along  
And I miss you  
  
I miss you like crazy baby  
Only your sweet love can save me  
I miss you like crazy  
A love like ours will never end  
Just touch me and we're there again  
I miss you like crazy  
I miss you like crazy  
No matter what I say or do

It took one look  
And forever laid out in front of me  
One smile and I died  
Only to be revived by you  
  
There I was  
Thought I had everything figured out  
Goes to show just how much I know  
'Bout the way life plays out...  
  
Chorus:  
I take one step away  
Then I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only, one and only you... Ooh...  
  
Now I know  
That I know not a thing at all  
Except the fact that I am yours  
And that you are mine  
  
Ooh  
They told me that this wouldn't be easy  
And no  
I'm not one to complain...  
  
Chorusx2:  
I take one step away  
When I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only, one and only you... Ooh...

Now the parking lot is empty  
Everyone's gone someplace  
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed  
A cooler and a two day suitcase  
'Cause there's a place we like to drive  
Way out in the country  
Five miles out of the city limit we're singin'  
And your hand's upon my knees  
So we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
I know the things that I am afraid of  
I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash  
And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth  
'Cause we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
Something new instead of something old  
But all you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
And it's fool's gold  
Fool's gold  
Now we're talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
And don't you ever forget it  
Now there's steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
And the closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free  
So we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two

Tired of feeling all by myself  
Being so different from everyone else  
Somehow you knew I needed your help  
Be my friend forever  
I never found my star in the night  
Building my dream was far from my sight  
You came along and I saw the light  
We'll be friends forever  
  
I can't face the thought of you leaving  
So take me along  
I swear I'll be strong  
If you take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
  
Somebody must have sent you to me  
What do I have you could possibly need  
All I can give is my guarantee  
We'll be friends forever  
I can't face the thought of you leaving  
So take me along  
I swear I'll be strong  
When you take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
Teach me more with each passing hour  
By your side  
I'll follow you  
I know I would cover?  
Is it true that you have the power  
To capture this moment in time  
Take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
Take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
(I want you to take me)  
I want you to take me

It's not the laughter  
It's not just the fun  
You've always touched my heart  
I know you're the one  
You're nothing less than a perfect friend to me  
Don't try to be like anyone else  
You don't have to be  
It's not the hours  
The times that we've spent  
A special moment like this  
Makes you know it's heaven sent  
You're nothing less than the right one for me  
Don't try to be like someone else  
You don't have to be  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
It's not the sweet song  
It isn't the dream  
It's just you my good friend  
And the love that you bring  
Throughout the seasons  
You're the one for me  
You're the one I love to love  
And you'll always be  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
The right one for me...  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
(No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other)  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
(It's not the laughter  
It's not j
