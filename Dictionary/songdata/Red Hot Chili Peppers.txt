Each time we have a quarl  
It almost breaks my heart  
Because I'm so afraid  
That we will have to part  
  
But each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
One day I feel so happy  
Then I feel so sad  
Looks like I need to learn  
The good  
From the bad  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
I cried a tear  
For nobody but you  
I will be a lonley one if your to say were through  
  
And if you wanna make me cry that wont be so hard to do  
If your gonna say goodbye  
I will still go on loving you  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
I cried a tear  
For nobody but you  
I will be a lonley one if your to say were through  
  
And if you wanna make me cry that wont be so hard to do  
If your gonna say goodbye  
I will still go on loving you  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
Why must I be a teenager in love X4

[Chorus]  
I like pleasure spiked with pain  
And music is my aeroplane  
It's my aeroplane  
Songbird sweet and sour Jane  
And music is my aeroplane  
It's my aeroplane  
Pleasure spiked with pain  
That mother fucker always spiked with pain  
  
I  
Looking in my own eyes "hello"  
I can't find the love I want  
Someone better slap me  
Before I start to rust  
Before I start to decompose  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
I can make it disappear  
I can make it disappear "have no fear"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sitting in my kitchen "hey girl  
I'm turning into dust again  
My melancholy baby  
The star of mazzy must  
Push her voice inside of me  
I'm overcoming gravity  
I'm overcoming gravity  
It's easy when you're sad to be  
It's easy when you're sad "said 'bout me"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just one note  
Could make me float  
Could make me float away  
One note from  
The song she wrote  
Could fuck me where I lay  
Just one note  
Could make me choke  
One note that's  
Not a lie  
Just one note  
Could cut my throat  
One note could make me die

Oh give me a home  
Where the buffalo roam  
And the death of a race is a game  
Where seldom is heard  
  
A peaceable word  
From the white trash  
Who killed as they came  
Though these words dig deep  
They offer no relief  
God save the queen  
I am an Indian chief  
  
There is a secret I keep  
It's called the talking leaf  
And you better believe  
That he speaks his beliefs  
Like a rock that bleeds  
A sea of grief  
  
My talking leaf speaks of  
A wounded knee creek  
American ghost dance  
A new man who is with old ways  
He walks the streets of life  
  
But he's in chains  
I'm alive he cried  
I can feel the flame  
Burning red inside  
I am an Indian brave  
There is a memory  
  
That lives in my blood  
Of the brand you laid  
On all you touched  
But the burning flame  
Turns to burning pain  
Genuine genocide  
  
And that's truly insane  
So like a wild hurricane  
I will dance on the grave  
Of my race that died  
When it should have been saved  
American ghost dance

Never twenty one when everyone's a sailor  
Coming up strong with the animal bar  
Ever loving more with Mr.Norman Mailer  
Turn another page at the animal bar  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it can't be long  
  
I I I the cry of vacilation  
I I I the higher meditation  
I I I the sweet precipitation  
I I I the higher depravation  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it can't be long  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three lets make this  
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words  
One, two, three forsake this  
  
All aboard the ship cause  
Your going to need arc when  
The wet comes down you'll be swimming like a shark  
Mopping up the pain when I'm a little older  
Right as rain at the animal bar  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it can't be long  
  
I I I the cry of vacilation  
I I I the higher meditation  
I I I the mild precipitation  
I I I the higher depravation  
And it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
No it wont be long  
Because it can't be long  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three lets make this  
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words  
One, two, three forsake this  
  
Raindrops will fall from the sky  
Stealing the shape from your eye  
Now we can all get some sleep  
The water the water the water  
Saving us from the heat  
Somethings will die in there place  
Others will leave with a trace  
Fire will come by its day  
The water the water the water  
Washing it all away  
  
Rain on my frustration  
Save my queen now break this  
Wash me down my station  
Make more rain forsaken  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three lets make this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three forsake this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three lets make this  
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth  
One, two, three forsake this

Later she'll go back and redefine the line

Pie in your face  
Living in and out  
Of a big fat suitcase  
  
Bonafide ride  
Step aside my Johnson

In the woods of Wisconsin  
  
Wake up the cake

You say hello then I say I do

On a hop skip jump up a baby beat  
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet

Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street

Back in the game cuz I'm gonna hang  
With the gang ill be back with a bang

Someone spilled blood many years ago  
Someone spilled blood but do you know  
That from the backwoods  
Where the Chuck Berry's grow  
Come your long tall  
Daddies of a rock and roll  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
  
Spinning' down from the clouds  
Like a tornado  
Spinnin' out of control  
Like a psychedelic soul  
With a rhythm hittin' harder  
Than Larry Holmes  
Come your long tall  
Daddies of rock and roll  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
  
Mr. Uplift Mofo - my man Bo Diddley  
Hit sippin' a bottle of nickle ripple  
Play the lickity split finger licking licks  
For all you wicked city slick chicks  
  
And all you nitty gritty hick  
We'll make your nipples ripple  
Make you wanna dip your dipple  
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick  
Because my man has a grip on it  
And I do mean on it  
Which brings to mind  
A very sinister minister kind of guy  
A man named Little Richard  
Born to make them bitches stir  
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip  
From the middle of your hillbilly lips  
And like the farmer milk his cow  
The Howling Wolf will howl  
And since times does allow  
You all can  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now

Don't give up your fight, in life, you better buckle down  
Two days with might, in life, you better buckle down  
Leave dreams tonight, in life, you better buckle down

Off the bus on to the chain  
Getting all to hot, gotta head on 5th and main  
I look like you I feel the same  
You don't even know my name  
  
I got this tied up to my cell  
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shelf  
  
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body  
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy  
  
I don't like blood into the chain  
There aint a nelly man that stays up in my brain  
A dirty sun will burn away  
Do you even want to stay  
  
Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body  
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy  
Where'd you get that bruise, do you want me to,  
Take your body  
I must still, taking your bod away

And anyone from any other crew

If you want me to

Everyone would take a cue from anything you do

This time of nights for singing songs about the local news

All the world would take a cue from anything you do

Psychic spies from China  
Try to steal your mind's elation  
And little girls from Sweden  
Dreams of silver screen quotation  
And if you want these kind of dreams  
It's Californication  
  
It's the edge of the world  
And all of western civilization  
The sun may rise in the East  
At least it settles in the final location  
It's understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Celebrity skin is this your chin  
Or is that war your waging  
  
[Chorus]  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication  
Dream of Californication  
  
Marry me girl be my fairy to the world  
Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard  
It's Californication  
  
Space may be the final frontier  
But it's made in a Hollywood basement  
Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderaan's not far away  
It's Californication  
  
Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population everybody's been there and  
I don't mean on vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving  
  
[Chorus]

Can't stop addicted to the shindig  
Cop top he says I'm gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Don't die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
White heat is screaming in the jungle  
Complete the motion if you stumble  
Go ask the dust for any answers  
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers  
  
[Chorus]  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Ever wonder if it's all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Come and tell me when it's time to  
  
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone  
So smart she's leading me to ozone  
Music the great communicator  
Use two sticks to make it in the nature  
I'll get you into penetration  
The gender of a generation  
The birth of every other nation  
Worth your weight the gold of meditation  
This chapter's going to be a close one  
Smoke rings I know your going to blow one  
All on a spaceship persevering  
Use my hands for everything but steering  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you  
Mop tops are happy when they feed you  
J. Butterfly is in the treetop  
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop  
  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Ever wonder if it's all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave can't stop  
Come and tell me when it's time to  
  
Wait a minute I'm passing out  
Win or lose just like you  
Far more shocking  
Than anything I ever knew  
How about you  
Ten more reasons  
Why I need somebody new just like you  
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew  
Right on cue  
  
Can't stop addicted to the shindig  
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Don't die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
  
Kick start the golden generator  
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her  
Can't stop the gods from engineering  
Feel no need for any interfering  
Your image in the dictionary  
This life is more than ordinary  
Can I get two maybe even three of these  
Coming from space  
To teach you of the pliedes  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you  
This life is more than just a read through

Down the street you can hear her scream  
You're a disgrace as she slams the door  
in his drunken face  
And now he stands outside  
and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool  
He cries oh girl you must be mad  
What happened to the sweet love you and me had  
Against the door he leans and start a scene  
and his tears fall and burn the garden green  
And so castles made of sand  
fall in the sea  
eventually  
A little Indian brave who before he was ten  
played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends  
And he built a dream that when he grew up  
he would be a fearless warrior Indian chief  
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong  
until tomorrow he would sing his first war song  
and fight his first battle  
but something went wrong  
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
And so castles made of sand  
fall in the sea  
eventually  
There was a young girl  
whose heart was a frown  
'cause she was crippled for life  
and she couldn't speak a sound  
and she wished and prayed  
she could stop livin'  
so she decide to die  
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore  
and to her legs she smiled  
You won't hurt me no more  
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say  
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way  
And it really didn't have to stop  
It just kept on going  
And so castles made of sand  
slips into the sea  
eventually

You jump in front of my car when you,  
You know all the time that  
Ninty miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive  
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain  
You say you just want me to take you for a ride  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through to you  
Crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you  
Crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
And I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town  
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run  
Tire tracks all across your back  
I can see you had your fun  
But darlin' can't you see my signals turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through to you  
Crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you  
Crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
And I got better things on the other side of town

You got yours and I got mine  
She got his and she got shine  
Under moon and overseas  
She got those and we got these  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance  
All night long, yes all night long

I got love but you got more

The light is right, look here tonight  
Lets make the right,  
The song of prize lets play  
Well let's play

Bear paws and rascal power  
Watching us in your garage  
Big girl you ate the neighbor  
The nova is over  
Wake up and play  
Balleradio  
Make room for Clara's bare feet  
The love of a Martian  
  
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor  
This clock is opening another door  
  
Lots of love just keep it comin'  
Making something out of nothin'  
These are the best that I  
I don't know how to say  
Losin' what I love today  
These are the best that I  
Lots of love just keep it comin'  
Making something out of nothin'  
These are the best that I  
I don't know what to say  
Look at what I lost today  
And these are the things that I  
  
Blood flowers in the kitchen  
Signing off and winding down  
This Martian ends her mission  
The nova is over  
She caught the ball  
By the mission bell  
Chase lizards bark at donkeys  
The love of a martian  
  
Let's bow our heads  
And let the trumpets blow  
Our girl is gone  
God bless her little soul  
  
(She's got sword in case  
Tho this is not her lord in case  
The one who can't afford to face  
Her image is restored to grace.  
  
Disappeared.  
No trace.  
Musky tears.  
Suitcase.  
  
The down turn brave  
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare  
Rampages pitch color pages  
Down and out but not in Vegas.  
Disembarks and disengages.  
No loft.  
  
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude  
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude  
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its.  
It's for you.  
  
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck  
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show.  
It's a beehive barrel race.  
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her.  
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost.  
The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries.  
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the new morning milk
blanket.  
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny who's bouquet set a course for
bloom without decay.  
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles, away)

Anything we should know about your change?  
Hahahaha  
You start by doing that first, okay?  
Okay, here we go  
Deck Deck  
(Not yet, not yet)  
(Deck, Deck...)  
(No, if you...)  
(De...De...)  
  
Deck the halls  
With boughs of holly  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
'Tis the season  
To be jolly  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
  
Don we now  
Our gay apparel  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
Something something  
Yule tide carol  
Fa la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Merry Christmas!  
Good night Detroit!

All alone, not by myself,  
Another girl bad for my health  
Seen it all through someone else and I,  
(Another girl bad for my heath)  
  
Celebrated but undisturbed,  
And serenaded by the terror bird  
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, I'm  
(Serenaded by the terror bird)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
Disintegrated by the rising sun  
A rolling black out of oblivion  
And I'd like to think that I'm your number one  
(I'm rolling black out of oblivion)  
  
I wanna leave but I just get stuck  
A broken record runnin' low on luck  
There's heavy metal coming from your truck  
And I'm (a broken record running low on luck)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise  
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys  
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed  
We could all go down  
  
I love the feeling when it falls apart  
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and  
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark  
And I'm (slow to finish but I'm quick to start)  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
  
Never in the wrong time or wrong place  
Desecration is the smile on my face  
The love I made is the shape of my space  
My face, my face  
Yeah...

(Come on, come on)  
  
I'm comin' for you 'cause 'cause I adore you and  
I'd like to get inside your mass production  
This indecision has has got me cringin' well  
I can't resist the smell of your seduction  
  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Unwrap the package with a mutt persuasion  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
I wanna dance to every day's occasion  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
When we envision, lack of division and  
The planet does another revolution  
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on ya  
Turns out that we are all the one solution  
Go!  
  
I'm comin' at you well, you are the cap too and  
I like the sound of your articulations  
Want to arouse her and maybe espouse her well  
She showed me love with out the stipulations  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
I wanna lean on you, get Jan and Dean on ya  
It's time to sway a little mass perception  
I like you cheeky well, so Mozambiquey and  
I think the world could use a clear connection  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
This I know, hell this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?

I'm an ocean in your bedroom  
Make you feel warm  
Make you want to re-assume  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
I'm a dance hall dirty break beat  
Make the snow fall  
Up from underneath your feet  
Not alone, I'll be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
I'm a meth lab first rehab  
Take it all off  
And step inside the running cab  
There's a love that knows the way  
  
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell  
All the memories of  
Everything you've ever smelled  
Not alone, I'll be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
Sideways falling  
More will be revealed my friend  
Don't forget me  
I can't hide it  
Come again make me excited  
  
I'm an inbred and a pothead  
Two legs that you spread  
Inside the tool shed  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
I could show you  
To the free field  
Overcome and more  
Will always be revealed  
Not alone, I'll be there  
Tell me when you want to go  
  
Sideways falling  
More will be revealed my friend  
Don't forget me  
I can't hide it  
Come again get me excited  
  
I'm the bloodstain  
On your shirt sleeve  
Coming down and more are coming to believe  
Now we know it all for sure  
  
Make the hair stand  
Up on your arm  
Teach you how to dance  
Inside the funny farm  
Not alone, I'll be there  
Tell me when you want to go

I got dosed by you and,  
Closer than most to you and,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Take it away,  
I never had it anyway,  
Take it away,  
And everything will be okay  
  
In you a star is born and,  
You cut a perfect form and,  
Someone forever warm,  
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on,  
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on  
  
Way upon the mountain where she died,  
All I ever wanted was your life,  
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide,  
All I ever wanted was your life  
  
Show love with no remorse and,  
Climb on to your seahorse and,  
This ride is right on course,  
This is the way,  
I wanted it to be with you,  
This is the way,  
I knew that it would be with you,  
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on,  
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on  
  
Way upon the mountain where she died,  
All I ever wanted was your life,  
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide,  
All I ever wanted was your life  
  
I got dosed by you and,  
Closer than most to you and,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Take it away,  
I never had it anyway,  
Take it away,  
And everything will be okay  
  
Way upon the mountain where she died,  
All I ever wanted was your life,  
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide,  
All I ever wanted was your life

Easily let's get carried away  
Easily let's get married today  
Shao Lin shouted a rose  
From his throat  
Everything must go  
A lickin' stick is thicker  
When you break it to show  
Everything must go  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for  
  
Calling calling for something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
Easily let's get caught in a wave  
Easily we won't get caught in a cage  
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake  
Of his soul Everything must go  
Lookin' mighty tired of  
All the things that you own  
Everything must go  
  
I can't tell you who to idolize  
You think it's almost over  
But it's only on the rise  
Calling calling  
For something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for  
  
Throw me to the wolves  
Because there's order in the pack  
Throw me to the sky  
Because I know I'm coming back  
  
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake  
Of his soul Everything must go  
Lookin' mighty tired of  
All the things that you own  
Everything must go  
  
The story of a woman on the morning of a war  
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for  
  
Calling calling for something in the air  
Calling calling I know you must be there  
  
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy  
The creature that I am is only going to destroy  
  
Throw me to the wolves  
Because there's order in the pack  
Throw me to the sky  
Because I know I'm coming back

The California animal is a bear  
Angeleno but the devil may care  
Summer time to talk and swear  
Later maybe we could share some air  
I'll take you to the movies there  
We could walk through Leicester Square  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
[Chorus]  
London in the summer time  
Call me now use the satellite  
London in the summer time  
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right  
  
Hesitate but don't refuse  
The choice was yours but you said choose  
The look she used was green and sharp  
Stabbed that boy all in his heart  
Come what may the cosmos will  
Take me up and down on Primrose Hill  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right  
It's all right now  
Call me now use the satellite  
It's all right  
It's all right  
  
Down and out and it'll sound all right  
It's all right now  
It's all right  
  
The California flower is poppy child  
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile  
Drift away from anyone you can  
Nothing ever goes according to plan  
Though I know that every river bends  
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames  
What could be wetter than  
An English girl American man  
  
[Chorus]

In the name of it's for you I  
Bought it all and it's all untrue I  
Know, I'm a little slow  
Desparate and it shows  
  
In the name of spending street(?)  
Burning bush and a busted knee you  
Stole, all the rain and snow  
  
Who will be my Eskimo  
It's what I wanna know  
It's time to under go  
Somewhere in Mexico  
I'm making room for you  
A Simple Point of view  
Someone too deeper to  
  
Aw  
Searching for an eskimo  
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you  
What did they say  
Desperate and I gotta go  
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you  
  
In the name of Jesus Christ I  
Sold my son and I named my price I  
Sold, just a little low  
  
Who will be my eskimo  
That's what I wanna know  
Before I under go  
Somewhere in Mexico  
I'm making room for you  
A Simple point of view  
Someone too deeper to  
  
Ooooooh aw  
Searching for an eskimo  
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you  
Hey hey hey  
Desperate and I gotta go  
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you  
  
In the name of Oscar Wilde I  
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I  
Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find and eskimo

Life is my friend  
Rake it up to take it in  
Wrap me in your cinnamon  
Especially in Michigan  
Well I could be your friend  
  
White clouds I'm in  
A mitten full of fisherman  
C'mon huckleberry finn  
Show me how to make her grin  
Well I'm in Michigan  
  
Cry me a future  
Where the revelations run amok  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Lions and tigers come running  
Just to steal your luck  
  
A rainy Lithuanian  
Who's dancing as an Indian  
Painted in my tiger skin  
(Especially in Michigan)  
  
Double chins and bowling pins  
Unholy Presbyterians  
Land is full of medicine  
I find it when I'm slipping in  
Into Michigan  
  
The tainted new librarian  
Who fainted when she tucked you in  
Let's float away like zeppelins  
(On stoic gusts of northern wind)  
  
Out on the farm we'll be  
Swimming with the mother duck  
Deep in the mitten where  
Lions and tigers come running  
Just to steal your luck  
  
Life is my friend  
Underwater violins  
Order now from ho chi min  
A porcelain that comes in twins  
When I'm in Michigan  
  
Throw me in the looney bin  
Cause I can take it on the chin  
The cleavage of your pillow skin  
(Is moving like a violin)

"We're rolling everybody,  
It starts with bass"  
  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
When you give your love away  
You get a feeling for  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Live to love another day  
Even when you feel unsure  
More and more I wanna raise  
Raise my bar and raise your stay  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
When I lie they're wide awake  
For my son I make  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road  
  
E-I-O-I-E-I-A  
Something good gon' come your way  
Just look out your door

Tell him what you wanna say

Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know

Walk out in that road

Steal my heart to give away  
Make me wanna say

You and I are so no same  
More and more and more each day  
  
Tell my boy I love him so  
Tell him so he know  
Lost in Ethiopia  
Walk out in that road

They say in chess, you gotta kill the queen  
And then you mate it  
Oh I, do you?  
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated  
Hey now, every time i lose  
Altitude  
  
You took a town by storm  
The mess you made was nominated  
Oh I, do you?  
Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've overstayed it  
Hey now, every time I lose  
Altitude  
  
[Chorus]  
So divine, hell of an elevator  
All the while my fortune faded  
Nevermind the consequences of the crime this time  
My fortune faded  
  
The medicated state of mind you find is overrated  
Oh I, do you?  
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it  
Hey now, every time I lose altitude  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on God, do I seem bulletproof?  
Ooooooooooh  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Why do you do what you do  
I do what I want to do  
Who said you could do what you do  
I told you who told me to  
I do what I want to do  
I do what I want to do  
  
Funky crime funky crime  
Don't you know funk's colors blind  
Well I've committed a funky crime  
Against a state of mind  
  
Hey you mister interview  
I don't have to answer you  
This is what I grew into  
Don't judge me and my soul stew  
Cause funk is my attitude  
Funk is my attitude  
  
Funky crime funky crime  
Don't you know funk's colors blind  
Well I've committed a funky crime  
Against a state of mind  
  
Barriers of race  
In the media take place  
Tellin' you there is no room  
For what you do, don't budge  
There's no groove to your gloom  
Who made you the judge  
Always room for funky tunes  
And yes I funk it up  
  
Funky boy  
Meets a funky girl  
Make it funky, baby  
Cause the funk is crazy  
  
Why do you do what you do  
I do what I want to do  
Who said you could do what you do  
I told you who told me to  
I do what I want to do  
I do what I want to do

Don't you know funk's colors blind  
Well I've committed a funky crime

There are no monks in my band  
There are no saints in this land  
I'll be doin' all I can  
If I die an honest man  
  
Confusion is my middle name  
Ask me again I'll tell you the same  
Persuaded by one sexy dame  
No I do not feel no shame  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin' from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you  
  
Every man has certain needs  
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds  
To these needs I must concede  
Livin' by my lowly creed  
  
Woman please know that I'm good  
Know that I did all I could  
But yes it's true likelihood  
Of being great is not so good  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin' from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you  
  
There are no monks in my band  
There are no saints in this land  
I'll be doin' all I can  
If I die an honest man  
  
Virtue slipped into my shoe  
No I will not misconstrue  
More rockin' more rockin' now doobley do  
Dancin' down your avenue  
  
You are on the road  
Can I get a little lovin' from you  
Can I get a little bit of that done did do  
You are on the road  
Tell me now girl that you need me too  
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you

It must have been your funny face  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your paper chase that  
Wasn't quite enough  
  
It must have been your tiny dance that  
Made me laugh out loud  
Must have been your angel dust that  
Put me on your cloud  
  
You're the reason why...  
You're the reason I...  
  
It must have been your love... oh  
It must have been your love... I said  
It must have been your love... In a little bit...  
It must have been your love  
  
It must have been your poppy eyes  
That made me step outside  
It must have been the sight of tears that  
Let me know I cried  
  
It must have been your bunny shake  
It must have been your love  
A lot of girls won't come around they  
Treat me like a wolf  
  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your love... I said  
It must have been your love... I gotta get that  
It must have been your love  
  
You're my angel baby  
You're my darling  
You're my star  
Lo lo lo lolita  
Let her see me deep in love  
  
You're the reason why...  
You're the reason I...  
  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your love... now  
It must have been your love...  
It must have been your love  
  
You're my angel baby  
You're my darling  
You're my star  
Lo lo lo lolita  
Let her see me deep in love  
  
I've stared at eyes in a crooked frown  
Make more of life, just settle down  
Every single little princess needs a crown  
Make more of life, just settle down

Get on Top Get on Top  
Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me  
Gorilla cunt illa  
Sammy D and Salmonella  
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer  
You're ill but I'm iller

Give the finger to a cop and  
Pick a lock before I knock and  
Set you up to get on top

Complications of a mastermind  
Last temptation of my kind  
Extra planetary sign

Get up come sit up I light but she lit up  
Grass Hopper Show Stopper  
The life of a Wife Swapper  
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper  
You do but I wopper  
  
Exterminate my cause  
You want to draw some straws  
Be the one to see my flaws  
Make me bleed with painted claws

Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me

Jump a boy

Jump a rope  
Jump for joy  
Just don't stop jumpin'  
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'  
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?  
When you're just standing or sitting still  
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill  
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos  
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!  
Jump a nun  
Jump a Jack  
Jump for fun  
Jump back  
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?  
And now, it's time for a jump attack  
Get up and jump (x8)  
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie  
To the tune of slima Billy  
Lookin' like you're mighty silly  
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?

Mister Mexican jumpin' bean knows

What I've got you've got to give it to your mama  
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa  
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter  
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water  
  
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you  
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you  
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you  
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue  
  
Realize I don't want to be a miser  
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser  
Young blood is the lovin' upriser  
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
Give it away give it away give it away now  
  
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper  
Greedy little people in a sea of distress  
Keep your more to receive your less  
Unimpressed by material excess  
Love is free love me say hell yes  
  
I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how  
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow  
Get smart get down with the pow wow  
Never been a better time than right now  
  
Bob Marley poet and a prophet  
Bob Marley taught me how to off it  
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it  
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lucky me swimmin' in my ability  
Dancin' down on life with agility  
Come and drink it up from my fertility  
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility  
  
My mom I love her 'cause she love me  
Long gone are the times when she scrub me  
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me  
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me  
  
There's a river born to be a giver  
Keep you warm won't let you shiver  
His heart is never gonna wither  
Come on everybody time to deliver  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What I've got you've got to give it to your mama  
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa  
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter  
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

About this planet, there is something I know  
There's a very big difference between above and below  
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor  
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  
Here, above land, man has laid his plan  
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan  
We got a government so twisted and bent  
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent  
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution  
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution  
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution  
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution  
And that's a heart felt shame  
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same  
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?  
Time now to take you to a different place  
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space  
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace  
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace  
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none  
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun  
No one tells 'em how their life is run  
And no one points at them with a gun  
They have a lot of love for every living creature  
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature  
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher  
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you  
Back to the land of the police man  
Where he does whatever he says he can  
Including hating you because you're a Jew  
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new  
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl  
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all  
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails  
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail  
So support your police, support your local wars  
That's the way to open economic doors  
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore  
We assume the position to sell the ammunition  
What the fuck? It's the american tradition  
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen  
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

I'm the man, I'm the king  
I'm the one that's pure inside  
Everyday, Everyway  
I smell of suicide  
Bitter sins how they grow within  
So you tell me it ain't right  
I am all sins and you're my reason for life  
  
I will stone you, stone you  
Wrap my arms around you  
I will stone you, stone you  
My little halo  
  
I'm the man, I'm the king  
I'm the one that's broken from giving  
Everday, everyway  
I swear just one last try  
Killing me with the death to be  
Something that's so right  
I am all sins, my hands are scarred with time  
  
I will stone you, stone you  
Wrap my arms around you  
I will stone you, stone you  
My little halo  
  
I'm the man with the rock in his hand, got  
The rock in my hand gonna stone you stone you

Stop marching 'cause you think you shot to number one  
Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun  
Overrated on the form it goes to where you turn,  
I'll be yours tonight,  
Living the dream of a meteorite  
  
Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah  
  
Short stroking butterfly, better to go for broke  
What you're smoking Mary Jane, it doesn't make you choke  
Jumping the fence, riding the waves, can you take a joke?  
I'll be yours today,  
Living the dream with a capital K!  
  
Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah  
  
Tell me now, tell you how  
Just show me where to sit  
  
Make time for love and your happiness  
The mothers of invention are the best  
We all learn and struggle with some loneliness  
A tender mess for everyone I guess  
I guess  
  
Half blinded, I'm reminded how to find myself  
Nickel and dime I think, it's time to play some musical chairs  
Dirty laundry, what a quandary, ask her if she cares  
I'll be yours and more,  
Better than ever like never before  
  
Stop jumping 'cause we got something to say, yeah  
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of  
  
Make time for love and your happiness  
The mothers of invention are the best  
We all know and struggle with some loneliness  
A tender mess for everyone I guess  
I guess  
  
Sweet talking, there's a marker,  
To your part of town,  
Never again, we're trying to see your love supremed and bound  
Is it ever meant to be, and is it so profound?  
Is it you and me play it to one, make history  
A history  
  
Said yeah, oh yeah  
Said yeah, oh yeah  
I said yeah, oh yeah

Walkin' around  
Out of a town  
Walkin' it out  
When you want to  
Soldiering my style is smiling  
Turn it into whatever I've chosen  
Take me now to the water  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
Kick it around  
Stare at the ground  
Breakin' it down  
When you want to  
Soldiering my days I've chosen  
Dancing round do whatever I want to  
Take me now it's the water  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
I think I know, everything you gonna say  
I think you know, don't want to runaway  
  
Don't be late I hear it  
Gonna be so very great and  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
  
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway  
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway

Dusting off your savior  
You were always my favorite  
Always my man All in a hand  
  
To celebrate you is greater  
Now that I can Always my man  
  
Now you see what I came for  
No one here is to blame for  
Misunderstand All in a hand  
  
Just like you 'cause you made me  
All that I am All in a hand  
  
A butterfly that flaps its wings  
Affecting almost everything  
The more I hear the orchestra  
The more I have something to bring  
And now I see you in a beautiful  
And different light  
He's just a man and any damage done  
Will be all right  
Call out my name  
Call and I came  
  
Dusting off your savior  
Forgiving any behavior  
He's just a man All in a hand  
  
Your hero's destined to waver  
Anyone can Always my man  
  
I would never betray you  
Look at me who could raise you  
Face in the sand Safe in your hand  
  
You were always my favorite  
Always my man All in a hand  
  
We are the red hots and  
We're loving up the love me nots  
The flowers in your flower pots  
Are dancing on the table tops  
And now I see you in a beautiful  
And different light  
He's just a man and everything he does  
Will be all right  
Call out my name  
Call and I came  
  
Dusting off your savior  
The life that you have narrated  
You were my man

Scar tissue that I wish you saw  
Sarcastic Mister know it all  
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share  
This lonely view  
With the bird I'll share  
This lonely view  
  
Push me up against the wall  
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra  
Fallin' all over myself  
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Blood loss in a bathroom stall  
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl  
Wave goodbye to ma and pa 'cause  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Soft spoken with a broken jaw  
Step outside but not to brawl  
Autumn's sweet we call it fall  
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view  
  
Scar tissue that I wish you saw  
Sarcastic Mister know it all  
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause'  
With the bird I'll share  
With the bird I'll share, this lonely view

I was not created  
In the likeness of a fraud  
Your hell is something scary  
I prefer a loving god  
We are not the center  
Of this funny universe  
And what is something worse  
I do not serve  
In fear of such a curse  
  
Shallow be thy game  
Two thousand years look in the mirror  
You play the game of shame  
And tell your people live in fear  
  
A rival to the way you see  
The bible let him be  
I'm a threat to your survival  
And your control company  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never burn me  
You'll never burn me  
I'll be your heretic  
You can't contain me  
I am the power free  
Truth belongs to everybody  
  
To anyone who's listenin'  
You're not born into sin  
The guilt they try and give you  
Puke it in the nearest bin  
  
Missionary madness  
Sweep up culture with a broom  
Trashing ancient ways  
Is par for the course  
It's fucking rude  
  
To think that you're above  
The laws of nature is a joke  
Purple sashes feeding masses  
Smoke on which to choke  
  
I might be a monkey  
When it comes to being holy  
Fundamental hatred  
Get down on your knees and  
  
[Chorus]

Looks to me like heaven sinned  
No lullaby kid no five percent  
Any way you want to cut that cake  
She's a-dyin' from a life of abandonment  
Lost in a valley without my horses  
She needs somebody to hold  
  
[Chorus]  
It looked to me like heaven sent this for  
Your roughest night  
She looks to me  
She looks to me alright  
  
Who's going to take you home  
And hold you when things aren't so bright  
She looks to me  
She looks to me alright  
  
It's a long walk down those tracks  
It's a dirty walk in  
It's a dirty walk back  
Gonna learn no way too much  
Shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac jack  
  
Slow down the road to my back forty  
She needs somebody to hold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Down in the south sea  
Give me your mouthpiece  
Resuscitation is the way I find these  
I give you majors  
You give me minors  
Don't fade away  
Like an ocean liner  
Now  
  
Lost in the valley without my horses  
No one can tell me what my remorse is  
God made this lady that stands before me  
She needs somebody to hold  
  
She shows the world up with a smile  
And then she throws the fight  
She looks to me  
She looked to me alright  
  
Down on the bathroom floor  
She's searching for another light  
She looks to me  
She looks to me alright  
  
It looked to me like heaven sent this for  
Your roughest night  
She looks to me  
She looks to me alright  
  
Who's going to take you home  
And hold you when things aren't so bright  
She looks to me  
She looks to me

Shes only eighteen  
Don't like the Rollin' Stones  
She took a short cut  
To be in fully grown  
She got the mood ring  
Her little sister rose  
A smell of Springstein  
A pair of pantyhose  
  
Destructing pages show is leaking from a silhouette  
She said my man you know its time to get your fingers wet  
You hussle faster when you can't afford a cigarette  
The last I heard from you you were screamin' Lavallette  
  
Knock to world  
Right off its feet and straight onto its head  
Oopala, we're lonely laughing after you are dead  
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said  
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share  
  
I heard some defunct  
Out on the road again  
Get your head shrunk is what I recommend  
It's on your bloodline  
A perfect Frankenstein  
Out on the lone pine  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Its understood you wrap the fool right around my neck  
You've got some glitter on ya kitty in the disco tech  
I put my lovin in your oven and I had to check  
The last I heard from you a you we're screamin' resurrect  
  
Knock to world  
Right off its feet and straight onto its head  
Oopala, we're lonely laughing after you are dead  
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said  
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share

Waking up dead inside of my head  
Will never never do there is no med  
No medicine to take  
  
I've had a chance to be insane  
Asylum from the falling rain  
I've had a chance to break  
  
It's so bad it's got to be good  
Mysterious girl misunderstood  
Dressed like a wedding cake  
  
Any other day and I might play  
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae  
Why try and run away  
  
[Chorus]  
Slow cheetah come  
Before my forest  
Looks like it's on today  
  
Slow cheetah come  
It's so euphoric  
No matter what they say  
  
I know a girl  
She worked in a store  
She knew not what  
Her life was for  
She barely knew her name  
  
They tried to tell her  
She would never be  
As happy as the girl  
In the magazine  
She bought it with her pay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone has  
So much to say  
They talk talk talk  
Their lives away  
Don't even hesitate  
  
Walking on down  
To the burial ground  
It's a very old dance  
With a merry old sound  
Looks like it's on today  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Next stop on the KLM  
Two lips and a sturdy stem  
A funny thing always happens when  
I get a heavy jam  
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I  
  
Cowgirl and a troubadour  
MGM and the lion's roar  
A straight shot to the corner store  
I wanna show you what  
I wanna show you what your head is for  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I  
  
So much I, wish i could  
So many I, wish i would  
So much I, wish i could  
Count on you not to defeat me  
  
So much I, wish i could  
So many I, wish i would  
So much I, wish i could  
Count on you not to defeat me  
  
Please don't turn away again  
Please don't turn me into them  
Please don't turn away friend  
Please don't turn me into them  
  
Stand by for the great eclipse  
Rip it out now shake your hips  
Backing off the apocalypse  
I gotta loosen up  
I gotta loosen up to get my grip  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I

I've got a bad disease  
But from my brain is where I bleed.  
Insanity it seems  
Has got me by my soul to squeeze.  
  
Well all the love from thee  
With all the dying trees I scream.  
The angels in my dreams (yeah)  
Have turned to demons of greed that's mean.  
  
[Chorus]  
Where I go I just don't know  
I got to got to gotta take it slow.  
When I find my piece of mind  
I'm gonna give you some of my good time.  
  
Today love smiled on me.  
It took away my pain say please  
All that you had to free  
You gotta let it be oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, so polite indeed  
Well I got everything I need.  
Oh make my days a breeze  
And take away my self destruction.  
  
It's bitter baby,  
And it's very sweet.  
I'm on a rollercoaster,  
but I'm on my feet.  
Take me to the river,  
Let me on your shore.  
I'll be coming back baby,  
I'll be coming back for more.  
  
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone  
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad  
  
I could not forget  
But I will not endeavor  
Simple pleasures aren't as special  
But I won't regret it never.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where I go I just don't know  
I might end up somewhere in Mexico.  
When I find my piece of mind  
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time.

Well, my young lady, she lives  
Three houses away  
  
She claims that she can hear moaning and screaming  
To me fuckin' you every night  
Well, let me say "hey"  
  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on, party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Struck by lust in a telephone booth  
Busted by a cop, he said "That's uncool"  
  
He said that he hears moaning and screaming  
To me fuckin' you every night  
Well, let me say "hey"  
  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on, party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy  
I want to party on your little pussy, girl  
I want to party on your pussy  
  
Let me shine your diamond  
The girl got a scratch  
Slap that cat  
Have mercy  
  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on, party on your pussy  
I want to party on your pussy, baby  
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

Bells around St. Petersburg  
When I saw you  
  
I hope I get what you deserve  
And this is where I find  
  
Smoke surrounds your perfect face  
And I'm falling  
  
Pushing a broom out into space  
And this where I find the way  
  
(Chorus)  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
Now  
  
Alone inside my forest room  
And it's storming  
  
I never thought I'd be in bloom  
But this is where I start  
  
Derelict days and the stereo plays  
For the all night crowd  
That it cannot phase  
And I'm calling  
  
Tedious weeds that the media breeds  
But the animal gets what the animal needs  
And I'm sorry  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warming  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
Now  
  
And this is where I find  
  
Rays of dust that wrap around  
Your citizen  
  
Kind enough to disavow  
And this is where I stand  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
To you

She's stone cold bush yea  
And baby that's alright  
She's stone cold bush yea  
And that's alright with me  
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me  
Tell me what you need to get along  
  
A statue come to life  
I cut you with my knife  
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger  
She's stone cold bush  
Haight Street got nothing to show  
Except the skirt on your ass  
When you're livin' on the streets  
You've got to let it roll  
Get on with what you've got  
Awe everybody knows that it's alright  
You've got no secrets to tell  
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock  
  
You do it oh so well  
She's stone cold bush  
She's got marble eyes  
Sweet china doll her thighs  
And animal in pain she starts to cry  
  
Her pipes are open wide  
She blows more than my mind  
Echo sounds of soul  
Time after time  
She's stone cold bush

Come on come on baby  
Let me show you what I'm talking about  
You try to be a lady  
But your walkin' like a sour kraut  
Looka looka lika lika  
Like you want to get some  
If you never tell a lie  
Then you never have to play dumb  
  
Dirty baby time you're gonna take some  
Pretty baby love you're make some  
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some  
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some  
  
Dirty baby we've got a situation  
Pretty baby open invitation  
Little lady what a reputation  
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know you can battle the  
Masses, dear  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
  
Every other day you say  
You're gonna have to bury 'em  
Famous last words  
Spoken from the laserium  
Descendants had to record  
Sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo  
You can take the a train  
But you're gonna have to lie low  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know you can battle the  
Masses, dear  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
  
Dirty baby time you're gonna take some  
Pretty baby love you're make some  
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some  
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some  
  
Dirty baby we've got a situation  
Pretty baby open invitation  
Little lady what a reputation  
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again  
  
I know you can straddle  
The atmosphere  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl  
I know we may never get  
out of, here  
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

All of my love and  
Most of my fears  
Been coming on strong  
For most of my years  
Add up and end up in a song  
  
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams  
Are blocking my shots and killin' my dreams  
That showed me how to be the cause  
  
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, hey ah what now?  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time, for me, I see  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah  
  
All of my friends and enemies  
They were part of this dance  
That put me right here we go  
So glad I got this chance  
  
Better known plans  
And lesser known schemes  
Were all about love and less about me  
I'd have to say she wore the pants  
  
That's oh!  
  
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time for me, Uh-hu  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
Woo! Yeah  
Ahh  
Go  
Oh  
I've been left  
(Can't figure out what he says next)  
(And then a bunch of scat)  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right  
It's a long time, for me, lets see  
She wants to belong and, I want to be free  
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  
  
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's me  
It's a long time, for me, uh-uh  
She wants to be rich and, I want to be free  
Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no, guarantee

Stretching out your tightness  
Good enough to make you grow  
  
We are all in favour of this motion  
  
Stretching out your tightness  
Time to open up your whole  
  
When it rains, I let myself get wet  
I have always wanted to  
Give something to my brother  
  
Proposing to expose your head  
To something that is like no other  
  
Hit it  
  
I'll stretch you out  
I'll stretch you out my friend  
I'll stretch you out  
  
The the two-step goes from intuition is my liquid fare  
  
We are all in favor of the open air  
  
Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull  
Truth be told, we let the good times roll  
  
I have always needed to  
Receive it and believe it  
And it's moaning and creating love  
  
Tender titilations  
  
I'll stretch you out  
  
I'll stretch you out my friend  
I'll stretch you out  
I'm a fish and I can swim all day  
I can swim in so many ways  
Make it up as I go along  
That way it is never wrong  
  
I'm a bird and I can fly away  
I can shift in so many shapes  
Make it up as I go along  
That way it is never wrong  
  
Ow  
  
There's a glowing up around the moon it's showing  
We want to play in the water that is flowing  
Very legendary instraplanetary fairy  
  
Varied truths  
She's making just for you  
  
Yes, I have always wanted to  
Give something to this stranger  
  
M m m moving to approve the grove  
A mental transformation

Arthur J. did, indicate  
The boulevard will never be  
So full of life and love again - hey  
(Aw, say goodbye to your boots, man)  
  
Hot as Hades, early eighties  
Sing another song  
Make me feel like I'm in love again, hey  
(You gotta lose to win)  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
  
All in favor sign the waiver  
Bloody Carolina  
Won't you take another look inside, hey  
(Aw, it will make me cry)  
  
Operator, co-creator  
Come on baby Ellie  
Won't you blow another compensator, hey  
(Ah, you only get what you bring)  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
  
El Dorado won the lotto  
All the cash and not a clue  
But now you know what I've been through, hey  
  
Oh yeah  
Oh  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind  
Please don't strip my mind  
Leave something behind

Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine  
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government  
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,  
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off  
God knows when but you're doin' it again!  
You better duck down the alleyway lookin'for a new friend  
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen  
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid  
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot  
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but  
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say  
They must bust in early may  
Orders from the D.A.  
Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"  
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose  
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes  
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid  
Looks to me like you did  
A little to much hittin' kid  
You should've took it to the bridge  
Before you started to skid  
Look out, kid  
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan  
Chillin' 'em, thrillin' 'em, and red hot killin' 'em  
Killin' 'em  
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well  
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell  
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille  
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail  
But users, cheaters, six time losers  
Hand around the theaters  
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool  
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid

Step right up and listen please  
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease  
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground  
You've got to get in before you get out  
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about  
If you find that you are blind  
Open your bashful mind  
Let my band step inside  
And take you on a cosmic ride  
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain  
For in this song I do proclaim  
That once aboard this moving train  
I'll do my best to ease your pain  
Slinky as my speech may be  
On this trip you'll ride for free  
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus  
Once aboard and feeling smooth  
Like a liquid you will ooze  
Into a state of mind that soothes  
Aw be my quest inside my grove  
Cause what I've got to give to you  
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm  
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm  
Life's too short to be in a hole  
So bust into your funkiest stroll  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus  
Take your body shake it around  
Do the dog on the ground  
And if I can't make you dance  
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants  
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus

Drivin' around I've got my baby and my top down  
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love  
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground  
I'm on the mound I make it for my love  
  
Who, you talking to, talk to me you  
Sound of music  
  
Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day  
Time in the town I need it for my love  
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day  
This is the sound I listen for my love  
  
Who, you talking to, talk to me you  
Sound of music  
  
I love you swim through me  
Good feelings come to me  
  
Sought and I found a life of makin my blood sound  
Do anything for the one I love  
Something profound the face of God is in Sensurround  
I'm on the mound I make it for my love  
  
I love you swim through me  
Good feelings come to me

Oh yeah!  
Can you dig it, can you dig it  
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when  
The 'Fax City Four' were four young men  
  
Time has come, now we jam  
With the uplift mofo party plan  
We're the organic anti-beat box band  
One comes from the holy land  
Another was born an Australian  
  
Me I'm from Michigan  
But Hollywood is the land of lands  
It's a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic anti-beat box band  
  
Life is grand in the land of lands  
The mind does boggle the mind expands  
The anarchy for have manned their craft  
Get on your knees and shake your ass  
  
To the jam that is  
We don't ask we demand  
That you and your clan  
Listen now to this jam  
To the power of the drummers bad  
  
It's a Hollywood jam  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Organic anti-beat box band  
There's a party in my town at 12:00  
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock  
  
I've got nothin' against hip hop  
But there's a party in my town  
And no beat box jam that is  
The party's got girls the girls got hot  
The party's got boys and the boys got socks  
Something popped the doors unlocked  
House got up ran around the block  
  
Sit down house  
Take off your blouse  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
Hollywood is where we live  
Any good friend of the lollipop kids  
Over the rainbow with the wiz  
We represent the Hollywood kids  
  
Organic anti-beat box band  
With the organic anti-beat box band  
You just might slam dance that is  
It's a Hollywood jam!

I've got a soul that can not sleep  
At night when something just ain't right  
Blood red, but without sight  
Exploding egos in the night  
Mix like sticks of dynamite  
Red black or white, this is my fight  
Come on courage, let's be heard  
Turn feelings into words  
American equality has always been sour  
An attitude I would like to devour  
My name is peace, this is my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
Right or wrong, my song is strong  
You don't like it, get along  
Say what I want, do what I can  
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan  
I don't buy supremacy  
Media chief, you menance me  
The people you say cause all the crime  
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime  
Blackest anger, whitest fear  
Can you hear me, am I clear  
My name is peace, this is my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
I've got tapes  
I've got c.d.'s  
I've got my Public Enemy  
My lilly white ass is tickled pink  
When I listen to the music that makes me think  
Not another motherfuckin' politician  
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition  
Never touch the sound we make  
Soul sacred love, vows that we take  
To create straight what is true  
Yo he's with me and what I do  
My name is peace, this my hour  
Can I get just a little bit of power  
  
The power of equality  
Is not yet what it ought to be  
It fills me up like a hollow tree  
The power of equality  
  
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger  
Can't forget, cause the memory lingers  
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness  
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness  
I've got a welt from the Bible belt  
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt  
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist  
Giving up blood just to exist  
Rub me wrong and I get pissed  
No I can not get to this  
People in pain, I do not dig it  
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot  
Little brother do you hear me  
Have a heart oh come get near me  
Misery is not my friend  
But I'll break before I bend  
What I see is insanity  
Whatever happened to humanity

I can't rest in war  
Will you be my friend  
Dark Ages never change  
I can't comprehend  
  
Kiss me we self destruct  
Can you hear me Lord  
Yes I think we're fucked  
But I can't rest in war  
  
The righteous and the wicked  
War and peace  
The killing fist  
Of the human beast (chorus)  
P.O.P  
Prodigies Of Peace  
Hear me when I'm calling you  
From my knees  
I am playing for a better day  
  
Holy mother earth  
Crying into space  
Tears on her pretty face  
For she has been raped  
  
Killing your future blood  
Fill her with disease  
Global abortion please  
That is what she needs  
  
(chorus)  
  
Are we fire flies  
Flashing in the night  
Big thunder rumble fish  
Did you get it right  
  
Headstrong battle song  
Exploding souls be gone  
Marvin Gaye my love  
Where did we go wrong  
  
(chorus)

Close to my skin  
I'm falling in  
Someone whos been  
  
Sittin by the phone  
I'm left alone  
In another zone  
  
John says to live above hell and  
My will is well  
  
No one is waiting  
For me to fail and  
My will could sail, yeah  
  
Its such a waste to be wasted  
In the first place  
I want to taste the taste of  
Being face to face with common grace  
To meditate on the warmest dream  
And when I walk alone I listen  
To our secret theme  
  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That can see right through  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
  
Sailin for the sun  
Cause there is one  
Knows where I'm from  
I care for you  
I really do, I really do  
  
Come closer now  
So you can lie  
Right by my side  
  
Sittin alone in the sun  
I wrote a letter to you  
Gettin over myself, yeah  
  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That can see right through  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
Your solar eyes are like  
Nothing I have ever seen  
Somebody close  
That was made for you  
Ill take a fall and you know  
That I'll do anything  
I will for you  
  
Close to my skin  
Someone whos been  
I'm falling in  
  
Disasters are  
Just another star  
Fallin in my yard  
  
John says to live above hell  
My will is well  
  
Long to be with  
Someone to tell  
I love your smell
