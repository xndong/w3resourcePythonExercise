If I leave in silence  
Would you notice me  
Would you hate my absence  
Would you drown in your misery  
  
If I leave with a reason  
Would you argue to your grave  
Would you hold on to a promise  
Like a master keeps a slave  
  
I throw the question  
To see if you feel the same  
Because there is nothing  
I wouldn't sacrifice  
For you  
  
I am too tired to cry  
Don't you leave me to die  
I have become at peace  
As you set me free  
  
On my last confession  
The final breath I take  
Will you look me in the eyes  
And say my name  
  
the only consolation  
Is you remember me that way  
With the butterflies  
And the happy times we made  
  
I throw the question to see if you feel the same  
Because there is nothing  
To replace you

When I wonder where I am  
When I wonder why I take these chances  
I try to breathe  
I say to me, "believe"  
And whatever comes, it's okay  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm further every day  
I'm on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So I'm on my way  
To find that place  
  
People say that I'm naive  
'Cause I'm trusting and my heart is open  
But I won't hide  
I'm here to find who I am  
And whatever comes is what's right  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm further every day  
I'm on my way  
I know it might take until forever  
But everything could change today  
So I'm on my way  
To find that place  
  
I'll keep dreamin'  
Til I get there  
I'll be free  
So goodbye to yesterday  
I'm giving what it takes  
  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To somewhere better  
I'm on my way  
It could take forever  
(And everything could change)  
It could change today  
'Cause I'm on my way  
To find that place

I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up up up up up up  
  
It's 'bout as bad as it could be  
Seems everybody's buggin' me  
Like nothing wants to go my way  
Yeah, it just ain't been my day  
Nothin's comin' easily  
  
Even my skin is acting weird  
I wish that I could grow a beard  
Then I could cover up my spots  
Not play connect the dots  
I just wanna disappear  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
Even something as simple as  
Forgettin' to fill up on gas  
There ain't no explanation why  
Things like that can make you cry  
Just gotta learn to have a laugh  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
When everything is goin' wrong  
Don't worry, it won't last for long  
Yeah, it's all gonna come around  
Don't let it get you down  
You gotta keep on holding on  
  
It's 'bout as bad as it could be  
Seems everybody's buggin' me  
Like nothing wants to go my way  
Yeah, it just ain't been my day  
Nothin's comin' easily  
  
Up, up, up, can only go up from here  
Up, up, up, up where the clouds gonna clear  
Up, up, up, there's no way but up from here  
  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up  
I'm goin' up up up up up up, I'm goin' up  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
