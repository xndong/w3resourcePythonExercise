Five o'clock Friday  
All my work is done  
I can hardly wait  
Let's take the server  
Let's sling it around  
Let's make it taste so sweet  
  
I wanna take all the Saturdays  
I wanna stay up late  
I wanna stomp my feet on the ground  
I wanna celebrate  
  
A month of Saturdays, Saturdays  
A month of Saturday, Saturdays, ah  
  
I'm tired of waiting for the weekend to begin (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)  
I'm tired of punching in (Wednesday, Thursday)  
Give me a holiday that never ends (Friday, Saturday)  
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend  
Give me a weekend, weekend  
  
A month of Saturdays, Saturdays  
I'm talkin' Saturday, Saturdays, ah  
  
Shout  
  
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend

Walk into my room  
Ask me jerky questions  
Don't mean what you say  
Immaculate Conception  
Play by the rules  
So close to the chest, chest  
Show that all's not lost  
This is not a test.  
Stay just as far from me as me from you.  
Make sure that you are sure of everything I do.  
'Cause I'm not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not  
Your academy  
The halls are like piss  
The rooms are underlit  
Still it must be nice  
Such a perfect fit, fit  
What's that I hear?  
The sound of marching feet  
It has a strange alure,  
Has a strange alure  
Stay just as far from me as me from you.  
Make sure that you are sure of everything I do.  
'Cause I'm not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not  
Your academy  
Your academy  
Maybe you're right,  
I shouldn't judge  
What's wrong or right,  
It's all too much  
I'm not judging you,  
I'm judging me.  
My academy.  
Your academy  
My academy.  
Your academy

I do the dancin'  
You do the hoppin'

There's no stoppin'  
  
You make the action, action  
Happen, happen

I feel like an alligator  
Climbing up the escalator  
Climbing up the escalator  
I feel strong  
  
I feel like an aviator pilot  
Bet you wouldn't buy it  
I'm feeling violent  
Bet your bleeding eye in, turn up and fly it  
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn  
I have got, have got a lot to learn  
  
I feel like an autopilot  
I'm the world's strongest island  
I feel like a rage coming under my hood  
I feel good and calm like a robot would  
  
I feel like an autopilot  
I feel like an autopilot  
I am not a hater, hater, hater, hater, hater  
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn  
I have got, have got a lot to learn  
  
I feel like a contradiction  
I'm a walking science-fiction  
I don't know which way to turn  
I've got a lot to burn  
I've got a lot of lot to learn  
  
If I didn't like the way you stared at me  
If I didn't like the way you stared at me  
I could knock sideways, I could knock you blind  
I could show you found to the lost and find  
  
I am not an agitator  
I feel like an alligator  
Climbing up the escalator  
Hey, hey, alligator, you've got a lot to learn  
I have got, have got a lot to learn  
  
You've got so much to learn  
You got a lot to learn

Mmmm...You're so pretty  
Not to talk to you would be a crime  
Let me put my arms around you  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And I'm going...  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Won't you be my girl?  
  
You're eyes, they're so pretty  
The clothes you wear, so fine  
Won't you come around to my place  
Just want to use up a little of your time  
And I'm going...  
  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby  
  
Won't you be my girl?  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
Baby baby baby  
Won't you be my girl?

Almost four a.m.  
Halloween night  
Had enough to drink to make my own party  
All my fellow writers in half costume, half asleep  
Half silly, gone to seed  
  
I don't mark my time with dates, holidays, faded wisdom, locked karma holders  
Convenient  
  
I am made by my times  
I am a creation of now  
Shaken with the cracks and crevices  
I'm not giving up easy  
I will not fold  
I don't have much  
But what I have is gold  
  
I saw your face  
  
I sing in platinum  
I dress in brass  
I eat in zinc  
Let it pass  
  
Compare toast  
I like that  
I understand courage  
I still roll with the shout of a character I was married to today  
I try to see outside myself  
I understand the eyes  
Excuse all the highs  
Sorry  
I am sorry  
Ha ha  
  
I like you, love you, every coast of you.  
I've seen your eddies and tides and hurricanes and cyclones.  
Low ebb tide and high, full moon.  
Up close and distant.  
I read you.  
Look, the sky, the sea, the ocean, the sun, the moon.  
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Naked and blue.  
  
Breathing with you.  
Touch. Change. Shift. Allow air.  
Window open. Drift. Drift away. Into now.  
  
I want Whitman proud. Patti Lee proud.  
My brothers proud. My sisters proud.  
I want me. I want it all.  
I want sensational. Irresistible.  
  
This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive.  
  
Living. Blessed. I understand.

All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone  
Never dared to take a chance  
Goin' home alone  
But it gets so very cold  
When it's late at night  
Leave the foxholes on their own  
Do you sleep well at night?  
Bodycount... Feeling hot  
Bodycount... Keeping warm  
Friends are playing with danger  
They don't know where it's found  
With their casual letters  
It's just another chain  
You've lost the innocence  
That you've never found  
Standing in the dmz  
Don't get turned around  
Body count... Feeling hot  
Body count... Vietnam  
It's not the game.. Well, it's a scar  
And they won't let you wear your khakis  
And your Izods anymore  
You can go get shot to hell  
They don't want you anymore because..  
All the young kids learn to dance  
In the combat zone  
Never dare to take a chance  
You're going home alone  
Military metaphors  
Are metaphors no more  
Keeping up with protocol  
You're dancin' off to war  
Body count feeling hot  
Body count Vietnam  
Do you sleep well at night?  
Body Count... Vietnam  
They can say what they want  
But you have your doubts  
It's not what you've lost  
It's what your without  
When I ran so far  
And they just turned away  
I doesn't bother me by the light of day  
But at night... I hear your call  
Late at night... I hear your call  
I saw the mirror that you broke today  
I saw the ceiling falling down your way  
When they looked at you, you could turn away  
You didn't bother then by the light of day... You'll stay  
But at night... I hear your call  
Late at night... I hear your call  
You said that you could turn away  
I knew that you going to stay  
The walls are falling all around  
They pinned you down onto the ground  
But at night... I hear your call  
Vietnam... I hear you call

These are dangerous times  
Nothing to care or die for  
These are dangerous times  
What you want, someone will buy for you  
Don't get away  
It's so easy to wait  
You've been wearing the green  
I've been wearing the fall  
And you said that all was just agreed  
But, don't get away  
I saw a guy out on the street  
Said, I know what you need, boy  
I can set you fine  
I didn't buy his line, because  
These are dangerous times  
I don't want to get old  
You say that everything's fine  
Then you leave me standing in the cold  
All alone  
But, don't get away  
It's so easy to fall  
You've been trying to gain  
I've been trying to stop  
But it's catching up with me again  
But, don't get away  
These are dangerous times  
It's a dangerous time

Oh where are you now?  
Pussy willow that smiled on my sleeve  
When I was alone, you promised a stone from your heart  
My head kissed the ground,  
I was half the way down, treading the sand  
Please...please lift a hand, I'm only a person  
Whose armbands beat on his hands hang tall  
Won't you miss me? Why don't you miss me at all?  
My head touched the ground, I was half the way down  
Strumming the sand  
Please lift a hand, I'm only a person  
With Eskimo chain, you tattered my brain all the way  
Won't you miss me? Why don't you miss me at all?

I've dragged my feet  
Across the seat  
And jumped out the passenger side.  
The only thing worth looking for  
Is what you find inside.  
But that had not yet appeared.  
Lost, invisible, here.  
Tel Aviv and Agadir,  
Taroudant or Olomouc  
Before I learned to see  
The vanishing point appear  
  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
  
There is a calm I haven't come to yet  
I spent half my life figuring what comes next  
I telescoped in.  
I'll finally win,  
I'll finally win the prize.  
That now my eyes see  
A comic's perfect timing squeezed.  
I'm headfirst fighting everything  
The crushing force of memory  
Erasing all I've been  
The vanishing point appears  
  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
Tell me why you're here  
I came to disappear.  
  
Look at this face.  
Can you believe it?  
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum?  
Because I can't see it  
The vanishing point appears.  
  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
I looked for you and everywhere.  
Tell me why you're here  
I came to disappear  
Tell me why you're here  
I came to disappear  
I came to disappear

Hey baby!  
This is not a challenge, just means that I love you as much as I always said I
did  
I was wrong  
I have been laughable, wrong  
Sand-paper, paper-mache, chalk, hung out wet.  
  
Oh the city! We all scan now, na, na, na, na, na, na.  
Well I didn't have to be afraid, I didn't have to be so stupid.  
I can see myself.  
I can feel  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now!  
  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Laughing  
Discoverer!  
  
From the cross Houston where I am  
I see the city rise up tall  
The opportunities  
The possibilities  
I have never felt so called  
  
Remember the vodka-espresso night of discovery?  
Remember that  
Laughing  
Discovery  
Oh how I look back and reflect  
How I felt it  
I was sick  
I don't have to feel so wrong  
Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Let's all get on with it  
Now!  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was

Hugging a tree

That's great it starts with an earthquake  
Birds and snakes and aeroplanes  
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid  
  
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn  
World serves it's own needs, dummy serve your own needs  
Feed it off an aux speak grunt no  
Ladder with a clatter fight, fear flight down height  
Wire in a fire representing seven games and a government for hire in a combat
site  
Left of west and coming in a hurry with the furies breathing down your neck  
  
Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped  
Look at that low playing, fine, then  
Uh-oh overflow, population common food, but it'll do  
Save yourself, serve yourself, world serves it's own needs  
Listen to your heart bleed dummy with the rapture and the revered and the
right, right  
Vitreolic, patriotic stand, fight, bright, light  
Feeling pretty psyched  
  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
Six o'clock tv hour, don't get caught in foreign towers  
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn  
Locking in, uniforming, book-burning, blood-letting  
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate  
Light a candle, light a votive, step down step down  
Watch your heel, crush, crushed uh-oh this means  
No fear cavalier, renegade, steer clear  
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies  
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives  
And I decline  
  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
I feel fine  
  
The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide  
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein  
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs  
Birthday party, cheescake, jellybean, boom you  
Symbiotic patriotic slam book neck  
Right? Right!  
  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)  
It's the end of the world as we know it  
And I feel fine  
  
I feel fine

They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom  
For trying to change the system from within  
I'm coming now I'm coming to reward them  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens  
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin  
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
I'd really like to live beside you, baby  
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes  
But you see that line there moving through the station  
I told you I told you I told you I was one of those  
You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win  
You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline  
How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin  
  
[Chorus:]  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
I don't like your fashion business, mister  
I don't like these drugs that keep you thin  
I don't like what happened to your sister  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
  
And I thank you for those items that you sent me  
The monkey and the plywood violin  
I practiced every night and now I'm ready  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  
Remember me, I used to live for music  
Remember me, I brought your groceries in  
It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded  
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

The world is an oyster, the bitter refrain  
The Lord is my shepherd, I cannot stay  
This blessed earth, this beautiful land  
A new day that breaks the dawn  
  
I am the tide, the oceans sing  
I am the anchor, I hold the brass ring  
I am the action, the deed of our king  
I am the static goodnight  
  
You make me to stand in the square on scene  
And make my choice, decision sing  
And bring my Lord, what this may bring  
I stand before you alone  
  
I rallied and sang and shouted refrains  
I'm blessed, turn the radio on  
The air was calm  
I held the bomb and the radio, the radio  
  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah

This is not a parable  
This is a terrible  
This is a terrible thing  
  
Yes I will rhyme that, after, after all I've done today  
I have earned my wings  
  
It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!  
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray!  
  
We'll leave the allegory to another Bible story  
Out of deference, defiance and choice  
And close in on a promise, after, after all I've done today  
I have earned my voice.  
  
It happened today. Hooray! Hooray!  
It happened. Hip, hip hooray!

Hurts but I'm so, so happy.  
Cause you, oh yes, yes, you do really deserve this. Shed a tear when you  
Want me to stop.  
So many times you have made people cry. So many lies, why I'm asking.  
I'm the one who will say, hey get out of my way, because you're twisted.

Lay me down, down, down, down, down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
But take me deep again  
  
We live and dream about our heroes  
I listened closely and I said  
"I'm not sure where to place myself here, friend.  
Am I upon the gold rings and stand?"  
  
The winners write the rulebooks, the histories and lullabies  
  
Lay me down, down, down, down  
Lay me down, down, down, down, down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
(Down, down, down)  
Take me deep again  
(Down, down, down)  
I have watched you sing  
(Down, down, down)  
I picture glass wings in your head

While golden broads and combines

Or brasses mixed with lead

I would dare you, but I know I don't need to  
You're going to do just what you want to  
You're going to take the leading chair at the fairground  
You're going to sing the praises of your fruit  
  
Mine smell like honey, uh!  
Mine smell like honey, uh!  
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- hu- honey, uh!  
  
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!  
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!  
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
If the end comes faster than we had expected  
And predictions lead us to the final fall  
If the flowers crack the grain and weave the patterns of the pavement  
I can hear you shouting over it all  
  
Mine smell like honey, uh!  
Mine smell like honey, uh!  
Mine smell like hu- hu- hu- hu- honey, uh!  
  
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!  
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!  
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper!  
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper!  
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper!  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
You track a trail of honey through it all  
You track a trail of honey

I am the passenger  
And I ride and I ride  
I ride through the city's backside  
And everything will be alright  
And everything is yours and mine tonight.

Yeah I ride and I ride  
I ride through the city at night  
I ride through this torn-down side  
And everything is yours and mine  
Mark out what's yours and mine  
We'll make what's yours and mine tonight  
We'll make what's yours and mine tonight  
  
Everything will be alright

What I want, I want now  
And it's a whole lot more, anyhow  
I wanna climb a mountain  
I wanna jump, jump, jump, jump a mountain  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
I get ideas, notions  
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean  
I get your point, you're so sharp  
Gettin good reactions with 'BeBo' talk  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
[SOLO]  
I understand all destructive urges  
It's seems so perfect  
I see, I see no evil  
Walkin' hand in hand with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' through Manhattan with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' hand in hand with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' in Jackson with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' in the world with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin' and talkin' with the one I love (I see no evil)  
Walkin', walkin' and talkin' with the one I love

Pleasure is melting like chocolate  
My blue ribbon gumption is gone  
All my gravy must have soaked into something  
And the world...  
The filthy steps, the cold concrete  
The phony earth below my feet  
The ancient odor of the streets  
Yes the world it is a sponge  
And when the crisis passes  
When the coast is clear  
I'll be buffed down to a liquid  
And the world it is a sponge  
Throughout this entire ugly outing  
I've been mumbling the convex of what I should be shouting  
But I'll soon be silent you'll soon hear nothing  
'cause the world it is a sponge

There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
Micheal's nervous and the lights are bright  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
Micheal's nervous and the lights are bright  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
There's something strange going on tonight  
There's something going on that's not quite right  
  
There's something going on that wasn't here before  
Keep your eyes glued to the floor  
No one's going to say goodnight  
There's something going on that's not quite right

[Chorus]  
I am, I am, I am Superman and I know what's happening  
I am, I am, I am Superman and I can do anything  
  
You don't really love that guy you make it with now do you  
I know you don't love that guy cause I can see right through you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you go a million miles away I'll track you down girl  
Trust me when I say I know the pathway to your heart  
  
If you go a million miles away I'll track you down girl  
Trust me when I say I know the pathway to your head  
  
[Chorus: x3]
