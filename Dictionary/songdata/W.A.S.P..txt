You don't have to hear my heart beat  
All you need is to look into my eyes  
And tell me I'm the one you heart needs  
I'm the only one you run to in the night  
  
Oh let me burn the words forever mine  
Across your heart, across your mind  
Take your hands and feel my heart beat  
come and let me feel it in your eyes  
  
All you have to do is touch me  
Oh and lay your flame across my fire  
Oh let me spread your wings and come inside  
And take your heart and make you mind  
  
Come and lay down your heart on me  
All that I want to feel is  
Breathe in me  
Lay down your heart on me  
  
Feel you inside of me  
Breathe on me  
Come and take me on, take me down  
Oh take me all the way  
  
There's only one way  
Only one thing I need, all I need  
Take me way down  
Come and lay down on me

This is a thing I've never known before  
It's called easy living  
This is a place I've never seen before  
And I've been forgiven  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
Easy living, and I've been forgiven  
Since you're taking your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Waiting, watching, wishing my whole life away  
Feeling, fainting, ready for my happy day  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road  
I had tried to find you  
Day after day on the winding road  
I have walked behind you  
  
[REFRAIN:]

YOU STAND OUTSIDE the circle lonely  
Here in darkness' eyes  
Are the lives realized all the same  
Or are they magic of mind  
Ooh if I leave  
Will I - be here again  
Ooh what remains  
Is Evermore in the wind  
Do the shadows of my memory  
From a long ago time  
Lead a path to the other lives of me  
Souls of past great divides  
Will I be here again  
Ooh, give me wings  
Ooh and its embrace  
Is in the arms of the wind  
And only those who stand within  
Can hold the keys that let us in  
But if the magic in us dies  
Ooh then the souls within us cries  
Beyond the wall of tears we wander  
Evermore in the wind  
Beyond the wall of tears we wonder  
The magic of the circle lays  
Somewhere between the dark and light  
Will I be here again  
The magic circle never dies  
Ooh, Evermore winds of change  
Will I be here again  
Ooh, will I rise on my wings  
Evermore in the wind  
Ooh, am I ever the same  
Will I come back again  
Ooh, give me wings for my change  
Evermore in the wind  
Oh will I come back again  
Ever free in the end  
Into the arms of the windOoh, will I be here again  
  
  

I'm politically incorrect  
and damn proud of it  
I love my country  
but I'm scared to death of its government  
Ya believe what you read  
cause it's all that they give ya  
Cause all of history is written by winners  
I'm engaged in a frenzy  
of mass self-destruction  
I feed upon your famine to fuel my corruption  
I'm whole-selling hatred  
and international incest  
To carnivorous hyenas in a global theft fest  
I've mastered the arts of death  
and foreign nations genocide  
And those who turn on me  
commit national suicide  
  
I'm the queen of the global dream  
And I rule a declining nation  
I sit and watch all the violent screams  
From the throne of your desperation  
I killed them all and stole their land  
Enslaved the blacks and slaughtered the red man  
In God we trusted and I gave birth  
To would be kings to rule the earth  
  
I have more pigs than I have tits to feed  
I embrace the world's phoney leaders  
And hold the sucklings to my breast  
And I'd fool you all as I'd feed ya  
I'll prop you up then strike you down  
And lick your blood up from your ground  
Humpty-fuckin-dumpty  
My empire's falling down  
  
"The hour is late, the clock of destiny is ticking out. America has become a
schizophrenic personality. For years, most of these people have been dominated
politically, exploited economically, segregated and humiliated by some foreign
power. America has trampled over the dream. The price that the United States
must pay is the price of its own destruction!"  
  
Breakdown, Goodbye America  
So long the music's died  
Freedom's last hero's wasted  
I made you, I'll break you  
Breakdown, Goodbye America  
It's all gone, kiss it goodbye  
There on bloody bended knees where  
my nation died

Like an animal that's on the run  
Tie me down spread-eagle  
Leave me dyin' in the sun

When you writhe and when you squeeze  
You smell my blood and you come runnin'  
Taste me if you please

Now that's what I'm after  
Come do that wicked deed aha

A wolf howls at the moon  
A heart attack, a sex maniac  
With rock salt in my wounds  
Cause I can feel my pulsing vein  
Make it last, last all night long  
I taste the bliss I wet the lips  
And I don't care if it's wrong  
  
Lick it hard, lap it up, do it now baby, touch it, touch it

And I'll make it through the night  
And I'll be alright, hold on, hold on to my heart  
  

The target is me, a monster you flee  
I hate what you say and you do  
A mirror is there and look if you dare  
The fool that you see's only you  
Oh, no, you won't nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
No kingdom reigns over me  
Despise all the liars I see  
Don't give me your  
"Save my soul" cure  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I - I'm still alive, and I am soul survivor  
You can't understand, why  
I - I'm still alive, and I am soul survivor  
Damn your holy man - alive  
  
Can't understand, the lord of the land  
Your heart and your head made of stone  
Lay in the sand my blood on your hands  
For God's sake just leave me alone  
Oh, no, you won't nail me to your tree  
Or hang my head up high  
Restless is all I can be  
Ruthless and reckless you see

Welcome, I bid your welcome, to live

A strange world that you might want to know  
When it comes alive - crank, crank, crank, crank the show

Your sad eyes never told me  
No paradise here for the lonely  
But I hold on, half a heart here in my hands  
Been so long, would you know me  
Whose holding you, whose gonna hold me  
If you want me, then I'll be your man  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
Can you take me to heaven  
Show me the way cause I'm no angel  
I am lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you was holding you down  
  
Will I have your memory  
Or will your memory have me  
I don't know, only time  
Knows if I'll ever know peace of mind  
Only time knows if you're mine, if you're mine  
  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you come back to me  
And I keep holding on  
Holding on till you run to me  
All I can hold is a shadow of a heart that's gone  
And left me shattered  
I'm lost and  
Can I hold you one more time  
I guess me holding you. was holding you down [Repeat: x2]

But not any more...  
  
So I see their fate  
In the black of the doom  
Waves of fire in the storm  
Creatures howl at the moon  
They're screaming intensly  
Their cries are heard for miles  
A prince resides there  
Lake of fools, burning wild

And I leave a message for you all  
Written here the fear that are my destiny you see  
Come behold madness you never saw  
No love for killer babies  
My blood is written on your walls  
Oh, it's time I leave you now  
Mama look what you made me  
Oh no, you never heard me call  
Oh, I know you'll hear me now, now  
'Cause I'm gone to meet my maker  
'Cause I'm locomotive man  
One killer baby's come to call  
'Cause I'm gonna meet my maker

I'm coming down to take you all  
I feel the rage that brings  
The fame of that I need

Living with the fears  
That hear those fantasies in me  
Come an see sadness you never saw  
No love for killer babies

Mama look what you made me

Read my words I'm coming

You won't hear me coming  

In the Shuffling madness of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser, headlong to his death  
Oh, it feels the [Incomprehensible] scraping  
Steam breaking on his brow  
And Charlie stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
He sees his children jumping off at stations one by one  
His woman and his best friend in bed and having fun  
Oh, he's crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down, no, no, no  
He hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner has got him by the balls  
Oh, he picks up Gideons Bible, open at page one  
I thank God, he stole the handle  
And the train that watched her go  
You know he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down  
No, he couldn't slow down  

Lady have you known me  
The perfect love machine ah  
Virgo, my Leo's rising  
Venus made me king  
That trail of broken hearts  
They all belong to me  
Magic runs through my fingers  
One touch you'll see!!  
  
[Chorus]  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine, oh  
L.O.V.E All I need's my love machine tonight..tonight  
  
What can I do for you am I your wildest dream  
What do I move in you am I what I seem  
My eyes they lie and you cry  
Love brings you pain  
And if you try to love me  
You'll not feel the same  
  
[Chorus x2]

Turn loose the lightning metal hawgs  
And set me free  
Turn loose my crying metal hearts'  
1200 C.C.  
Cold steel forever I'm gonna ride  
And burn the flame  
That breaths the fire - breaths the fire  
And can't be tamed  
  
Thunder rolling down the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
A Harley child until I die  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Run to the scorching desert sun  
V-twins will scream  
Into the blackness of the night, at twisting speed  
High on the hawg I'm riding on  
Engines explode  
It feels like thunder it's breathing fire  
It rules the road  
Milwaukee metal on the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
Only the strong here will survive  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Them bad boys riding on forever  
When they die they ride in Harley heaven  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds

You see me, a man and machine  
All my life so hungry and lean  
Watch me bleed and I feel no pain  
I'm going wild and slowly insane  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine  
  
One fast lane, on top of the world  
Balls of steel, mechanical pearls  
I pay my dues and suffer alone  
Feel like hell and cut to the bone  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine  
  
Be careful now  
Because what you wish for  
Just may come true  
If you look  
Behind that door  
  
Mantronic, I'm on the loose  
Bionic, my neck in the noose  
Mantronic, I'm still the king  
Bionic, half man and machine  

A tatooed madman, I'm hell on wheels  
Born a wicked child left alone in the fields  
My father was the wind, my mother was fire  
Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild  
A kamakazi man, a hollering 'Banzai'  
Never crash and burn, never gonna die  
ya cannibal it's me, ya scream and shout  
I'll chew ya up and spit ya out  
  
Storms i gotcha comin and its gonna be me.  
Here comes Trouble with a capital "T", ta,ta,ta  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
All they way, all the way, all the way  
  
Chewbacca in the rye, the water of fire  
A terror in the flesh, a killer for hire  
California man I'm white line, "Homer"  
The unruly one they call the "Blond Bomber"  
Scooter gypsy, I'm a renegade  
An orphan on the road, a live hand greande  
Never gonna quit before my time  
When the moon gets high then I'll be blind  
Mad dog 20-20's king,ooh  
I drink that stuff and start getting obscene  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
  
I'm a motorcycle man  
Don't ever give a damn  
I lie when the truth serves better  
The Marquis de Sade, I cheat,steal and rob  
A heavy metal creature  
All the way, all the way, all the way  
  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
I gotta scream, that's what I am  
All the way, all the way  
'Cause I'm a mean mother fucking man,  
Riding the wind and know I'll be damned  
All they way, all the way, all the way

Lost inside a room  
The priest at the door with news  
Said you were gone now I knew  
Oooh my world was broken in two  
I prayed that you were here  
To hold my heart  
I'd hide myself in your bed  
And cry myself numb  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I can't scream and I can't speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Lost inside my head  
I close my eyes and fled  
No pain no gain  
No death no more  
I drown myself in flesh  
There's no way out  
No way how  
Do you even know me now  
I finally see how amazing  
Can you hear me now  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I can't scream and I can't speak  
Show me how  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I can't scream and I can't speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
Oh god I miss you  
  
Why did you go and leave me alone  
And now I'm running away from my home  
No they'll never know I'm gone  
They don't know how  
Know how  
Can you hear me now  
Oooh can you see somehow  
Oooh here's to new love  
From your great beyond  
Can you hear me now  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I can't scream and I can't speak  
Show me now  
Will I ever be free from you  
  
Oh god I miss you  
Tell me can you hear me  
Oh god I miss you  
I can't scream and I can't speak  
Tell me how  
Will I ever be free from you

Lost in the dark can you forgive me  
Deep in the darkenss of my heart  
Coiled in the grass's that torment me  
There lies mt serpents in the dark

The mirror cracked in a million pieces  
And so did I cause Johnny's me

Reflecting the flames in your eyes  
Sex and pain insane, they're really the same  
Misused and confused, bound and tied  
  
On Your knees,You shall be on your knees  
Cos I want you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees  
And I need you on your knees  
You shall be on your knees

I see your red door and I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love, both never to come back  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away  
Never see the sight of me that changes every day  
I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black  
Yeah, paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah  
I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah  
No more will my dreams' eagle turn a deeper blue  
(Handcuffed, handcuffed)  
I could not foresee this thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black  
I see my red door and it has been painted black  
(Painted black)  
Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah

I live my life like a shot in the wind  
If tomorrow don't come I know  
I stole my share of fun for me  
Cause I'm too fast, too rad  
I'm going wasted when I go  
The cost of freedom's never free  
It's the deep six, it's my fix  
It's my best friend, cause it's my way or the highway  
I'll tell you it's the living end  
  
I'm a rebel in the FDG  
And I say only God in heaven knows  
I'm a bad child, come and love me  
And I say, oh yeah  
  
If you're fast you might last  
Slow you gotta go  
A wild one in the decadent zoo  
Ooh, I lick up all my seven deadly sins  
Cause I'm too hot, too cool  
Oh I've been playing in the fire of fools  
I might burn but I'll burn in the wind  
It's the deep six, it's my fix  
It's the big jam, cause it's my way or the highway  
I'll tell you what I am  
  
Oh I, I feel the heat and I, I touch the flesh and bone  
And I feel the kiss of fire  
Too fast to live, too fast to die  
Mom and daddy say, "I'm dancing in the fire"  
  
Sometimes I feel like an animal in a cage  
I pace back and forth and look around  
For something to sink my teeth into  
But nobody knows what's going on inside me

For so long now, I'm racing on in the wind  
On this road, I'm moving on  
I feel her heat, the desert sun burning skin  
Never stopping, always on the run  
Ooh, forever all I want is you here by my side  
But I can't wait too long, no  
Holding me is like taming the seven seas  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I want restless gypsy, all I need  
Is to catch the wind, where my heart's in  
And I'm riding in the breeze  
Call me restless gypsy, to the end  
Riding free - is all I need  
My spirit's in the wind  
  
Move too fast no never hold me down  
Catch me if you really think you can  
Feel my touch, two lovers, cry that sound  
Never ever knowing who I am  
Ooh, I want you closer, baby, don't you take too long  
'Cause tomorrow I'll be gone, yeah  
And holding me is like holding the seven seas

Easy rider on the highway  
Got the wind in my hair  
Come on, you can touch me where I lay  
Running free without a care  
  
Come on, restless gypsy, all I need  
Is to catch the wind, where my heart's in  
And I'm riding in the breeze

And have a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass  
  
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this dance alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Night's alright

Night's alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Night's alright

I'm a night rider burning the highways, no brakes I ride  
Tasmanian Devil, a mean streak as wide as the sky  
As wild as the night  
Cause I'm a wild screaming eagle  
I thunder and roll down the line  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm living to be  
S-s-s-s-s-savage  
  
I'm a fur stroking monster, I'll eat you alive  
My heart is my smoking sportster, cross me and you'll not survive  
My wheels are my life  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm living to be  
S-s-s-s-s-savage  
Don't dare touch me  
Five hundred see-see-see-see-see-see-s  
  
No one can see that I got to be free  
All that I need's just to ride in the breeze  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Don't tread on me cause I'm destined to be  
Savage  
To be free, ride in the breeze  
No don't you touch me  
I'm running today, I'm still bound to stay  
Sa-sa-sa-savage

Grit your teeth and listen for the gun  
Get in the runners block and kneel  
And run the human race  
That decadent decathlon and  
Let the games begin for real  
Stop scaring me, it's bedlam in paradise  
Stop I can't see, nowhere I can hide  
Scared to run, this monstrous  
Marathon of fear  
  
I run the races with a dark horse to win  
Across a finish line of fear  
I swim a sea of skin, afraid to drown in flesh  
X-generations revolutions here  
Scared to have sex, I don't want to die  
Scared I'll be next, I'm scared for my life  
Dying to live, but there ain't no way  
Outta here alive, all we're all scared there's  
  
Nowhere to run, I'm scared to death  
Nowhere to hide, scared I'll be next  
Oh- stop, stop, stop, stop  
Nowhere to run, I'm scared to death  
Nowhere to hide, scared I'll be next  
Oh- stop, stop, stop, stop  
  
Am I a prisoner of the universe?  
Is destiny fixed among the stars?  
Should I cry or laugh?  
All I know is that  
The best time to laugh  
Is any time you can  
Life's one big party, thrown here by God  
We all get invitations, if we want them or not  
It's all truth or dare and nothing is fair, no  
No no  
We're all scared there's  
  
Oh, it's the decade of fear  
No way out of here, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Oh scream in my ears  
Oh stop what I hear, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Scream until you like it  
  
Come on in! ha ha ha  
  
Come on in, no this ain't no dream  
Better hold on tight things ain't what they seem, no no no  
Don't be afraid if your heart's burning ready to go  
Well I love it when I scare you so

Asleep in black  
There's no light in the crack  
The crooked fingers for you  
No don't ya dare say a prayer  
It's just the nights in your mare  
Oh the long forever you'll do  
  
No Mercy, no coming back  
No mercy, forever fade to black  
  
Oh where's the god that made you  
Oh you're Superman  
Going down forever - to never land  
Oh where's the God you pray?  
Forsaken again  
Giving you forever  
The Shadow Man  
  
Oh free at last  
With a heart in the black  
Forever Shadowing you  
Don't you swear to the terror  
Your god never cares  
Oh come oh whatever your do  
  
No Mercy, no coming back  
No mercy, forever fade to black  
  
Oh where's the god that made you  
Oh you're Superman

Going down forever to never land  
Don't runaway or hide again  
No gates of Heaven

All my life I've taken what I want  
Give an inch, take a mile  
Always on the hunt  
Ooh - sex, money, fast cars, never get my fill  
I ride hard and die free  
Paying for my thrills  
Fire, water, moonshine, going to my head  
He and my pistols loaded  
Go out and knock'em dead  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom  
I don't never miss  
I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom  
I don't never miss  
  
Hot sweaty steel, a woman's finger's on my gun  
Pull it hard, touch the trigger  
Squeeze it when I'm gone  
Ooh, come, woman, touch me, put it in your hand  
Take a hold heart and soul  
Honey, I'm your man  
Cock the hammer slowly and aim it at your love  
Put my barrel in your holster  
Like a velvet glove  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Hot and sticky, here it comes  
Emotion you can't tame  
Kind a tricky watch it run  
Smoking like a flame, flame, flame  
  
Hot and sticky, here it comes  
I got the bullet, load it up  
Slide it into place  
My emotions  
Coming down all across your face  
  
[REFRAIN:]

I, I hear the mighty engines roar  
And I unleash the savage dogs of war  
Ooh, I'm the outlaw that rides  
  
White anglo saxon, a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel, steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madman's badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
I can feel the cycles as they turn  
And I can smell the bodies as they burn  
Ooh, the city's on fire  
  
White anglo saxon, a violent reaction  
Fire is my fuel, steel and iron rule  
  
Ride on wasteland  
A madman's badland  
Ride on wasteland  
And I will survive to show no mercy  
  
Pain and hunger all across then thunder  
Life is for the biggest, it's survival of the fittest  
  
Ride on wasteland (show no mercy)  
A madman's badland (on you)  
Ride on wasteland (show no mercy)  
A madman's badland (on you, on you, on you)

Touch, touch in the flame's desires  
Feeling the pain's denial  
And your fingers in the fire  
  
Look, look in the candlelight  
See in the flame of life  
And my spell is our lie  
  
(Chorus):  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
You're sleeping in the fire  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
You feel what it does and you're drunk on love  
You're sleeping in the fire  
  
I gaze and the flame and fire burn  
And cry out the name of which I yearn  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
You're sleeping in the fire

When the truth is found to be lies  
You know the joy within you dies  
  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You Better find someone to love  
  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
Find somebody to love  
When the dawn is rose, they are dead  
Yes and you're mine, you're so full of red  
  
Your eyes, I say you eyes may look like his  
Yeah, but in you head, baby  
I'm afraid you don't know where it is  
  
Tears are running  
Running along down your breast  
And your friends baby  
They treat you like a guest

Paint a shadow on my heart  
In shades of ebony  
Paint the sun out of the sky  
That rains over me  
  
Black sun, rain on me  
I need one, black sun  
Rain on me, rain on me  
  
Tie me to my blackness there  
Where I'm ever free  
Taken to the dark edges of  
My wicked memories  
  
Paint my soul in indigo, and ebony for me  
No colour seen in my eyes, none in my eyes  
I'm naked in my misery  
Emotions stripped to bone  
I see inside the heart of me  
It's still not black enough for me  
  
No colour in the heart of me  
No colour run in my veins  
I hold the black to my breast  
It bleeds over me  
I can't go on till I get off  
For me it's still not black enough  
With darkness gone, my fear is seen  
My fear is real, my fear is me  
  

Think about the sorrow  
You brought  
Think of all the horror  
You made  
Lying to a world  
That you wrought  
Dying for the world - oh  
That you made  
  
What'd you get for  
Souls that you bought  
The bloody dead in the trades  
Don't never blame  
The souls that you lost - on  
The whores of Babylon  
That you laid  
  
Johnny get your guns  
You'll need all those prophets you pay  
Oh yeah Johnny get your guns  
I've come to kill the god that you made  
  
Im gonna murder supeman  
Murder superman  
Stone cold killer's what I am  
Your widowmaking ones come  
You can't hide  
I'm gonna murder superman  
Murder superman  
I got a heart breaker in my hands  
Yeah here I come  
Oh - You're gonna die  
  
Your lying messiah you know isn't real  
How will you die fo the one that you kneel  
Better get your guns  
I'm gonna kill your god  
My God will kill your god

Just a little bit west of old Pasadena  
Is the place I go, I call it home for me  
Call it what you will, Tinseltown for real  
It''s the open edge where the debutantes run free  
  
Hollywood, California, Rocktown USA  
Cruising down the stirp is where I''ll be  
At the Rainbow bar and grill  
I''ll drink till I get my fill  
The home of the movie stars is where you''ll find me  
  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
Desolation Boulevard I ride  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
It''s paradise on the faultline tonight  
  
Everybody''s lost in the land of Disney  
Ecstacy and Sister Misery  
Save your soul boy, but not to the stars  
Ha ha ha  
  
It''s the land of the twenty four hour party  
And my fist firmly wrapped around a fifth of Bacardi  
On the Sunset Strip''s where the orphans play tonight  
  
So if you wanna get really rude  
Jus come on down and we''ll get crude  
Cause there ain''t no place like here  
Baby I mean nowhere  
Cause in here''s the land of sun and sin  
All the freaks here gonna let you in  
The shooting stars and the poseurs are gonna be there  
  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
Desolation Boulevard I ride  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
It''s paradise on the faultline tonight

One night as I rolled down some long winding road  
I saw you and I knew I couldn't let you go  
Half child and all woman, vision fantasy  
Lost against the moonlight bathed in ecstasy  
Leopard's skin and cat's eyes  
Has the jungle made you wild  
The prey you're after, is you faster  
Will it make you smile  
Ride with me, I'll set you free  
Chains can't hold us down  
I need you, if you want me  
Lovers we are bound  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
Sweet cheetah, cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever, fever, I love it, babe  
Come do it to me  
Cheetah, cheetah  
I love it when your claws run through me  
Fever, fever, I love it, babe  
Come do it to me now  
  
Skin tight you move in so slowly to thrill  
Waiting for the nightmare then you're in for the kill  
Amazon so sleekly you know what to do  
Eat the flesh, and save my heart  
And leave it when you're through  
Pain and pleasures all mine  
Untamed and running wild  
Sink your teeth into me  
Lick your lips and smile  
Take my hand and ride the land  
Forever you and me  
Hold on tight to me all night  
And set your spirit free  
  
[REFRAIN:]

[Jesse to Congregation] Don't you take me to  
Your preachers  
And blind me with  
Their teachings  
Take your sorrowed souls  
And give'em to the blind  
  
Are the Gods that made you lying  
To the bloodied faces  
And never cry  
How long you all  
Been waiting to die  
  
Blinded by your teachers  
Now they'll be hiding  
You'll be seeking  
Will you give'em mercy  
Hang'em on high  
Johnny get your guns for dying  
It's time for right'n all the wrongs they've lied  
Give me a shotgun  
Make it alright  
  
Don't tell me your  
Maker's laughing  
You're bleeding the world he made  
  
Shotgun the walls of wailing  
Come tell me  
When it starts again  
  
Running for our lives - will ya  
Tear down the walls and smile  
God in Heaven save us all tonight

Welcome to the show, the great finale's finally here  
I thank you for coming into my theater of fear  
Welcome to the show, you're all witnesses, you see  
A privileged invitation to the last rites of me  
Remember me? You can't save me  
Mama, you never needed me  
No crimson king, look in my eyes, you'll see  
Mama, I'm lonely, it's only me, it's only me  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes, of a million  
I am the prisoner of the paradise I dreamed  
The idol of a million, lonely faces look at me  
Behind the mask of sorrow, four doors of doom behind my eyes  
I've got their footprints all across my crimson mind  
Long live, long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free  
I was the warrior with an anthem in my soul  
The idol of eight thousand, lonely days of rage ago  
And remember me when it comes your time to choose  
Be careful what you wish for, it might come true  
Long live, long live  
Long live the king of mercy  
Long live, long live  
There is no love to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love to shelter me, only love, love set me free  
Red, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?  
The straps on my back  
Red, crimson red, no, I was never to be  
Only one crimson son, no, it never was me  
Living in the limelight, little did I know  
I was dying in the shadows and the mirror was my soul  
It was all I ever wanted, everything I dreamed  
But the dream became my nightmare, no one could hear me scream  
With these six-strings, I make a noose  
To take my life, it's time to choose  
The headlines read of my demise, yeah, suicide, of my suicide  
Oh, sweet silence, where is the sting?  
I am no idol, no crimson king  
I'm the impostor, the world has seen  
My father was the idol, it was never me  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, no, I don't wanna be  
The crimson idol of a million eyes  
No love, to shelter me  
Only love, love set me free  
No love, to shelter me, only love, love set me free  

The tarot is fate, said the Gypsy Queen  
And she beckoned me, to glimpse my future she'd seen  
  
She said, do you see what I see?, be careful to choose  
Be careful what you wish for, cause it may come true  
When I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?  
Will it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose  
  
I'm the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me  
  
Then the illusion was real, a crimson idol I saw  
But the higher he'd fly, then the further he'd fall  
  
I'm the lost boy can you help me  
Yeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me  
  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be  
The crimson Idol of a million eyes  
Of a million

Father come save us from this  
Madness we're under  
God of creation are we blind?  
Cause some here are slaves  
That worship guns that spit thunder  
The children that you've made  
Have lost the minds  
  
This monster that we call the earth  
Is bleeding  
Cause the children have been  
Left along too long  
This thing that we've made is fat  
And feeds on the hate  
Of the millions that it's taught to sing  
The song  
  
The headless children  
The screams that fill the night  
Fill the night fill the night fill the night  
Oh the headless children  
The madness steals the light  
Steals the light steals the light steals the light  
  
Time bombs in the hands of all the wicked warbabies  
Light the fuse of temptation and we all burn  
Four horsemen sit high up in the saddle  
And waiting are ride the bloody trail of no return  
  
Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare and  
Wake to find we've been away too long  
This Frankenstein of flash  
Stitched together back from death  
And preying on the souls of everyone  
  
The headless children  
The screams that fill the night  
Fill the night fill the night fill the night  
Oh the headless children  
The madness steals the light  
Steals the light steals the light steals the light

There's a red worm crawling in my head  
Cut in half worm, in my blood he lies red  
And I see him in my head  
It's my nightmare, oh it's my dream  
He's inside here silencing my screams  
Alone on a razor's edge  
Alone sliding on the razor's edge  
  
I'm the horror on the edge  
Cause I, I'm the worm that cometh  
I am him I am hell, I am god, I'm the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes  
  
A killer's listening to horrors in my head  
He's bleeding, sliding on the razor's edge  
Through my eyes he watches me  
He lies inside watching me  
There's a red noise deep inside my head  
An obscure noise and the smell of slow death  
If there's a hell then I'll be there  
  
I am god, obscene death  
I'm the worm on razor's edge  
All pigs die  
Kill, fuck, die  
  
I am hell, godless me  
I am pagan idolatry  
Kneel before the horror  
Kneel before the horror  
Fuck me, kill me, drink my blood  
Fuck me, kill me, drink my blood  
All pigs die, kill, fuck, die  
  
I'm the horror on the edge  
Cause I, I'm the worm that cometh I am him I am hell  
I am god, I'm the devil all in one  
The eyes that hide the face inside  
Come stare into my eyes

You don't know what's in our hearts  
This is our time, we've made our mark  
And you can't understand, we'll fight till we fall  
But what do you want to do? The time is right for you  
To stand on your feet and answer the call  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command  
  
A thousand times I had this dream, the flag was high, I heard a scream  
That cut through the still of the night just like a knife  
But that was yesterday, the darkness has gone away  
I stand on the edge, and I pledge my life  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command  
  
The destiny that I control will sever  
And break the bonds and set me free forever!  
  
Stand up, for the first time, and shout it, woah-oh  
The last command is heard across the land  
Stand up, for the first time, and cry out, woah-oh  
Hear the call we are, the Last Command

Are we to hide inside and fear forever  
A never ending road of tears  
Oh, Tell me my Lord  
Why am I here?

He came from the East  
They called him a beast  
This king of terror insane  
Neutron Ronnie, the people would whisper his name  
  
Dangerous and mad  
A torch in his hand  
Spread fire by the light of the moon  
Ooh, pyrotechnical wizard of doom  
  
Oh no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
Ah till he dies it'll burn in his eyes  
  
A phantom so cool  
A midnight would rule  
And molotov cocktail would rain  
Babies screamin'  
And house would go up in flames  
  
When next Ronnie goes, nobody knows  
But inside him's where Lucifer hides  
Ooh, he's the boy with the bombs at his side  
  
Ooh no here comes Ronnie, ah the boy with the flame  
Ah his life has been burning inside  
Oh no no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
Ah till he dies the burning in his eyes  
  
Oh no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the boy with the flame  
Ah his life has been burning inside  
Oh no no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
As till he dies the burning in his eyes

[Jesse to God]  
  
A storm is come  
One war of sun and rain - within me  
A raging storm  
Lost crossroads thundering - in the wind  
Dark and son  
Who's the only one  
To lay claim of me  
Altars of store  
Righteous temptations  
Here at my feet  
  
Give me love  
To rage in me can you see?  
Only love  
Is saving me  
Give me love, oh love  
That rage in me  
  
It rages on  
Of mourn and memories  
In the wind  
A warring storm  
My soul is bargaining - in the end  
Is there no sun?  
With only love in vain - and it's pain  
Hear me oh Lord  
Cleanse me evermore with  
Your blood of rain  
  
Holy war for my soul  
Scares of memories remain  
Oh, tell me why am I here  
Storms of crossroads are rage

I went back to the doctor to get another shrink  
I sit and tell him about my weekend  
But he never can change what he thinks  
Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor  
Can you see the real me, doctor, ooh doctor  
  
I went back to my mother, I said I'm crazy Ma, help me  
She said "I know how it feels son, cause it runs in the family"  
see'mon tell me  
Can you see the real me, mother, mother  
Can you see the real me, mother, woah mother  
  
Can you see, can you see, can you see the real me  
Can you see, can you see the real me  
The real me, the real me, the real me  
  
The cracks between the pavement stones  
Like rivers of flowing rain  
Strange people who know me  
From behind every window pane  
The girl I used to love lives in this yellow house  
Yesterday she passed me by, she don't want to know me now  
  
Can you see the real me, can ya, can ya  
Can you see the real me, woah yea  
  
I ended up with the preacher, full of lies and hate  
I seemed to scare him a little, ha ha  
So he showed me to the golden gate  
Can you see the real me preacher, preacher  
Can you see the real me woah yea  
Can you see, can you see, can you see, woah yeah  
Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor  
Can you see the real me, mama  
Can you see the real me me me me

A crown of thorns on my heart  
  
Change me  
Save me  
Will you love me?  
Forever nailed to your cross

There's never a day, that's passing my way  
That I never need it  
My hands on the wheel, my foot's on the steel  
'Cause I gotta feel it  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on  
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah  
The rock rolls forever on - ooh, forever on  
Like thunder - coming down, ooh, yeah  
  
It blows through my veins like thunder and rain  
And I can't live without it  
I scream for the crowds, and turn it up loud  
'Cause I gotta feel it  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Six string and lightning strikes  
Come make me blind  
Ooh burn it up  
Bring down the pedal to the metal  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Forever never stop

You'll be so far out of control  
You know, the ones you saved  
  
Look in my eye cause somehow you  
You don't realize what I made  
  
You can't run away from me  
Don't deny your blind believers  
And hide your Devil's keeper  
  
Take your love away from me  
'Cause I will blind your heathen reason  
And ride us on your broken wings for love  
  
True we are disciples lost  
You know the promise you made  
Look in my eyes and tell me why  
You realize the price that you'll pay?  
  
Number nine, number nine, number nine  
I'm still inside of  
The nine asylums  
Am I Messiah?  
  
You're the only God they know  
  
What are you running from  
Wasn't this enough  
Aren't you satisfied?  
They're all at your feet  
The Lord to sheep  
Oh, are you sanctified?

Bang, bang, banging in your head  
You're banging on the walls  
Hang, hang, hanging up yourself  
You're hanging by your balls  
  
And you, you die but no-one hears or cares  
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Suck, suck, sucking at your life  
Your master sucks the juice  
Shoot, shoot, shooting at you  
And the hangman's noose is loose  
  
And you, you cry but no-one hears or cares  
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Your masters beat you bloody  
Still you're running back for more  
And every day, you lay down and play the whore  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops

Listen to me now  
No words, I can say, can describe  
How I hate your fucking face  
And do you hear me now  
You stole my soul with your lies  
Your killing zone's where I lie  
There you watched me die  
  
You fucken suck  
  
Can you see yourself I lie in my bed  
Fantasizing your death  
Here I lie  
Can you see yourself  
And how do you sleep with what you are?  
What you turned out to be  
Fuck you, kill yourself  
  
You fucken suck  
  
Liar you know I do I wish you well  
Liar I died for you I wish you well in hell ...in hell  

Oh I, I was marked from the day I was born  
A rebel and I was the one who I am  
My father could not understand the fire in me  
There was, there was times I was crazy for real  
So crazy I just couldn't feel, no, no, no  
Confusion would stand in the door and tell me lies  
But now I stand on my feet so alive  
I'm a metal warrior, I need their cries, War Cry  
  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, come take a stand  
Together we'll let out a cry  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, come take a stand  
Together we'll never say die  
  
Oh I, I did not choose, the music chose me  
I was christened and destined to be who I am  
The one that they said would be damned  
A hellion child that...?  
I stand at the mirror and sing  
I dare to be different and dream, now I am  
Big thunder that rolls on the land forever wild  
But still, this feeling inside never die  
I'm a metal warrior, I need their cries, War Cry  
  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, come take a stand  
Together we'll let out a cry  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, Come take a stand  
Together we'll never say die  
  
Raise your fist and support your rebel outlaws  
Cause nobody rides for free  
The freedom we lose today, you lose tomorrow  
Because freedom means something to us...  
  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, come take a stand  
Together we'll let out a cry  
I'm a soldier, soldier, a soldier of fortune  
Ahh, come take a stand  
Together we'll never say die  

GIVE ME A LINE  
And pour me wine  
I'll do the Devil's daughter  
Fill my glass and kick your ass  
I'll do it any time  
Oh, I don't want no Holy rollers  
On you knees  
I don't need  
There's no time to waste tonight  
No don't hold me rollers  
Cause I might die tonight  
It's come down to blows  
I am - wasted and out of order  
With a bloody nose  
Oh I don't want no Holy rollers  
Demon swill with a thirst to kill  
I'll do it anytime  
There's no time to waste tonight  
On your knees  
No don't hold me rollers  
Howl at the moon in the night  
Cause I might die tonight  
I don't need  
Wasted boys feeling no pain  
I'm the devil alright  
Just give me shooters and that demon cocaine  
I'm a wasted white  
White boys better  
Run for you lives  
It's do or die, die  
I'll tell you why  
Rather die that get civilized  
Wasted white boys ride free and I'd  
Oh let me ride  
  

[BIlly to Jesse]  
  
Time to go away  
Down a road I cannot hide  
Will I have no name  
For destiny's I cannot find  
Will I wander alone  
Forever's lonely road of time  
Am I looking for what  
I'll never find  
  
Did you call my name  
I will be leaving from this dream  
Can you feel the pain  
Slowly leaving me  
Will you hold my hand  
And ease me to the other side  
Am I looking for what  
I'll never find  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me in the night  
Will you feel me  
If you leave me will I cry?  
Can you hear me  
Can you feel me say goodbye

A thousand years I've roamed the plains  
And waved the hand of doom  
I've seen the tears that fall  
Like rain from the waste and all that ruin  
A shadow's cast from me to you  
A time to claim  
All that's mine, my wrath is blind  
The balance is where you hang  
  
I'm the WidowMaker  
I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker  
  
The cries of sadness never heard  
Fall deaf upon my ears

The smell of sorrow fills the fields  
And lingers in the sky  
The littered ground will swallow down  
The souls that fill my eyes

I'm the Lord of the Wings  
I'm the WidowMaker

So come turn me on and turn the flames up higher

And all the souls  
Oh - they're wishing they could die  
  
Take me down  
And drown this the orphan forever  
Ya know I do  
Wish away the pain  
And wash away my life  
Find me down inside a shallow pool  
Down a wishing well  
No more bleeding  
No more screaming tonight  
  
Wash away my pain  
Oh - in the well of sighs  
For I have no face - oh  
Abandoned for all, for all time  
  
[Jesse thinking of his mother]  
  
Why, why am I nothing?  
Oh mamma why, why'd you leave me  
A throw away for life  
Oh - oh why, why am I nothing  
Oh and mamma why  
Can you feel me there  
Oh God I want to die
