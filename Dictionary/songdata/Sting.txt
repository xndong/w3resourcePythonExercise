How can you say that your not responsible?  
What does it have to do with me?  
What is my reaction?  
What should it be?  
Confronted by this latest atrocity  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Hide my face in my hands, shame wells in my throat  
My comfortable existence is reduced  
To a shallow, meaningless party  
Seems that when some innocents die  
All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine  
Too many cam'ras and not enough food  
'Cause this is what we've seen  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Protest is futile  
Nothing seems to get through  
What's to become of our world?  
Who knows what to do?  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears

The fox is done running  
And the beast is at bay  
We've run them in circles  
By the end of the day  
We chased them through bramble  
We chased them through the fields  
We could chase them forever  
But the fox would not heel  
And some saw her shadow  
On the crest of a hill  
All the hounds are distracted  
Away from the kill  
One day we'll reach a great ocean  
At the end of a pale afternoon  
And we'd lay down our heads just like we were sleeping  
Controlled by the drag of the moon  
We ran through the forest  
And we ran through the streams  
And we ran through the heather  
Though we ran in our dreams  
And you were my lover  
And I was your boy  
We ran like the river  
For what else did we know  
One day we'll reach a great ocean  
At the end of a pale afternoon  
The dogs are all howling  
And the horses are late  
All the hunters have hunted  
Through the end of the game  
Our love was a river  
A wild mountain stream  
In a tumbling fury  
On the edge of a dream  
And they chased us through bramble  
And they chased us through the fields  
They could chase us forever  
But our heart would not yield  
And the fox is done running  
At the end of the day  
I'm ready to answer  
I'm ready to pay  
And this river's done running  
And time will come soon  
Carried to the great ocean  
By the drag of the moon  

Everybody laughed when I told them  
I wanted you, I wanted you  
Everybody grinned they humored me  
They thought that someone had spiked my tea  
Everybody screamed they told me you  
Would cost the moon, we'll be there soon  
Everybody laughed till they were blue  
They didn't believe my words were true  
  
Everybody laughed but you  
It's easy to lose touch with all the friends  
You like so much or liked so much  
Everybody laughed they couldn't take me seriously  
Abandoned me  
Sometimes I would read of things they'd done in magazines  
They made the scene  
Everybody left with such important things to do  
But I'm not blue  
  
Everybody left but you  
Everybody left but you  
  
Many years have passed  
And some have fallen by the way I heard them say  
Everybody dreamed but those who fell  
Are sleeping now, they're sleeping now  
Everybody climbed like ivy to the top most branch  
It was their chance  
Everybody grasped till they were through  
It's all they thought that they could do  
  
Cause everybody fell  
Everybody fell  
Everybody fell but you

You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley  
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we walk in fields of gold  
So she took her love for to gaze awhile upon the fields of barley  
In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold  
  
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?  
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold  
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.  
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold  
  
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken  
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold  
We'll walk in fields of gold  
  
Many years have passed since those summer days among the fields of barley  
See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold  
You'll remember me when the west wind moves upon the fields of barley  
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky when we walked in fields of gold  
When we walked in fields of gold, when we walked in fields of gold

I know we got some history  
We got some issues that we need to solve  
But is it really such a mystery?  
It's just the way that the world evolves  
Let me ask your forgiveness baby  
My heart is ever full of sorrow  
We got to move into the future maybe  
And think about a new tomorrow  
  
She said you know I used to love you baby  
But you're thinking way too fast  
So forget about the future  
And let's get on with the past  
  
So they called a 'nited nations summit  
To negotiate for peace on earth  
And it may be idealistic baby  
But I know what peace of mind is worth  
Everybody aired their grievances  
And they threw away the suture  
They opened up all the wounds of the past  
As they failed to find their way to the future  
  
They said we'd better check the weather chart  
Before we tie our colors to this mast  
It's just too hard thinking about the future baby  
So let's just get on with the past  
  
She said we'd better check the horoscope honey  
Just in case this feeling wasn't meant to last  
It's just too hard thinking about the future  
So let's just get on with the past  
  
How many times you ever hear me say  
I'm as flawed as any other human being?  
There simply has to be a different way  
And a whole new way of seeing  
Are we doomed by all our history?  
Is our love really beyond repair?  
It's getting close to midnight baby  
And we ain't got time to spare  
  
Just when I think I'm home and dry  
And she's given up the fight  
There's an unmistakable optimism  
In romantic music and candlelight  
There's this lingering perfume  
The merest ghost of the past  
She says wait a minute baby  
You're moving way too fast  
We'd better check the weather chart  
Before we raise this mast  
We'd best consult our horoscope  
In case this feeling wasn't meant to last  
Let's just forget about the future  
And get on with the past

If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one  
Drying in the color of the evening sun  
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away  
But something in our minds will always stay  
  
Perhaps this final act was meant  
To clinch a lifetime's argument  
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could  
  
For all those born beneath an angry star  
Lest we forget how fragile we are  
  
On and on the rain will fall  
Like tears from a star  
Like tears from a star  
On and on the rain will say  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
  
On and on the rain will fall  
Like tears from a star  
Like tears from a star  
On and on the rain will say  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are

The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
His wings as drifted snow  
His eyes as flame  
"All hail" said he "thou lowly maiden Mary  
Most highly favored maid," Gloria  
  
"For known a blessed mother thou shalt be  
All generations laud and honor thee  
Thy Son shall be Emanuel  
By seers foretold  
Most highly favored maid," Gloria  
  
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,  
"My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name."  
Most highly favored maid Gloria  
  
Of her Emanuel, the Christ was born  
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn  
And everyone throughout the world forever saved  
Most highly favored maid Gloria

Turned on the weather man just after the news  
I needed sweet rain to wash away my blues  
He looked at the chart but he looked in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
Back in the time with Louis XVI  
At the court of the people he was number one  
He'd be the bluest blood they'd ever seen  
When the king said hi to the guillotine  
The royal astrologer was run out of breath  
He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death  
He look in the sky but he look in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
Well the land was cracking and the river was dry  
All the crops were dying when they ought to be high  
So to save his farm from the banker's draft  
The farmer took out a book on some old witchcraft  
He made a spell and a potion on a midsummer's night  
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight  
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
The sun won't shine 'til the clouds are gone  
The clouds won't go 'til their work is done  
And every morning you'll hear me pray  
If only it would rain today  
  
I asked my baby if there'd be some way  
She said she'd save her love for a rainy day  
I look in the sky but I look in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain

Now that I have found you  
In the cool'th of your evening smile  
The shade of your parasol  
And your love flows through me  
Though I drink at your pool  
I burn for you, I burn for you  
  
You and I are lovers  
When night time folds around our bed  
In peace we sleep entwined  
And your love flows through me  
Though an ocean soothes my head  
I burn for you, I burn for you  
  
Stars will fall from dark skies  
As ancient rocks are turning  
Quiet fills the room  
And your love flows through me  
Though I lie here so still  
I burn for you, I burn for you  
  
I burn

Early one morning with time to kill  
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill  
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain  
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim  
My brother's rifle went off in my hand  
A shot rang out across the land  
The horse he kept running the rider was dead  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
  
I set off running to wake from the dream  
My brother's rifle went into the stream  
I kept on running into the salt lands  
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands  
The sheriff he asked me "Why had I run"  
Then it came to me just what I had done  
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
  
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there  
I see the judge high up in his chair  
"Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind  
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find"  
I said "I felt the power of death over life  
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife  
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead"  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
  
Early one morning with time to kill  
I see the gallows up on the hill  
And out in the distance a trick of the brain  
I see a lone rider crossing the plain  
He's come to fetch me to see what they done  
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come  
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead  
I hung my head, I hung my head  
I hung my head, I hung my head

Lady Dolphin and her dolphin beau  
Were swimming out to sea one day  
All the other lady dolphins smiled  
But they were smiling in that subtle dolphin way  
  
So they pretended that they'd pay it no mind  
But she was female, of the jealous kind  
She couldn't stand it - not to ask him why  
She could see that he was flattered by the twinkle in his eye  
  
She said, "How much do you need me?  
How much do you need me?  
Would you stay with me till this ocean floor is dry?  
But if you cannot find the words that say  
I'm the only one you love that way  
I guess we'll have to say goodbye."  
  
He said, "My love for you is wider than the wide Sargasso Sea  
There ain't no bigger number, I know, but  
I never counted every ripple on the sea."  
  
He said that words had never failed him yet  
"But before our future course is set  
I have to find a way to win you, dear  
But there's two atmospheres of pressure on me here"  
  
"How much do I need you? How much do I need you?  
Can't seem to find the words to make you stay  
But remember all the things I've said  
That I'll love you till the day I'm dead  
'Cause I need you like this hole in my head  
I need you like this hole in my head

Alone with my thoughts this evening  
I walked on the banks of Tyne  
I wondered how I could win you  
Or if I could make you mine  
Or if I could make you mine  
The wind it was so insistent  
With tales of a stormy south  
But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree  
There came a dryness in my mouth  
Came a dryness in my mouth  
For then without rhyme or reason  
The two birds did rise up to fly  
And where the two birds were flying  
I swear I saw you and I  
I swear I saw you and I  
I walked out this morning  
It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes  
For the first time I saw the work of heaven  
In the line where the hills had been married to the sky  
And all around me every blade of singing grass  
Was calling out your name and that our love would always last  
And inside every turning leaf  
Is the pattern of an older tree  
The shape of our future  
The shape of all our history  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Came things I'd never seen  
Things I'd never seen  
I was brought to my senses  
I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature  
Said you belong to me  
I know it's true  
It's written in a sky as blue  
As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes  
If nature's red in tooth and claw  
Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw  
The wounds she gave me  
Were the wounds that would heal me  
And we'd be like the moon and sun  
And when our courtly dance had run  
Its course across the sky  
Then together we would lie  
And out of the confusion  
Where the river meets the sea  
Something new would arrive  
Something better would arrive  
I was brought to my senses  
I was blind but now that I can see  
Every signpost in nature  
Said you belong to me

Seven weeks have passed now since she left me  
And she shows her face to ask me how I am.  
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me,  
Maybe I could come and babysit sometime.  
  
She says "Are you ok? I was worried about you,  
Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."  
I said "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm so happy, I'm laughing through my tears."  
  
I saw a friend of mine. He said "I was worried about you,  
I heard she had another man. I wondered how you felt about it"  
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
Saw my lawyer, Mr. Good News  
He got me joint custody and legal separation.  
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
I can't stop crying, I'm laughing through my tears,  
I'm laughing through my tears.  
  
I took a walk along last night, I looked up at the stars,  
To try and find an answer in my life.  
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him,  
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife.  
Something made me smile, something seemed to ease the pain,  
Something 'bout the universe and how it's all connected.  
  
The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream.  
We try to do the best within the given time.  
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that,  
What can a father do but babysit sometimes.  
  
I saw that friend of mine, he said "you look different somehow."  
I said "everybody's got to leave the darkness sometimes."  
I said, "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears."  
  
"I'm so happy that I can't stop crying,  
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears."

He looked beneath his shirt today  
There was a wound in his flesh so deep and wide  
From the wound a lovely flower grew  
From somewhere deep inside  
He turned around to face his mother  
To show her the wound in his breast that burned like a brand  
But the sword that cut him open  
Was the sword in his mother's hand  
  
Every day another miracle  
Only death will tear us apart  
To sacrifice a life for yours  
I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart  
The blood of the Lazarus heart  
  
Though the sword was his protection  
The wound itself would give him power  
The power to remake himself  
At the time of his darkest hour  
She said the wound would give him courage and pain  
The kind of pain that you can't hide  
From the wound a lovely flower grew  
From somewhere deep inside  
  
Every day another miracle  
Only death will keep us apart  
To sacrifice a life for yours  
I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart  
The blood of the Lazarus heart  
  
Birds on the roof of my mother's house  
I've no stones that chase them away  
Birds on the roof of my mother's house  
Will sit on my roof someday  
They fly at the window, they fly at the door  
Where does she get the strength to fight them anymore  
She counts all her children as a shield against the rain  
Lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain  
  
Every day another miracle  
Only death will keep us apart  
To sacrifice a life for yours  
I'd be the blood of the Lazarus heart  
The blood of the Lazarus heart

When you're down and they're counting  
When your secrets all found out  
When your troubles take to mounting  
When the map you have leads you to doubt  
When there's no information  
And the compass turns, yeah to nowhere you know well  
  
Just let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
He'll guide you well  
  
When the doctor failed to heal you  
When no medicine chest can make you well  
When no counsel leads to comfort (leads to comfort)  
When there are no more lies they can tell  
No more useless information and the compass spins  
The compass spins between heaven and hell  
  
Just let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
He'll guide you well  
  
And your eyes turn towards the window pane  
To the lights upon the hill  
The distance seems so strange to you now  
And the dark room seems so still  
  
Let your pain be my sorrow  
Let your tears be my tears too  
Let your courage be my model  
That the north you find will still be true  
Oh, when there's no more information  
And the compass turns, the compass turns  
To nowhere that you know well  
  
Let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you upon your way  
  
(Let your soul guide you)  
Let your soul  
When your down, let it come to you  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you  
Be your guidance, yeah  
When your secret all found out  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul  
When there's no  
Affirmation, let your soul, let your soul

In the empire of the senses  
You're the queen of all you survey  
All the cities all the nation  
Everything that falls your way  
There is a deeper world than this  
That you don't understand  
There is a deeper world that this  
Tugging at your hand  
Every ripple on the ocean  
Every leaf on every tree  
Every sand dune in the desert  
Every power we never see  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Swelling in the world  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
Feel it rising in the cities  
Feel it sweeping over land  
Over borders, over frontiers  
Nothing will its power withstand  
There is no deeper wave than this  
Rising in the world  
There is no deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
All the bloodshed all the anger  
All the weapons all the greed  
All the armies all the missiles  
All the symbols of that fear  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Rising in the world  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Listen to me girl  
At the still point of destruction  
At the center of the fury  
All the angels all the devils  
All around us can't you see  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Rising in the land  
There is a deeper wave than this  
Nothing will withstand  
I say love is the seventh wave

Fatal fascination for the seedy part of town  
Walk down the street and your head spins round  
Don't be seen alone without your friends at night  
Take a gun or a knife to the low life  
  
Don't have to be born into this society  
Pay for love but the hate comes free  
Bring enough money for the rest of your life  
Don't bring your wife to the low life  
  
Bringing us there to the degredation  
Always keep your back to the wall  
No rewards for your infatuation  
Low life  
No life at all  
  
Yeah, low life, low life  
In here to long to be afraid anymore  
You can't reach the bed so you sleep on the floor  
You get so stoned you think you could fly  
But you won't get high on the low life  
  
Low life, low life  
Low life, low life  
Low life, low life  
Low life, low life

Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh  
Another lonely day, with no one here but me, oh  
More loneliness than any man could bear  
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
A year has passed since I wrote my note  
But I should have known this right from the start  
Only hope can keep me together  
Love can mend your life but  
Love can break your heart  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
Walked out this morning, don't believe what I saw  
Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore  
Seems I'm not alone at being alone  
Hundred billion castaways, looking for a home  
  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I'll send an s.o.s. to the world  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
I hope that someone gets my  
  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
Message in a bottle, yeah  
  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s.  
Sending out at an s.o.s...

Well it's five in the morning and the light's already broken  
And the rainy streets are empty for nobody else has woken  
Yet you turn towards the window as he sleeps beneath the covers  
And you wonder what he's dreaming in his slumbers  
  
There's a clock upon the table and it's burning up the hour  
And you feel your life is shrinking like the petals of a flower  
As you creep towards the closet you're so careful not to wake him  
And you choose the cotton dress you bought last summer  
  
There's a time of indecision between the bedroom and the door  
But the part of you that knows that you can't take it any more  
There's the promise of the future in the creaking of the floor  
And you're torn if you should leave him with a number  
  
And in your imagination you're a thousand miles away  
Because too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So you write it in a letter all the things you couldn't say  
And you tell him that you're never coming home  
  
She starts running for the railway station praying that her calculation's
right  
And there's a train just waiting there to get her to the city before night  
A place to sleep a place to stay will get her through another day  
She'll take a job she'll find a friend she'll make a life that's better  
  
The passengers ignore her just a girl with an umbrella  
And there's nothing they can do for her, there's nothing they can tell her  
There's nothing they could ever say would change the way she feels today  
She'd live the life she'd always dreamed if he had only let her  
  
Now in her imagination she's a million miles away  
When too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all the things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I wake up in an empty bed a road drill hammers in my head  
I call her name there's no reply it's not like her to let me lie  
It's time for work it's time to go but something's different I don't know  
I need a cup of coffee I'll feel better  
  
I stumble to the bathroom door, her make up bag is on the floor  
It really is a mess this place it takes some time to shave my face  
I'm not really thinking straight she never lets me sleep this late  
I'm almost done and then I see the letter  
  
In his imagination she's a universe away  
Too many of his promises got broken on the way  
So she wrote it in a letter all things she couldn't say  
And she told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home,  
She told him she was never coming home  
  
I'm gonna live my life  
And she told him she was never coming home  
I'm gonna live my life in my own way

I can't stand it for another day  
When you live so many miles away  
Nothing here is gonna make me stay  
You took me over, let me find a way  
  
I sold my house  
I sold my motor, too  
All I want is to be next to you.  
I'd rob a bank  
  
Maybe steal a plane  
You took me over  
Think I'm goin' insane  
What can I do  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
I've had a thousand girls or maybe more  
  
But I've never felt like this before  
But I just don't know what's come over me  
You took me over, take a look at me  
What can I do  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
I saw my doctor he said give it time  
I got this feeling, gonna lose my mind  
  
When all it is is just a love affair  
You took me over baby, take me there  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you

Lay my head on the surgeon's table  
Take my fingerprints if you are able  
Pick my brains, pick my pockets  
Steal my eyeballs and come back for the sockets  
Run every kind of test from a to z  
And you'll still know nothin' 'bout me  
Run my name through your computer  
Mention me in passing to your college tutor  
Check my records, check my facts  
Check if I paid my income tax  
Pore over everything in my c.v.  
But you'll still know nothin' 'bout me  
You'll still know nothin' 'bout me  
You don't need to read no books on my history  
I'm a simple man, it's no big mystery  
In the cold weather, a hand needs a glove  
At times like this, a lonely man like me needs love  
Search my house with a fine tooth comb  
Turn over everything 'cause I won't be home  
Set up your microscope, and tell me what you see  
You'll still know nothin' 'bout me  
You'll still know nothin' 'bout me  
You'll still know nothin' 'bout me etc.  
You'll still know zip a-bout me  

Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
  
We thank you, father in heaven  
Who sings all young songs of love  
Let us bow before the Messiah  
Jesus, save us from the darkness of human hearts  
Help us to understand the purpose of Your pain and suffering  
Help us to see the beauty of the least of Thy creatures  
Impart on us thy infinitely complex mercy  
And limit the trespassers!  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
  
Through the pain and anguish  
Bring those who bear hate closer to Thy gentle creation  
Reach out ,o Lord, in Thy holy mercy,  
And catch this innocent young girl,  
The loveliest of Thy peoples  
She cried out in the long dark night of her soul  
And we who love her on this earth  
Can neither hear nor understand!  
Only you, o God!  
Only You can once again present to her  
The warmth of a joyous life,  
An innocent world,  
A sunshine of laughter,  
And the grace of Jesus Christ!  
Only You!  
  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you  
Only you  
Only you  
Only you, you, you, only you

Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Those days are over  
You don't have to sell your body to the night  
Roxanne, you don't have to wear that dress tonight  
Walk the streets for money  
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right  
  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light  
Put on the red light, oh  
  
I loved you since I knew ya  
I wouldn't talk down to ya  
I have to tell you just how I feel  
I won't share you with another boy  
I know my mind is made up  
So put away your make up  
Told you once I won't tell you again it's a bad way  
  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light  
You don't have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light, put on the red light

In Europe and America there's a growing feeling of hysteria.  
Conditioned to respond to all the threats  
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets.  
MIster Krushchev said, "We will bury you."  
I don't subscribe to this point of view.  
It'd be such an ignorant thing to do  
If the Russians love their children too.  
How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?  
There is no monopoly on common sense  
On either side of the political fence.  
We share the same biology, regardless of ideology.  
Believe me when I say to you,  
I hope the Russians love their children too  
  
There is no historical precedent  
To put the words in the mouth of the president?  
There's no such thing as a winnable war,  
It's a lie we don't believe anymore.  
Mister Reagan says, "We will protect you."  
I don't subscribe to this point of view.  
Believe me when I say to you,  
I hope the Russians love their children too  
We share the same biology, regardless of ideology.  
But what might save us, me and you,  
Is if the Russians love their children too

If somebody up there likes me somebody up there cares  
Deliver me from evil save me from these wicked snares  
Not into temptation not to cliffs of fall  
On to revelation and lesson for us all  
  
She walked into the room on the arm of my best friend  
I knew whatever happened our friendship would end  
Chemical reaction desire at first sight  
Mystical attraction turned out all my lights  
  
The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye  
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die  
  
I don't know if it's pain or pleasure that I seek  
My flesh was all too willing, my spirit guide was weak  
I was deadly certain his thoughts for me weren't kind  
A switchblade in his pocket, murder on his mind  
  
Blessed St. Theresa the whore of Babylon  
Madonna and my mother all rolled into one  
You've got to understand me, I'm not a piece of wood  
Francis of Assisi could never be this good  
  
  
The less I need the more I get  
Make me chaste but not just yet  
It's a promise or a lie I'll repent before I die  
  
The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye  
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die  
The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye  
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die  
  
Relax, have a cigar, make yourself at home.  
Hell is full of high court judges, failed saints.  
We've got Cardinals, Archbishops, barristers, certified accountants, music
critics,  
They're all here.  
You're not alone, you're never alone. Not here you're not.  
Okay, break's over.  
  
The less I need the more I get  
Make me chaste but not just yet  
It's a promise or a lie I'll repent before I die  
  
The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye  
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die  
The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye  
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die

Finding the world in the smallness of a grain of sand  
And holding infinities in the palm of your hand  
And Heaven's realms in the seedlings of this tiny flower  
And eternities in the space of a single hour  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your love into the distant dawn  
  
Inside your mind is a relay station  
A mission probe into the unknowing  
We send a seed to a distant future  
Then we can watch the galaxies growing  
  
This ain't no time for doubting your power  
This ain't no time for hiding your care  
You're climbing down from an ivory tower  
You've got a stake in the world we ought to share  
  
You see the stars are moving so slowly  
But still the earth is moving so fast  
Can't you see the moon is so lonely  
She's still trapped in the pain of the past  
  
This is the time of the worlds colliding  
This is the time of kingdoms falling  
This is the time of the worlds dividing  
Time to heed your call  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your precious love into some distant time  
And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing  
Send your love  
Send your love  
  
There's no religion but sex and music  
There's no religion but sound and dancing  
There's no religion but line and color  
There's no religion but sacred trance  
  
There's no religion but the endless ocean  
There's no religion but the moon and stars  
There's no religion but time and motion  
There's no religion, just tribal scars  
  
Throw a pebble in and watch the ocean  
See the ripples vanish in the distance  
It's just the same with all the emotions  
It's just the same in every instance  
  
There's no religion but the joys of rhythm  
There's no religion but the rites of Spring  
There's no religion in the path of hate  
No prayer but the one I sing  
  
Send your love into the future  
Send your precious love into some distant time  
And fix that wounded planet with the love of your healing  
Send your love  
Send your love  
  
There's no religion but sex and music  
There's no religion that's right or winning  
There's no religion in the path of hatred  
Ain't no prayer but the one I'm singing  
  
Send your love  
Send your love

"Seven days" was all she wrote  
A kind of ultimatum note  
She gave to me, she gave to me  
When I thought the field had cleared  
It seems another suit appeared  
To challenge me, woe is me  
Though I hate to make a choice  
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly  
Well we'll see  
I don't think she'd bluff this time  
I really have to make her mine  
It's plain to see  
It's him or me  
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday  
If I make up my mind  
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind  
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait  
But Sunday'd be too late  
The fact he's over six feet ten  
Might instill fear in other men  
But not in me, The Mighty Flea (flee?)  
Ask if I am mouse or man  
The mirror squeaked, away I ran  
He'll murder me in time for his tea  
Does it bother me at all  
My rival is Neanderthal it makes me think  
Perhaps I need a drink  
IQ is no problem here  
We won't be playing scrabble for her hand I fear  
I need that beer  
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday  
If I make up my mind  
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind  
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait  
But Sunday'd be too late  
Seven days will quickly go  
The fact remains, I love her so  
Seven days, so many ways  
But I can't run away  
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday  
If I make up my mind  
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind  
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait  
But Sunday'd be too late  
Do I have to tell a story  
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met  
It's a big enough umbrella  
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Sister moon will be my guide  
In your blue blue shadows I would hide  
All good people asleep tonight  
I'm all by myself in your silver light  
I would gaze at your face the whole night through  
I'd go out of my mind but for you  
I'd go out of my mind but for you  
  
Lying in a mother's arms  
The primal root of a woman's charms  
I'm a stranger to the sun  
My eyes are too weak  
How cold is a heart  
When it's warmth that he seeks?  
You watch every night, you don't care what I do  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
I'd go out of my mind, but for you  
  
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun  
My hunger for her explains everything I've done  
To howl at the moon the whole night through  
And they really don't care if I do  
I'd go out of my mind for you  
  
Sister moon

When we set out on this journey  
There were no doubts in our minds  
We set our eyes to the distance  
We would find what we would find  
We took courage from our numbers  
What we sought we did not fear  
Sometimes we'd glimpse a shadow falling  
The shadow would disappear  
But our thoughts kept returning  
To something the boy said  
As we turned to go  
He said you'll never see our faces again  
You'll be food for a carrion crow  
  
Every step we took today  
Our thoughts would always stray  
From the wind on the moor so wild  
To the words of the captain's child  
Something the boy said  
  
In the circles we made with our fires  
We talked of the pale afternoon  
The clouds were like dark riders  
Flying on the face of the moon  
We spoke our fears to the captain  
And asked what his son could know  
For we would never have marched so far  
To be food for a crow  
  
Every step we took today  
Our thoughts would always stray  
From the wind on the moor so wild  
To the words of the captain's child  
Something the boy said  
  
When I awoke this morning  
The sun's eye was red as blood  
The stench of burning corpses  
Faces in the mud  
Am I dead or am I living?  
I'm too afraid to care, I'm too afraid to know  
I'm too afraid to look behind me  
At the feast of the crow  
We spoke our fears to the captain  
And asked what his son could know  
For we would never have marched so far  
To be food for a crow

Late at night in summer heat. Expensive car, empty street  
There's a wire in my jacket. This is my trade  
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid  
I can hot wire an ignition like some kind of star  
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car  
So I whisper to the engine, flick on the lights  
And we drive into the night  
  
Oh the smell of the leather always excited my imagination  
And I picture myself in this different situation  
I'm a company director, two kids and a wife  
I get the feeling that there's more to this one's life  
There's some kind of complication, he tells her he's alone  
Spends the night with his lover, there's a trace of her cologne  
And the words of his mistress, as she whispers them so near  
Start ringing in my ear  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could its, what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid form the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  
  
I imagine his wife, she don't look nothing like a fool  
She picks the kids up form some private school  
She remembers what he told her, he was late and worked alone  
But there's more than a suspicion in this lingering cologne  
And the kid's just won't be quiet and she runs a traffic light  
And she drives into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  
  
So here am I in a stolen car at a traffic light  
They go form red to green and so I just drive into the night  
  
Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own  
You promised one day we could it's what you said on the phone  
I'm just a prisoner of love always hid from the light  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight

Well in a hundred years from now  
They will attempt to tell us how  
A scientific means to bliss  
Will supersede the human kiss  
A sub atomic chain  
Will maybe galvanize the brain  
A biochemic trance  
Will eliminate romance  
But why ever should we care  
When there are arrows in the air  
Formed by lovers' ancient art  
That go straight to my heart  
A future sugar coated pill  
Would give our lovers time to kill  
I think they're working far too much  
For the redundancy of touch  
But what will make me yours  
Are a million deadly spores  
Formed by lovers' ancient art  
That go straight to my heart  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
You'll never have to sweep the floor  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Come and be my wife  
I'll be true. To no one but you  
If it's a future world we fear  
We have tomorrow's seeds right here  
For you can hold them in your hand  
Or let them fall into the sand  
But if our love is pure  
The only thing of which we're sure  
Then you can play your part  
And go straight to my heart  
If I should seek immunity  
And love you with impunity  
Then the only thing to do  
Is for me to pledge myself to you  
But they only dealt one card  
So for me it is not hard  
You're the bright star in my chart  
You go straight to my heart  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
You'll never have to sweep the floor  
Come into my door  
Be the light of my life  
Come into my door  
Come and be my wife  
I'll be true. To no one but you

Southern trees bear Strange Fruits  
Blood on the leaves, blood at the roots  
Black (belly's) body's swinging in the southern reek  
Strange fruit hanging from the popular tree.  
  
Past star will sing from the gallon south  
Bulging eyes and a twisted mouth  
Send up magnolia, sweet and fresh  
And the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is the fruit for the crows to pluck  
For (but) the rain to gather for the wind to suck  
For the sun to rot for the tree to drop  
Here is the strange and bitter crop.

My sisters and I  
Have this wish before we die  
And it may sound strange  
As if our minds are deranged  
Please don't ask us why  
Beneath the sheltering sky  
We have this strange obsession  
You have the means in your possession  
  
We want our tea in the Sahara with you  
We want our tea in the Sahara with you  
  
The young man agreed  
He would satisfy their need  
So they danced for his pleasure  
With a joy you could not measure  
They would wait for him here  
The same place every year  
Beneath the sheltering sky  
Across the desert he would fly  
  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
  
The sky turned to black  
Would he ever come back?  
They would climb a high dune  
They would pray to the moon  
But he'd never return  
So the sisters would burn  
As their eyes searched the land  
With their cups full of sand  
  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you

Mercury falling  
I rise from my bed  
Collect my thoughts together  
I have to hold my head  
It seems that she's gone  
And somehow I am pinned by  
The hounds of winter  
Howling in the wind  
  
I walk through the day  
My coat around my ears  
I look for my companion  
I have to dry my tears  
It seems that she's gone  
Leaving me too soon  
I'm as dark as December  
I'm as cold as the man in the moon  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
It's easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They follow me down  
  
I can't make up the fire  
The way that she could  
I spend all my days  
In the search for dry wood  
Board all the windows and close the front door  
I can't believe she won't be here anymore  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
It's easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They follow me down  
  
A season for joy  
A season for sorrow  
Where she's gone  
I will surely, surely follow  
She brightened my day  
She warmed the coldest night  
The hounds of winter  
They got me in their sights  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
It's easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They harry me down

It's all there in the gospels, the Magdalene girl  
Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl.  
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled,  
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold.  
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight,  
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light.  
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill,  
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still.  
  
"Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?"  
"Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!  
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon,  
And I have to be there before daybreak.  
Oh I canna be missing, the lads'll expect me,  
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?  
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail,  
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale,  
May the angels protect me if all else should fail,  
When the last ship sails."  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers,  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears,  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea,  
And the last ship sails.  
  
It's a strange kind of beauty,  
It's cold and austere,  
And whatever it was that ye've done to be here,  
It's the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears,  
When the last ship sails.  
  
Well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east,  
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast,  
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest,  
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased,  
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least,  
When the last ship sails.  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers,  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears,  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea,  
And the last ship sails.  
  
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done,  
And whatever the station in life you've become.  
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,  
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun,  
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun,  
When the last ship sails.

After all the jacks are in their boxes  
And the clowns have all gone to bed  
You can hear happiness  
Staggering on down street  
Footprints dressed in red  
And the wind whispers Mary  
  
A broom is drearily sweeping  
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life  
Somewhere a Queen is weeping  
Somewhere a King has no wife  
And the wind it cries Mary  
  
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow  
And shine their emptiness down on my bed  
The tiny island sags downstream  
'Cause the life they'd lived is dead  
And the wind screams Mary  
  
Will the wind ever remember  
The names it has blown in the past  
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom  
It whispers "No, this will be the last"  
And the wind cries Mary

We rode all night across an endless desert  
We had no moon to light our way  
And though a billion stars were slowly turning  
We lacked the consciences to pray  
Our horses running like devil chasers  
Those feet they hardly touched the ground  
Yes, I'm familiar with the grey wolves howling  
But I'm certain I never heard this sound  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray this cowboy song  
It's all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
Your distant sun  
Your shining light  
You'll be my dog star shining  
Tonight  
I've been the lowest of the low on the planet  
I've been a sinner all my days  
And I was living with my hand on the trigger  
I had no sense to change my ways  
The priest asked if I'd embrace the resurrection  
To suck the poison from my life  
Just like an existential cowboy villain  
His words were balanced on my knife  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray  
This cowboy song  
It's all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
Your distant sun  
Your shining light  
You'll be my dog star shining  
Tonight  
Every night  
Every night  
All my distances afar  
This cowboy song  
It's all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
This cowboy song  
This cowboy life  
I'll be your dog star shining  
Tonight  
Dog star...
