When I woke up today  
And thought of all the things You'd done  
I find myself here  
Feeling oh so overcome  
  
You gave Your life away for me  
Truly my heart belongs to You  
So let me say  
  
Could I ever thank You for  
What You did at Calvary  
When You bled and died for me  
How could I ever turn away  
Knowing that You paid the price  
That I could never pay  
  
When I think of the way  
That You died upon that Cross  
Bearing my sin  
Even though my heart was lost  
  
You gave Your life away for me  
Truly my heart belongs to You  
So let me say  
  
Could I ever thank You for  
What You did at Calvary  
When You bled and died for me  
How could I ever turn away  
Knowing that You paid the price  
That I could never pay

Wondrous mystery, in the pages of history,  
Of a man who bled and died for me,  
Its more than a story, He' s the one who hung up on a tree,  
His crimson flow poured out for me,  
Gave His life to set my free  
  
[Chorus:]  
I fall down, I fall down,  
And I fall down on my knees,  
And cry holy is the Lord  
Worship him, worship him and adore  
  
Wondrous mystery, in the pages of history,  
Of a man who bled and died for me  
Its more than a story, he' s the one who hung up on a tree  
His crimson flow poured out for me  
Gave his life to set me free  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
I cry holy, I cry holy is the Lord X5

When i feel low your words ring true  
Its not by might or in my strength  
But its by your spirit moving in my life  
'Cause God you are my life

Sinking sand  
I'm thankful that it's you the solid rock on  
Which i stand

Why I'm so different  
Why I'm not the same as everybody else  
Well something changed

Jesus came in he came into my life  
And I know I never felt so good.

I can see the angels gathering  
'Round the Throne to bring an offering  
Of praise to the King of all Kings  
It's Jesus  
I can hear their voices singing loud  
Bringing anthems in a glorious cloud  
Of praise to the King of all Kings  
It's Jesus  
Nations will join and men confess  
Declaring Your holy righteousness  
Giving their hearts, their lives, their all  
To the King of Glory  
Mountains declare and oceans roar  
All of creation stands in awe  
Join with them now in one accord  
Holy is the Lord  
All of the angels stand and sing  
The anthem of heaven loudly rings  
Hear them proclaim this offering  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord

Here I stand  
Before you my heart is still  
Wanting just to be with you  
Waiting here  
Long for your voice to speak  
Touch me now  
Its your face I seek  
  
How my soul longs for you  
To be with you  
Adore you  
Nothing more I want to do  
Than to sing to you  
  
Jesus I'm in love with you  
Speak to me  
Whisper you words of truth  
Take my heart  
Won't you make me new  
Jesus, how I love you  
How I love you  
  
On my knees  
Before you I lay my life  
Giving all  
A living sacrifice  
Take my life  
And all that I long to be  
Set apart  
Only for you my king  
  
How my soul longs for you  
To be with you  
Adore you  
Nothing more I want to do  
Than to sing to you  
  
Jesus I'm in love with you  
Speak to me  
Whisper your words of truth  
Take my heart  
Won't you make me new  
Jesus, how I love you  
How I love you  
  
How my soul longs for you  
How my soul longs for you  
How my soul longs for you

I need Your power to come and change me  
Your Spirit lives in me  
I wanna dance for all to see

What can separate me from Your Love  
I need You in my life  
I'm never letting go  
Of all the things You've said  
I'm holding on 'cause You promised me that  
You'd never leave  
You're always by my side  
You'll never let me go  
So I'm holding on 'cause I know that I need You

I was no one when I first met you  
I had nothing of worth in my life  
But then I found you and it all became clear  
You're the one that I've been searching for  
From the start I couldn't figure it out  
Why someone like you would die for me  
But I know that your love for me is so great  
And that is why I'm giving you my life  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
I can't believe that you're with me 'til forever  
I'll never leave you and you'll never leave me  
It's what I long for your presence here in my life  
Cause you're the air I breathe my reason why  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
  
I am yours every part of me  
Jesus you're the reason I live  
Take my life lord and use me as you will

Since I've found your love  
I've never needed anything to fill my heart  
Even when I fall  
You're always there with open arms to pick me up  
From the start I knew  
No one else could make me feel the way you do  
Everyday I want to grow  
Just a little bit closer, just a little bit closer  
I want to be a reflector  
I want to shine with your glory  
I want to let the whole world know that you're  
Living in me  
I want to burn with your fire  
Shine my light a little brighter  
I want to let the whole world know that  
Jesus Lives in me

No mountain too high  
No valley too low  
That You cannot overcome  
  
No problem too great

Sometimes its hard to keep the smile upon my face  
It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down

When everything starts crashing down  
When all I know falls to the ground

Just when I think that I've got it figured out  
You open my eyes and let me see that there's no doubt  
But you've got it all within the power of your hand  
It seems like the more I know the less I understand  
  
When everything starts crashing down  
When all I know falls to the ground  
When darkness comes and I can't see  
You're always there to rescue me

Walking down the road called life  
Thinking how my world has changed  
Since i met the saving grace  
of the man they called Jesus Christ  
  
He's not just an ordinary guy  
He is supernatural in all ways  
He's not just in my imagination  
He is real in everyway  
  
I will stand in awe  
I will stand in awe  
  
Worship the King of Glory  
Open up the doors, lift up the gates  
The King of Glory, may He enter in  
May His power fall, may His glory fill  
All the earth  
  
People come and people go,  
Something's in and then it's out  
One thing that remains the same  
Is the Love I've found Jesus Christ

Your faithfulness never fails  
Your faithfulness everyday  
You're the same  
  
Unfailing love sets me free  
Unfailing love you lead me  
With your hand  
  
And all I know  
With your arms around me  
Your face is all that I seek  
Your love and grace  
Pick me up and hold me  
You alone are holy  
  
For you alone are great in power  
  
You alone are my strong tower  
And I will lift my heart and soul  
To worship you alone  
  
For you alone are my desire  
You have set my heart on fire  
And I will lift my heart and soul  
To worship you alone  
Worship you alone  
  
And I will follow after you  
For you are my desire  
Oh jesus, my heart belongs to you

Lord, I come into Your presence.  
Here I stand in awesome reverence,  
Falling before the wonder of Your Name.  
Humbly now, Lord, I surrender.

Take all I am and use me, Lord, I pray.  
  
Make me what You want me to be  
Teach me Your ways

Throw down my crowns before You.
