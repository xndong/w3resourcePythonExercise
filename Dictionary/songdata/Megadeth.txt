Grinding my teeth, white knuckles grasp at the wheel  
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feel  
As quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seat  
It doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speed  
  
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8, 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle, hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line  
  
My hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampede  
I fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns green  
In a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayers  
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air  
  
Supercharged, strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8, 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle, hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line

It was a cool winter's morning  
Somewhere shortly past 9:00 AM  
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming  
So instead they went for the bank  
  
The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car  
Heavily sedated with thousands of round  
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons  
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
Baptized in a firefight  
Hot blood running cold as ice  
Forty four minutes of target practice  
All hell's breaking loose  
Outgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife  
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel  
And brought down the beast!!!  
  
This was an accident waiting to happen  
It wasn't if it would happen, it was when  
The city's people sabotaged themselves  
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense  
  
The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped  
Standard police issue guns were just not enough  
But SWAT arrived to settled the fight  
Between AK-47 and AR-15  
  
[Chorus: x2]

If I see the morning hours  
I'll have one more yesterday  
Take life from tomorrow  
'Cause I've burned out my today  
  
If I get up to the top I know  
I'll just go back downhill  
Gotta' terminal future  
And it's time to write my will  
  
Down another glass of courage  
And a shot of Thorazine  
  
[Chorus]  
We're not ready to see you yet  
99 ways to die  
We're not ready to see you yet  
  
Gotta' short between the earphones  
Wringing my hands in dismay  
A more efficient maniac  
With two feet in the grave  
  
Ain't got no last words to say  
Yellow streak right up my spine  
The gun in my mouth was real  
And the taste blew my mind  
  
In a black tie and straight jacket  
Man I'm gonna try again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Demitasse of arsenic  
Try on this tie  
Never mind the tree  
  
There is only death and danger  
In the sockets of my eyes  
A playground of illusion  
No one plays they only die  
  
There's a prison in my mind  
And the bars are gonna break  
I'm as mad as a hatter  
And strung out just the same  
  
Taunting rigor mortis  
I feel it draw me in

We all know about the hate you're breeding  
And we pay for the machine you're feeding  
You can never shut up, you can never shut down  
This house divided...  
  
(We all know, we all know, something's wrong, we all know)  
  
Something's wrong about the way you're thinking  
The rats are jumping, and your ship is sinking  
You can never get on, you can never get off  
This house divided...  
  
We all hear about this case you're pleading  
Your demands have gone beyond conceding  
You can never get in, you can never get out  
This house divided...  
  
This is a sad day for violence  
When speech results in silence  
I'm supposed to hate you  
You're supposed to hate me  
We can never agree  
  
[Solo: Chris]  
  
Now we've become so desperate  
Don't you forget you asked for it!  
I'm supposed to hate you  
You're supposed to hate me  
We never agree  
  
[Solo: Chris]  
  
[Solo: Dave]  
  
We all know about the hate you're breeding  
And we pay for the machine you're feeding  
  
A house divided...

There's a secret place I like to go  
Everyone is there but their face don't show  
If you get inside you can't get out  
There's no coming back, I hear them shout  
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place  
How I arrived I can't explain  
You're welcome to, if you want to stay  
But everyone just runs away  
Let me in, get me out  
Can't do more than twist and shout  
Lost my soul without a trace  
Found it again in my secret place  
In disgrace  
I hide from those that try to find me  
Scary things that's right behind me  
I lost myself, I must confess  
I can't explain how I got this mess  

I thought a desires worth any pleasure,  
Can never really be a sin in vain  
One hundred and one shots of opportunity,  
I'd gladly take them all again and again and again  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
I promised on my soul, not to get carried away  
It always starts on psychedelic, and then it turns to black  
My head starts swaying, I forgot what was that I was saying  
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back  
  
I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt  
I fell from grace with deep regret  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
My angel's left me, sorrows are my own  
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own  
On my own  
  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see  
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me  
  
Just like a churchyard shadow, craving after me  
There's nothing left to see, there's nothing left of me

Walking stiff let me tall ya'  
Better left for dead  
And now we are on a mission  
Well it's full speed ahead  
My legion's when we do the crime  
Let's get one thing straight  
To get there early is on time  
And showing up on time is late  
Ladies and gents, we're still alive  
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time  
Angel in our pocket, devil by our side  
We ain't going nowhere, 'cuz heroes never die  
Still alive  
Blood of heroes  
Never die  
They never die  
We've been run down every hill  
Chased up all the dead end streets  
But if you try to cut us out  
You'll get a kick in the teeth  
Ladies and Gents, we're still alive  
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time  
Fasten up you head belts,  
Time to ride the skies  
It's time to be immortal, 'cuz heroes never die  

Ain't got no job  
Ain't got no smoke  
Ain't got a car  
His life's a joke  
Living on the skids  
Thinks the world's just fine  
Forgot what he did  
Dancing on the breadline  
No one there to bind him  
Nothing to remind him  
Nowhere left to find him  
About to lose his lifeline  
He's dancing on the breadline  
Forgot who he is  
Forgot who he was  
Used to call the shots  
Now he can't connect the dots  
A mover and shaker  
Getting closer to his maker  
Lower than a hemline  
Dancing on the breadline  
No one there to bind him  
Nothing to remind him  
Nowhere left to find him  
About to lose his lifeline  
He's looking for a headline  
Sniffing up the white lines  
He's dancing on the breadline  
Watch him dance  
About to lose his lifeline  
He's looking for a headline  
Sniffing up the white lines  
He's dancing on the breadline  
About to lose his lifeline  
He's dancing on the breadline  
No one, nothing, nowhere  
Dancing on the breadline  
He forgot and he ain't got nothing  

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
  
Listen, I didn't start this believe me, I will finish it  
You called down the thunder too late now there's no way out  
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
  
There is no retreating I will cut you down to size  
You will beg for mercy a bad seed, you're as good as dead  
Yield to new dimension Hell's coming, better say your prayers  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?  
What do you think your fists are for?  
  
One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside  
Final retribution torture and pure punishment  
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits  
Fear not as death surrounds you  
Bitch all you want, but here it comes  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?  
What do you think your fists are for?

Pounding in my teeth  
Hydraulics on the move  
Kicking in my face  
Savage bucking mule  
  
Pummeling my soul  
100 tons of lead  
Trampled under foot  
Steamrollers on my head  
  
Crushing down, caving in my will to live  
I'd rather be dead, scream insane  
To have the bullprick split their guts  
Make them pay make them bleed  
  
On your backs, in your face  
Down your throats, up your ass  
Bullprick!  
  
Pulverizing flesh, broken bones the aftermath  
Can't escape the war, the war machine path  
All become one, flattening the streets  
Cry for absolution, splitting at the seams  
  
Crushing down, caving in my will to live  
I'd rather be dead, scream insane  
To have the bullprick split their guts  
Make them pay make them bleed  
  
On your backs, in your face  
Down your throats, up your ass  
Bullprick!  
  
On your backs, in your face  
Down your throats, up your ass  
Bullprick!

I've got a sickening feeling  
My life is standing still  
It's clear that fate is closing in  
But this is the life I choose  
I've got so much time to kill  
Born to lose, I'll die to win  
  
Burn, baby burn 'cause it feels so good  
  
I'm getting on my own nerves  
And I get no satisfaction  
Till I light it up and burn it down  
One match lights my fire  
And it starts a chain reaction  
That burns my crooked past to the ground  
  
Burn, baby burn 'cause it feels so good  
Burn, baby burn like I knew it would  
Fire, I've got the fire  
Fire, burning desire my desire to burn  
  
I hear the darkness call  
The sirens are growing near  
It's time I make my great escape  
The flames are getting tall  
Inside my rear view mirror  
Just a spark is all it takes

You give up on yourself  
Somehow you got betrayed again  
Thin ice and luck runs out  
Who will you blame it on this time?  
  
Due to lack of interest in you  
The light at the end of the tunnel  
Was turned off  
And something I noticed  
Beating you is thrilling me  
I've got a secret for you  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
Don't close your eyes to injustice  
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit  
A man without any valor  
Has nothing worth living for  
  
Due to lack of interest in you  
The light at the end of the tunnel  
Was turned off  
And something I noticed  
Beating you is thrilling me  
I've got a secret for you  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time  
  
If you took your own direction  
If only you practice what you preach  
If you follow your advice  
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

He said he'd try just a little bit  
He didn't want to end up like them  
And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder  
Pounding on the door to make the next score  
  
Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it  
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul  
  
Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell  
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell  
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies  
His cause of death, high speed on burnt ice  
  
Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man  
Memories of his family are calling after him  
He can hardly thing, hardly walk  
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk  
With just one hit the pain would go away  
But he's dead if he does  
  
Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes  
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows

You doubt your strength or courage  
Don't come to join with me  
For Deth surely wants you  
With sharp and pointy teeth  
An animal so vicious  
No others fought and won  
So on the fields of battle  
We are the chosen one  
Human bones blanket the dirt  
of the heathens lair  
That we must pass this den of deth  
  
The only path from here  
But I walk in the light  
The time to die has come  
No one shall take my life  
I'm of the chosen ones  
Black shadows till the sky  
As the creatures eyes grow near  
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims  
High into the air  
Heavens powers fill my arms  
Onward now to fight I'm sent  
Oh the beast is coming  
To put you to the test  
  
Lookout!  
Now this land is mine to pilage  
Rape, and steal, and take at will  
Never let you cross this path  
I reign, for now, I say to Kill

Hollow deeds and human death and torture hit men hard  
In a rhetoric of equals  
No such things as hell, not heaven, continues,  
The code of annihilation confronts with social attack  
As the flames of death are filled with brains in flux intact  
No one would ever die too soon  
Before the beginning of the baby boom  
And before the beginning of an era in gubernatorial rhetoric  
The rules of death and brutal attack while most men rise from the sick  
The mortal path of greed and demonic inaction  
Is about to be destroyed by demons attacking each other's adoration  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
And now, let demonic combat reign intact  
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout  
But it is not every male human being's fault  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
And now, let demonic combat reing intact  
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout  
But it is not every male human being's fault  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction

And today, I leave you  
But I'll be back someday  
And as I fly away  
My hope is that we'll meet again  
I'm off to my home away from home  
I will miss you  
But I know  
I know you know  
  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
  
I'll take you everywhere I go  
I'll show you everything I see  
And as we say so long  
I know your tears wish me well  
It won't be long till I'm back again  
We will meet again  
We will meet again  
You will see, oh  
  
I'm coming home to Arizona  
I'm coming home

Endangered species, caged in fright,  
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight.  
The stage is set, now pay the price.  
And ego boost, don't think twice.  
Technology, the battle's unfair,  
You pull the hammer without a care.  
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,  
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...  
The hunt is canned  
All are gone, all but one.  
No contest, nowhere to run.  
No more left, only one.  
This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction  
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare.  
The skin and trophy, oh so rare.  
Silence speaks louder than words.  
Ignore the guilt and take your turn.  
'Liars' anagram is "lairs,"  
Man you were never even there.  
Killed a few feet from the cages,  
Point blank, you're so courageous...  
So courageous  
"One hour from now,  
Another species of life form  
Will disappear from the face of the planet  
Forever... And the rate is accelerating."  

Thermal count is rising in perpetual writhing  
The primordial ooze and the sanity they lose  
Awakened in the morning to more air-pollution warnings  
Still we sleepwalk off to work as our nervous systems jerk  
Pretending not to notice how history has forbode us  
With the greenhouse in effect our environment was wrecked  
Now I can only laugh as I read our epitaph  
We end our lives as moles in the dark of the dawn patrol

Come now my lovely, won't you  
Take a midnight stroll with me?  
Through the misty air the things  
I keep I shouldn't dare  
  
My garden's so inviting, and its  
Deadly blooms are hiding  
Be careful what you touch  
'Less the grave is what you lust  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Each night at midnight  
Dating back into the fog of time  
Another victim falls  
The things I've done, the voices call  
  
The Hourglass runs out on us  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
The killers must be fed, the soil is red  
Now that you're dead  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Delirium, your burning throat  
Mania, your heart rate soars  
Hallucination, you're losing your mind  
Suffocation, cannot breathe, you're going blind  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Deadly nightshade  
Deadly nightshade  
Nightshade, nightshade

The light that fill my lonely cell,  
Is blocked out by the key,  
That locks the door to this hell,  
The place they wanted me.  
Time's racing like the wind,  
Execution's near.  
Oh Lord, I wait for death,  
And yes, I have no fear.  
I recall that night, my every breath,  
And step along the way.  
Closed my eyes, walking,  
As danger paved the way.  
The devil and the darkness  
Let her evil wander free.  
And here on Devil's Island,  
The final stop for me.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Oh there's no escape,  
The sea is full of sharks.  
The tides take you way  
And smash you on the rocks.  
The sun is shining,  
But feel not today,  
Its warmth, it's dying,  
And fading away.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Oh hear the call,  
From the grave beyond  
Oh so pernicious,  
Her soul could, it creates song.  
As there is no man that is  
Here upon the earth,  
Able to terminate our  
Noisome will since birth.  
The priest that reads the sermons,  
Is walking next to me,  
To the stake, my last request,  
To have her burn with me.  
But so it did, the heavens opened,  
Rain began to fall.  
The final judgment came.  
And was spread before you all.  
Final Judgment!  
Old, weak, and feeble,  
But the lesson taught to me,  
To stay away from evil,  
She doesn't care for me.  
She haunts me in my sleep,  
Though I tore that page away.  
And here on Devil's Island,  
I'll always have to stay.  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  
Here I am  
Devil's Island! Devil's Island!  

Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today  
The more insatiable the sex, the more swelled our tongues became  
As prehistoric as this seems, this is now, today  
Talkin' about no vision, talkin' about no dream  
The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks  
I look above and see entrails in the sky  
This one ain't over until the fat lady dies  
One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast  
Ten Diadems to crown them all  
World religion at his feet  
Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come  
So run my child and hide your face  
Once you've been marked you're finished, one  
You've become one!  
You're mine!  
You're one.  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away  
Vengeance is mine!  
Vengeance is mine!  
The Netherworld and Sheol and never satisfied  
So the eyes of man are never satisfied  
I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away  

Behind closed doors all you live for is taking  
That double life of yours has left your whole world shaking  
Who are you fooling? I know you hear the laughter  
Don't you hear people talking? What is it that your after?  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
The key to save yourself if for nothing else  
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden  
With a broken heart underneath all of the pain  
Do you stroke the pretty scars? The hurt never ends  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect  
  
Turn off your conscience  
Leave the world outside  
Nothing at all can ever make you feel  
That anything's so real so you just  
Disconnect

Let me introduce myself I'm a social disease  
I've come for your wealth leave you on your knees  
No time for feeling sorry, I got here on my own  
I won't ask for mercy, I choose to walk alone  
  
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught?  
What if there is no judgment?  
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked  
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind  
  
You built walls to protect you so no one will infect you  
Pursued by those out there that vanish in thin air  
Come a long way to find what you really left behind  
You don't know when the end is but it's coming fast  
  
What's yours is mine and what's mine is mine too  
If you shake my hand better count your fingers  
  
What if I do get caught?  
What if there is no judgment?  
If I'm right I lose nothing, if you're right I lose it all  
I ought to get caught because I'm doing something wicked  
I'm guilty haunted by my fear and the only consequences  
Are dread and the fugitive mind

Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes  
I hope the end is less painful than my life  
I stand on trial before the gods  
On Judgment Day  
A blink of an eye between  
The cradle and the grave  
One last look at visions of flesh  
The last best hope of man on earth  
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands  
The world don't want to be saved  
Only left alone  
Elysian Fields...  
We are storming the heavens  
To raise our swords and shields  
We ascend to our destiny  
To the Elysian Fields  
Soaring to the sun  
With blood upon their wings  
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind  
Man still has one belief,  
One decree that stands alone  
The laying down of arms  
Is like cancer to their bones

Attention! Attention!  
All citizens are ordered to report to their District detention centers!  
Do not return to your homes,  
Do not contact anyone!  
Do not use any cellular or G-P-S devices!  
Surrender all weapons at once!  
Attention! This way to the camps!  
  
I woke up in a black FEMA box  
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin  
My dreams are all nightmares anymore  
And this is what I dream every night  
  
The Leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States  
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A  
Without the R-F-I-D chip, you're just an illegal alien  
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order  
  
This is the end of the road, this is the end of the line  
This is the end of your life, this is the  
  
A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops  
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours  
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die, the clock is  
Ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour  
  
I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned  
I had to bleed, inside the day yard  
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm  
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore  
  
The Ex-President signed a secret bill that can  
Land a legal US Citizen in jail and the  
Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights  
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!  
  
Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat by the  
Tyranny of Mind control, for the mark of the beast  
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved  
Believe me when I say, this is the endgame!

Forgotten things remembered  
The tigers eat their young  
The body stayed but inside the head  
The mind was on the run  
Conspiracy of silence  
The only way out of pain  
Is turn around and run through it man  
Too wet to come in from the rain,  
Tell them...  
I know they were doing it to you  
But don't try doing it to me  
Let me show you, how I love you  
It's our secret, you and me  
Let me show you how I love you  
But keep it in the family tree...  
The secret of the family tree  
When you hear them saying "Trust me"  
Don't wait to see what's next  
Thrown to the wolves  
Forever trusting  
Raised in a form of living Hell  
Sing a one note song of rage  
Live and die within your heart  
So beware in the shadows  
Your family tree waits in the dark  
I say...  

You don't know what I feel, I get behind the wheel  
A fuel in my soul  
I hyperventilate as I accelerate  
Till I've lost all control  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and disaster  
  
My supersonic machine  
Get out of my  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain, this is my domain  
Addicted to the fast lane  
  
I look into mirror, red lights are drawing nearer  
They think I've met my match  
But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear  
You can't jail what you can't catch  
  
My speed becomes relentless  
And testing all my senses  
White line appearing faster  
Prompting death and d-d-disaster  
  
I hear the engines screaming  
I'm burning up the  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane  
Addicted to the fast lane  
Rushing to my brain  
No time to explain, this is my domain  
Fast lane  
  
Fast lane, like a jet plane  
Like a freight train, this is my domain  
D-d-domain

Looking for a cure within the human race  
Eliminate the poor, how much longer will it take  
Burning up the tents of the rank and file  
Exterminate their lives, crack a demon smile  
Crushing down, caving in our will to live  
Getting rid of man's mistakes  
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down  
How much more can we take  
Fight for freedom, fight authority  
Fight for anything, my country tis' of me  
Cry for absolution, it's not the end for me  
A last minute pardon, one final reprieve  
Resist the war machine, don't get in its path  
Fight to die a free man and reap the aftermath  
Crushing down, caving in our will to live  
Getting rid of man's mistakes  
To take a lost life, lock it up, break it down  
I don't know how much more I can take  
Fight!... It's my country  

Bestow upon me knowledge  
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise  
I want to rule my kingdom  
Make sweet the breeze, not once defiled  
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists in velvet gloves of sin  
Parade the grey-robed monks, the vestal virgins  
And wheel the wyvern's in  
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage  
Let me be the protege of five magics  
  
Give me alchemy!  
Give me sorcery!  
Give me wizardry!  
Thermatology!  
Electricity!  
  
Master all of these  
Magic if you please  
Bring him to his knees  
I master five magics  
Possessed with hellish torment  
I master magics "5"  
Hunting the abyss lord  
Only one will stay alive  
He who lives by the sword will surely also die  
He who lives in sin will surely live the lie

Rise so high, yet so far to fall  
A plan of dignity and balance for all  
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high  
More borrowed money, more borrowed time  
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race  
Means to an end ended in disgrace  
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
barren land that once filled a need  
Are worthless now, dead without a deed  
Slipping away from an iron grip  
Nature's scales are forced to tip  
The heartland cries, loss of all pride  
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried  
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
Now with new hope some will be proud  
This is no hoax, no one pushed out  
Recieve a preieve and bea pioneer  
Break new ground of a new frontier  
New ideas will surely get by  
No deed, or divident  
Some may ask, "Why?"  
You'll find the solution, the answer's in the sky  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
Rise so high, yet so far to fall

More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Sands in the hourglass fall for us all  
You don't answer me anymore when I call  
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain  
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain  
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,  
You forget to remember  
  
If this is living, what the hell is living for?  
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door  
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face  
You can't recall me at all,  
There's not a trace, not a trace, not a trace  
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,  
You forget to remember  
  
I just want to talk  
What do you want?  
But you've nothing to say  
Leave me alone  
I beg you to come  
Get away from me  
And you just walk away  
I have no idea who you are!  
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray  
  
A burning candle in-between and at both ends  
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend  
I just wish you could say my name again  
  
They made the lock and broke the key,  
The culprit was the mercury  
The vaccine wipes your memories,  
Till you forget even how to breathe  
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive  
  
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye  
The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes  
Day after day after day the world will pass you by  
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie  
  
You forget to remember it's time to say the long goodbye

(Gears of war, gears of war, gears of war, gears of war)  
(Gears of war, gears of war, gears of war, gears of war)  
  
Ethnic cleansing with no defending  
These acts of genocide  
A fatal ending with no surrendering  
To cover up the crimes and lies  
  
Smart bombs, precision guided armament  
A more sophisticated way to end up dead  
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons  
That kill each other like the gears of war  
(Gears of war, gears of war)  
Ho-rah!  
(Gears of war, gears of war)  
  
When you ride with thieves, then you die with thieves  
Cross my heart and hope that you die (that you die)  
When the smoke has cleared, the devil's in the mirror  
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die!  
  
Smart bombs, precision guided armament  
A more sophisticated way to end up dead  
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons

Welcome to our fortress tall  
Take some time to show you around  
Impossible to break these walls  
For you see the steel is much too strong  
Computer banks to rule the world  
Instruments to sight the stars  
  
Possibly I've seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much  
  
Foreign life forms inventory  
Suspended state of cryogenics  
Selective amnesia's the story  
Believed foretold but who'd suspect  
The military Intelligence  
Two words combined that can't make sense  
  
Possibly I've seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much

Mamas pack their lunches, kiddies pack their guns  
Wishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done  
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies  
We the people, point our fingers, blame and wonder why  
Face it and fight or turn high tail and run  
'Til it comes back again like the rising sun  
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie  
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try  
There's no recess and no rules in the school of life  
I f you listen very closely you will see what it's like  
Have cool, will travel  
Tell myself it ain't true, they just cannot see  
Grown up or sewn up, the medicine is worse than the disease  
I have cool, will travel  
Here we go  

Time to take your last walk in this world  
Before your journey begins underground  
But not before we torment you from your  
Cell straight to hell with a short detour in-between  
  
Begging for mercy, all alone  
Unable to handle the pressure  
Before his mortification, now let the torture begin  
  
Death by the head crusher, Head Crusher!  
  
The horrific torture device  
For those who fail interrogation  
The most painful technique ever known  
People thirst for the worst, the skull's disintegration  
  
Beaten, broken, in bloody rags  
Adding insult to injury, he recants  
But it's much too late, now let the torture begin  
  
Death by the head crusher, Head Crusher!  
  
On your knees, prisoner, take your position  
Place your chin forward into the restraints  
Your head slowly caves in from the compression  
You faint in a blackout from the infernal pain  
  
Twisting, turning the giant screw  
Your teeth are breaking loose  
Crushed and splintering into your mouth  
  
Winding down, cutting through  
Like broken glass being chewed  
The fragmented skull and shattering bones  
There's nothing you can do

Do it if you dare  
Leaping form the sky  
Hurling through the air  
Exhilarating high  
See the earth below  
Soon to make a crater  
Blue sky, black death  
I'm off to meet my maker  
Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge  
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure  
Up here in the air, this will never hurt  
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt  
Paralyzed with fear  
Feel velocity gain  
Entering a near  
Catatonic state  
Pressure of the sound  
Roaring through my head  
Crash into the ground  
Damned if I'll be dead  
Jump or die!  
Dropping all my weight  
Going down full throttle  
The pale horse awaits  
Like a genie in a bottle  
Fire in my veins  
Faster as I go  
I forgot my name  
I'm a dirt torpedo  
High speed dirt...  

A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes.  
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies.  
A little man with a big eraser, changing history  
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees.  
  
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue.  
Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you.  
  
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was.  
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws.  
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules.  
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools.  
  
You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway?  
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?  
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come.  
I believe my kingdom will come.  
  
F is for fighting, R is for red,  
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed.  
E, we elect them, E, we eject them,  
In the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  
D, for your dying, O, your overture,  
M, they will cover your grave with manure.  
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,  
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.

This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me,

Put your hand right up my shirt,  
Pull the strings that make me work,  
Jaws will part, words fall out,  
like a fish with hook in mouth.

I ain't superstitious,  
When a black cat crosses my path.  
And, I ain't superstitious,  
As I break the looking glass.  
Ain't afraid of no demons,  
Don't make me laugh!  
I ain't superstitious,  
Under the ladder I go.  
I ain't superstitious,  
It's all bullshit, don't you know!  
Ain't afraid of the shadows,  
I like the dark anyway, and that's a fact!  
Superstitious  
  
I ain't superstitious,  
No such thing as bad luck.  
I ain't superstitious,  
I couldn't really give a fuck.  
Take your stupid superstitions,  
And find some other paranoidal,  
Chickenshit, sissy, worm, and, tell it to him.  
Superstitious

Broken down, feeling naked  
Leaving me unfulfilled  
Promising compromise  
Championing mediocrity  
  
Time and time again  
What you said ain't what you mean  
Even if all my bones are broken  
I will drag myself back from the edge to  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the King  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the  
King,  
I am the King, God save the King  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead  
I am the King, Long live the King  
Kill the King, The King is dead  
I am the King, Long live the King  
  
I reveal a deceiver  
In the highest seat in the land  
His idle hands the Devil's workshop  
Generate more smoke than heat  
  
Time and time again  
What you said ain't what you mean  
Even if all my bones are broken  
I will drag myself back from the edge to  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the King  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the  
King,  
I am the King, God save the King  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead  
I am the King, Long live the King  
Kill the King, The King is dead  
I am the King, Long live the King  
  
A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain  
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust  
An explosion of the Brain, an explosion of the  
Brain  
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust  
  
Kill the King, The King is dead, Long live the  
King,  
I am the King  
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live  
the King,  
I am the King  
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live  
the King,  
I am the King  
Kill the King, I, The King is dead, I am, Long live  
the King,  
I am the King

Sitting up, late at night  
I tiptoe through the darkness  
Cold as hell, black as spades  
Aware of my immediate surrounding  
In my place I escape up into my hideout  
Hiding from everyone  
My friends all say,  
"Dave you're mental anyway" hey!  
Drift into a deeper state  
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways  
Dirt grits between my feet  
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak  
Hypnosis guides my hand  
I slipside through the walkways  
Sit in granny's rockin' chair  
Memories are whirling by, yeah  
Reminisce in the attic  
Lucretia waits impatiently  
Cobwebs make me squint  
The cobra so eloquently glints  
Moonbeams surge through the sky  
The crystal ball's energized  
Surely that like the cat waiting  
Lucretia rocks away

Anonymous existence, rendered useless to mankind  
Destroy the logic volume in the confines of the mind  
En massed and purposeless, marching in a perfect line  
Neo-neuro torture, mental meltdown, a heinous crime  
Mastermind, I tell you what to think  
I tell you what you need  
I tell what to feel  
Invade the core of souls to wipe the lives away  
Design vacant beings, welcome the inhuman race  
Encrypted horror codes, directive psyche overwrite  
Processing brains to pabulum  
Delete and format living drives  
I tell you what's real  
Hail to the power age, lest the viral hour comes  
Raise the flag of voltage, bow to circuitry unknown  
Kneel before the processor, lords of static laugh  
Electrons in submission, you must know who I am  
I tell you what to think  
I don't care what you thought  
I tell you what to get  
I don't care what you got  
Mastermind  
I don't care what you got  
Mastermind  
Mastermind  
Mastermind

Responsibility, an anchor around my neck  
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck  
Accountability, I live from check to check  
Volatility, neglect and no respect  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"  
  
One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train  
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again  
  
Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere everybody is a  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho  
  
You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean  
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean  
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between  
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene  
  
Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat  
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"  
  
One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train  
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho  
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road  
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho  
Time and time and time again I'm a  
Moto Psycho  
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby  
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour  
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

I will give you life  
You'll serve only me  
And my will to kill  
You will kill for me  
  
All that I desire  
All that I command  
You are here for me  
I'm your master  
  
My creation  
  
I will make for you  
A soul mate to love  
Unlike your love for me  
And you will take my name  
  
She will be your bride  
She will serve me too  
And I will introduce you to  
The Bride of Frankenstein

The flag that I once planted as a king I abandoned  
And now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my name  
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own  
Blood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it  
  
Drink from the chalice and be reborn  
And the land with me, it will change and transform  
  
A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget  
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath  
Good and evil, there never is one without the other, his brother  
Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders  
  
The futures taken root in the present son  
Don't look into my heart, least of all your own  
  
No man who is false can win in combat against the truth  
When he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lost  
Hearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet done  
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled  
  
Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings  
The Necromancer's hard teachings of war and quest  
  
I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice  
I have lived through others for far too long,  
And carried my guilt, my causes, my sins  
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future  
That I can be just a man

My life's on time but again my sense is late.  
Feel a might unsteady but I still have to play.  
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes.  
And once again I gamble with my very life today.  
Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam.  
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream.  
Your life is like a trigger, never troubled till you're squeezed.  
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease.  
Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin.  
Load another bullets, now the second round begins.  
A couple grains of power, a couple grams of lead.  
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head.  
Take another drink and raise the last bets.  
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said.  
A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail.  
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill.  
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still.  
Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill.  
Add another bullet, the third round begins.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
Please, no IOUs no markers for death.  
Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play?  
You, you! Next victim! You, next to die.  
You, you! Next victim! You, next to die.  
You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!  
You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!

Father time, I'm running late  
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired  
Seconds drift into the night  
The clock just ticks till my time expires  
You were once my friend  
Now I know I can't tie your hands  
The days I saved I couldn't spend  
They fell like sand through the hourglass  
No time to lose, no time to choose  
Time taking time, it's taken mine  
Scenes of my life seem so unkind  
Time chasing time creeps up behind  
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one  
Not even me  
An enemy I can't defend  
My final place a deadly end  
Life's just a speck in space  
Dreams of an eternal resting place  
I can't get any younger  
Time has brutal hunger  

Lost in a dream  
Nothing is what it seems  
Searching my head  
For the words that you said  
Tears filled my eyes  
As we said our last goodbyes  
This sad scene replays  
Of you walking away  
My body aches from mistakes  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
Time and again  
She repeats let's be friends  
I smile and say yes  
Another truth bends,  
I must confess  
I try to let go, but I know  
We'll never end 'til we're dust  
We lied to each other again  
But I wish I could trust  
My body aches of mistakes  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
God help me please, on my knees  
Betrayed by lust  
We lied to each other so much  
That in nothing we trust  
How could this be happening to me  
I'm lying when I say, "Trust me"  
I can't believe this is true  
Trust hurts  
Why does trust equal suffering  
Absolutely nothing we trust

I heard somebody fixed today  
There was no last goodbyes to say  
His will to live ran out  
I heard somebody turned to dust  
Looking back at what he left  
A list of plans and photographs  
Songs that never will be sung  
These are the things he won't get done  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands  
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
Just one shot to say goodbye  
One last taste to mourn and cry  
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim  
Just one shot to do him in  
He hangs his head and wonders why  
Why the monkey only lies  
But pay the pauper, he did choose  
He hung his head inside the noose  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands  
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man  
Cryptic writings on the wall, the beginning of the end  
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in my hand  

Internal combustion  
Multiple personalities  
Terror inside of me  
A mask of silent agony  
Curse the falling rain  
The vortex of pain  
As medieval as Merlin  
A pact for power was made  
Lucifer in transition  
It's time the price was paid  
Scorching the domain  
The vortex of pain  
A telestic message  
Written in torment  
Howl out dirges  
Like the horns of Jericho  
Distorted faces  
Writhing in rage  
Walls of purgatory  
Tumble down  
Endless death  
The jewels of a crown  

As sure as the sun rises in the east  
Another gunman will come seeking my defeat  
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still  
Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone  
As I ride into the sunset to take another town  
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down  
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns  
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone  
A drum beats for me, it's louder every day  
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day  
Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come  
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun  
The game I play has caused a lot of grief  
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand  
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land  
I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land  
I got wanderlust  

Secret bureaucracy, it's just a lie  
The devil's henchmen, in suit and tie  
A sacred brotherhood, an ancient rite  
Politicians and the double lives they hide  
  
Violate your rights, no more equality  
Surrender freedom, your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust, in revolution we die  
  
Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves  
The land of liberty needs a regime change  
Until you no longer know right from wrong  
The constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on  
  
Violate your rights, no more equality  
Surrender freedom, your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust, in revolution we die  
  
In revolution we die  
  
Screams from the future, warn of calamity  
The coming plagues of the new disease  
The illuminati, one world currency  
One world religion, one world everything  
  
Violate your rights, no more equality  
Surrender freedom, your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust, in revolution we die  
  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust, in revolution we die  
  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

No hears a word I say  
And my prayers are never answered  
But you'll never see the pain inside of me  
Stabbing me over and over and over  
I trusted you and I loved you  
And you spit back in my face  
How could you do this to me?  
When will you stop trying to hurt me?  
  
I've walked a minefield for you  
A career in hell with you  
I have made it through the things  
Others would surely die just watching  
And the oath I take on this day  
Is to know that you will be repaid  
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl  
Until then, until I see your world implode  
I wish you death and suffering  
Misery to spare  
Time to release your pain  
Face the last enemy  
I am the last thing you will know  
The last thing you will see  
I see your death surrounding me  
I know you, yes I do  
I know you  
  
When no words are spoken and please are ignored  
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?  
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard  
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?  
  
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies  
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life  
  
When judgement has failed you  
When your own heart's impaled you  
Your wandering mind has destroyed you  
Will you ever know when?  
  
When you give everything and the feeling is gone  
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?  
When you take everything and you stay too long  
When there's nothing left, did you take enough?  
  
It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies  
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life  
  
When judgment has failed you  
When your own heart's impaled you  
Your wandering mind has destroyed you  
Will you ever know when?

Uuu you're just in time  
Come get inside my head  
Uuu the war of words  
You're underneath my skin  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know what's best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than a price  
When are you gonna pay?  
  
You only point out fault  
An anxiety attack  
You're a nay you mouth  
You stab me in my back  
  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know what's best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than the price  
When are you gonna pay?  
  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
Got so much more than the price  
When you gonna pay?  
  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey, just whose life is this anyway? x3

It doesn't matter what car you drive, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter where you go to work  
Doesn't matter where you go to church  
Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it  
  
My bleached bones in the desert, it's all she's left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker  
  
It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter how you live your life  
Doesn't matter anymore to your wife  
Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too  
  
Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker  
  
Doesn't matter where you live  
Doesn't matter what you drive  
Home wrecker  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker

When someone becomes nothing to anyone  
Whilst feelings have died  
Anyone would know it  
They set out stick and stones  
They say they'd crush my bones  
I say, I don't get mad, I get even  
Before they do  
  
Spoils go to the victor  
I'm dead on time  
Your time is going to come  
  
[Chorus]  
One day I'll dance on your graves  
Even if you're buried at sea  
Till then, till when I exact my revenge  
I'll tell them, "you're dead to me"  
  
We're all just trying to hold on to anything  
You'd think they'd know that's what we're trying to do  
These wounds are invisible  
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars  
But then when things got bad, we spread our wings and fly away  
  
You'll take all of your riches in the back of a hearse  
Your time is going to come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day I'll dance on your graves  
Even if you're buried at sea  
Till then, till when I exact my revenge  
  
[Chorus]

Who'd believe with the way things are here  
We'd be going anywhere telling people how to live?  
Who'd believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns  
Than to educate our sons? Sorry but that's what they did  
I can't help but think,  
Someone's forsaken you and me  
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains  
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things  
I've stepped over a lot of bodies on my way  
Thanks for the information don't need no more anything  
We are the damned of all the world with sadness in our hearts  
The wounded of the wars, we've been hung out to dry  
You didn't want us anyway and now we're making up our minds  
You tell us how to run our lives, we run for Youthanasia
