You see me sitting here  
A smile upon my face  
The time has come but you know that it's not too late  
There's been too many things  
Together we have seen  
It's not that hard if we start to believe  
And we're not gonna take anymore  
Can we try to erase all the pain  
So please  
  
[Chorus]  
Show me a reason, give me a sign  
Tell me the way we fall out of line  
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find  
The answer to our life  
  
This world is not at ease  
We seem to hide the truth  
Thinking there's only so much we can really do  
It's up to you and me  
To fix our destiny  
The jury's here, so let's take the stand  
And we're not gonna take anymore  
Can we try to erase all the pain  
So please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So tell me why we have to cry (and not try)  
When there's so many things we can do  
To help this troubled world start anew  
  
I need a reason, I need a sign  
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side  
Is it today or maybe tonight, we'll find  
The answer to our life  
  
Show me the way  
Give me a sign  
Tell me the way we fall out of line  
Is it today, is it tonight  
The answer to our life  
  
[Chorus]

[Nick:]  
There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again  
Just when I'm trying to get over you  
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend  
A day without you  
  
[AJ:]  
Now you've carved out a life  
But I wear the scars  
Reminding me by the hour  
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are  
I wish I could but  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't imagine it any other way  
A world without you is only wasted space  
You're gone and I'll always wonder  
Why it can't be any other way  
Any other way  
  
[Brian:]  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
How am I supposed to feel?  
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life  
Tell me it's not real  
  
[Repeat Chorus 2x]  
  
[Howie:]  
Like we never had a falling out  
Like the tears had never hit the ground  
Like you're still here  
You're still here  
  
[Brian:]  
Since you drained all the color out of the sky  
  
[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine  
I'm leavin' my life in your hands  
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind  
Risking it all in a glance  
And how you got me blind is still a mystery  
I can't get you out of my head  
Don't care what is written in your history  
As long as you're here with me  
  
I don't care who you are  
Where you're from  
What you did  
As long as you love me  
Who you are  
Where you're from  
Don't care what you did  
As long as you love me  
  
Every little thing that you have said and done  
Feels like it's deep within me  
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run  
It seems like we're meant to be  
  
I don't care who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from (where you're from)  
What you did  
As long as you love me (I don't know)  
Who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from (where you're from)  
Don't care what you did  
As long as you love me (yeah)  
  
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows  
But I guess it shows  
When you look into my eyes  
What you did and where you're comin from  
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby  
  
I don't care who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from (where you're from)  
What you did  
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)  
Who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from (where you're from)  
Don't care what you did (yeah)  
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)  
Who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from  
What you did  
As long as you love me  
Who you are (who you are)  
Where you're from (where you're from)  
As long as you love me  
Who you are  
As long as you love me  
What you did (I don't care)  
As long as you love me

Understand girl that my heart is in your hands  
And I'm cautious of fallin' in love again  
Please don't hurt me...  
I'm scared  
Don't desert me  
I'm afraid of being a fool again  
  
Chorus  
Baby I'm yours if you want me  
(If you want my love)  
Baby I'm yours if you need me  
Lovin' you forever if you want me  
(Give me your love)  
Baby I'm yours if you need me  
  
Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn  
So watch your step girl  
Because my heart is weak and worn  
So won't you please be careful I'm fragile  
I can't imagine the damage  
I'll have to handle  
If you hurt me one more time  
Please be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey baby I finally found someone  
That I can depend on  
I just want you to know  
That I'm your sweetheart...  
Hey someone that you can depend on...  
Don't you ever go nowhere, baby  
  
Chorus

t's not that I can't live without you  
It's just that I don't even want to try  
Every night I dream about you  
Ever since the day we said goodbye  
If I wasn't such a fool  
Right now I'd be holding you  
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do  
Baby if I only knew  
  
[Chorus]  
The words to say  
The road to take  
To find a way back to your heart  
What can I do  
To get to you  
And find a way back to your heart  
  
I don't know how it got so crazy  
But I'll do anything to set things right  
'Cause your love is so amazing  
Baby you're the best thing in my life  
Let me prove my love is real  
And made you feel the way I feel  
I promise I would give the world  
If only you would tell me girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me one more chance, to give my love to you  
'Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do,  
tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I turn back time  
To make you mine  
And find a way back to your heart  
I beg and plead  
Fall to my knees  
To find a way back to your heart  
  
[Chorus]

How can I begin to  
Tell you what you do to  
Me every time I hear ya  
More willing to wanna see ya  
  
I know that there's no use in  
Tryin' to explain the confusion  
But still I'm not complainin'  
'Bout my situation  
  
Let's not talk about a  
Possible ending  
  
The very first time that I  
Was lookin' to be your fellow  
I found my inspiration  
Hidin' in your expression  
So I put myself on forward  
For your consideration  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's not talk about a  
Possible ending  
Let's not think about it  
Every day  
And I know  
I'm so  
In love  
With you  
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath  
Every time I'm near  
My beautiful woman  
  
And so we put the top down  
To take you drivin' downtown  
I guess we'll know just what to do  
When you're lookin' to fool around  
  
It's too late to stop me  
I know we're gonna get down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
My beautiful woman  
  
B is for beautiful as the sunshine  
E tells me everything is feelin' alright  
A goes to  
You and me swingin' it down  
T is two  
I want you  
You've got me actin' like a fool  
  
[Chorus:]

Some say that love isn't fair  
But they don't know you and me  
And when they tell me that love doesn't last alone  
That's when I look at you  
And it's alright just let me lead you  
  
[Chorus:]:  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end(yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
That I can...  
  
Time cannot tear us apart  
Were stronger than yesterday  
And though we've traveled so far  
You're still close to me  
Love changes everything  
And know that it's alright  
Just let me lead you (let me lead you)  
(Yeah)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
Your my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end (yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
  
Through the peaks and the valleys  
Your not alone  
And when the world's upside down you know I'm there  
And anytime I feel afraid that's when I look at you  
  
With the best that I can  
I will love you(will love you) the very best I can  
The best that I can  
With every breath I take  
From this moment till the very end  
I'm gonna love(gonna love you) the best that I can  
The best that I can  
  
It's ok if you close your eyes  
I'll be standing by your side  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
You're my heart and your my best friend  
And I promise till the end (yeah)  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can  
  
I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you the best that I can

First off I can't keep a promise  
I'm no one to count on at all  
Add on that I'm a coward  
Too scared to return your call  
  
[Chorus]  
But you don't care  
You keep sticking around  
While I'm acting a clown  
You're bigger, than me  
La la la la la la  
'Cause you're still here  
Your feet stuck to the ground  
Despite how silly it sounds  
You're bigger  
Than me  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
It's known that I'm a liar  
Often I'm blacker than white  
Add on my uncandid ego  
No ones less humbled than I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the messed up things I do  
Yeah I swear I'll make 'em up to you  
Before you're going heaven knows  
Just let me make it better  
I'll try and measure up  
I'll try and measure up to you  
Oh yeah,  
  
I'll make 'em up to you  
Oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just bigger than me  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la

[Chorus]  
Oh boys will be boys  
Oh boys will be boys  
  
You've got something so that incredible in my eyes,  
My heart (my heart) is stars to bumpin' whenever you around  
My whole world upside down baby  
But I try to get closer and you always push me away  
You tell me its much too soon, but I just can't help it  
I've always got to make a play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All my senses, going around you all the time  
And I invences, I've never going hope  
Always gotta lose control  
I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait  
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go  
  
I hear ya saying, that you think that we should wait  
And I can't hold on any more, my body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
My body's callin' for ya  
So please don't hesitate  
  
[Chorus]

The roses you left me slowly fading to grey  
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss  
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times  
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark  
Yeah we laughed and cried  
  
And I never knew alone wherever you are is home  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
  
Ooh I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings  
And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play  
  
And I never knew alone wherever you are is home  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
  
We're not over  
We're not over  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine  
And no I can't  
You know I can't breathe  
  
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe  
I can't breathe  
I can't breathe

Tonight I saw an eclipse of your smile within my own reflection  
On your look, so beautiful then  
A tear ran down my face, all my memories erase  
Oh, why'd you have to leave my side  
  
Oh, why do all the rivers flow into the ocean?  
And why does all the love in the world come strait from the heart?  
And why does all the pain I feel come from deep inside?  
Oh, all those questions I could have answered ... if you were by my side  
  
Maybe something mad e me look at you,  
Maybe something made me do what I had to do what I had to do  
Maybe something made me talk to you,  
Maybe something made me do what I should do  
  
I want you by my side  
(I want you by my side)  
(I want you by my side)  
  
Now everyday the pain I feel slowly fades away  
And all the memories of you and me are always here to stay  
What I'm asking, girl, is one more chance to let me in your life  
Oh, girl, if you give me one more chance ... then I could be right by your
side  
  
Maybe something made me look at you  
Maybe something made do what I have to do, girl  
Maybe something made me talk to you  
Maybe something made me do what I should do  
  
I want you by my side  
(I want you by my side)  
(I want you by my side)

Yeah, yeah, oh,  
Yeah, yeah,  
  
You should be right here laying next to me  
But baby you chose to love the hard way  
You could be right here getting the best of me  
But baby you decided he was your man  
  
And now that you're finding out  
He's playing little games, you calling me again  
You say you want me around  
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down  
So  
  
I think I wanna stay single  
Maybe we're better apart  
See I don't want a girl  
That, only wanna come back  
'Cause, some other man broke her heart  
  
So bye bye love  
Bye love  
So bye bye love (Bye love)  
Bye love  
Yeah  
  
Crazy how the tables turn  
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no.  
Saying there's no way that we can work (We can work)  
And you were quick to move on to the next thing  
Yeah.  
  
And now that you're finding out  
He's playing little games, you calling me again  
You say you want me around  
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down  
So  
  
I think I wanna stay single  
Maybe we're better apart  
See I don't want a girl  
That, only wanna come back  
'Cause, some other man broke her heart  
  
So bye bye love (Bye love)  
Bye love  
So bye bye love (Bye bye, bye bye love)  
Bye love (Bye bye, bye bye love.)  
Yeah.  
  
I can't take you back when I know (When I know)  
I'm not the one you really wanted before  
Sorry, that I let you go (Let you go)  
This time I think it's best to do it alone!  
  
Whoo, whoo, whooo, yeah (say goodbye to me love.)  
Whoo, whoo, let it go, let it go.  
  
Bye bye, bye bye love! (Love)  
  
I think I wanna stay single (I think I wanna stay)  
Maybe we're better apart (Maybe we're better apart)  
See I don't want a girl  
That, only wanna come back  
'Cause, some other man broke her heart  
  
So bye bye love (Said bye bye love)  
Bye love (Said bye bye love)  
So bye bye love (Bye, bye, bye, bye, girl)  
Bye love (Oh, bye bye love)  
  
I think I wanna stay single (I think I wanna stay)  
Maybe we're better apart (Maybe we're better apart)  
See I don't want a girl

(Say goodbye, bye, love) I'm saying goodbye to you

Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing infront of me  
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby  
Want to go?"  
  
I should've said no  
Someone's waiting for me  
But I got my coat, called and said  
  
Listen baby, I'm sorry  
Just want to tell you don't worry  
I will be late  
Don't stay up and wait for me  
I said again, your dropping out  
My battery is low  
Just so you know  
We're going to a place nearby  
Gotta go  
  
Now two is done, nothing's been won  
I can't take it back, what's done is done  
But what if my friends found out  
That she wasn't my only one  
And it eats me from inside  
That she's not by my side  
Just because I made that call, yeah  
  
Lemme tell you the story  
Bout the call that changed my destiny  
Me and my boys went out  
Just to end up in misery  
Was about to go home when  
There she was standing in front of me  
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby"  
Gotta go

You are the reason I wake up in the morning  
Lately I'm sleeping till two  
  
Sometimes I swear that you are lying here beside me

Still got the smell of your body on the pillow  
Still finding strings of your hair

There is something special  
About this time of year  
The Christmas feeling's everywhere  
I just got home  
To join You  
I've been away too long  
But now I'm back to share my love  
Friends are reunited  
One big family  
Filled with love to last  
Throughout the year  
  
[Chorus]  
Christmas time  
Time to share our love  
Come and joy  
The tidings to the world  
Christmas time  
The best time of the year  
Yes, it's Christmas time  
  
You and me together  
A sleigh ride in the park  
A loving kiss straight from my heart  
Straight from the heart  
Snowflakes are falling gently  
The smell of chestnuts in the air  
And Christmas lights they gleam  
Across the sky  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you remember?  
Everything felt so right  
When I held you close to me  
Do you remember?  
Those cold Christmas nights  
When we sewed the world in harmony  
  
Christmas time  
Time to share our love  
Come and joy  
The tidings to the world  
Christmas time  
Always the best time

Close your eyes, make a wish  
This could last forever  
If only you could stay with me now  
So tell me what it is, that keeps us from each other now  
Yeah, it's coming to get me  
You're under my skin  
  
[Chorus]  
No I can't let you go  
You're a part of me now  
Caught by the taste of your kiss  
And I don't want to know the reason why I can't stay forever like this  
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you  
  
Take my hand, take my life  
Just don't take forever  
And let me feel your pain kept inside (ohh yeah)  
There's gotta be a way, you and I together now  
Yeah it's comin' to get me  
You're under my skin  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's an illusion, how can I feel this way?  
(if I can't have you)  
It's an illusion, nothing is real this way  
(if I can't have you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't let you go, no  
And I don't want to know the reason why  
I can't stay forever like this (no no)  
Now I'm climbing the walls 'cause I miss (I miss you) you

My feet on the ground but I can't run  
Drowning the noise inside my head  
Who is this man that I've become  
It's killing me to see myself  
How do you learn how to forgive  
When deep down inside you can't forget  
With all that I regret  
And I pray for the first time in a long time  
The lies fade away  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
I'm alive  
I never was sure but now I am  
This was the choice I had to make  
Maybe I'll never understand  
Sometimes you've got to make mistakes  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
Finally I face it off  
I feel like I can let it show  
I know I can walk away  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
How do you know where to go when you go away  
  
When I close my eyes  
  
How do you know When it's over  
  
I see for the first time in a long time  
Believe me when I say  
  
Finally I'm waking up  
I feel like I can let you go  
Say everything I wanted to say  
I'm ok with being alone  
Finally I face it off  
I feel like I can let it show  
I know I can walk away  
I'm ok with being alone  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
When I close my eyes  
  
I'm alive

Ohhh no  
  
Everybody needs affection  
Looking for a deep connection  
So put a little bit of love in my life today  
Everybody needs some shelter  
Let's spend a little time together  
Come into my arms  
Let them tell you what I wanna say  
  
Color my world  
Draw on my heart  
Take a picture of what you think of love  
Looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul everything you know  
Use every word you ever heard  
To color my world  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
I've had enough of not believing  
Living life without a meaning  
I want something real  
And I feel it when I'm next to you  
Let's vow to have some love and devotion  
Winner to my heart's emotions  
Until the very end  
It's the place I'm gonna keep you in  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Color my world  
Draw on my heart  
Take a picture of what you think of love  
Looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul everything you know (no no)  
Use every word that you ever heard  
To color my world  
  
Color my world  
Yeah  
  
Let's make a world for you and me yeah  
That we're never gonna leave (yeahh)  
  
Color my world (why won't you color my world?)  
Draw on my heart (yeahh)  
Take a picture of what you think of love  
Looks like in your imagination  
Write on my soul (write on my soul) everything you know  
Use every word you ever heard  
To color my world (color my world)  
  
Oooh ooh (oh no no)

Oooh ooh (ooh ooh)  
Use every word you ever heard  
To color my world  
  
Everybody needs affection  
Looking for a deep connection  
Ohhh  
Color my world

Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you  
And baby I was wrong  
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone  
It was time that we moved on  
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.  
  
I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait  
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face  
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell  
Girl I know you're mad  
I can't blame you for being mad  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you  
  
If you could see these tears I'm crying  
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking  
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

Baby, can I talk to you?  
I know something's wrong  
Things just ain't the same  
But deep down inside  
I know you still care  
So tell me what to do  
To get things back  
The way they used to be  
  
If your words had meaning  
If you really cared about me  
Tell me why can't I find love in your heart  
If you were my lover  
A constant friend to me  
Tell me why  
Would you turn away from my love  
  
[Chorus]  
So darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right  
Darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right  
Darlin'  
Tell me what to do to make things right for love  
Tell me what to do to make things right for love (for love)  
  
If your words have reason  
When they won't turn away from me  
They're trying hard to hide all truth they might say  
If you listen to me girl  
If you know how I'm feeling inside  
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Can't you see?  
All I'm asking for  
Is a chance to let me love you  
Can't you see?  
Girl, you know with me  
Is where you should be  
And if by chance we should find  
That it can be for you and I  
Then girl I'll try  
I'll try  
Oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl, you should know how I feel by now  
There's so many ways to love  
So just open your heart  
And I'll find the way  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

Brothers fighting brothers  
Lovers fighting lovers  
People barely caring anymore  
Nations hating nations  
Love is lost in the equation  
Wondering why there is still so many wars  
  
It's like this whole world's caught in  
Some crazy storm  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us  
Find a solution to all this confusion  
  
Lives in desperation  
A world of devestation  
No one knowing where it's gonna go  
We got too many too hungry  
It's time to stop this suffering  
And I don't think we can do it on our own  
  
And right now we need something  
To save our souls  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us  
Find a solution to all this confusion (we sure could use some)  
  
Show us that our change is gonna come  
Help us to replace the hate with love  
Overflow our hearts with kindness  
Help us lift the clouds out of our way  
  
We could use some divine intervention  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us (yes, God are you listening)  
Find a solution to all this confusion  
  
Gotta find a way (X5)  
  
God, if you're listening, won't you help us?

Ooh that sounds good, why don't you turn that up  
Baby  
  
(Listen) Pay attention are you listening  
Hey you're my favorite girl  
Excuse me for a moment, I'm in another world  
On a mountain, by a fountain, flowers blooming everywhere  
With Venus and with Cupid, the pictures very clear  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
I say don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
Erotic whispers for the listener  
Let the music fill the air  
Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words  
By election you're perfection  
And as if these eyes would care  
Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change  
  
Baby over and over the passion starts again  
And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin  
Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live  
'Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
Bridge:  
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood  
Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off  
It's time for me and you  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
It's the feeling girl (repeat)

I never thought that I would lose my mind  
That I could control this  
Never thought that I'd be left behind  
That I was stronger than you, baby  
Girl if only I knew what I've done  
You know, so why don't you tell me  
And I, I would bring down the moon and the sun  
To show how much I care  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't want to lose you now  
Baby, I know we can win this  
Don't want to lose you now  
No no, or ever again  
  
I've got this feeling you're not gonna stay  
It's burning within me  
The fear of losing  
Of slipping away  
It just keeps getting closer, baby  
Whatever reason to leave that I've had  
My place was always beside you  
And I wish that I didn't need you so bad  
Your face just won't go away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that I would lose my mind  
That I could control this  
Never thought that I'd be left behind  
  
That I was stronger than you  
Don't want to lose to loneliness  
Girl I know we can win  
Don't want to lose to emptiness, oh no  
Never again  
  
[Chorus]

You hit me faster than a shark attack  
You saw my picture  
On the Backstreet's Back, alright  
And you were more than just a pretty face  
But how you fooled me, I'm still amazed baby  
But I should have known that I would be  
Another victim of your sexuality  
But now we're done and over with  
I don't want you back  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't want you back  
'Cause you're no good for me  
I know  
That's all I can say  
Don't want you back  
Forgive my honesty but you gotta go  
I don't want you back  
  
You started going out with so-called friends  
But I was blind and so I lost all common sense  
But there were things that made me realize  
Like all the hundred no, thousand lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, don't bother telling me your reasons why  
  
Just let us sing this story 'bout you and I  
Don't want you back  
That's all I know  
Don't want you back  
All I can say  
Don't want you back  
You know you gotta go  
  
[Chorus]

Ooh, yeah, yeah  
I've been walking around inside a haze  
Between the lines of reason  
Hiding from the ghost of yesterday  
Feels like I'm barely breathing  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain, feel the rain  
I've been losing days  
The shades pulled down  
I still can't face the sun  
But I, I'm going crazy  
I can't stay here  
I've gone completely numb  
I just wanna need someone  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain, feel the rain  
Oh no, I thought you were the only one  
But now I think I was wrong  
?Cause life goes on  
I've been walking around inside a haze  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the rain  
I, I wanna feel the rain again  
I, I wanna feel the water on my skin  
And let it all just wash away in a downpour  
I wanna feel the downpour, I wanna feel the rain  
In a downpour, feel the rain  
Feel the rain, oh, oh  
I wanna feel the rain  

Let me sleep  
For when I sleep I dream that you are here  
You're mine  
And all my fears are left behind  
  
I float on air  
The nightingale sings  
Gentle lullabies  
So let me close my eyes  
  
And sleep perchance to dream  
So I can see the face I long to touch  
To kiss  
But only dreams can bring me this  
  
So let the moon shine softly on  
The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me  
  
I hide beneath the clouds  
And whisper to the evening star  
They tell me love is just a dream away, dream away, dream away, dream away  
I'll dream away  
  
So let the moon shine softly on  
The boy I long to see  
And maybe when he dreams  
He'll dream of me  
  
Ohhhh, dream of me

(Spoken:)  
Girl you know  
We belong together  
I have no time for  
You to be playing  
With my heart like this  
You'll be mine forever  
Baby, you just see  
  
We belong together  
And you that I'm right  
Why do you play  
With my heart,  
Why do you play  
With my mind?  
  
Said we'd be forever  
Said it'd never die  
How could you love me  
And leave me  
And never say goodbye?  
  
When I can't sleep at night  
Without holding you tight  
Girl, each time I try  
I just break down and cry  
Pain in my head oh  
I'd rather be dead  
Spinnin' around and around  
  
CHORUS:  
Although we've come to  
The end of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
Come to the  
End of the road  
Still I can't let you go  
It's unnatural  
You belong to me  
I belong to you  
  
Girl, I know you  
Really love me,  
You just don't realise  
You've never  
Been there before  
It's only your first time  
  
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm  
Maybe you'll try  
We should be  
Happy together  
Forever, you and I  
  
Can you love me again  
Like you loved me before  
This time I want you  
To love me much more  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Don't let me  
Don't let me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
(Spoken:)  
Girl I'm here for you  
All those times of night  
When you just hurt me  
And just run out  
With that other fella  
Baby I knew about it  
I just didn't care  
You just don't understand  
How much I love you do you?  
I'm here for you  
  
I'm not out to go out and  
Cheat on you all night  
Just like you did baby  
But that's all right  
Hey, I love you anyway  
And I'm still gonna  
Be here for you  
Till my dying day baby  
Right now, I'm just in  
So much pain baby  
'Cause you just won't  
Come back to me  
Will you?  
Just come back to me  
  
(Lonely)  
Yes baby my  
Heart is lonely  
(Lonely)  
My heart hurts baby  
(Lonely)  
Yes I feel pain too  
Baby please  
  
This time instead  
Just come to my bed  
And baby just  
Don't let me go  
  
Repeat chorus twice

Ohhhh Ohhhh  
  
Late at night you call on the phone  
We talk about the day  
When you found out he was cheating  
You tell me that it hurts to the bone  
To trust someone that way  
To find out he was decieving  
And I know I've always just been your friend  
But if you look my way I'll make sure that you'll never hurt again  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you'd only see  
How beautiful you and I would be  
Endlessly  
  
Ohhh ohh yea  
I remember when you fell in love  
I could not believe  
That it was not with me  
I said a secret prayer up above  
And put my heart away  
So that you could be free  
And I know right now your broken in two  
But did you know my hearts been broken since the day i met you  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And in my sweetest dream you'd learn to put your faith in me  
Endlessly  
  
Sometimes the thing you need is the one thing you can't see  
If you put your faith in me  
How beautiful you and I would be  
  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear (I'd swear)  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you'd only see  
How beautiful you and I would be  
Endlessly

We've been through days of thunder  
Some people say we don't belong  
They try to pull us under  
But here we stand together in the new year strong  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
And this one goes out to  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone  
This one goes out to you,  
Everyone  
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done  
This one goes out to you  
  
We've been inside the circus  
We take the pleasure with the pain  
I guess there's something about us  
Whatever comes around will always stay the same  
Oh yeah  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Oh let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
(we know who you are)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're minutes away  
Till it's time to play  
Our heartbeats are rising  
They're letting you in  
Time for the show to begin  
  
Here  
We're standing stronger from what you've done  
This one goes out to you, you, you  
You make us feel like we've just begun  
And this one goes out to you... yeah  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Walking along the sky  
Chasing a glimpse of you  
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes  
Up here above the haze  
Everything looks so clear  
Wondering what it would be like if you were here  
  
And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)  
But I can't wait  
To tell you how I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing  
My heart, my blood, my passion  
Why, tell me why  
You're everything but mine  
  
I hold you close when it all goes crazy  
And through it all, you'll be my lady  
Why, tell me why  
You're everything  
Everything but mine  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
Of somebody else's touch  
Just gimme a chance to prove  
Just how you should be loved  
  
And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)  
It's not too late  
To tell you how I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everything but mine  
Mine I know, oh baby  
Someday you'll come around  
I'm gonna leave the light on  
And I won't let you down  
No I won't let you down  
  
I won't let you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're everything but mine  
You're everything but mine  
You're the sun, you're the star  
You're the moon, you're the rain  
Love your lips, love your eyes  
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby  
Everything but mine  
You're everything but mine

I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
You had me fooled  
You were so good at that  
I'm so unglued  
Too many pieces to put back  
And you were the best by far  
How did we end up like this?  
Don't even know who you are  
I can't believe it's like this  
I wanna know  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I followed you to the deepest part of love  
And how do you destroy the life we built for us?  
And this is a mystery  
You played the part so well  
Now this is history  
Was I the last to tell?  
I wanna know  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
The only thing that's worse than emptiness  
Is when your heart's lost  
And the only thing that's worth the pain  
Is the price of what love costs  
Coz when you think it's all in your hands  
That's when it's gone  
And you're thinking you're invincible  
Believe me, you're so wrong  
Tell me how does it feel  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
Tell me how does it feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
I wanna know how it feels

This song is not a Backstreet song,  
althought Howie sings it with his sister.  
I think it's important to say that  
  
  
Yesterday is now a memory  
Just a picture on the wall  
Of a life I once shared with you  
Someone who listened when I called  
(Bridge)  
So many things I should have said to you  
I had the chance and let it slip away  
If I could fly to heaven (if I could fly up)  
Just to see you one more time (just to see you one more time)  
I'd fly all the way to heaven (to heaven)  
Just to say that I love you  
The last three words you said to me  
I love you  
Remain an echo in my mind (remain an echo in my mind)  
Never imagined that you'd leave so soon  
I will miss you sweet Caroline  
(Bridge)  
(Chorus)  
If I could fly to heaven (vuelvo a cielo)  
Just to see you one more time (quiero verte otra vez)  
I'd fly all the way to heaven (directo al cielo)  
Just to say that I love you  
(Angel de la guardia) Now I lay me down to sleep  
(Dulce compania) I pray my heart and soul I'll keep  
(No me desampares) And if I should die before I wake  
(Ni de noche, ni de dia) In your arms my soul you'll take  
(Chorus)  
Te Amo  
(Chorus 2 x's)

Money money money money, money (x6)  
Some people got to have it  
Some people really need it  
Listen to me y'all, do things, do things, do bad things with it  
You wanna do things, do things, do things, good things with it  
Talk about cash money, money  
Talk about cash money- dollar bills, yall  
  
For the love of money  
People will steal from their mother  
For the love of money  
People will rob their own brother  
For the love of money  
People can't even walk the street  
Because they never know who in the world they're gonna beat  
For that lean, mean, mean green  
Almighty dollar, money  
  
For the love of money  
People will lie, Lord, they will cheat  
For the love of money  
People don't care who they hurt or beat  
For the love of money  
A woman will sell her precious body  
For a small piece of paper it carries a lot of weight  
Call it lean, mean, mean green  
  
Almighty dollar  
  
I know money is the root of all evil  
Do funny things to some people  
Give me a nickel, brother can you spare a dime  
Money can drive some people out of their minds  
  
Got to have it, I really need it  
How many things have I heard you say  
Some people really need it  
How many things have I heard you say  
Got to have it, I really need it  
How many things have I heard you say  
Lay down, lay down, a woman will lay down  
For the love of money  
All for the love of money  
Don't let, don't let, don't let money rule you  
For the love of money  
Money can change people sometimes  
Don't let, don't let, don't let money fool you  
Money can fool people sometimes  
People! Don't let money, don't let money change you,  
It will keep on changing, changing up your mind.

Yeahhh  
  
Opposites attract, chemicals react  
But when I look at you  
Deserts need the rain, fires feed the flame  
We can't deny what's true  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do  
I love you, I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
We don't have no walls  
The beauty of it all (beauty of it all)  
Is waiting in your eyes  
Breathing on my skin  
Just let me take it in  
Under an open sky  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
Cause you got me yeah (oh you know I can't)  
All these elements are real  
They come from deep within me  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do  
I love you (oh I love you) I love you  
This power is greater than the forces of nature  
  
Nothing is greater  
Than the energy I get from loving you  
Sooner or later  
It'll take us too forever  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (ohhh)  
Let this emotional wind take us higher  
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)  
  
I would move heaven and earth for this fire (for this fire)  
For this ocean, I'd fight for you (I'd fight for you)  
Let this emotional wind take us higher (let this emotional wind)  
Where there's nothing we can't do (nothing we can't do)  
I love you (I love you baby) I love you (I love you baby)  
This power is greater than the forces of nature

From this moment life has begun  
From this moment you are the one  
Right beside you is where I belong  
From this moment on  
  
From this moment I have been blessed  
I live only for your happiness  
And for your love I'd give my last breath  
From this moment on  
  
I give my hand to you with all my heart  
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start  
You and I will never be apart  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
Chorus  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you, I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldn't give  
From this moment on, oh  
  
You're the reason I believe in love  
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above  
All we need is just the two of us  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
Chorus - Repeat  
  
I will love you (I will love you)  
As long as I live  
From this moment on

I wake up every morning and see your face  
Lying right beside me it fills the space  
In my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't wanna figure right how to  
And every time I lay my head down to sleep  
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat  
So loud  
I can't hear the sound  
Do you hear it?  
For you  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve  
But still somehow you keep on surprising me  
I'm yours  
I can't live without you  
Don't wanna figure right how to  
Every time I see you I feel like I  
Could be the luckiest man in the world  
Why try to fight it  
There's no need to hide it  
Because  
You know  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
Helpless  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
Feels like  
I fall apart  
Every time  
Where do I start(without you)  
I'm so helpless  
Without you  
Without you  
  
(Pitbull)  
Every time I close my eyes  
You're the first thing that runs to my mind  
Everywhere I go  
I see you  
Hear you  
Feel you  
I just wanna be near you  
And heal you  
Last thing you said is how dare you  
First thing I said is I'm sorry  
Now I'm sitting here  
Helpless  
Man  
Same old story  
  
Now she's brokenhearted  
Time heals all the wounds  
She said  
Not this time  
It's true  
Everyone plays a fool  
And that fool is me  
Because I foolishly  
Took advantage of a woman who loved me  
  
I fall in love all over again  
Each time  
I lay my eyes on you  
I pretend  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
Feel so helpless  
Without you  
It takes a piece of me  
Each time you leave  
I feel it in my chest  
So hard to breathe  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
I feel so helpless  
Without you  
  
Ohh yeah

She keeps her secrets  
In her eyes  
She wraps the truth  
Inside her lies  
Just when I can't say  
What she's done to me  
She comes to me  
And leads me back to paradise  
  
She's so hard to hold  
But I can't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a house of cards  
In a hurricane  
A reckless ride  
In the pouring rain  
She cuts me and the pain  
Is all I wanna feel  
She tears away just like a child  
She drives me crazy  
Drives me wild  
But I'm helpless when she smiles  
  
Oh when she smiles  
  
Maybe I'd fight if I could  
It hurts so bad  
But feels so good  
She opens up just like  
A rose to me  
When she's close to me  
Anything she'd ask me to  
I would  
  
It's out of control  
But I can't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When she looks at me  
I get so weak  
  
[Chorus]

Ah, Backstreet  
Yes yes y'all  
One time, here we go (yes yes y'all)  
Ooh, ooh  
Yes yes y'all  
I could tell when I stepped in the room  
And I saw you standing there  
And about by the way that you moved  
I couldn't help the way I stared  
  
There were some mysterious folks  
They led me here to you  
Lead me (lead me) to you (to you)  
So I stood there watching  
And I was hypnotized  
By the rhythm of your body  
And the music in your eyes  
And I was lost inside a groove with you  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' that song for me  
Out on the floor in my arms, she's gotta be  
Let's get it on (let's get it on)  
Jam all night long  
Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ  
Will you play it for me?  
Ooh, ooh (yes yes y'all)  
Now it feels like it could be romance  
As we dance across the floor  
Every move that your body makes  
  
Only makes me want you more  
And it seems like time's moving fast  
How can we make it last?  
Make it (make it) last (last, so long)  
As we keep on dancing  
I am hypnotized  
By the rhythm of your body  
And the music in your eyes  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Close your eyes (close your eyes)  
And just imagine this alone  
Let the music put you in a groove  
I am lost, lost inside a groove with you  
When you do the things you do  
Come on and work your body, work your body  
Hey Mr. DJ, jam all night long  
Hey Mr. DJ play that song for me  
  
Keep it coming Mr. DJ

Remember when  
Never needed each other  
The best of friends  
Like sister and brother  
We understood  
We'd never be alone  
  
Those days are gone  
Now I want you so much  
The night is long  
And I need your touch  
Don't know what to say  
Never meant to feel this way  
Don't want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
What can I do to make you mine?  
Falling so hard, so fast, this time  
What did I say?  
What did you do?  
How did I fall in love with you?  
  
I hear your voice  
And I start to tremble  
Brings back the child that  
I resemble  
  
I cannot pretend  
That we can still be friends  
Don't want to be  
Alone tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to say this right  
And it has to be tonight  
Just need you to know  
  
I don't want to live this life  
I don't want to say goodbye  
With you I want to spend  
The rest of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What can I do to make you mine?  
Falling so hard, so fast, this time  
Everything's changed  
We never knew  
How did I fall in love with you

Open up your heart to me  
And say what's on your mind, oh yes  
I know that we have been through so much pain  
But I still need you in my life this time, and  
  
[Chorus]  
I need you tonight  
I need you right now  
I know deep within my heart  
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right  
I really need you tonight  
  
I figured out what to say to you  
But sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong, oh yes they do  
And I know in time that you will understand  
That what we have is so right this time, and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more  
And baby I know  
I need you  
I know deep within my heart  
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right  
I really need you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I know is baby  
I really need you tonight

Who are you now?  
Are you still the same  
Or did you change somehow?  
What do you do  
At this very moment when I think of you?  
And when I'm looking back  
How we were young and stupid  
Do you remember that?  
  
No matter how I fight it  
Can't deny it  
Just can't let you go  
  
I still need you  
I still care about you  
Though everything's been said and done  
I still feel you  
Like I'm right beside you  
But still no word from you  
  
Now look at me  
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see  
That I keep coming back  
And I'm stuck in a moment  
That wasn't meant to last (to last)  
  
I've tried to fight it  
Can't deny it  
You don't even know  
  
That I still need you  
I still care about you  
Though everything's been said and done  
I still feel you  
Like I'm right beside you  
But still no word from you  
  
No no  
I wish I could find you  
Just like you found me  
Then I would never let you go (without you)  
  
Though everything's been said and done (yeah)  
I still feel you (I still feel you)  
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)  
But still no (still no word) word from you

I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you  
  
I'd like to know your policy  
When it comes to me  
Like to know what's in your mind  
It's not easy to see  
I Know now what I feel  
And what to do  
I want to be with you  
And I'll be waiting  
Until you face the truth  
When the light is fadin'  
You know what I want to do  
  
I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you  
  
Yeah everybody say  
Yeah, see you once again  
Yeah, everybody swing  
Yeah, everybody swing  
  
Wish you'd come and set me free  
So that I can see  
All the things I've left behind  
What's missin' in me  
I'm looking for a sign  
In the things you do  
I want to be with you  
And I'll be waitin'  
Until you face the truth  
When the light is fadin'  
You know what I want to do  
  
I want to be with you  
It's crazy but it's true  
And everything I do  
I want to be with you

Yeah-eh-heah  
You are, my fire,  
The one, desire,  
Believe, when I say  
I want it that way  
  
But we, are two worlds apart,  
Can't reach to your heart,  
When you say,  
That I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
Tell me why,  
I never want to hear you say,  
I want it that way  
  
Am I, your fire?  
Your one, desire,  
Yes I know, it's too late,  
But I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I can see that we've fallen apart,  
From the way that it used to be, Yeah,  
No matter the distance,  
I want you to know,  
That deep down inside of me  
  
You are, my fire,  
The one, desire,  
You are (You are, you are, you are)  
  
Don't want to hear you say,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
(Don't want to hear you say),  
I never want to hear you say,  
I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
Tell me why,  
I never want to hear you say,  
(Never want to hear you say it),  
I want it that way  
  
'Cause I want it that way

Oh, I will be yours  
  
I don't know what to do  
I can't believe it's true that  
You can make me feel this way  
I see it in your eyes  
It made me realize  
There's something that I've got to say  
  
Refrain:  
I just wanna tell you that I'm sorry  
For all the things I've done to make you worry  
And all the time I cared for you from the bottom of my heart  
  
Chorus:  
I will be yours if you'll be mine  
I will be there 'til the end of time  
I will be with you until the day that I die  
I'll be yours, I will be yours  
  
I've been around the world  
And seen a lot of girls  
But no one can compare to you  
It's really plain to see  
That you belong to me  
Cause you're the only one I need  
  
Refrain  
  
Chorus  
  
I will be yours (2x)  
  
Oh, I will be yours  
  
Chorus  
  
I will be yours (2x)

Every day  
Girl I wake up and pray  
That you'll come back home  
Don't take too long  
Cause since you've been gone  
Everything's gone all went wrong  
I wish you were here  
holding me near  
  
You know I'd go  
out of my mind  
If you ever left  
my heart behind  
So I'm begging you please  
Bring your sweet love back to me  
  
If I don't have you  
(Don't have you)  
to hold on to  
(to hold on to)  
I can't go on  
in this world alone  
Baby, It's true  
(Baby, It's true)  
If I don't have you  
If you say goodbye  
(you said goodbye)  
Girl, I would die  
(Girl, I would die)  
I'm a star with no light  
a day with no night  
If I don't have you

Life should be like a game of cards  
You make a mistake  
Shuffle the deck and start over  
It should be just like drivin' in your car  
Get lost and your navigation system  
Gets you closer  
  
But there ain't no handbook  
You're on your own  
Got no instructions  
When it comes to love  
Cause once you do something  
Can't be undone  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
Yeah I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now  
  
Wish I come with remote controls  
Then I just rewind into  
The time it was better  
It should have a restart button  
So, I could travel right back  
To the day that I met her  
  
But there ain't no handbook  
You're on your own  
Got no instructions  
When it comes to love  
Cause when you do something  
Can't be undone  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)

You're on your own (your own)  
Got no instructions (instructions)  
When it comes to love (to love)  
See once you do something (you do)  
Can't be undone (undone)  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now

I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best

Baby if I knew then  
What I know now

7 am, thinking ?bout you  
Wondering  
If the thoughts I'm feeling  
You're feeling too  
Like a new born child  
Soft to the touch  
Baby is it possible  
To love someone so much  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldn't say what you said  
(Say what you said)  
If you knew what I knew  
We?d be together instead

Of you breaking my heart  
(Breaking my heart)  
Over things that aren't true  
My lady, yes, my lady  
(My lady)  
If you knew what I knew  
Time passes by  
The only tears I cry  
Are filled with disillusion  
And fears I have inside  
Like a lost soul  
I feel like I'm all alone  
(All alone)  
If only I could feel your pain  
Within your heart of stone, woh oh  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night

If you knew what I knew  
Then you would be here to stay  
Right by my side always  
(Always)  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldn't say what you said  
(Say what you said)  
If you knew what I knew  
We?d be together instead  
Of you breaking my heart  
(Breaking my heart)  
Over things that aren't true  
My lady, yes, my lady  
(My lady)  
If you knew what I knew, my, baby

Girl, 'cause I've got forever in sight  
For all of my life  
I'll be there for you

Baby, I know you're hurting  
Right now you feel like you could never  
Love again  
Now all I ask is for a chance  
To prove that I love you  
  
From the first day  
That I saw your smiling face  
Honey, I knew that we would  
Be together forever  
Ooh when I asked you out  
You said no but I found out  
Darling that you'd been hurt  
You felt like you'd never love again  
I deserve a try honey just once  
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong  
You walked in, you were so quick to judge  
But honey he' s nothing like me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'll never break your heart  
I'll never make you cry  
I'd rather die than live without you  
I'll give you all of me  
Honey, that's no lie  
  
As time goes by  
You will get to know me  
A little more better  
Girl that's the way love goes baby, baby  
And I (I) know you're afraid (know you're afraid)  
To let your feelings show (feelings show)  
And I understand  
Girl, it's time to let go (girl, it's time to let go because)  
I deserve a try (try) honey  
Just once (once)  
Give me a chance (chance) and I'll prove this all wrong (wrong you walked)  
You walked in, you were so quick to judge (quick to judge)  
But honey he's nothing like me  
Darling why can't you see  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Bridge]  
No way, no how (I'll never break your heart girl, I'll never make you cry)  
I swear (Oh I, oh I, I swear)  
No way, no how (I'll never break your heart girl, I'll never make you cry)  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Oh, I'll never find  
I'll never find some one like you  
Girl you take my breath away  
And when I'm with someone new  
I'd rather be here with you baby forever  
My heart belongs to you  
'Cause I think about you all the time  
I know my love is true  
When we're together  
I played around girl  
And I made you cry  
When I looked up  
You were saying goodbye  
I'm begging you please  
I need you so bad  
Don't leave me now you're the best that I've had  
Chorus  
I'll never  
I'll never find someone like you  
No I'll never  
That promise is true  
No I'll never  
I'll never find someone like you  
Oh baby  
'Cause I love the way that you are  
And girl I won't no  
I won't let you go  
'Cause no one could ever do  
Love you like I love you  
All I have is just my heart  
And my feelings I give to you  
That's all that I can do, girl  
Baby forever  
Oh, you don't know that you're hurting me  
'Cause it's not just a sexual thing  
I wanna share my dreams  
Baby together, oh  
Girl I'm afraid just to give you that but  
My heart's telling me to hold on to my love  
But when you get close  
I want you to know  
I start to get weak  
And I can't let you go  
Chorus  
Just your smile  
That's all I need  
Tenderness  
Girl I won't let you down  
Girl I will never find no one that compares to you  
Chorus  
'Cause no one could ever do  
And I promise to honour you  
Chorus  
I'll never find someone like you  

In Christ alone will I glory  
Though I could pride myself in battles won  
For I've been blessed beyond measure  
And by His strength alone I overcome  
Oh I could stop and count successes  
Like diamonds in my hands  
But those trophies could not equal  
To the grace by which I stand  
  
Chorus:  
In Christ alone I place my trust  
And find my glory in the power of the cross  
In every victory let it be said of me  
My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone  
  
In Christ alone will I glory  
For only by His grace I am redeemed  
And only His tender mercy  
Could reach beyond my weakness to my need  
And now I seek no greater honor  
Than just to know Him more  
And to count my gains  
But losses to the glory of my Lord

So I lay awake another hour  
Just like the one before  
The shadows play a game with my head  
I can't take this anymore  
  
I hear the sound  
Of my own breathing  
It makes me miss you more  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up when it's over  
After the ending  
When the damage has all been done  
I don't wanna be somewhere  
Where you can watch me as I bleed  
Just leave me here in pieces  
In pieces  
  
I can't take the chance  
Of running into  
You running into me  
So lock the door  
And close the window  
I just wanna see  
  
Until the day  
Inside my future  
When I'll be on my feet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you want you can find me  
On the dark side of the sun  
Babe I don't wanna see what we've become  
The damage has all been done  
  
Wake me up when it's over  
After the ending  
Wake me up when it's over  
When the damage has all been done  
The damage is done  
I don't wanna be somewhere  
I don't wanna be somewhere  
Where you can watch me as I bleed  
Leave me here in pieces  
Just leave me in pieces  
Just leave me in pieces  
Just wake me up when it's over (in pieces)  
Just wake me up when it's over

Empty spaces fill me up with hopes  
Distant faces with no place left to go  
Without you within me I can't find no rest  
Where I'm going is anybody's guess  
  
[Chorus]  
I tried to go on like I never knew you  
I'm awake but my world is half asleep  
I pray for this heart to be unbroken  
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete  
  
Voices tell me I should carry on  
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone  
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face  
You still wonder if we made a big mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mean to drag it on  
But I can't seem to let you go  
I don't want to make you face this world alone  
I want to let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Incomplete

I close the door  
Like so many times, so many times before  
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor  
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word  
  
I try to sleep, yeah  
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me  
A thousand more regrets unraveling  
Oh, if you were here right now,  
I swear I'd tell you this  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I don't wanna waste another day  
Keepin it inside, it's killing me  
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave  
I'm inconsolable  
  
I climb the walls, yeah  
I can see the edge,  
But I can't take the fall, no  
I've memorized the number  
So why can't I make the call  
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me  
In the possibility  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, no, no  
  
I don't wanna be like this  
I just wanna let you know  
That everything I hold in  
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)  
  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you know it baby  
I don't wanna waste another day  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave  
I'm inconsolable  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, I'm inconsolable  
Whoa yeah  
I'm inconsolable

Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
  
I can't control it anymore  
I've never felt like this before  
you really make me lose my head  
My hungry heart must be fed (uh huh, uh huh)  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
[Chorus]  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
All the way  
It's gotta be you (uh huh, uh huh)  
Everyday  
I promise you I will be true, yeah  
It's only you  
  
Now I know why I was born  
You feel my feelings one by one  
Can't see the world I'm walking through  
'Cause baby I see only you, oh yeah  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby it's the way you make me  
Kinda get me go crazy  
Never want to stop  
And you know  
I can't see the world I'm walking through  
'Cause of you, yeah  
It's gotta be you, all the way  
All that I ever wanted  
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah  
It's only you  
  
[Chorus]

Even the lover makes a mistake sometimes.  
Like any other, fall out and lose his mind.  
And I'm sorry for the things I did,  
For your teardrops, or the words I said.  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again? Oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's true. I mean it.  
From the bottom of my heart.  
Yeah, it's true.  
Without you I would fall apart.  
  
Whatever happened, I know that I was wrong. Oh yes.  
Can you believe me? Maybe your faith is gone.  
But I love you and I always will,  
So I wonder if you want me still.  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?  
Oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything to make it up to you.  
So, please understand and open your heart once again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's true.

This is for the lovers,  
Strictly for the lovers, year  
If you want some one you want to get close to,  
Then you get close to this  
  
Woo, just to be close to ya  
  
Yo, drop the verse  
  
Like a flower to a tree, that how close I want to be,  
To your heart (baby to your heart, heart)  
Like the stars to the night, and daytime is to light  
Will never part (will never part)  
I want you to be the only thing that I see  
'cause I believe it's our destiny  
  
[Chorus]  
Just to be close, just to be close  
It's the only thing that I want to do  
Just to be close, just to be close  
Just to be close to ya (closer to ya)  
Just to be close  
  
So lonely is the night, without you to hold me tight  
(I want to hold ya closer)  
I need ya (baby hold me closer, closer)  
My life will mean nothing without the joy you bring  
To me, you know, you know, you know  
There were never (never be) no one else for me  
You were like the dream that become reality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to give you all my love (all my love)  
I gonna give it to you, I gonna give to you  
All me love (all my love) I gonna give it to you, I gonna give to you  
Give you everything you need (all my love I gonna give it to you)  
I'm gonna it to you all you want (to be close to you) close to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be without your side  
I've never never never ever let you go  
Just want to be close  
I don't want to be without  
You girl never never never ever let you go  
Just to be close  
Never be no one else for me you were like a dream that become reality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just want to be close, to you

I may run and hide  
When you're screamin' my name, alright  
But let me tell you now  
There are prices to fame, alright  
All of our time spent in flashes of light  
  
[Chorus]  
All you people can't you see, can't you see  
How your love's affecting our reality  
Every time we're down  
You can make it right  
And that makes you larger than life  
  
Looking at the crowd  
And I see your body sway, c'mon  
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon  
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of your time spent keeps us alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, every time we're down  
Yeah, you can make it right  
Yeah, and that's what makes you larger than life  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Its 3 am, I can't sleep  
Too late to call this is not like me  
But I'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back  
The angle of your chin when you were looking back  
See, god you're beautiful and I'm still coming down  
I'd like a one-night stand, but you had to stick around  
But I'm still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets  
I haven't changed a thing since you abandoned me  
Tonight I stare out the window?  
Knowing I'll never again be alone  
Last night you changed my life  
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life  
Last night you saved my life  
Your fingernails running down my spine  
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind  
It's like I knew you all my life even though we just met  
My children in your eyes, something you don't expect  
I had to stop myself from calling all day long  
I'm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong  
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring  
I tried to play it off  
But you knew everything  
Last night you changed my life  
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life (saved my life)  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Last night you saved my life (saved my life)  
Last night you saved my life  
Ohh yeah  
I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun  
Can't wait to tell you you're the only one  
Last night you saved my life  
And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life (saved my life)  
Last night you changed my life  

Walk on, up to me  
Look in my eyes, i'll make you see  
I want only you

I love you with everything that's in me  
Did you know that?  
You'll be the first that's ever been so close  
You should know that  
I've been loving you since the beginning  
For what it's worth I've always been waiting for this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl

With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love  
  
Never had a reason to believe that love would find me  
It must've known something that I didn't know  
And you showed me that if I had a chance to go to heaven  
Girl I'd stay here cause nothing could make me miss this moment  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love  
  
I can't think of any place I'd rather be than here with you  
When I hold you close to me feeling every bound of your heartbeat, baby  
It's the way you look into my eyes  
That lets me know just what you wish it's for a night like this  
  
One special night for one special girl  
Let's make love like it's our last day on Earth  
With everything I am I promise it will be  
Much sweeter than you ever could dream  
Let's do it tonight baby  
Let's do it for love

Love Knows I Love You  
  
You make me say it 25 times a day  
You make me feel you don't believe the words I say  
What is a man to do to prove his love for you?  
You make me feel like I'm just givin' free love away  
  
I can send flowers tomorrow  
But it doesn't mean a thing  
If your heart rejects the message from mine  
It's a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Yeah, I look at you and know I never loved anyone more  
You make me feel like a child in a candy store  
What can I do to prove  
That you're a dream come true  
And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to you  
I can send daisies daily  
But it never will penetrate  
If your heart if rejects the best from mine  
It's a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you (I really do)  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you (I really do, babe)  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Baby I'm lookin for cupid  
Can I tie him in a ball and chain  
To see if he can say to you  
The words that make you feel my love is real, oh  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
(That's right you know I love you, baby girl)  
Baby love knows the truth  
(Hey gotta know the truth, you know I love you)  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
(In my heart)  
From the very start  
I loved you  
(Yeah, that's right)  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you, yeah

Love  
Is it too much to ask for  
One minute to breath  
Cause you take my breath away  
Like I'd never sink  
  
You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls  
The reason why after every summer we fall  
  
You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night  
Cause nothing that I could dream  
It's better the you by my side  
  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
  
You know that I, I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine,  
I need you tonight  
  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody,  
  
When you wake up with no make up  
You try hiding your face,  
You know that I, and it's so cute,  
You don't even know  
How beautiful you are in me  
  
You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall  
Why after every summer we fall  
  
And the way the you look in those purple jeans  
It's the sexiest thing I ever see  
  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I you know that I,  
  
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine,  
I need you tonight  
  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
  
When the games on  
You wear the jersey of my favorite team  
I yell at the TV, knock over my beer  
You're not even mad of me  
You know I love you baby  
  
I love somebody, love somebody  
I know, I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I, I'm so in love  
I can die right now and be fine, I need  
You tonight  
  
You know that I love somebody, love somebody  
You know that I'm gonna love you, gonna love you,  
Gonna love girl, love somebody, love somebody

LOVING YOU  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel  
And I love how loving you feels so real  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh Loving you than anything else  
  
All my life I've dreamed of a princess all dressed in white  
Standing there to be my bride and then there's you  
A sending from Heaven right before my eyes  
Letting me know that there is a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real baby  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)  
  
All my life I've wondered if I'd hear all the bells and whistles  
If the one should come my way  
Then there is you like the wind makes the earth shake  
Making me a believer there must be a God somewhere I know  
Many people think they find love in the world  
But this kind of love isn't found it finds you it takes you  
  
This kind of love doesn't come from just a touch  
Nor does it come from anything you can't pay for  
Its so pure if we just send love on in the world  
  
Cus I love how loving you makes me feel oh yeah  
And I love how loving you feels so real so real so real  
Through the good through the bad the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world (in the world)  
  
I love how loving you makes me feel  
And I love how loving you feels so real  
Through the good through the bad  
When I'm happy or sad  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
Ohoooh I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world  
I'd rather be loving you than anything else in the world

We can only make believe  
We can only make believe  
  
Something that you said got into my head  
Here I am falling from the edge  
Waiting for the day I can run away with you with you  
Like angels on fire we burn the sky  
One kiss and we say goodbye  
  
If we could only make believe  
You and me together  
We could be king and queen  
Rule another world forever  
We'd set our course to live or die  
Across the universe  
I'd be by your side  
If we could only believe  
We can only make believe  
We could only make believe  
  
Catch another breath I got nothing left  
This love I have is pulling me to death  
Waiting for the night I can feel alive with you  
Like angels on fire we burn the sky  
One kiss and we say goodbye  
  
If we could only make believe  
You and me together  
We could be king and queen  
Rule another world forever  
We'd set our course to live or die  
Across the universe  
I'd be by your side  
If we could only believe  
We can only make believe  
We could only make believe  
  
If we close our eyes  
Let our hearts collide  
Leave the world outside  
Leave it all behind  
If we close our eyes  
Let our hearts collide  
Leave the world outside  
Leave it all behind  
Leave the world outside  
Leave it all behind  
  
If we could only make believe  
You and me together  
We could be king and queen  
Rule another world forever  
We'd set our course to live or die  
Across the universe  
I'd be by your side  
If we could only believe  
We can only make believe  
We could only make believe  
  
If we close our eyes (If we could only make believe)  
Let our hearts collide (If we could only make believe)  
Leave the world outside (If we could only make believe)  
Leave it all behind (If we could only make believe)  
If we could only make believe  
If we close our eyes (If we could only make believe)  
Let our hearts collide (If we could only make believe)  
Leave the world outside (If we could only make believe)  
Leave it all behind (If we could only make believe)

This scenes so hypnotic  
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic  
Paper faces in gold  
There's solider boys, beauty queens  
Everyone's a mystery  
It's got me losing control  
  
Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes  
Wanna play in this game of disguise  
  
It's a masquerade, a love parade  
So won't you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade, I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade  
  
Just like a perfect dream  
I don't ever wanna leave  
A thousand freaks in the show  
One's a tiger, one's a lynx  
One's a king that suffering  
Moving high, moving love  
  
Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes?  
Wanna play in this game of disguise  
  
It's a masquerade, a love parade  
So won't you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade, I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade  
  
I gotta know the girl behind the mask  
Let me in, where you been, don't pretend  
Dreamed that I had her alone  
Show your face to me, we could be everything  
  
It's a masquerade, a love parade  
So won't you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade, I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
A masquerade, a love parade  
So won't you stay and dance with me  
All though the night and day  
My masquerade, I need you baby  
So stay with me tonight  
  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade  
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade

Memories  
The love I left behind  
I still think about it all the time  
Nothing stays the same  
Maybe I'm to blame  
Oh I, I'd do it all again  
  
Through these eyes  
I've seen a thousand lies  
And it's taken years to realize  
That nothing stays the same  
And no one is to blame  
But I, I'd do it all again  
  
Does it really matter if you got it right?  
Does it really matter who was wrong or right? (yeah)  
All I know, yes I know that I can make it through  
What about you?  
  
Ooh my my  
But ain't no way it's gonna change me (oh you wanna know)  
Ohhh  
Cause all the fear I've left behind (where you gonna go)  
Yeah yeah  
And only time will tell you what is meant to be  
  
There's a place  
I can't let go  
Holding all the dreams I used to know  
I wish it was the same  
I guess no one's to blame  
But I, I'd do it all again  
Yeah yeah  
  
Does it really matter if you got it right? (does it really matter?)  
Does it really matter who was wrong or right? (who was wrong or right)  
Looking at my life today and I'm alright (I'm alright)  
Yes I'm okay (I'm okay)  
Now I see the world in a better way (so much better now)  
And I know, yes I know that I can make it through (yeah)  
  
Memories  
The love I left behind  
I wish it was the same  
I guess no one's to blame  
No no nothing stays the same  
And everything must change  
Oh I  
I'd do it all again  
Oooh again  
Again  
Again

[Chorus]  
Oh baby I'm missing you  
We used the love so strong  
Tell me where do we go  
Oh baby I'm missing you  
They said I'd learn to forget but it sure ain't happen yet  
  
Been checkin' out the places where we used to go  
Been lookin' for your face inside the crowd  
I've been talkin' to the people what we used to know  
Nobody wants to say where you hang out  
  
And when I call your phone  
Seems like you're never home  
And you don't return my call  
It tears me apart  
This is breakin' up my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still have your pictures hung around my room  
That's the only thing that is left of you with me  
Girl what can I do to make you come back soon  
And make it just the way it used to be  
  
Oh, this is someone new  
Can never go on without you  
Girl I don't want to think about it  
I can't sleep at night  
No this can't be right  
Come back into my life  
(Come back baby come back)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know there's a chance for you and I  
And I believe there's no way our love could die  
So no matter how long it takes I'll wait for you  
And what ever it takes I'll be there for you  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Only one life to live in  
Trying our best to make it through  
Ooh we're trying our best to make it through  
There's no mistakes, just lessons  
It's all about what they mean to you  
Ohhh, oh yeah no matter what you've gone through (you can)  
Pick up the pieces, move on with your life  
Cause we have to accept the wrongs and try to make them right  
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth  
Baby you've got to realize it takes time to become you  
So just get to  
  
Movin' on  
We're movin' on  
We're movin 'on  
Living day by day, everything must change  
But in a way everything stays the same  
Movin' on, movin' on, movin' on, movin' on  
Movin' on  
  
Well take what you've been given  
Gotta take a chance while we can  
Ooh, ohh yeah  
To find our place in our world  
We gotta understand the plan (understand)  
Pick up the pieces, move on with your life  
Cause we have to accept the wrongs and try to make them right  
It may be hard to look at yourself and see the truth  
Oh realize it takes time to become you  
Oh, just get to  
  
Movin' on  
We're movin' on (you know we''ve got to keep on movin' on)  
We're movin 'on (nothing''s gonna stop us)  
Living day by day, everything must change  
But in a way everything stays the same  
Movin' on, movin' on, movin' on, movin' on  
Movin' on  
  
Moving on  
We're moving on (you know we've got to keep on moving on)  
We're moving on (nothing's gonna stop us)  
Living day by day, everything must change  
We know we've changed  
But we're still the same  
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be  
As life goes on uou'll have your time  
Cause everything's meant to be  
Whooaa ohhh

You know, sometimes being  
On the road is rough, especially the loneliness  
  
Girl I miss you  
And it's only been one day  
Since I been away  
And aw lady I say I long to kiss you  
And hold you in my arms  
The nights are much too long when you're gone  
Baby that's why...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wherever I go  
Girl, my heart stays with you  
My heart stays with you  
After every show  
I want to rush over to you  
My heart stays with you  
  
Trust me, when we are apart  
I won't break your heart  
Wherever you are I know you feel me, Baby  
And I can feel you too  
No matter what you do  
I think of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, yeah  
When I'm leaving town  
Girl, it hurts me too  
But I've got a job to do  
I'll be back around  
To see your sweet face  
Your embrace  
No one can take your place  
I want you to know...  
  
Wherever I go  
I'll be rushing over to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wherever I go  
Where I stop, who knows  
Whatever I do  
My heart stays with you  
I'm gonna rush, gonna rush over.

I really miss you  
There's something that I gotta say  
  
The things we did,  
the things we said,  
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again.  
You showed me how to face the truth.  
Everything that's good in me, I owe to you.  
  
Though the distance that's between us now, may seem to be too far.  
It will never separate us, deep inside I know you are  
  
[Chorus]  
Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.  
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.  
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,  
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)  
Never Gone  
  
No, no, no  
  
I walk along these empty streets.  
There is not a second you're not here with me.  
The love you gave, the grace you've shown,  
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone.  
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me.  
As long as time goes on, I swear to you that you will be  
  
Never gone, never far, in my heart is where you are.  
Always close, everyday, every step along the way.  
Even though for now we've got to say goodbye,  
I know you will be forever in my life. (Yeah)  
  
Never gone from me  
If there's one thing I believe  
I believe  
I will see you somewhere down the road again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When we turn out the lights  
The two of us alone together  
Something's just not right  
But girl you know that I would never  
Ever let another's touch, come between  
the two of us  
  
'Cause no one else will ever take your place  
  
[Chorus]  
No one else comes close to you  
No one makes me feel the way you do  
You're so special girl to me  
And you'll always be eternally  
Every time I hold you near  
You always say the words I love to hear  
Girl with just a touch you can do so much  
No one else comes close  
  
And when I wake up to  
The touch of your head on my shoulder  
You're my dream come true, oh yeah  
Girl you know I'll always treasure  
Every kiss and everyday I'll love you girl in  
every way  
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]

Ain't nobody else but you [Repeat x3]  
  
There is nobody  
Who can make me cry  
Nobody can do  
Nobody but you (2x)  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There is nobody  
Who can make me lie  
Nobody else can do it  
Nobody but you [Repeat x2]  
Ain't nobody else but you  
Nobody, nobody but you  
Gimme one more chance to make it right  
Time has come for us to reunite  
Baby it's true  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There's no one like you  
  
There is nobody  
Who can make it right  
Nobody else can do  
Nobody but you  
You know what to do  
Nobody else but you  
Nobody, nobody but you  
Somebody tell me  
Cause I can't eat or sleep  
When you're not close to my body  
You're a bittersweet delight  
Come and help me through the night  
  
Ain't nobody else can make me cry  
Ain't nobody else can make me lie  
Nobody but you  
Ain't nobody else but you  
Nobody but you  
Gimme one more chance to make it right  
Time has come for us to reunite  
Cause baby it's true  
Ain't nobody else but you  
There's no one like you

Yeah  
Yeah yeah  
  
I was looking for something  
On the crime scene where you're in too deep  
I found a note with his number  
It's just another clue (that leads to you)  
  
I got a little suspicious  
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me  
I should've known better  
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)  
  
Yeah  
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see  
that you're not for me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
No no, uh uh  
Things will never be the same again with you  
No no, uh uh  
Now I know what it's comin' to  
No no, uh uh  
'cause' if you think that it's the way  
That love should be  
Let me tell you it's not for me  
  
No no  
  
I don't want to be part of your screenplay  
Just tell me  
Did you rehearse on me?  
Now give me the story  
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)  
Caught in the middle  
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek  
I'm getting a feeling  
That it's time for me to leave  
  
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see  
That you're not for me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah (yeah)  
I said no no (no way)  
No no, no no (whoa)  
  
I had enough of your talk, your games  
And you won't go away  
Justify my reasons to say  
(Say, reasons to say)  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Not No More  
  
  
Oooh oooh  
She stayed with 'em all  
But she got her own place  
She made me wait too long  
But you let me hit the second date yeah  
  
She's always asking me for my  
But girl you got your own  
I'm always trying to teach her things  
But her tricks fooled on  
  
She didn't stick around  
But now you hold me down  
I've been there and I tell you now girl  
She's my every don't  
But you are my everyone  
  
That's why she used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
She'd work my last nerve,  
You made it all good  
She wouldn't do the things I like  
But always knew you would  
Mmmmmmmm  
  
I couldn't let you go, I wanna keep it on the low  
Cause I never had nothing like this before  
And I let you know you are so incredible  
That's why I'm telling you  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
No more wondering just where we stand  
No more feeling like I'm the other man  
Girl I need to know if you are down to stay  
No more should've, would've, could've been  
Cause I'm through with yesterday  
  
She used to be the one I'd fight for  
But not no more  
She used to be the one I would cry for  
But not no more  
Cause girl now you are the one I would die for  
And that's for sure  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more (not no more)  
  
Used to fight for her  
But not no more  
Used to cry for her  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
  
I thought I had everything still something was missing  
But not no more  
  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more  
I used to fight for her  
But not no more

I'll be the one...  
  
I guess you were lost when I met you  
Still there were tears in your eyes  
So out of trust and I knew  
No more than mysteries and lies  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
  
Chorus  
I'll be the one  
Who will make all your sorrows undone  
I'll be the light  
When you feel like there's nowhere to run  
I'll be the one...  
  
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright  
'Cause my faith is gone  
And I want to take you from darkness to light  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
  
Chorus - repea  
  
You need me like I need you  
We can share our dreams comin' true  
I can show you what true love means  
Just take my hand, baby please  
  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it alright  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
  
Chorus - repeat  
  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it alright  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it all right  
I'll be the one  
To hold you  
And make sure that you'll be alright  
I'll be the one

This song was orignally done by brian mcknight but brian (littrell) sang it as
his solo in concert.  
Go to "the docks" and check out "bsb fanzine - online" to listen to the song.  
  
  
My shattered dreams and broken heart  
Are mending on the shelf  
I saw you  
Holding hands  
Standing close to someone else  
Now I sit all alone  
Wishin' all my feeling was gone  
Gotta get over you  
Nothing for me to do  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
This time  
Stop living a lie  
  
I know I got to be strong,  
But around me  
Life goes on  
And on  
And on  
And on  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes  
Right after I have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
For the very last time  
Quit living a lie  
  
I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down  
To my last cry

Hard to believe it  
It's almost a year since  
I got to hold you, head on my shoulder  
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I  
It's all I got left, so lately I've spent  
  
Every single night like its 25 to life  
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven  
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
First time it rings  
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you  
That moment I knew  
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice  
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us  
  
Every single night feels like 25 to life  
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven  
And I'm guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even I've got rights, your always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
So let me make my case  
That way you won't erase the message  
That I'm leaving for you now  
But if you do at least you knew  
  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want, all I need is one phone call  
  
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
You'll always be my one  
You'll always be my one  
'Cause you're my one  
Always be my one phone call  
You'll always be my one phone call

You know I been trying to figure out  
Just what's going on  
Am I over her?  
I been doing a lot of thinking lately  
Am I over her?  
And I'm really missing you  
  
It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days  
Since the last time I seen your pretty face  
My decision to bring this to an end  
And I'm caught up in reminscing  
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks  
Play fights, late nights  
It's been on my mind since Valentine's  
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide  
  
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)  
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)  
  
Am I over her? (am I over her?)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)  
I can't think straight  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
I was going through some things that I couldn't explain  
Now my situation's taking a big change  
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town  
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around  
Is she sad or is she mad?  
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?  
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on  
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone  
  
I ask myself time and time again (again I'm trying to comprehend that)  
Unanswered questions still (things to be are meant to end)  
  
Am I over her? (am I over her?)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her?)  
I can't think straight  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
It's water under the bridge  
But I can't seem to forget  
All the plans we made, all the time we spent  
Makes me reminisce  
I still see your face  
All this love I can't replace  
Am I over (am I over)  
Am I over her? (her now)  
  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her? (am I)  
Am I over her? (am I over)  
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love my love)  
I can't think straight (my love)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)  
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)  
  
No  
Am I over her?  
No not over her no  
Ohhhhhh  
Am I over her?  
  
Am I over her? (over her)  
Am I over her?  
Am I over her?  
Tell me am I really over my my love (am I over her, am I over her?)  
I can't think straight (I'm not over her)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love? (ahh oooh)  
  
I'm not over my my my love  
I'm not over my my my love  
I'm not over my my my love (oh no no)  
I'm not over my my my love  
  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my my my love)  
Am I over her? (I'm not over my love my love, she's my love, she's my)  
Tell me am I really over my my love (she's my everything)  
I can't think straight (she's my everything, my everything)  
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love?  
  
Not over not over my love  
Not over not over my love  
I'm not over not over my love  
Am I over her?  
Not over not over my love..

Intimacy's  
Fresh from my dreams  
Over a triple X movie screen  
I couldn't care less about being seen  
A higher self esteem if you're on me?  
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)  
I say baby do you think  
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth  
But instead it just rottens me  
Spoiled crazy  
  
I said,  
Public display of affection  
(Gotta make 'em)  
Pointing in that direction  
(Watch me, watch me)  
Public display of affection  
Makes them wish they had it this way  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
Remember at the beach we brought the sheets  
We were harassed by police  
Good thing we didn't go too deep  
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams  
I just need you in my reach  
Baby your suspense can be intense  
It's got me convinced, oh yeah  
You're the fingers to my instrument  
  
Public display of affection  
(Gotta make 'em)  
Pointing in that direction  
(Watch me, watch me)  
Public display of affection  
Makes them wish they had it this way  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
From the lobby to the patio  
(Boy you're so crazy)  
And we're so compatible  
From the Starbucks to the Navho  
(Hmm, nasty)  
And we're so compatible  
  
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies  
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty  
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
Your P-D-A, hey hey  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
I wanna run  
(I want your P-D-A)  
All over your body  
(I, I, I want your P-D-A)  
I wanna run  
(I want your P-D-A)  
All over your body  
(I want your P-D-A)  
  
I want your P-D-A  
(That's right)  
Public display of affection  
Mmm I want your PDA

(On memory's bliss of you)  
  
The candle plays the hourglass  
The days go and all I do is  
Think of you and wonder where you are at night  
Oh I remember everything  
Every smile, and even all  
The reasons why you say  
I pushed you out of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby you set me  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
  
Destiny is everything  
Reality's replaced you with  
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh  
Bet you say that I don't care  
I bet you say that I don't even think of you  
But God knows how wrong you are  
  
Baby will you be there when the morning comes?  
(Baby will you be there?)  
Just give me time (just give me time)  
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)  
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?  
After all the time I've spent, wishing you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sadness that overwhelmed me  
My mind flies and carelessly  
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh  
I guess that's just the was it goes  
Forever's gone so now I must  
Place you with all the things that I can never have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on now  
I know this much is true  
I know this much is true

Baby, please try to forgive me  
Stay here don't put out the glow  
Hold me now don't bother  
If every minute it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man that I've become  
oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Looking back on the things I've done  
I was trying to be someone  
Played my part, kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Sadness is beautiful  
Loneliness is tragical  
So help me I can't win this war  
oh no  
Touch me now don't bother  
If every second it makes me weaker  
You can save me from the man I've become  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm here with my confession  
Got nothing to hide no more  
I don't know where to start  
But to show you the shape of my heart  
  
I'm looking back on things I've done  
I never want to play the same old part  
Keep you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart  
  
Looking back on the things I've done  
I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone)  
Played my part, kept you in the dark  
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (Now let me show you the true shape
of my heart)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Show you the shape of my heart

So empty, can't feel no more,  
As I'm left with my tears on the floor  
I wait for my heart to mend,  
But you keep tearing a hole  
  
Inside, I'm so lost,  
In the middle of my heart  
It's a battlefield of love,  
I've been fighting for too long  
  
And now I'm shattered,  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
What am I still here for,  
Could it be that I'm just waiting  
Hoping you'd rescue me,  
And put the pieces together again  
  
Inside, I'm so lost,  
In the middle of my heart  
It's a battlefield of love,  
I've been fighting for too long  
  
And now I'm shattered  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
Tell me what you're really here for,  
If you never really loved me  
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough  
  
Cause all you had to say was that you ain't  
Looking for commitment  
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, hey  
  
You took my emotions  
And scattered them on the ground  
So hard to just pick up,  
And move on with life, again  
  
And now I'm shattered  
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)  
Oh how it hurts  
(But it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)  
I'm so shattered  
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you and me, ahh)  
So shattered  
(Can't believe, you left me, shattered)  
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh  
  
Can't believe, you and me, ahh

Show me the meaning of being lonely  
So many words for the broken heart  
It's hard to see in a crimson love  
So hard to breathe  
Walk with me and maybe  
Nights of light so soon become  
Wild and free, I could feel the sun  
Your every wish will be done  
They tell me  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
Life goes on as it never ends  
Eyes of stone observe the trends  
They never say, forever gaze, if only  
Guilty roads to an endless love  
There's no control, are you with me now?  
Your every wish will be done  
They tell me  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go  
Surrender my heart, body and soul  
How can it be you're asking me  
To feel the things you never show?  
Tell me why can't I be there where you are  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart  
Show me the meaning of being lonely  
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?  
Tell me why I can't be there where you are  
There's something missing in my heart

I'm so sorry  
That I called you  
I'm trying to pick up  
The pieces of my life  
I forgot that we were over  
Tell me what went wrong  
Wrong, wrong, wrong  
Twelve days, four hours, twenty minutes  
I'm stuck and you know you've got me in it  
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame  
Shame, shame, shame  
We had it all  
This love so strong  
Now everything  
We had is gone  
If you could read my mind  
You'd know I've crossed that line  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Six miles, twelve lights till your front door  
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before  
Does he know that it's me you've been talking to?  
Shame, shame, shame  
  
If you could read my mind  
I'm gonna fight to get you back this time  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
I'm tired of all these lies  
There's nothing but regret behind these eyes  
All this love I could never show  
I don't care any more  
Give a damn who knows  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you back with me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisting my soul  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run (nowhere to run)  
Girl I can't let you go (nowhere to hide)  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Yeah, I just can't leave you alone  
Yeah, yeah  
Tired of all the lies  
Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride  
Gonna shout it from a mountain top  
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we've cried  
Gonna break down these walls  
Gonna stand tall  
Gonna

Wanna be there just in time  
Wanna be your shining knight  
Protect you like a soldier  
  
I wanna be the first in line  
Be the one to save your life  
All I wanna do is hold you  
  
But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe...oh oh oh  
  
I will be your soldier  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
You don't have to hide your scars  
I'll be there when you fall apart  
And fix you like a soldier  
  
You don't have to go to far  
Baby just lay down your arms  
Now that the battle's over  
  
But somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe, oh oh oh  
  
I will be your soldier  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder  
You know I will always be your soldier  
  
Somebody shot you down right in the middle of a war outside  
Words mean so little when you've heard those lies  
You need someone to make you believe, make you believe!  
  
I will be your soldier (I will ooh)  
I, I'll stand and fight until it's over (ooh yeah)  
Oh, and if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know!)  
You know I will always be your soldier (soldier)  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh  
And if your heart is getting colder (heart is getting colder)  
You know I will always be your soldier (soldier, soldier)  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh (I will be your soldier, oh yeah)  
And if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know)  
You know I will always be your soldier

So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
It's like the world is on your shoulders  
Now nothing's making sense  
You just wanna quit  
You runaway but you just don't know  
How to feel what is real  
You're not alone  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life  
  
Then, sometimes you got to crawl  
Before you start to walk  
I'll be there  
I've had my rainy days  
You try to keep up a smile  
You go the extra mile  
You run the race no matter where your place  
You know which way to go so turn the page  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life  
  
It's hard to be strong  
No right seems wrong  
And nobody hears what you say  
So don't be afraid  
Hold on to your faith  
I swear to you there will be better days  
  
So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
It's like the world is on your shoulders  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody falls, everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
  
Everybody falls (Everybody falls), everybody cries (everybody cries)  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again, give it one more try  
Everybody's got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life, story of your life  
It's the story of my life

Oh oh oh  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When it's dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest noise  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
I looked down  
And my shirt's turning red  
I'm spinning around  
Felt her lips on my neck  
And her voice  
In my ear  
Like I missed you  
Want you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Straight through my heart  
A single bullet got me  
I can't stop the bleeding  
Oh oh  
Straight through my heart  
She aimed and she shot me  
I just can't believe it  
Oh oh  
No I can't resist  
And I can't be hit  
I just can't escape this love  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
  
Thought I moved  
More than on  
Thought I could  
Fool her charm  
I really wanna go  
But I can't leave her alone  
Oh oh  
  
Hear the sound  
Of a love so loud  
I just can't  
I just can't  
Ignore this feeling  
Said she missed me  
And she wants me  
Wants me tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the heart  
Of the night  
When it's dark  
In the lights  
I heard the loudest voice  
A gunshot on the floor  
Oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
My heart, my heart, my heart  
Straight through my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
(Soldier down) my heart  
Oh oh

I, I've waited all my life  
To step out from the light  
And see the shadows fading.  
You, you've always stood so tall  
I've never thought you'd fall,  
  
But now it's you that's fading!  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Oh, oh, oh so you want, there's no need to want  
Stand up face to face the stage  
Up high, but we'll reach higher!  
I will tell the soul if you cry  
I can hold you, why you're crying now?  
Pre-Chorus:  
I know that inside you're delicate  
But you say that  
You don't need someone to take care of you, but  
Chorus:  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!  
I know that inside you're delicate  
And, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of!  
Baby, baby, baby  
I, I, I take care of you, you, you  
Take care of you!  
Take care of you!

So just tell me how you wanna be done

You seem like you don't play stupid tricks  
  
Sweety you are so beautiful

How to behave, oh how to please you

Let me feel those hips  
You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you

And tell me everything you want  
  
Girl you told me what was in the past  
All the relationships that never last  
No man ever let you be free  
And oh you're fed up with the jealousy  
  
I'll give you all the freedom that you need  
Baby you and I will succeed  
I like to know what I need to do  
How to behave, oh how to please you  
I can't take it, oh come home

You can tell me what you wanna do  
If you want me to bring the freak outta you

Don't want violated things that make you sad  
Let me just find it right here pretty lady  
We can make it baby  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
What if we loose all the money baby  
What if there's nothing but you and me  
Tell me what would you do pretty lady  
Would you at least take care of me  
  
You can tell me how you deal the stress  
When everything becomes a big mess  
We stay strong and fight it off  
Or would you pack your shhh, and take off..

Hey yeah  
  
That's the way I like it  
  
Somebody told me that you're not my kind  
So have I lost my mind?  
You keep on doing all the things I like  
You've got me hypnotized  
But that's the way I like it  
  
Girl you make me wanna move  
It's the price I got to pay  
For all the things you do  
But I like it  
Gotta listen to the groove  
And you gotta listen well  
The way you do it  
That's the way I like it  
  
Everybody now  
I like it  
Everybody now  
That's the way I like it  
Everybody come on  
I like it  
Everybody come on  
That's the way I like it  
  
Oh mystery lady, you've got somethin' I like  
Tell me you're here to stay (ooh yeah)  
You're dangerous, oh baby  
Could you do me right?  
Will you come out to play?

Gotta listen to the groove  
And you gotta listen well

There are people who say what you want to hear  
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear  
When you really, really love someone  
And I'm right when I say that you want them near  
And if you can't even tell  
Them things that they want to hear  
  
[Chorus]  
Always forever, all the things she said  
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed  
I will never leave you  
All the love I thought she had  
But can you blame me, no,  
'Cause that's what she said  
That's what she said  
She told me we'd see forever  
That's what she said, she said, yeah  
  
And,  
There are people who that say what they really mean  
She said she'd always be there  
She said she'd always care  
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love  
Tell me why do you know  
How stars can fall from above  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep  
But you're not hurting' yourself  
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me)  
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean  
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me  
  
Oh, you said how much you really cared  
Just when I thought I was in love  
Girl, how could you dare  
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once  
To the face of the one that I love so much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh that's what she said

It takes a lot to know what is love  
It's not the big things, but the little things  
That can mean enough  
A lot of prayers to get me through  
And there is never a day that passes by  
I don't think of you  
You were always there for me  
Pushing me and guiding me  
Always to succeed  
  
[Chorus]  
You showed me  
When I was young just how to grow  
You showed me  
Everything that I should know  
You showed me  
Just how to walk without your hands  
'Cause mom you always were  
The perfect fan  
  
God has been so good  
Blessing me with a family  
Who did all they could  
And I've had many years of grace  
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face  
I want to thank you for what you've done  
In hopes I can give back to you  
And be the perfect son  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You showed me how to love  
You showed me how to care  
And you showed me that you would  
always be there  
I want to thank you for that time  
And I'm proud to say you're mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause mom you always were,  
Mom you always were  
Mom you always were,  
you know you always were'  
Cause mom you always were, the perfect fan  
  
I love you mom

Yeah ooh uh  
  
This one's for the mothers who have lost a child  
And this one's for the gypsies who've left their hearts behind  
This is for the strangers sleeping in my heart  
Who take what they want (yeah) and leave while it's still dark  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
All by themselves (all by themselves)  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved (the unloved)  
  
This one's for the bridesmaid, never the bride  
This one's for the dreamers who lock their faith inside (who lock their faith
inside)  
And this is for the widows who think there's only one  
For the dying fathers who never told their sons  
  
No one is glamorously lonely  
Follow your heart (follow your heart)  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry (one last cry)  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved (unloved)  
The unloved  
  
Oh tomorrow the sun will shine  
And dry the tears in your eyes  
Suddenly love comes alive  
Suddenly love comes alive  
  
For one last cry  
Just one last cry  
Ohh  
  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
This is a song for the unloved (loved)  
This is the music for one last cry (one last cry)  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
  
(This is this is)  
This is a song for the unloved  
This is the music for one last cry  
This is a prayer that tomorrow will help me leave the past behind  
It's a song for the unloved  
Song for the unloved (the unloved)

There's me looking down at my shoes  
The one smiling like the sun that's you  
What were you thinking?  
What was the song inside your head?  
There's us going on about a band  
Working out how we'd play our hands  
I lay there dreaming later, all alone in my bed  
If I was stupid maybe careless so were you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Freeze frame, I'm not about to cry  
It's to late for us to change, why try?  
I've got a camera tucked away inside my heart  
If I'm a loser or just unlucky, so are you  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Somewhere between then and now  
I looked away when you said we'll never change  
And if you think what might have been  
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Not everything is supposed to come true  
Some words are best unsaid  
Some love is not really love at all  
I'll keep everything I shared with you  
And that's enough there's us  
Some love is not really love at all  
There's us  
Some love is not really love at all  
There's us  

Got a million reasons to run and hide  
I don't blame you for being scared (for being scared, no)  
'Bout a novel long, all the pain that he's caused you  
  
Baby I'm fully aware (I'm fully aware)  
If I could change the stories ending to me and you  
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do  
  
[Chorus]  
I could be the one  
Give you all my love  
Forget what he has done to you  
I'm here now  
Open up to me  
Love will set you free  
If ever you believe then  
Please believe in me  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is us  
This is love  
This is love  
Let the world know baby, this is us  
  
I know everything isn't meant to last  
Box up all those photographs  
Your moving on, yeah  
I could flip back over that hour glass  
And refill the better half (the better half)  
  
And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend  
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone  
Would you let your past go  
I'll take it slow  
'Cause there's no need to rush when I know

I know that I  
I can't believe  
Just what the path has brought me  
To the man I want to be  
And I know that we  
Have had some times  
That we can't forget the struggle  
Cause we have so far to go  
  
I know we have changed  
But change can be so good  
So lets not forget why it's understood  
That  
  
[Chorus]  
Time (time)  
Look where we are and what we've been through  
Time (time)  
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)  
Time  
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday  
Baby time is what is, come what may  
  
I remember when  
Mom used to say  
That things are getting better  
And you'll soon be on your way  
Remember those days  
That we would sing at the drop of a dime  
Way back when nothing else mattered  
  
I know we have changed  
But change can be so good  
So lets not forget why it's understood  
That  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So here we are (here we are)  
And we'll always stick together  
And through it all you know we owe it all  
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Time goes on and on everyday  
Time is what it is  
Come what may  
Come what may

[AJ:]  
The first night that we met  
I will never forget  
Baby, you were a star  
From that point in time  
It was always you and I shining  
So beautiful  
When we're out with your friends  
You treat me like I'm dead  
It was like I'm invisible  
  
[Nick:]  
(I can't let it go)  
That was unforgettable  
(I can't let it go)  
I just wanna let you know  
(I can't let it go)  
Situations unlivable  
(I can't let it go)  
I can't let it go  
(I can't let it go)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tell me what you say that you want me  
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons  
You always bring me down in public  
When nobody's around you say that you love me  
Make me say oh no  
I see you all alone  
I'm halfway out the door  
Unless you turn around  
And you treat me right  
  
[Brian:]  
Oh, you got me twisted  
Oh, you got me twisted  
I'm not someone you can just disrespect  
How would you feel if you were in my shoes  
Feelin' used with your heart bruised  
  
[Nick:]  
(I can't let it go)  
The situations critical  
(I can't let it go)  
Relationship is pitiful  
(I can't let it go)  
Everything's falling apart  
(I can't let it go)  
Cause you're so hypocritical  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[All:]  
You're just no good for me  
You're no good for me  
You're just no good for me  
I know you're no good for me  
  
[Howie:]  
You know  
It's wrong to treat me cold  
I've no one to hold  
One day I'm gonna say goodbye  
What's it gonna be  
Girl I'm gonna leave  
Unless you turn around  
And treat me right  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[Howie:]  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
[Brian:]  
Say that you want me  
  
[Howie:]  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
[Repeat Chorus]

Let me tell you about this girl I know  
First glance and damn she stole my heart  
She amazes me  
  
The way she moves, just the way she moves  
Hold me back just the way she moves  
Take me to the disco  
Make me dance  
  
Oh honey spinnin' round' like a queen  
And the way you do your thing  
Oh you're mesmerizing me  
Oh I'mma tell you how I feel  
And the feeling is so real  
Baby

Underneath the willow tree  
Kissing, loving, making sweet sexy baby  
The grass is greener on the other side  
There's no other side when it's you and I  
Tonight, let's count the stars  
  
Yeah, oh time will always be our enemy  
For tonight baby, come lie here next to me

Just another butterfly sigh

And I'mma call you back  
Kiss me

Your words burn, they're melting  
What we have, I'm breaking down  
No reason, no warning, no love loss  
You might as well  
  
Take our pictures off the walls tonight  
I don't wanna see you no more  
I don't wanna feel you no more  
Take our memories, throw them all aside  
I hope you finally get what you want  
Now you know  
  
I didn't wanna live without ya  
I didn't wanna love without ya  
I used to think I'd die without ya  
Now it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I can't feel without ya  
You know I can't deal without ya  
And now I got a life without ya  
Now it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
And this constant echoing  
In my head,  
I'm spinning 'round  
You seem so unaffected  
While I go on in this hell  
  
Take our pictures off the walls tonight  
I don't wanna see you no more  
I don't wanna feel you no more  
Take our memories, throw them all aside  
I hope you finally get what you want  
Now you know  
  
I didn't wanna live without ya  
I didn't wanna love without ya  
I used to think I'd die without ya  
Now it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I can't feel without ya  
You know I can't deal without ya  
And now I got a life without ya  
And it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
We can be undone  
  
You're talking now  
And I'm hearin' everything that you say  
And I'm holding on is a real phrase  
And it's dragging me along to my grave  
It's dragging me to my grave  
  
You're talking now  
And I'm hearin' everything that you say  
And I'm holding on is a real phrase  
And it's dragging me along to my grave  
  
I didn't wanna live without ya  
I didn't wanna love without ya  
I used to think I'd die without ya  
Now it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I can't feel without you,  
You know I can't deal without you  
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me  
That we could be undone  
  
I didn't wanna live without ya  
I didn't wanna love with ya  
I used to think I'd die without ya  
Now it's killing me  
That we can be undone  
  
I can't feel without you,  
You know I can't deal without you  
And now I got a life without you, and it's killing me  
That we could be undone

Darkness falls  
I thought I heard you call  
Or was it just a dream?  
I'm a little scared knowing you're out there  
So far away from me  
  
Its been so long  
Since you've been gone  
Every day I miss you more  
Now I wanna know  
Why did you have to go?  
What were you looking for?  
  
And I hope you find your way,  
But I can't wait to say  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
So you lost your way but that's yesterday  
And I don't care where you've been  
Cause every step you've taking since you left  
Has brought you back again  
And I hope you see it clear  
My love has always been right here  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
I'm glad you found your way  
And I hope you are here to stay  
Oooooooh  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart ...

Everybody groove to the music  
Everybody jam, we've been waiting so long  
Just can't hold it back no more  
Creepin' up and down now  
It's time for me to let it go  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
Well, I'm creepin' up on your left  
Straight up funky when I get with you  
I get ruthless when I get wet  
Keep the party packed in my corner  
Tough like to keep the crowd hype  
Get up on this just to get right  
What you want is what you're gonna get  
Backstreet's got the special effects  
If you really wanna see  
What we can do for you  
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  
We've got it going on for years  
We've been waiting so long  
Just can't hold it back no more  
Creepin' up and down now  
It's time for me to let it go  
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it  
Come now everybody  
We've go it goin' on for years  

Ohh oh yeah  
  
You don't run with the crowd  
You go your own way  
You don't play after dark  
You light up my day  
  
Got your own kind of style  
That sets you apart  
Baby that's why you've camptured my heart  
  
I know sometimes you feel  
Like you don't fit in  
And this world doesn't know  
What you have within  
  
When i look at you  
I see something rare  
A rose that can grow anywhere  
And there's no one i know that can compare  
  
Chorous:  
What makes you different  
Makes you beautiful  
What's there inside you  
Shines through to me  
In your eyes i see all the love i'll ever need  
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me  
  
You've got something so real  
You touched me so deep (touched me so deep)  
The material things  
Don't matter to me  
So come as you are  
You've got nothing to prove  
You won me with all the you do  
  
And i wanna take this chance to say to you  
  
Chorous  
  
You don't know how you've touched my life  
Oh there's so many ways, i just can't describe  
You taught me what love is supposed to be  
It's all the little things that made you beautiful to me  
  
Chorous  
  
(in background)  
Everything in you is beautiful  
Love you give shines right through me  
Everything in you is beautiful  
Beautiful to me (to me)

I tried to pick the pieces up  
And I can't think of starting over  
We used to share the stars above  
I don't wanna think it changed  
And now I gotta move on  
I've gotta catch up to the world  
Even though I gave you my life  
As wrong as it seems I know it's right  
But is there a place that I can go away  
To escape the love that I will forever know  
  
Where can we go from here?  
All I know is that I love you still  
Sometimes we do things against our will  
I know I cry lonely tears  
Where can we go from here?  
  
Why, Why do I cry inside?  
When love is gone away  
And how, How can I carry on  
When I know all the love is gone  
Tell me where can I go to get away?  
From the pain of loving you  
Tell me where  
  
Where can we go from here?  
All I know is that I love you still  
Sometimes we do things against our will  
I know I cry lonely tears  
Where can we go from here?  
Oooh

I know he's driving a fancy car  
When you're with him  
You're feeling like a star  
But when I'm home alone I think only of you  
So what do you know  
How does it go  
  
So how can he buy a love that's not for sale  
If you two were so in love I couldn't tell, baby  
Girl, but when I'm home alone I hear your heart, it spells  
You gotta know  
And how does it go  
  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
Oh yeah  
  
So let's take some time out to find a way  
Cuz there are just so many things I need to say  
(So many things I need to say)  
Cause when the lights are down and love is in the air  
And I need to know  
Do you really care  
(Do you really care baby)  
  
Who do you love (tell me who do you love)  
Who do you love  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love (oh yeah)  
Who do you love  
Oh yeah  
  
Girl I find just I can't leave you alone  
(Ain't nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong)  
I promise I will make it back home  
And if you're ever in need  
Put your full trust in me  
And I will never leave you at home  
  
Who do you love (tell me who, yeah)  
Who do you love (I need to know baby)  
Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be  
I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know  
Who do you love  
Who do you love  
  
Who do you love
