So now love is gone  
And I can't go on  
Love is gone  
I want to say, now it's just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start, yeah  
But the words didn't come out right  
So I'll tell you straight from my heart  
  
You meant more to me  
Then I let you see  
You held on somehow  
All your tenderness and your sweet caress  
I miss you now  
  
But a head strong stubborn man  
Only works it out the best he can  
Valentines he never sent  
There's not enough time he's a working man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't stop falling  
Heartaches calling  
Finds you after the fall  
Saints or sinners  
Take no prisoners  
What's left, after you fall  
No not much no  
  
I said love is gone  
I can't go on  
Now love is gone  
I want to say but it's just too late  
Waited far too long  
  
Shoulda told you then I knew  
Shoulda told you right from the start, yeah  
But the words didn't come out right  
So I'll tell you straight from my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no not much  
After the fall  
After you fall  
After you fall

You paint a rainbow of emotion  
You are the rhythm...life is the dance... yeah  
You are the queen of many faces  
How you can move me with just one glance  
I don't stand a chance  
  
All the things I love about you  
Keeps amazing me now  
All the things I love about you  
  
You're a garden of many hidden secrets  
Leaving clues to the mysteries you will reveal  
You are the eyes of intuition  
You see through illusion... you know what's real  
Just something you feel  
  
All of the things I love about you  
Ten thousand dreams you make come true  
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...  
  
All the things I love about you  
Keeps amazing me now  
All the things I love about you  
  
My while world revolves around you  
Changing colors with the moon...  
Keep amazing me I never get enough  
  
You twist the truth still your're sincere  
To get your way you'll shed a tear  
Don't need a reason when you're beautiful...  
  
All of the things I love about you  
Then thousand dreams you make come true  
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...  
My whole world revolves around you  
Changing colors with the moon.  
  
All the things I love about you

Up against the world as you face your destiny  
Don't let today's regrets affect tomorrow's dreams  
When you shoot for the moon and you miss your mark  
Baby you'll still end up so high among the stars  
  
Anyone can give up when it's time to risk it all  
Knowing where you stand and you'll never fall  
  
If you can see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream now then you know that anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
Take it brick by brick, throw away the stone  
Take a chance on something, build a castle you call home  
Live for the moment, you can't put into words  
Don't keep a song inside, let your voice be heard  
  
Find a true desire, don't be afraid to cry  
Better to reach for something, than to never have tried  
  
It's time to see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream, you know that anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, believe that anything is possible  
  
It's time to see how you imagine your life  
You want to dream, anything is possible  
It's not who you are, it's where you wanna go  
You don't need a miracle, anything is possible  
  
It's the choice you make, it's the time you take  
It's the risk you take, you know that anything is possible  
It's a choice you make, it's the time you take  
It's a risk you take, believe that anything is possible

A place in time  
Can make the grind  
Fall out when you want to  
Anyplace, anytime  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Dark at one  
Are you havin' fun  
Come on out with your play toys  
You've got the blues on the run  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Yes, I'm gonna love you anyway yeah, yeah, yeah  
No, no, no, no  
Feelin' low  
How I loved you so  
Cut out all your teasing  
You may never know  
All the world loves another  
You know you can't find no other  
Still I'm gonna love you, yeah  
Yeah, yes I know  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway  
Anyway

I work all day to make a livin'  
No one needs  
Your kind of attitude  
Your sharp tongue  
It cuts me like a razor  
Lip service gets you nowhere  
No, no, no  
Back talk I don't need it  
Be -be -be -back talk I don't need it  
No, no, no back talk  
Don't want to hear it  
Don't give me no back talk  
Watch that temper  
You watch what you're sayin'  
  
Don't talk to me  
With that tone of voice  
Your act is pushin' me  
To the limit  
Can't stand it, can't stand it  
Can't take it any more  
Don't wan't back talk  
I don't need it  
Don't give me back talk  
I don't want to hear it  
Don't give me back talk  
Don't need it, no  
I believe you enjoy  
This aggravation  
Lately that's all I get from you  
You were born to drive me crazy  
Can't take it, can't take it any more from you  
No, no more  
Back talk, I don't need it  
Back talk, I don't need it  
Back talk, Don't want to hear it  
Don't give me no back talk  
Sassy back talk  
Don't give me no sassy back talk  
No I don't want to hear it  
No don't really need it  
No don't give me no  
Give me no don't you give me no

Runnin' out of self-control  
Gettin' close to an overload  
Up against a no win situation  
Shoulder to shoulder, push and shove  
I'm hangin' up my boxin' gloves  
I'm ready for a long vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will  
Oh be good to yourself  
You're walkin' a high-wire, caught in a crossfire  
Oh be good to yourself  
  
When you can't give no more  
They want it all but you gotta say no  
I'm turnin' off the noise that makes me crazy  
Lookin' back with no regrets  
To forgive is to forget  
I want a little piece of mind to turn to  
  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will  
Oh be good to yourself  
You're walkin' a high-wire, caught in a crossfire  
Oh be good to yourself  
  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will

Young and wild with a madness  
I wouldn't listen  
I thought I knew just exactly  
The way life would be, you see  
You came along and you showed me  
Just what I was missing  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Oh, then I could see  
  
They said it wouldn't last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause we've always known that we belong  
And we're better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing I'll be there if you should fall  
Oh, we're better together, all right, yeah yeah  
  
Running alone, I was searching  
While you were there waiting  
Lessons in love I was learning  
Were all right with me, you see  
You changed my world and you gave me  
Aw, the kiss you were saving  
Oh, we had each other to fight for  
Oh, when no one believed  
  
They said it wouldn't last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause we've always known that we belong  
And we're better together  
If we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing I'll be there if you should fall  
Yeah, we're better together  
  
Ooh it gets so lonely out there  
Oh, playing my solitaire  
  
Oh, Mustang  
All right  
Wait a minute  
Young and wild with a madness  
This time I listened, baby  
You opened my eyes with your sweet love  
Ooh, yeah, you set me free  
Taken from OldieLyrics.com  
They said it wouldn't last  
We proved them wrong  
We learned to fly above the storm  
Cause we've always known where we belong  
Yeah we're better together  
Oh, if we got our backs against the wall  
Somehow we survive through it all  
Knowing I'll be there if you should fall  
Oh we're better together  
So much better, girl, we're better together  
Better together, all right  
Listen  
Let's get together, let's get together, all right  
Let's get together, well  
Let's get together, let's get together right now  
It's just, it's just better that way

Jimmy wanted her the moment that she stumbled his way  
With a cocktail in her hand, she knew how she'd win the game  
There were beautiful in all the right places  
She keeps her rendezvous with soup opera faces  
She started rumors that were driving him crazy  
He couldn't stop the things they'd say  
  
And they live for, passion, love and pain  
In a rage of jealousy and fame  
And they watch their dreams go up on flames  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Wo... burnin'...  
  
In the kingdom of pretenders love is not what it seems  
Jimmy cried and then he punished her  
No one heard her scream  
On the outside, it's all crimson and clover  
On the inside, they know it's over  
  
And the band of lawyers that steal the show  
As they watch their world go up in smoke  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Wo... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'...  
  
When we return a story of a 5 alarm fire  
Late last night in the prestigious Hollywood hills  
Where one of the most controversial marriages in the  
Entertainment industry went up in smoke, arson is suspected  
It is still under investigation...  
  
You know I love you, you know you're my girl,  
I'd never hurt you... no  
  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Castles burning... in the dead of night  
Burnin'... burnin'  
  
All is fair in love and war, but war is hell...  
In the heart of the night, in the middle of the big bad city

One precious moment in a state of grace  
Send the mantra to an endless night  
Feel the glow, feel the peace of mind  
True perfection in one true light  
  
Pathways in my mind that lead to nowhere  
Promises of happiness that leave me wanting more  
When my desire becomes a nightmare  
Feel paranoia about what I'm wishing for  
If I could just let go of who I think I am  
Surrender to the silence, help me understand  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love  
  
Voices in my head that try to rule me  
I've found a place where I can't hear them anymore  
My own illusions come to fool me  
Lost in emotions that I've never touched before  
If I could get beyond what's in my mind  
Free my spirit, leave the world behind  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love  
  
One precious moment in a state of grace  
Send the mantra to an endless night  
Feel the glow, feel the peace of mind  
True perfection in one true light  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love

I bet you, she's the one  
Who helped you, come undone  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
You're overdue  
I bet you, she'd like to say  
She's changed you, in every way  
She's so sure  
Now she's on the run  
She ran a red light  
You jumped the gun  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
So now you, lived a mystery  
You won't be  
Just one more casualty  
You stumble, before you fall  
Won't be the last time  
No not at all  
In motion, it's on her way  
The red light  
Somebody's got to pay  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
You're overdue  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Love's a viper, steals your soul  
  
So now just where do we go  
Tell me where  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Love's a viper, steals your soul

Down the lowest I can go  
With no one left to turn  
On the edge, I lose control  
Before I crash and burn  
Can I turn around  
Slow it down, oh  
  
Hold on, we've still got living to do  
So far gone  
See life for someone like you  
In your eyes  
You showed me reasons to live  
Take time  
The time it takes to forgive  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make it change for the better  
  
I was dying, a drowning man  
And I wish you well  
Pull me from the darkness  
And save me from myself  
  
Wake up, shake it off  
Let go  
What I'm pretending to be  
I know  
I'm still the man I could be, yeah  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fight  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
Make a change for the better  
  
I'm waking up to find  
A different state of mind  
There was a new place, I'm okay  
I've changed for the better  
  
I've opened up my eyes  
I'm glad to be alive  
It's never too late  
To cheat fate  
Changed for the better  
  
And now then there is no hope  
Until we are faced without  
We can never fall in love  
Until we learn to live without  
In our love we can't find peace  
Without conflict in our lives  
And the healing won't begin, oh  
'Til we open up our eyes  
  
It's my life, it'll change for the better  
I've faced the light  
It's worth the fights  
See a new day  
Start a new way  
Get it straight  
It all comes together  
  
Made my mind up  
There's still time enough  
I'm all right  
Made a change for the better  
  
Change for the better  
Change for the better, yeah  
Oh, oh, oh  
Yeah, I'm all right  
Oh

People waiting for some kind of sign from above  
Lost in the shadows of doubt, need a message of love  
Nothing is certain in uncertain times  
Hard to see beyond the greed and the crime  
  
Oh, the faithful refuse to give up  
Homeless and hungry survive just enough  
Learn to smile through it all  
They are blessed from above  
  
Never stop believin', change will come  
There's a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard  
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope  
Founded on faith, connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah, that's where I am from  
The city of hope  
  
On the edge of the world, across oceans of blue  
It's a place where a dream has a chance to come true  
Don't be fooled by illusions or falling from grace  
Make your own destiny, find your own place  
Where the streets beat the lessons of trouble open play  
  
Never stop believin', change will come  
There's a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard  
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope  
Founded on faith, connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah, that's where I am from  
The city of hope  
  
I hear them whisper, "send in a prayer,"  
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder  
  
Never stop believin', change will come  
There's a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard  
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope  
  
Yeah that's where I am from  
The city of hope

City of the angels.  
City of the angels.  
Walkin' and talkin' and laughin'  
About dreamin' the things that you want will work out.  
People in places where you want to be,  
I'm lost in the city, who's got the key?  
  
[Chorus:]  
City of the angels,  
Oo, I hear you callin' me.  
City of the angels  
I've got this feelin' that things will work out.  
I've got this feelin', and there ain't no doubt.  
I'm holdin' on, hopin' to find,  
Life in this city can bring peace of mind.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Just like, just like it used to be, yeah.  
City of the angels.  
I'm goin' home, home, bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye.  
Oh, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye  
Yeah, yeah, I'm leavin', leavin'  
Oo, oo, I'm goin' home  
I'm leavin', leavin'

We are one, we are one  
Distant rhythm in a troubled sky  
Angry clouds divide the sun  
Feels like thunder and so do I  
Bloody silence has begun  
Flying like a wounded dove  
  
Tomorrow comes undone  
Surrender don't come easily  
We try to get over, over  
Falling together, together  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
  
Ask the question, what's goin' on  
Why raging children run  
Where's the father's legacy  
Where's the harvest of the son  
Close your eyes and tell me what you see  
I see the same thing, same thing  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
No, surrender don't come easily  
We try to get over, over  
  
Many colors of the spirit  
Many lives below the sun  
We are colors of the spirit  
We are many, we are one  
We are many, we are one

A double secret agent  
And he was paid to kill  
With cold steel magnum force is how the man possessed the skill  
He shot a man in Paris  
He did a job in L.A.  
And if the price was right, he'd surely  
Take your life away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wanted, dead or alive, blood for money, money  
Assault, homicide, blood for  
Money, money, money, money  
Wanted  
  
He drove a Maserati, lived up in the hills  
A cat with nine lives that's gone  
Too far to feel the chill  
He never though it'd happen  
It was his last mistake  
Cause he was gunned down by a  
Heartless woman's thirty eight.  
  
[Chorus]

"Well, since we're recording tonight,  
And we're ah, we're indebted to you to  
Let us be on your album. We have to thank  
You for that, this is your album you know.  
We're gonna do a brand new song about a  
Highway that runs from Detroit all the way  
Down to Florida. The Dixie Highway."  
  
I said, What you want to do  
Would you like to be with me?  
'Cause I'll meet you back stage, baby  
Love is feelin' fancy and free.  
We'll rock the night away down by the Dixie Highway,  
Yeah, down by the Dixie Highway.  
  
My love, my love, movin' to the left now, movin' to the right.  
My love, my love, Ooh soft and tender, ooh so tight  
My love, my love, oh, oh, ooh, Dixie Highway.  
I don't care what you want to be, baby,  
Long as you're happy and free.  
  
She said, That's quite all right.  
I think I'll spend the night,  
And I want to hold you, Stevie,  
I want to hold you tight.  
We'll rock the night away down by the Dixie Highway,  
Down by the Dixie Highway.  
  
My love, my love, rockin' and a rollin' the night away.  
My love, my love, ooh, makin' love till the break of day.  
My love, my love, oh, oh, ooh, Dixie Highway.  
I don't care what you want to be, baby,  
Long as you're happy and free.  
  
Baby, oh, girl, you drive me crazy.  
Baby, oh, girl, you drive me crazy, baby.  
I want to hold on you, come with you, love with you all the night.  
Foolin' who do you think you're foolin', baby?  
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Who do you think your foolin', baby?  
You want to hold on me, love on me, love with me all the night.  
  
My babe, move it to the left, now move it to the right all night.  
Oh, yeah, Dixie Highway.  
I wish I was in Dixie, Dixie, Dixie.

Do you recall  
That lonely summer day?  
We were together and things got in our way.  
Well, so you think that it's all over,  
And you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?  
  
Yes, I recall, the things you said that day  
You told me that you were leavin'  
Cause we can't go on this way  
You think that it's all over, and you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?  
  
Yes, it's the lovin' things  
That keeps us wandering.  
Yes, it's the lovin' things,  
Ooo, baby, love.  
  
Yes, it's the lovin' things  
That keeps us wandering.  
Yes, it's the lovin' things,  
  
Ooo, girl,  
Say you'll stay.  
You'll stay.  
You think that it's all over, and you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?

I don't know why, there's an open flame  
Burnin' in the game, it's me you blame  
I can't deny, it was a crime  
If you would let me try, maybe you'd change your mind  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Those little things, you say I do  
Well they might be true  
Tell me what good does it do  
When things go wrong, I'm the first you blame  
I try another way, still someone's gotta pay  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
Down on me girl  
I get lost sometimes  
In my crazy world  
  
Don't be down on me baby  
'Cause I love you  
'Cause I need you

In the morning, sunlight shining  
The face in the mirror knows the crime  
Voices cry from the darkness  
A broken promise one more time  
  
You say you believe in love  
And still you run  
You only believe in God when you come undone  
  
So here you are  
You brought everything on yourself  
So easy to fall  
When you're all alone by yourself  
  
He said he's tried everything he could  
A fool's illusion one more lie  
There'll be demons waitin' in the shadows of a concrete world  
Tears are runnin' tonight  
  
You say you believe in love  
And still you run  
You only believe in God when you come undone  
  
So here you are  
You brought everything on yourself  
So easy to fall, (easy to fall)  
When you're all alone by yourself  
  
Words unspoken  
The words unspoken  
The words unspoken  
The words unspoken

You've been tryin', very heard  
Now this time you've gone too far  
Your performance perfect  
In every way, perfect!  
I hear rumors all around  
Contracts and lawyers  
And champagne downtown  
Tell me what you think  
You want me to do  
I've been always fair with you  
Turning on me  
After all we've been through  
You want trouble then that's just  
The way it will be  
  
You're caught up in the power  
A blue magical maze  
Now the circle is broken  
In a spellbinding rage  
Better see if you're holdin'  
The wrong edge of the blade  
  
If it's sharp, if it cuts  
Enjoy yourself

Blood red sky fades into blue  
Miss your touch in shadows I'm waiting  
Sweet memories of holding you near  
In your eyes anticipating, uh huh  
  
One embrace and two worlds collide  
Feel the heat of our sweet surrender  
Melt away with me there's nothing else  
Time stands still when we are together  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
  
Letting go of all I knew  
My heart's racing fast  
Not sure where I'm going  
Nothing certain there's nothing to lose  
You by my side all that I know is  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
Woah woah woah woah with you  
  
With your sweet love I lose all track of time  
Till I don't know if it's day or night  
Before it all fades into the past  
Wanna see how long we can make it last  
Ooh come on closer  
Into my arms  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
Woah oh oh oh with you

He's just a young boy out of school  
Livin' his world like he wants to  
They're makin' laws, but they don't understand  
Turns a boy in to a fightin' man  
They won't take me  
They won't break me  
No one could tell him what to do  
Had to learn everything the hard way  
He's on the street, breakin' all the rules  
I'm tellin' you that he's nobody's fool  
They won't take me  
They won't break me  
Now he's leavin', gettin' out from this masquerade  
Oh gotta go  
  
I'm finally out in the clear and I'm free  
I've got dreams I'm livin' for  
I'm movin' on where they'll never find me  
Rollin' on to anywhere  
I'll break away, yes I'm on my way  
Leavin' today, yes I'm on my way  
Just when you think you had it all figured out  
Runnin' scared can change your mind  
I never knew I had so much to give  
How hard times can fool ya  
Oh I'm okay, I'm alright  
Feelin' good out on your own  
  
I'll break away, I'll break away tonight  
I've got dreams I'm livin' for  
I'll break away  
Yes, I'm on my way  
I'm leaving', leavin' today  
Yes, I'm on my way  
This is my escape  
Yes, I'm on my way  
I'll break away  
Yes, I'm on my way

Kids hanging out on a Saturday night  
Waitin' on wheels, wanna go for a ride  
Cruisin' 'round town, just feels right  
Got to get away  
  
Blasting rock and hip hop, they know  
All dressed down with no place to go  
A difficult age just takin' it slow  
Wait for better days  
  
Can't stop the wild and restless  
Still the ritual goes on  
Following the footsteps  
Where their fathers used to run  
  
Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh, in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh, there's a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
  
Fashions go and come back around  
And vinyl LPs still got a cool sound  
Flash back to retro (retro)  
It's all new again  
Fighting wars under different names  
Losing daughters and sons, we all feel the pain  
Through the tears, why don't things ever change  
Between now and then  
  
While the radio's still playin'  
That familiar sweet love song  
We still share the same desire  
We all need to belong  
  
Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh there's a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
  
Some generations leave us heroes of their day  
With magic moments that still take our breaths away  
Some will inherit all the politics and blame  
And some will leave this world a better place  
Taken from OldieLyrics.com  
Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh there's a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Every generation  
They keep comin' around  
Every generation  
Na na na na na  
Yeah  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na

He goes to work in a brand new dawn  
With the early morning sunrise  
He's got his dream and he's holding on  
It's getting harder every day  
  
He loves a girl who speaks her mind  
Don't always look at life the same way  
Sharing truth that will heal in time  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
  
Time moves on as the fading town  
And they struggle with the changes  
The stores have closed, friends have moved away  
Now it's hope that sees him through  
  
The kids have gone but they'll see them all  
At the Sunday congregation  
Sharing dreams truth will heal in time  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
Ooh, it's words that divide them  
It's love that defines them  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
In our darkest hour, oh, we look to the sky  
With a silent prayer  
Believe that God's on our side  
In a land where freedom rings  
And where eagles fly  
Ooh yeah, yeah  
  
They want to believe something real  
Still they're searching  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
Yeah, it's words that divide them  
It's love that defines them  
They're keeping the faith in the heartland tonight  
  
Oh, I just want to believe it  
  
Give me something to believe in  
We all need something to believe in  
In the heart tonight  
  
Got faith  
Got dreams  
Yeah, we're keeping the faith alive

Highway run  
Into the midnight sun  
Wheels go round and round  
You're on my mind  
Restless hearts  
Sleep alone tonight  
Sendin' all my love  
Along the wire  
  
They say that the road  
Ain't no place to start a family  
Right down the line  
It's been you and me  
And lovin' a music man  
Ain't always what it's supposed to be  
  
Oh girl you stand by me  
I'm forever yours, faithfully  
  
Circus life  
Under the big top world  
We all need the clowns  
To make us smile  
Through space and time  
Always another show  
Wondering where I am  
Lost without you  
  
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair  
Two strangers learn to fall in love again  
I get the joy  
Of rediscovering you  
Oh girl, you stand by me  
I'm forever yours, faithfully  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Faithfully, I'm still yours  
I'm forever yours  
Ever yours, faithfully

And if you hold on through the night  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll sing you love songs  
And hold you tight  
And this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
  
And like a seed  
That's blessed by the sun  
A rose will come to you  
And as the song bird  
Flies through the sky  
He sings his song for you  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
Always be the same  
  
And if your colors all run dry  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll bring a rainbow to your eyes  
Yes this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same  
  
And if you hold on through the night  
I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll sing you love songs  
And hold you tight  
And this is what I'll do  
All for you, for you, all for you  
The clouds would spell out your name  
All for you, for you, all for you  
My love will always be the same

When you give your all and you're feeling small, don't you cry  
If you're crying loud you won't feel so proud, don't you cry  
  
There's a place to be, won't you stay with me, you can help us see,  
Here we are.  
  
Let yourself go by,  
You can touch the sky if you try.  
  
All you've got to show, you may never know, what you are  
If you ever try, can you tell me why, why you are  
Only you will know, and you picked your show,  
Can you tell me though, will you know?  
  
If you feel like me, you can't help but please, who you know  
If you're feelin' low, will you tell me though, who you are  
  
Only you will know, and you picked your show,  
Can you tell me though, will you know?  
  
If you feel like me, you can't help but please, who you know.

So I think I got it all in place now  
No distractions under control  
Yet there's something missing inside me  
I'm chasing shadows of myself  
And the clocks are ticking  
Oh my world is spinning  
Spinning 'round and 'round  
And 'round and 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
And I try  
I try to reason why  
Don't you know I can't go on this way  
Baby please don't walk away there is this place  
Where I toss away my pride  
So you can see that I'm the one  
To take you to a higher place this time  
  
I am on the outside looking in  
To a place where I will be  
Let me give you what you need from me  
I surrender my soul to you  
And my heart is pounding  
And a fire's burning  
And my head is spinning, 'round and 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I crash, and burn inside my mind  
It happens time and time again, I can't explain the way you make me feel  
Oh, I know, I don't have much to give  
But what I have I give to you with all the madness left inside of me  
With the madness left inside of me, oh  
  
[Chorus]

Oh, oh.  
Oh, baby.  
I love cookin' with honey.  
I love to make you feel funny.  
I love the way you do.  
I want, I want it with you, yeah.  
Homemade love, Jelly roll love.  
Homemade love.  
  
I need a jelly roll sweetie.  
Now, spread it oh spread it on me, babe.  
Feels so good, on the top.  
Spread it around, baby, 'til I drop ya'.  
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.  
Homemade love.  
  
Oh, baby, oh baby,  
I know you love it.  
Homemade love, oh, baby.  
I know you love it.  
So love it.  
  
Oh, homemade love, hot jelly roll love.  
Homemade love.  
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.  
Homemade love.  
Oh, baby, baby, baby  
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.  
Homemade love.  
  
Oh, smokin',  
Oh, baby, you're burnin'  
Oh, baby, it's boilin', ah.

Baby... too bad... I used to love you girl  
I... don't care... no more about your face  
No you... make me mad... the way you cat around  
With your lips, your legs  
And all your sexy ways  
Do you got another lover now  
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now  
No... no  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
Oh you... never hear  
A single word I say  
No you... turn away  
Where do you disappear  
Oh I've had enough  
You need to get a life  
It's all... so tired  
I think I'm out of here  
Do you got another lover now  
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now  
No.  
And when you're alone remember why  
You had never learned how to cry.  
No... no  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
(Vintage neal solo)  
Say you got another lover now  
Tell me who you think you're foolin' now  
(Chorus)  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
Ever since you walked away  
Said your last goodbye  
Oh... I can see it in your eyes  
All the damage has been done  
No more alibis  
Oh...  
Oh...  
(Neal solo reprise to exit)  
I'm awesome

I wake with the morning light  
Makin' love all through the night  
Was I dreaming  
Lyin' there I watch you sleep  
One kiss before I leave, what you've done to me  
I'm gonna tell the world... yeah  
  
Chorus:  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason  
  
I used to be a restless soul  
All the dreams I could not hold  
I was searchin'...  
I reached out and you were there  
I never though someone would care  
The way you do...  
You got me shakin' now girl  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason  
Oh no... no...  
  
I want your love... want you to stay... oh yeah  
You know you got me night and day  
Every day...  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
There'll be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason... yes I do  
Oh no... no... 'cause I got a reason... yeah  
  
Now I got a reason... yeah

Oh, I'm cryin', tears are fallin' down.  
I'm cryin' the lonely tears of clowns.  
I'm tryin' to wear a smilin' face.  
It was just yesterday things then they felt okay.  
Now that has all gone away.  
  
Oh, I'm cryin' the only tears of clowns.  
I'm tryin' tryin' and rain's fallin' down.  
I'm cryin' and that's a lonely place.  
If I could hide the pain, if I could stop the rain,  
Then all my cryin' could be gone.  
  
Oh, rain, who will stop the rain, the rain?  
Oh, I'm cryin', the tears are fallin' down.  
I'm tryin', the rain still beats the ground.  
I'm cryin' those lonely tears of clowns.  
  
Lonely, lonely tears,  
Lonely, lonely tears

Hold me... Let me dry those tears for you  
Be the healer... Of your heart he broke in two  
I wanna hold you close....  
But somethin' tells me to wait  
Is it too soon to touch,  
To reach for the love that you hide away...  
Talk to me... Tell me with your eyes  
What did he do... To make you feel this way inside  
  
Chorus:  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Come to me and don't be afraid  
I'm not that way  
  
Silence... Was meant to be broken  
Like waves on the shore  
Let your tears wash away these emotions  
I can't change the world,  
I can change your mind...  
I'll always be here, for you until you realize  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Broken trust... A failure in faith  
I'm not that way  
I'm not that way  
  
Cause life's too short for waistin'  
Waistin' precious time  
If time is what you need baby  
I'll give you all of mine  
One day you're gonna look at me  
And love is what you'll find...  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Come to me  
Bring back your faith  
Don't be afraid  
I'm not that way  
I'm not that way  
  
I want to hold you  
I want to hold you close  
Let me hear your heart baby

We were so close yet so far away  
I'd reach out, you'd be gone  
Moments that still talk my breath away  
There's so much more to life than loving you  
You don't need me, no...  
  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Time washes over, memories  
I can't look back no more  
Change has forsaken, our promises  
There's someone else for you to hold again  
So please stop your crying  
  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you  
  
Remember, remember, girl I remember  
I...can't wait all my life, on a street of broken dreams  
It could have been you my love (where are you now)  
Oh I...still wonder if you remember the night  
It could have been you (where are you now)  
Should have been you my love (where are you now)  
It could have been you my love, (where are you now)  
Remember...remember...remember

It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around you  
It's everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take each other's love  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around me  
The more I am, the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh no, no, no, no, no  
Yeah, hey, hey, hey  
All right  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around you  
It's everywhere, it's what you make  
For us to take each other's love  
It's all too much for me to see  
The love that's shining all around me  
The more I am, the less I know  
And what I do is live for love  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much  
It's all too much

Once in your life you love  
Once in your life you try  
The one you're holdin'  
Is the one that tears you apart  
  
Deep in her arms you lie  
Deep in the night her eyes  
Tell your secrets  
To the one you try to deny  
  
Touch me, touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
  
Inside you keep on lyin'  
Inside your soul is dyin'  
You still can't hold back  
Still you can't say good-bye  
Touch me, touch me crazy  
How your kiss betrays me  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
  
Two broken hearts  
But not in vain...  
No reasons why, no one's to blame  
It's not the love, it's just the rain  
It's just the rain, It's just the rain,  
It's just the rain, It's just the rain  
Falling, falling, falling  
It's just the rain

Oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild.  
Oh baby, you look to me as if you're still a child.  
  
Your innocence to me is so hard to believe,  
Just a spell in my past, tell me, how long will you last.  
  
Oh baby, you stole my lonely heart for you.  
Oh baby, I want to tell you what you can do.  
  
I no longer care about the things we shared, you always had your way.  
Won't you find a place today, won't you find a place to stay(repeat).

Workin' in the city  
This town's got no pity  
Bossman owns a heart of stone  
I'm on the line, it's overtime  
I'll tell you it's a crime  
They get me by the hour  
By my blue collar  
You're squeezin' me too tight  
It's Friday night  
Let's run tonight  
Till the morning light.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep on runnin', keep on hidin'  
Keep on runnin' away  
It's okay, it's alright  
It's okay, it's alright  
And if it makes you want to jump and shout, go ahead!  
Keep on runnin' keep on hidin'  
Keep on runnin' away, it's okay.  
  
Crusin' with my baby  
Think we just might maybe  
Find some back seat rhythm and blues  
Radio, down we go, down we go.  
  
[Chorus]

There's a state of grace that happens every day  
It's a feeling I thought lost or locked away  
Another question to an answer that I know  
Oh, are you coming home, coming home for sure  
I'd walk a thousand miles, just to hear you calling out my name  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
You've awakened something deep inside my soul  
And every moment, every breath I feel it more  
Your hidden treasure that you kept down deep inside  
We make love freely as we watch the new sunrise  
I'd live a thousand lives if every one I lived could be with you  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
I'd live a thousand lives  
If every one I lived could be with you  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Kiss me softly  
Kiss me slowly  
I get lost in you  
Like only lovers do  
Hold me closer  
Love me tender  
I get swept away  
Like only lovers do  
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do  
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do  
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do  
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do

I still see the look in your eyes  
The night you walked into my life  
And how we danced  
And the way that we touched  
Let me know you'd be mine  
And how your love has set me free  
An angel watching over me  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love  
When I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar  
My guiding light through the raging storm  
I find my strength to carry on  
Knowing that you love me  
  
If I could, I'd go back in time  
To be there the day you were born  
To hold you close  
Or to see your smile  
And rock you away in my arms  
To stand beside you through the tears  
Letting go of all the fears  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love when I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Ooh, someone to care  
And someone to share  
The little things that bring joy  
To my life ooh, it scares me  
We're so close but in my heart  
It's got to know  
I can't imagine me in a world without you  
(You lift me up)  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love when I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar  
My guiding light  
Through the raging storm  
Ooh, I find my strength to carry on  
Knowing that you love me  
  
That's all I'll ever need  
Is knowing that you love me

Roll the dice, roll them twice.  
My, my can you spare a dime?  
Ooh, snake eyes, the lady flies.  
My, my, my  
She's so hard to find.  
  
Ooh, lady luck, yeah, lady luck.  
Ooh, my lady luck, oh, my lady luck.  
  
Now what went wrong?  
I've been here too long.  
Can you spare a dime?  
Luck's disguised  
In her eyes.  
Oh, my lady's so hard to find.  
  
Ooh, lady luck, yeah, lady luck.  
Ooh, my lady luck, oh, my lady luck.  
  
Lady. She's gone. The lady, she's gone.  
  
Oh my lady,  
Oh my lady,  
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
My lady, luck.

See the mountains  
With my lady  
As the eagle  
In the golden sky  
Towers over purple majesty  
  
In the mountains  
Lives a freedom  
There's a river  
You can hear it say,  
"From the delta flows the Liberty"  
  
As the twilight of evening is broken  
Lacy, silvery, starlight unfolding  
'Round and 'round in a wave of emotion  
Rings of love circles back to the spoken  
Nothing equals a sea of devotion  
Oh, desire sets the wheels into motion  
  
We all agree  
We live to be free  
They can't tell us  
They can't tell us, how to be  
  
We, we all agree  
You individually  
We the people  
Share the power  
Hold the key

From the first day,  
I envisioned myself with you  
It's so hard to wait,  
But with you it was easy  
To do  
Somewhere in time  
I knew I would find you here with every  
Passing moment  
I see forever so clear  
Part of me was lost without you  
You are where I found my faith  
Feels like love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
When I look in your eyes baby  
I see a lifetime of dreams come true  
And I want you to say, that you feel the same  
Way too  
The stars in your eyes tell me  
All my tomorrows will wait for you  
You're all of my prayers answered  
My one saving grace is you  
  
In another life, I believed that I loved you then,  
If lightning strikes twice, we are destined  
Together again  
We don't have to make a promise, we were  
Always meant to be  
It's written in the way you look at me, I see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love moves at the speed of light  
Takes years to get it right  
But we've got till the end of time  
I can see, I can see, You and me, forever  
You're the one woman that can make me stay  
My one and only saving grace  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can see, I can see  
You and me, forever  
I can see, I can see  
You and me, forever

When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh  
  
So you think you're lonely  
Well my friend I'm lonely too  
I want to go back to my city by the bay  
Ooh, ooh  
  
It's sad, oh there's been mornings  
Out on the road without you  
Without your charms,  
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my  
  
When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh  
  
When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh, ooh

It was a hot and steamy night,  
Then Frankie pulled his gun in sight.  
He said, "Now Suzi, don't you lie.  
Did Stevie, did he catch you with another guy?"  
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.  
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,  
It's goin' through ya.  
  
He told her that he had been true,  
And that he'd never made her blue, no.  
So don't go sayin' Stevie's a liar,  
Girl, I've got my finder on a hair-trigger wire.  
  
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.  
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,  
It's goin' through ya.  
Bye, bye, bye, Suzi.  
So long girl.  
  
Those gunshots echoed through the town.  
Oh Frankie threw his shotgun down.  
That roof had moonlight shinin' through.  
She said she'd never, never, never, make him blue, yea.  
  
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.  
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,  
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.  
It's goin' through ya.  
Bye, bye, bye, Suzi.  
So long.

I've been waiting for the sky to clear, to get me  
Out of here,  
Get me on my way and go  
I've been waiting for a sign to appear,  
To show me the way to a place I've never known  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel, it's givin' me  
The feelin' that my dream  
Came true today  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
From the moment that I close my eyes, feel the  
Sun it rise, hear it echo through my soul  
For the first time in this young man's life, makes  
Me feel alive,  
Fills my heart and makes me stronger  
All I have are my dreams  
Your love and blind faith  
There in the sky spins a wheel, it's givin' me the feelin' that my dream came
true today  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
Someplace closer to both our hearts  
Somewhere further than where we are  
Just as long as there's hope enough  
Long as I live and breathe  
  
There's a place where we two can be together  
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on in search of all we've dreamed  
There'll come a day  
Blue skies endless  
And forever  
Well, that time has come  
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time is like the first time tenderly  
Loving you's like breathing spring  
Seasons change but your heart beats constantly  
Count my blessings every day as you love me  
As the sunset disappears across the northern sky  
You look for forever in my eyes  
All I can say, long as I have a voice  
I'll thank God above that I was your first choice  
  
If I should die before I wake  
I'll go into the night whispering your name  
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do  
At least I know that I'll be loved by you  
In about a hundred years from now  
When all of my love letters are found  
And someone reads these words I've written only meant for you  
They'll know how forever came true  
  
If I should die before I wake  
I'll go into the night whispering your name  
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do  
At least I know that I'll be loved by you  
In about a hundred years from now  
When all of my love letters are found  
And someone reads these words I've written only meant for you  
They'll know how forever came true  
  
Let the years roll on by  
These are the best times of my life  
I'll just smile when my days are through  
Knowing that I've been loved by you  
At least I know that I've been loved by you

You make me weep and want to die  
Just when you said we'd try  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
When I'm alone by myself  
You're out with someone else  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
You're tearin' me apart  
Every day, every day  
You're tearin' me apart  
Oh what can I say?  
You're tearin' me apart  
  
It won't be long, yes, till you're alone  
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home  
'Cause he's lovin' oo, he's touchin', he's squeezin' another  
  
He's tearin' you apart  
Every day, every day  
He's tearin' you apart  
Oh girl what can you say?  
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', squeezin' another  
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na

I know you got that special something, oh, baby  
I know you like to keep it hummin', oh, baby.  
Cause girl, lovin' you is so easy.  
Oh, woh, woh. Lovin' you is so easy.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Come on girl, give me that good lovin', oh baby  
Come on girl, keep the motor hummin, oh, woh, baby.  
  
Cause lovin' you is so easy.  
My, my, my, my  
Lovin' you is easy.  
Lovin' you is easy.  
  
Girl, after the mornin' sunlight,  
After the band has flown away,  
Oh, we'll be thinkin' of you.  
Yes, we'll be holdin' on girl.  
  
Lovin' you is easy.  
Lovin' you is easy.  
Lovin' you is easy.  
Lovin' you is easy.  
  
Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', you  
Oh, and it's easy (easy).  
  
Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', you  
Oh, and it's easy (easy).

I, walk alone in the dark, with you  
And deep, in the shadows I run, without you  
And here, here I stand, the king of fools  
Now Love's here, where are you  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin'  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Why, have I waited so long to be there...for you  
Now, now I'm ready to give everything...to you  
Now love's here, where are you  
Baby can you hear me callin',  
Baby you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
I hear...but I never listen  
I see...and still I'm blind  
All alone...lost in the silence, I'm dyin'  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Message...do you, do you. do you hear me  
Do you hear my message  
Baby can you hear me callin', callin'  
Do you, do you hear me

All alone through the countryside  
Clouds in my brain, vision in my eyes  
Thoughts are on the wall  
Like oceons on the sand  
Midnight dreamer, take me if you can  
You can't deny, it seems so easy to do  
But women trade in black  
And now she's sinning on you  
Giving you my heart, there's nothin' you can do  
Midnight lover, I'm in love with you  
She's my midnight lover, wild and fancy free  
Standing in the shadows in the palace of my dreams  
You're a pretty thing, like fire from the sun  
You've got to catch her while she's shining before the morning comes  
Could this be a dream  
Dream on, dream on, dream on

She sits alone, an empty stare  
A mother's face she wears  
Where did she go wrong,  
The fight is gone  
Lord help this broken home  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, mother, father, sister  
Hey, come back, tryin', believein'  
Hey, mother, father, dreamer  
  
Don't you know that I'm alive for you  
I'm your sevenths son  
And when lightin' strikes the family  
Have faith, believe.  
  
With dreams he tried, lost his pride  
He drinks his life away  
One photograph, in broken glass  
It should not end this way.  
  
Through bitter tears  
And wounded years, those ties  
Of blood were strong  
So much to say, those yesterdays  
So now don't you turn away.  
  
[Chorus]

Mountain of mystery,  
Rising high above the clouds.  
Mountain of magic,  
Standing tall and proud,  
Your magical veins  
Flowing silver and gold,  
Your cumulus cloud glows misty red,  
As Apollo sets beyond your head.  
Releasing the pressure built over the years  
The mountain is crying hot lava tears  
Molten rock created under vibrations of  
Subterranean thunder  
Ejecting boulders like pieces of sand  
The mountain is  
Giving birth to the land.  
  
Under your feet you feel a rumble  
As thousands of rocks are starting to tumble  
Above the trees where the buzzard flies  
Swirling vapors begin to rise  
Beneath those misty peaks you hide  
A tremendous force boiling deep inside.

Winter and moonlight  
It's an old-fashioned song  
Julie's in blue jeans  
Now her love has gone  
  
She's an old-fashioned feelin'  
She's an old-fashioned song  
Julie's in love now, but love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
  
I never knew her  
I never tried  
Julie would run by  
Cryin', teary-eyed  
  
She was old-fashioned feelin'  
She was old-fashioned song  
Julie's in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Her love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
  
Oh, she was old-fashioned feelin'  
She was old-fashioned song, yes Julie  
Now Julie's in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Well, love has gone  
Well, love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
  
Julie, Julie

Her head is filled with doubt  
Search her heart for faith that can't be found  
He's running desperate now  
All that he's become is just not working anymore  
He's needing something more  
  
Someone that he used to be  
Part of her is a mystery  
Spinning around in an empty place  
Lie to themselves till they're blind with rage  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
You know it's never too late to change  
  
So much to understand  
So much to feel and finally now you can  
They'll see a different day all because they faced themselves  
And now I hear them say they're gonna be okay  
  
She found who she used to be and now there is no mystery  
Open his eyes in a brand new place  
A different soul in a different place  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
  
Love is waiting, love is patient, love is kind  
Love is falling into places in their minds  
They love enough to know the difference  
The dream they had today, don't throw it all away  
  
It's never too late to feel the world come crashing down  
It's never too late  
It's darkest just before the dawn  
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain  
Never thought they'd fall this far  
You know it's never too late to change  
  
To rise above it all, never question, never fall  
There is no mystery they are who they used to be  
They're in a brand new place,  
A different soul and a different face  
The dreams they had today, don't throw it all away

(Verse 1)  
So young in love,  
They couldn't wait.  
Said their vows,  
Had to run away.  
Suddenly,  
They felt their lives  
Had changed.  
They believed...  
Their hearts were strong.  
Just to find  
They couldn't get along.  
The dream they shared...  
Had slowly come undone.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for  
One more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise...  
That he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
(Verse 2)  
They had to meet...  
Somewhere... halfway...  
Heart to heart and  
Face to face.  
Compromise...  
A price they had to pay.  
Cared enough...  
To stand her ground.  
Screamed and shouted  
Till the walls came down.  
Worth the fight  
To see a brand new day.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for one more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise that he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
(Chorus)  
Will she go  
Or will she stay?  
Fool herself for one more day.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
Love's the promise that he made.  
In his heart...  
It still remains.  
Don't give up.  
Never walk away.  
  
Never walk away.  
  
Ooohhh...  
  
Never walk away!

Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright  
Yes she did, well come to bed and turn out the light  
She's sleeping there, she's dreaming through her life  
Yes she is  
Well you know you've done no wrong  
All you done is sing this song  
You sing this song, yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
That's when the bad man meets his fate  
Sitting there, you're feeling only second rate  
You're sorry now, you've come a little bit too late  
Yes you did  
But when you come around  
You only bring you down  
You feel a clown, yeah  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright, yeah  
Mama said, she said it's gonna be alright  
You know she said, you've got to see the coming light  
You know you are, you're riding through your life  
Yes you are  
Well you know you've done your best  
All you need's a little rest  
You've done your best, yes  
On a Saturday night  
On a Saturday night  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Saturday night  
Saturday night

Two young hearts lost in love they vow to stay,  
Running wild they believe they've found a way  
Filled with hope  
She's the dream, she understands you  
Now this time he'll hold on, she'll never leave him  
They'll never let go 'cause...  
  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
  
How can lovers just turn and walk away  
Loneliness is an edge that cuts both ways  
So easy to fall  
So hard to get over  
  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
So easy to fall, so hard to get over  
Once you love somebody, (once you love)  
There's no turning back (turning back)  
It can burn forever, it can haunt you, haunt you in the night  
  
(Once you love somebody), once you love  
(they can break your heart), no no no  
It can burn forever, letting go, that's the hardest part

Wicked prophets kill, speaking his name  
In the glory of an innocent age  
A king is born to a house filled with rage  
One man's fear is another man's truth, one fear  
  
The blind suffer at the hands of sin  
Lines are drawn where the boundaries begin  
Ten thousand broken, by the madness within  
Broken  
  
One more, cry in the night, one more  
One more, war left to fight, one more  
One life, cut down by fire  
Once child's, angry desire, one more  
  
Hearts of stone, pride without shame  
Wicked prophets, kill while speaking his name  
As the heavens, fall from the sky  
Fallin'  
  
Brother to brother, blood on their hands  
Desolation in the kingdom of man  
Holy vengeance is the justice of hell  
Mercy, mercy  
  
One more, cry in the night, one more  
One more, war left to fight, one more  
One life, cut down by fire  
Once child's, angry desire, one more  
  
Wings of fire, drums of thunder  
No more, no more  
One more, cry in the night, one more  
One more was, was left to fight, one more  
  
One life, cut down by fire  
One child's angry desire, one more  
One more, one

Another night in any town  
You can hear the thunder of their cry  
Ahead of their time  
They wonder why  
  
Shadows of a golden age  
A generation waits for dawn  
Brave carry on  
Bold and the strong  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
They're seein' through the promises  
And all the lies they dare to tell  
Is it heaven or hell?  
They know very well  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
Only the young can say  
They're free to fly away  
Sharing the same desire  
Burnin' like wildfire  
  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Only the young can say  
Young can say

Lying beside you, here in the dark  
Feeling your heartbeat with mine  
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere  
How could our love be so blind  
We sailed on together  
We drifted apart  
And here you are, by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
So now I come to you with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am, with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Living without you, living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you  
Wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
  
Now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay  
  
[Chorus]

Girl, oh you came to me  
Touched my life  
Girl, how you sheltered me  
Touched my life  
  
It's the joy, you gave to me  
When I was on my own, alone  
  
Girl, your lips touching mine  
Ooh so fine  
Girl, softly touching me  
Ooh so fine  
  
She's the smile in my heart that sings  
I's a song for you again  
  
Ooh, she opened up the door  
She made my life once more  
Yes she opened  
Ooh, you opened up the door  
Ya made my life once more

He grew up in some forgotten midwest town  
His mama raised him well  
Barely getting by, but he'd be okay  
As far as he could tell  
Oh, the plant in town closed ten years ago  
Now an empty ghost ship stands  
For the last nine months he's tried to find a job  
But there's nothing to be had  
  
So he signs up to fight for Uncle Sam  
It's the only choice he's got  
To fight a desert war with another land  
Only to find peace or not  
He's a moving target in a desperate place  
Every day is a twist of fate  
Oh, his family wonders if he'll make it home  
Knowing his faith's his saving grace  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Harms way  
  
Oh, they sent him home to his family  
Nursing wounds that no one sees  
Certain scents and smells trigger flashback spells  
That rewind the tragedy  
All these memories hold him prisoner  
Cause of the violence he regrets  
What was his ticket out is his nightmare now  
In a war he can't forget  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
  
Now he's waking up in a strange land  
To face an even stranger day  
Brave ones, standing tall  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Keep them all out of harms way  
Harms way

Climbing the stairway to you know where,  
People, Oh! so happy until they scare.  
  
Who always has got to talk about somebody else,  
Born as a God, they think that's got to be  
People, simply just another you and me.

Find myself all alone  
In darkness without you  
Now I can't turn away  
From what I must do  
You know I'd give my life for you  
More than words can say  
I've shown you how to love someone  
I know you'll find a way  
  
Say goodbye  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Walk away  
The sun remains  
Remember me  
  
I'll live on somewhere in your heart  
You must believe  
Remember me  
  
No way I can change my mind  
I don't have the answers  
If you could see through my eyes  
You'd let go of your fears  
And though I have to leave you now  
With the thought of each other  
I miss your touch  
You call my name  
I am with you forever  
  
Say goodbye  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Walk away  
The sun remains  
Remember me

When I'm alone I keep replaying the look of love in your eyes  
When I miss home I swear I die every time we said goodbye  
Like a gentle wind you cross my mind  
I lose myself I lose all sense of time  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
It's all our love can be  
When we resonate, resonate  
  
Even though we're miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate, resonate  
  
You come to me, you're in my dreams, you are my satellite  
You make me feel, sweet vibrations, we shared endless nights  
Think of me, I'm never far away  
I hear your voice, you call my name  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
It's all our love can be  
When we resonate, resonate  
  
Even though we're miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate, resonate  
  
Feel the distance, send a message every night  
Finding each other, we share the same desire  
Like a telegraph that leads me to your heart  
I reach out and love is where you are  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
It's all our love can be  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
It's all our love can be  
When we resonate, resonate  
  
Even though we're miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate, resonate

Caught up in the daily grind  
Hard to find some peace of mind  
'Round here lately  
  
Trying to escape the beaten path  
To near the wrath of the world  
It just had me crazy  
Ooh crazy  
  
Just something to look forward to  
Along with you  
I still get lost in you baby  
It's always you, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all that comes together  
We're meant, two animals  
We've got something sacred  
You've become a ritual  
Our spirits feed each other  
We never get our fill  
Onward for your sweet religion  
You've become my ritual  
  
When I am with you all time stands still  
If I had the will then  
Pressure just doesn't phase me  
  
You more than take my breath way  
You captivate, we levitate  
You amaze me  
Ooh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual  
I want you baby  
  
Celebrate the love we found  
Make my world go round  
In your arms where I belong  
Makes me love all night long  
All night long  
  
You're all I see  
Heaven's here with me  
Need this time alone  
Send my spirit free  
Free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My ritual

In this promised land  
Fire burnin' in our hands  
The choice is ours to make  
Realize your fantasy  
You live the dream  
With every step you take  
Stand tall stand on the edge  
Use the thin end of the wedge  
The will to cast your fate  
Don't turn around too late  
Lose ground if we hesitate  
Burning youth won't wait  
  
Make a move across the rubicon  
Futures knockin' at your door  
Take your time  
And choose the road you want  
Opportunity is yours  
  
See it all so clear  
Time is right time is near  
We know now what to do  
All god's children learn  
Which way to turn  
Turning back we're through  
We all refuse to lose  
Live life and light the fuse  
Burning youth won't wait

It's been so long  
Since I've seen her face  
You say she's doin' fine  
I still recall  
A sad cafe  
  
How it hurt so bad to see her cry  
I didn't want to say good-bye  
  
[Chorus]  
Send her my love, memories remain  
Send her my love, roses never fade  
Send her my love  
  
The same hotel, the same old room  
I'm on the road again  
She needed so much more  
Than I could give  
  
We knew our love could not pretend  
Broken hearts can always mend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Callin' out your name I'm dreamin'  
Reflections of a face I'm seein'  
It's her voice  
That keeps on haunting me  
  
Send her, send her my love  
Roses never fade  
Memories remain  
Send her, send her, my love

Here we stand  
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two  
Sleepless nights  
Losing ground  
I'm reaching for you, you, you  
  
Feelin' that it's gone  
Can change your mind  
If we can't go on  
To survive the tide love divides  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
How we touched  
And went our separate ways  
If he ever hurts you  
True love won't desert you  
You know I still love you  
Though we touched  
And went our separate ways  
  
Troubled times  
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain  
Distant eyes  
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain  
  
If you must go, I wish you love  
You'll never walk alone  
Take care my love  
Miss you love  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
How we touched  
And went our separate ways  
If he ever hurts you  
True love won't desert you  
You know I still love you  
Though we touched  
And went our separate ways  
  
Someday love will find you  
Break those chains that bind you  
One night will remind you  
If we ever hurt you  
True love won't desert you  
You know I still love you  
  
I still love you girl  
I really love you girl  
And if he ever hurts you  
True love won't desert you  
No, no

Hear what I'm saying, you're losing control  
Can't take the sun from her eyes  
She's built for comfort, she ain't no fool  
She said, take a look  
It's easy tonight  
It's gonna be alright  
She made me feel alright  
Baby baby baby baby, feel alright, wooh  
Yeah, it's gonna be alright  
A flaming sky sure makes her look good  
You'll put your life on the line  
Are you gonna stay, or do you wanna leave  
Well hey, come with me  
We'll have a good time  
It's gonna be alright  
Yeah, she made me feel alright  
Baby baby baby baby, feel alright, yeah  
Yeah, it's gonna be alright  
I can't wait  
I gotta have her now  
I can't wait  
Well my love is growing stronger, yeah  
I can't wait  
No, no, no, no  
It's alright  
Baby baby baby baby  
She made me feel alright  
Yeah, she made me feel alright  
Well baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright  
Baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright  
It's gonna be alright  
She made me feel alright  
She made me feel alright

Cascades of gentle touch,  
Her passion blinding my eyes  
I'll find, I'll lose myself  
Drowning from her colorful sky  
I'm aware of her grace  
Those careless kisses  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
She's my zen, my home  
My only Shangri-La  
She's my French champagne  
She's my ooh la la  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
Like a gentle wind she moves  
Her fascination I desire  
She's a butterfly  
She's a Mona Lisa smile  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
I'd give her all the time  
If she's feeling so fine, yeah  
In and out of my life  
She's a mystery, yeah, yeah yeah

It's been forty days since I heard from you this waiting game  
You put me through  
I feel the silence  
Killing me  
Day to day  
Losin' hope, I lose myself, it's got me thinkin'  
There's someone else  
We need to talk  
You give me metaphors,  
By the way  
What are you tryin' to say  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
Lyin' next to me  
Were you ever mine  
Just wasted love and wasted time  
Did you ever find what you were lookin' for,  
The nights you took my breath away  
I'll miss your love  
Miss your touch, but this holdin' on it hurts too much  
Now it's my time to walk away  
I'll be okay  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
Well, tell your friends that you stole my heart  
But you'll never get a piece of my soul  
You took my love, tore my life apart  
There's more to me than you'll ever know  
  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
Showing signs of life  
Tryin' to not think about you  
I'm not a dead man walkin' without you  
You know I'll be alright  
I'm showing signs of life  
  
You left me barely breathin'  
I've had time for the healing  
Now I've opened my eyes  
I'm showing signs of life  
Seeing signs of life

Someday soon, someday soon.  
Seasons were made for the change.  
You will be there.  
Just like the night to the day without a care.  
The dark goes before the dawn.  
Open up your eyes.  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh, there'll be a better day.  
And someday soon,  
Yes, it's not too far away.  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh yeah, with open skies,  
And someday soon.  
All we can do is try.  
  
The cloudiest day comes around,  
You will be there.  
All of the feelin's you've found, without a care.  
So my friends, you take a look.  
Don't you look too far.  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh yeah, with open skies,  
And someday soon.  
All we can do is try.  
  
Someday, someday, someday soon,  
someday, someday soon  
Someday, someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon

All alone again tonight  
A place you know too well  
Guess there's something in your life  
Going through the motions  
  
And you like to say you got burned  
Well you're not the only one  
You've reached the why and lonely  
On the streets where you roam  
  
You can go back to where you've been  
Are you ready to try again?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
Believe it's never too late  
For someone to set you free  
Once you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)  
  
Commitment's just a word  
You could've wrapped your heart around  
It's your foolish pride and freedom  
Got you standing your ground  
  
The same faces every night  
Where you stay it's the closing time  
It don't stop the empty feeling  
When you're just wasting your time  
  
A leap of faith, another chance  
What if you can dance?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
Believe it's never too late  
For someone to set you free  
Once you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)  
  
You can go back to where you've been  
Are you ready to try again?  
  
Once you let someone love you  
You'll find an open door  
A place in your heart you've never been before  
(Believe it's never too late) never too late  
(For someone to set you free)set you free  
  
(Someone love you) someone love you  
Won't you let someone love you  
(Someone love you)  
(Someone love you)

Don't be so wise, I was born to fly  
Not without a place in the wind  
Walked off a cliff, then I closed my eyes  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman  
  
Don't need no feathers, I don't need no twine,  
I'm all together in my body and my mind,  
Not supernatural, just a human combine,  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman!  
  
Can't see a castle, I don't need a sleigh,  
I brought my wings, no, not today  
I'm a cosmopolitan, right-handed wingless man  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no  
Oh, I'm not a spaceman.

I'd do anything to hold you.  
I'd go anywhere to touch you.  
I'd do anything you want me to,  
If you'll just stay with me awhile.  
  
I'd sing any song your heart desires.  
I would sing out loud of love's sweet fires.  
Oh, I'd do all this and so much more.  
If you'll just stay with me awhile.  
  
Reach out your hand,  
Oh, to me.  
Oh, I'm fallin'  
One minute more,  
I'm fallin'  
I'm fallin'  
Oh, oh, fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin'  
Won't you just stay with me awhile?

Tears that she kept from me  
Somewhere there's broken dreams  
Where love once used to be  
  
All in a memory  
With time we are forgiven  
In time we will forget  
  
I hear her voice in the night  
Cries of joy  
We were good, good, good,  
I still recall how we'd touch, how we'd fall  
We were good, good, good,  
  
Tears that she kept from me  
Someone she used to be  
Forever yours then suddenly  
One kiss she can't remember  
  
I wish I could forget  
I hear her voice in the night, cries of joy  
We were good, good, good,  
I still recall how we'd touch, how we'd fall  
We were good, good, good,  
  
Still she cries  
Somewhere, still she cries  
No one knows when lovers will walk away  
  
I hear her voice, in the night  
Cries of joy,  
We were good, good, good,  
  
All in a memory  
Where our love once used to be  
Good, good,

Jesse rides through the night  
Under the Main Street light  
Ridin' slow  
  
This ol' town, ain't the same  
Now nobody knows his name  
Times have changed, still he rides.  
  
Traffic lights, keepin' time  
Leading the wild and restless  
Through the night  
  
[Chorus:]  
Still they ride, on wheels of fire  
They rule the night  
Still they ride, the strong will survive  
Chasing thunder  
  
Spinning 'round, in a spell  
It's hard to leave this carousel  
'Round and 'round  
And 'round and 'round  
  
[Chorus:]

Those crazy nights, I do remember in my youth  
I do recall, those were the best times, most of all  
In the heat with a blue jean girl  
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime  
She found me singing by the rail road track  
Took me home, we danced by moonlight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Those summer nights are callin',  
Stone in love  
Can't help myself I'm fallin'  
Stone in love  
  
Old dusty roads, led to the river  
Runnin' slow  
She pulled me down, and in clover  
We'd go 'round  
In the heat with a blue jean girl  
Burnin' love comes once in a lifetime  
Oo the memories never fade away  
Golden girl, I'll keep you forever.  
  
[Chorus]

Try and keep it simple,  
Not too far away,  
Movin' slow, so simple,  
  
Never felt this way.  
  
Movin' sweet, so simple,  
Takin' time to say,  
The way to being, to being simple  
Never felt this way.  
  
Don't be lonely,  
Oh, my friends, forget the past.  
Sweet as sugar,  
When you're movin'  
When you're movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
  
How could it be so simple?  
To forget the way,  
A way to being, to being simple  
Never felt this way.  
  
Don't be lonely,  
No, no, no, forget the past.  
Sweet as sugar,  
When you're movin' slow  
Your movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely  
It's what I like to do.  
  
Sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Movin' slow, movin' slow at last  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely  
It's what I like to do.  
It's what I like to do.  
Sweet as sugar.

One light shining bright, it's made from many colors  
Just like every ocean's made from many drops of rain  
One soul takes many shapes, to make up the human race  
One fire, many lives share the same sun every day  
  
Old beliefs let us down, many roads lead to heaven  
One love, many faiths all share the world in search of grace  
Across the universe, the same force that moves the earth's  
In my heart, makes me whole, wash my doubt and fear away  
  
In a big deep blue sky on a beautiful day  
For the moment is now, there's perfection in every way  
  
Feel it flow from me  
Tantra my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra watch over me  
  
Like a bird on a wing like the eye of a storm  
There's a circle of life when every child's born  
I get caught up in time lose all reality  
A prisoner of my own design  
Where my freedom is where I choose to be  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Like roses in bloom  
Like a Mountaintop majesty  
Like an orange harvest moon  
Wonders for all to see  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
oh yeah  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, watch over me

In the eyes of a woman, in a world of desire,  
From the moment she looked my way. I was so hypnotized  
Should I show how I feel, she's the magnet, I'm steel  
The eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman  
  
In the arms of an angel, in a dangerous disguise  
Love's a blue fascination  
It's a mystery that burns, takes a lifetime to learn  
The eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman, my fears come undone  
In the eyes of a woman, there's nowhere to run  
The eyes of a woman, my fears come undone  
  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run  
Nowhere to run

You never call me up  
When I'm alone at night.  
What can this poor boy do,  
When he's hopelessly in love with you?  
So I will tell you now  
This love is fallin' down.  
Just what more can I do,  
When I'm hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you.  
  
  
So I will tell you this,  
Our love is in a fix.  
Just what more can I do.  
When I'm hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
You never call me up  
When I'm alone at night.  
What can this poor boy do,  
When he's hopelessly in love with you?  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Hopelessly in love  
Hopelessly in love  
I'm hopelessly in love with you  
  
  
Oh, bye-bye, baby  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
The party's over,  
I have gone away.  
Oo, the party's over,  
I have gone away.

Lost in a feeling  
And this distance between us  
I start believing  
These days we're drifting apart  
We're leading separate lives  
Separately missing each other  
It's time that we face the light  
We can't go on pretending this way  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
When was the last time  
We were lost in the moment  
Seems like we can't find  
Oh, the love that we used to share  
If I could take you there  
Could we surrender together  
Somewhere to begin again  
Oh, it hurts just to go this way  
Yeah  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere there's love  
We've come this far  
Reach out your hand and I'll find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Times that I let you down  
You could have just walked away  
Yes, I need your forgiveness now  
Don't say it's too late, yes  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere there's love  
We've come this far  
Reach out your hand and I'll find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Oh, let me take you there  
Save a place for me baby  
Save a place in your heart  
Aw, let me take you there  
Leaving

Doin' time,where it takes you  
You know it's time that can break you  
We get caught in the moment  
Just sleepwalkin' most of our lives  
In your mind (when you need it)  
With a song (to help you believe it)  
You can reinvent your world  
Anytime you like  
  
[Chorus]  
To be alive again  
Wakin' up from where you've been  
Younger now than you were then  
You're comin' round again  
Do you remember when  
Life was so much simpler then  
Like summer nights that never end  
To be alive again  
  
Find the smile you've been missin'  
There's someone that you could be kissin'  
So open your eyes and you'll see  
What's been there all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be alive again  
  
You're not among the walkin' wounded anymore  
There's a time to fall  
There's a time to rise above it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be alive again  
(To be alive again)

Say everybody  
And everyone  
We've been waitin', so very long  
To play some music  
And have some fun  
  
Bring some happiness to everyone  
Well come with us and try and learn  
What's on your mind  
Open your ears and eyes and let's see what you can find  
You're not so different, I don't mean to be unkind  
Something's unfolding if you really take the time  
  
So let the sun shine  
It's just begun  
You've given all you could to anyone  
Well don't you lose it  
Don't run away  
It's getting stronger, day after day  
  
You're sittin' there, you say you're  
Waiting for the show  
And what you have, and what you  
Hear is what you really want to know  
You've only come here 'cause here's  
Nowhere else to go  
We're only sorry, that we have  
To end the show.  
  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Yeah

Man is love man is animal  
A warrior an intellectual  
He's the face of original sin  
He's the devil and the poet within  
  
Our father's have embraced the messiah  
And made the peace with Allah  
They even sought to be like Buddha  
To follow the old ways of Krishna  
  
Pretending prophets come to rule this age  
Turn the faith to fuel the wars they stage  
Well something has to change to go beyond the pain  
And somehow turn the page  
  
To whom it may concern I'm sending out a prayer  
The world finds peace in my lifetime  
To whom it may concern are you listening  
Are you there?  
I'll keep my hopes for paradise alive  
To whom it may concern  
  
We simply want to live it free  
So happy and in harmony  
No guilt, no fear, no hell to burn  
  
To whom it may concern I'm sending out a prayer  
The world finds peace in my lifetime  
To whom it may concern are you listening  
Are you there?  
I'll keep my hopes for paradise alive  
I close my eyes

See the stop-light turn-in' red,  
Don't you listen to what it's said.  
All the things you try to hide,  
They keep you runnin' hard inside.  
  
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
  
Ooo, yes, my friend, you're fadin' fast, if you stay here you won't last.  
Before your time has run astray, you've got to try to get away.  
Oh, you got to leave this place before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
Too late, too late to make the change  
Too late to make the change  
  
Yes, it's time to make the change, yes, it's time to rearrange,  
So, my friend, I join the fight for the things you know are right.  
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's...  
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late,  
Too late to make the change.  
Too late, too late to make the change  
Too late, too late, to make the change  
Too late to make the change  
Too late, before it's too late.

Sunrise, creepin' in your eyes  
Cold empty side walks  
Miles away from trustin' someone  
Far from giving up  
Young blood, cry tough  
Mean street run  
There's a hunger inside you  
Desperate rebel runaway  
Far from giving up  
  
Someday, someway, all very soon  
You'll end, long nights chasin' the moon  
  
War with yourself  
Makes you feel better  
Caught behind the lines  
Troubles child  
Faith finds a cure  
It makes you feel better  
You know you can shine  
Troubled child  
  
Voices echo, from the past  
Decisions made for you  
Trials they made  
To touch your heart  
Never found their way

Caught up in living  
Getting through each day  
When all the tomorrows become faded yesterdays  
Are you slipping away  
Lighted by our schedules  
Rushing here and there  
Become strangers to each other  
Miss you everywhere  
How did we get this way  
When the loneliness becomes too much to bear  
Girl, this merry-go-round  
Tell each other we still care  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
In the silence, hear your heart beat next to mine  
Baby, help me turn down the world tonight  
So much information streaming at us fast  
What I really need to know is if  
We can make it last  
I wanna keep you close  
We make commitments  
Take responsibility  
Why do we let them come between you and me  
That's when I miss you most  
We gotta take this night  
Throw in our love all the way  
Before our moment is gone  
Baby, say it's not too late  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
Far beyond those, with your body next to mine  
Won't you help me turn down the world tonight  
Turn down the world tonight  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
Oh, turn down the world  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
In the silence, hear your heart beat next to mine  
Baby, help me turn down the world tonight

Walks like a lady  
With her tender charms  
She moves like a lady  
When I'm in her arms  
She loves like a lady  
Lovin' all night long  
She cries like a baby  
When she's done something wrong  
  
I told you once, yes, I told you twice  
But you never listen to my advice  
I catch you walkin' with that boy again  
I'm gonna set you free  
Oh, I'm gonna set you free  
  
Loves like a lady  
So soft and slow  
She feels like a lady  
Ooo, I can't let go  
She smiles like a lady  
Smilin' all night long  
But cries lake a baby  
When she's done something wrong  
  
Walks like a lady  
Oh, but she cries like a little girl  
Walks like a lady  
Yes, but she cries like a little girl  
Walks like a lady  
Walks like a lady  
Cries like a little girl

Was it the words she said or was it all in the way  
In which the lady said them?  
Her eyes that spoke to me were sending my heart  
A thought so deep I can't forget them  
I guess it wasn't the right time or the place  
For love right then  
But we met destiny, and it sealed our fate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
On my heart it's written (we will meet again)  
Somewhere, someplace, somehow I'll find her then as I did now, just for a
moment  
And I will hear the wind that told me  
I will return again my love have patience  
Life's a circle, it all comes back around,  
So until then...  
I'll be waiting for you knowing somehow  
  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
It'd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all (we will meet again)  
  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
It'd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
On my heart it's written (we will meet again)  
From this day till(we will meet again)  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)

Missing something in my life  
Searching for it day and night  
Couldn't seem to get it right  
'Til you walked my way  
Leaving lovers one by one  
Didn't like who I'd become  
Couldn't face myself, I turn and run  
Made me see that I could change  
  
Out of my darkness  
As I step into the light  
We get a new day  
Taking one step at a time  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl, you were my rescue  
All I needed was you  
  
I used to always get my way  
Told me that you wouldn't stay  
Had to face it, what you had to say  
If I wanted you  
You tell me when I did you wrong  
I guess I've known it all along  
Cared enough and you stood strong  
I believed in you  
  
In my frustrations  
Tried to become someone else  
The years I've wasted  
I'd been lying to myself  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
You made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Hear me calling  
What I needed  
What I needed was you  
  
In you I found shelter  
How you believed in me, stood strong  
You were there through my darkest hour  
You lifted my spirit up  
Brought out the best in me  
And now I'll stand before you with all my love  
  
You were what I needed  
I was falling  
Hiding my emotion  
But you made me see the truth  
Your love was what I needed  
Hear me calling  
Waiting for a lifetime  
Girl you were my rescue  
What I needed was you

Day has come  
You're prepared  
Electricity in the air  
Feel the calm  
Feel the rush  
You want to leave victorious  
Will you look in their eyes  
They want you gone, they want the prize  
When day is done, risk it all  
One will stand, and one will fall  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
Seal the deal  
Get it done  
Earn the right to say you've won  
Work it out  
Sacrifice  
Someone's gonna have to pay the price  
Face to face  
Stand your ground  
Stay in the zone, now don't back down  
More than pride  
You depend  
Fighting hard 'til the very end  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
When you share the dream  
There's no "I" in team  
Let the spirit take you higher  
It's a state of mind  
No one can define  
There's no limit to desire  
  
When you learn to lose  
You'll know what it takes to win  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
Wanna go the distance  
With a hunger that never ends  
When you want to prove  
You're the best that's ever been  
They can knock you down  
You're on your feet again  
'Cause you know what it takes  
What it takes to win  
  
What it takes to win  
What it takes to win

Winter is here again oh lord,  
Haven't been home in a year or more  
I hope she holds on a little longer  
Sent a letter on a long summer day  
Made of silver, not of clay  
I've been runnin' down this dusty road  
  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow  
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
  
I've been trying to make it home  
Got to make it before too long  
I can't take this very much longer  
I'm stranded in the sleet and rain  
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again  
The mornin' sun is risin'  
It's kissin the day  
  
Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'  
I don't' know where I'll be tomorrow  
Ooo the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'

Magic moments  
There're the things I will remember  
Where's the time we spent together laughing  
Then you walk into my dream dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free, smiling at me  
So long since I've had you near  
  
Now you've come back again  
Where the love never ends  
And you're right here  
When I think of you  
  
When I need you, I just close my eyes  
And you're here  
Right beside me when I'm lost in shadows  
Of the memories of you oh my dear  
  
And I see your face  
Young and so free, smiling at me  
In your eyes I walk without fear  
We're together again  
Where the love never ends  
'Cause you're right here  
When I think of you  
  
Hold on just for a while  
Hold on hold on  
  
I try to forget the night that you left  
It's all so unreal, with you gone  
I can dream once again  
Where the love never ends  
'Cause you're right here  
When I think of you  
When I think of you  
When I think of you

In my life I see where I've been  
I said that I'd never fall again  
Within myself I was wrong  
My searching ain't over and over  
I know that  
  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes  
When you love a woman  
(Well) You know she's standing by your side  
A joy that lasts forever  
There's a band of gold that shines  
Waiting somewhere, oh, yeah  
  
If I can't believe that someone is true  
To fall in love is so hard to do  
I hope and pray tonight  
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl  
Yes I know, I know that  
  
It's enough to make you cry  
When you see her walking by  
And you look into her eyes  
  
When you love a woman  
When you love, love, love, love  
When you love a woman  
You see your world inside her eyes

It ain't always easy  
Movin' day to day,  
She said she wants to tease me, so I'm on my way.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
She told me she'd be there,  
She phoned me today.  
Little girl, big teaser,  
So I'm on my way.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
My, my, my, my, my, my, my yeah,  
My, my, my, my, my, my, my yeah,  
  
Oo, it ain't always easy,  
Movin' day to day,  
Oh, how the girl loves to tease me,  
So I'm gonna stay.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Nobody home.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
You're like a dog that roams.  
Ain't got no girl to tease me,  
Ain't got nobody home.  
  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
When you're alone it ain't easy,  
Oh, oh no,  
Ain't got nobody home.

Desperately falling  
Feeling our love set us free  
We were better together  
Believed it was all meant to be  
Stay as one forever  
The band of gold would always prevail  
Happy in the moment  
Life betrays one, a fairytale  
Memories time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
Never saw it coming  
You left so suddenly  
What was here that scared you  
You want what I couldn't see  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
What we shared was not enough  
Where did I lose your love  
  
So far from each other  
So close to happiness  
I'll be there to remind you  
Love forgives but never forgets  
Emotions time cannot erase  
I still see your face  
  
Where did I lose your love  
You'll always be the question in my heart  
How could I make you stay  
I still regret the night you walked away  
  
How could I make you stay  
Where did I lose your love  
Still regret the night you walked away  
Oh, oh, yeah

Where were you  
When I wanted you to love me through the night?  
Where were you  
When I wanted you to love and hold me tight?  
Where were you, little darlin'  
When you said to pick you up after school?  
I know where, little lady,  
'Cause my mama didn't raise no fool.  
  
Yeah.  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
I know where, baby,  
you been runnin' 'round loose on the side.  
I know where, little lady,  
you been runnin' 'round with something to hide.  
I don't mind, darlin', if you're feelin' fancy and free.  
I don't mind, little baby,  
'Cause your sister's lookin' real good to me.  
  
Hey,  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
I didn't know what the hell was goin' on,  
Someday you're gonna break.  
So don't try to get yourself straight,  
You're just a little too late.  
  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?

It's been a mystery  
But still they try to see  
Why something good can hurt so bad  
Caught on a one-way street  
The taste of bittersweet  
Love will survive somehow, somewhere  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
So many stormy nights  
So many wrong or rights  
Neither could change their headstrong ways  
And in a lover's rage  
They tore another page  
The fighting is worth the love they save  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
Only so many tears you can cry  
'Til the heartache is over  
And now you can say your love,  
Will never die  
  
Whoa ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?

Lost in twilight, the memories  
Precious moments, you and me  
We've been old friends, all through the years  
Picture postcards, sharing tears  
  
What's in our hearts, there's never time, to say  
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away  
I've seen your city lights  
As I walk away  
Why can't this night...go on forever  
  
Without love, we won't survive  
Run together, we rule the night  
Tell me secrets, oh that make you cry  
Where's the laughter, we gotta try  
  
What's in our hearts, there's never time to say  
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away  
Like a photograph  
That time won't erase  
Why can't this night...go on forever  
Go on forever and ever...ever and ever

Two different worlds collide  
Somehow come together  
Caught in the moment  
Blind with desire  
The way I want of you  
I should have known better  
Moving way too fast  
Jumping through the fire  
  
I can't regret you  
Somewhere we went wrong  
I won't forget you  
Long after you've gone  
  
Oh, you're still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Tell me, do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In my wildest dream, yeah  
  
We had our time to shine  
Before we started fading  
Could not see eye to eye  
Pretending nothing's wrong  
We open up our eyes and asked when love was gone  
I still think about you  
And how you've been  
Getting by without you  
But still you come again  
  
Oh, you're still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Tell me, do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In my wildest dream  
  
And on a bed of roses  
Under the pale moonlight  
I wait for sweet surrender  
Until another night  
  
Oh, you're still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Oh, tell me, do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In your wildest dream  
  
Can't get you off my mind  
In my wildest dream  
Can't get you off my mind  
Oh, oh, in your wildest dream  
Ooh, in your wildest dream, yeah  
Oh, oh, oh

I covered you with roses  
Like the stars at night  
I covered you with love  
Like a blanket on a cold winter's night  
I covered you with joy  
To make your lifetime bog and bright  
  
You touched me with your eyes  
Soft as an evening breeze  
You held me in your arms  
As the winds rushed through the trees  
You are my child  
You make my lifetime big and bright  
  
You are my child  
You came like the winds of March  
With all the love in your eyes  
You are my child  
You came like the morning lights  
With all your love, in your eyes  
  
You are my child  
You came like the morning light  
With all your love, in your eyes

On this day  
To be standing here with you  
There's no doubt  
I know this love is true  
See my tears  
Only you can understand  
A state of grace  
I feel blessed to hold your hand  
There's a room in my heart  
And you've unlocked a door  
That no one's ever opened before  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
On my own  
I searched for something more  
In your arms  
The kiss I've waited for  
I was lost for words  
To say what's in my heart  
Just to be close  
To the beauty that you are  
If someone could see  
To the end of our lives  
I know they'd find me there  
By your side  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
I've walked among the lonely  
Watching lovers come and go  
Fate finds us here as one  
You are salvation to my soul  
  
With your love I'm not alone  
In your world  
I'm never far away from home  
A life I thought I'd never find  
In your eyes I see all that I am  
With your love  
  
With your love  
With your love
