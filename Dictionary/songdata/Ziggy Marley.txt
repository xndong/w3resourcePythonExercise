[Chorus]  
I wanna thank you for the things you've done  
I wanna thank you for your generosity  
And I'll never be alone, that's because, that's because you are my friend  
That's because, that's because you are my friend  
  
Been through thick and thin together  
Through the ups and downs, yet we still remain  
And I can talk to you forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before I met you, I was real low, now everyone know  
Now that I know you hey I'm real high  
I wanna thank you for the day and nights  
I wanna thank you for the breath of life  
Without you I'd be lost  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as long, just as long as you're my friend  
Just as long, just as long as you're my friend  
That's because you are my friend, you are my friend

Seven richest countries in the world  
Them have a little meeting  
Them a plan to keep and oppress the poor  
So them have a little meeting  
But when them think then thing goes another way  
Yes when them think then thing goes another way  
  
Did you hear about these meetings  
No you won't find poor countries there  
Because of capitalist greed  
Revolution seem to be the only way  
It may be an old fashion way of thinking  
But I believe in the people and these aims  
  
'Cause when them think then things go the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
When them think then things go the the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
  
These countries want to stay on top  
So they'll find any way  
To them third world people life is but a small price to be paid  
They think they're great feeling no one can touch them  
Well them have a next thing comin'  
  
'Cause when them think then things go the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
Oh when them think then thing goes another way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
  
Seven richest things in the world  
What do they do for the people  
Look at America the so-called best  
How many homeless  
Where the money went  
In the sky on weapons of death  
WHy don't they write the needy some more checks  
  
'Cause when them think then thing goes another way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh  
When them think then things go the the people way  
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh

Irie days come on play  
Let the angels fly let the devils die  
Got to do what you can with the time at hand  
Ali boom mah yeah Ali boom mah yeah  
Don't worry your mind its just the test of time  
In five years these be the good old days  
  
No one knows what the future holds for everything has a season  
Its not a time for war its a time for peace  
Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes  
I remember when grandpa use to say grandson these be the good old days  
  
These be the good old days  
  
Now comes the moon with its starry lights  
And so begins the night life  
The tribal dance puts me in a trance  
As she pulls me in with her magic swing  
I asked of her what do we celebrate  
She said to me these be the good old days  
  
These be the good old days  
  
There is no future there is only now  
Let's cherish these moments that we now know  
  
These be the good old days
