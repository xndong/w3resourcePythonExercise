Trouble chasing me again  
Breaking down my best defense  
I'm looking  
God I'm looking for your  
  
Weary just won't let me rest  
And fear is filling up my head  
I'm longing  
God I'm longing for you  
But I will  
  
Find you in the place I'm in  
Find you when I'm at my end  
Find you when there's  
Nothing left of me to offer you  
Except for brokenness  
  
You lift me up  
You never leave me thirsty  
When I am weak  
When I'm lost and searching  
I find you on my knees  
  
So what if sorrow shakes my faith  
What if heartache still remains  
I'll trust you  
My god I'll trust you  
'Cause you are faithful  
And I will  
  
When my hope is gone  
When the fear is strong  
When the pain is real  
When the it's hard to heal.  
  
When my faith is shaken  
And my heart is broken  
And my joy is stolen  
God I know that you lift me up  
You never leave me searching

The moon and stars they wept  
The morning sun was dead  
The Savior of the world was fallen  
His body on the cross  
His blood poured out for us  
The weight of every curse upon him  
  
One final breath He gave  
As Heaven looked away  
The Son of God was laid in darkness  
A battle in the grave  
The war on death was waged  
The power of hell forever broken  
  
The ground began to shake  
The stone was rolled away  
His perfect love could not be overcome  
Now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive  
He is alive  
  
The ground began to shake  
The stone was rolled away  
His perfect love could not be overcome  
Now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive  
He is alive  
Forever, forever  
  
You have overcome  
Your resurrected King  
You have overcome the grave  
You have overcome

Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone  
Your presence, Lord  
  
Holy Spirit, You are welcome here

Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone  
By Your presence, Lord

Without a word  
The mountains speak  
The song that all creation sings  
The painted skies  
The sun and stars  
The Heavens tell how great You are  
The Heavens tell how great You are  
  
How majestic is Your name  
How majestic is Your name  
Jesus wonderful, powerful  
You're the Lord of all  
How majestic is Your name  
  
A rugged cross  
A humble King  
How beautiful the mystery  
That love would bleed from majesty  
  
All rise, all rise in highest praise  
Your name will reign through all eternity  
Our hope, our strength, our victory  
We bow down, down at Your feet

When I walk through deep waters  
I know that You will be with me  
When I'm standing in the fire  
I will not be overcome  
Through the valley of the shadow  
I will not fear  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [2x]  
  
In the midst of deep sorrow  
I see Your light is breaking through  
The dark of night will not overtake me  
I am pressing into You  
Lord, You fight my every battle  
And I will not fear  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [2x]  
  
You amaze me  
Redeem me  
You call me as Your own [4x]  
  
You're my strength  
You're my defender  
You're my refuge in the storm  
Through these trials  
You've always been faithful  
You bring healing to my soul  
  
I am not alone  
I am not alone  
You will go before me  
You will never leave me [3x]

Only one name lasts forever  
Only one fame stands alone  
Only one King has an anthem  
That goes on and on and on  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing  
  
Only one word in the beginning  
Only one truth will prevail  
Only one love brings a freedom  
Only one Man took the nails  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing  
  
Praise, praise to the Savior  
Praise to the Lamb of God  
Praise in all of His splendor  
Praise for saving my life  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing

You lead me by the waters still  
You lay me down to rest upon your faithfulness  
My Shepherd, simply take my hand  
Your song restores my soul  
For Your name, You make me whole  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
No shadow ever shall I fear  
Your peace, my heart will know  
My cup it overflows  
Your goodness chases after me  
Your mercy and Your grace will be my dwelling place  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
I will sing from the mountain top  
I will sing, I am overcome, I will sing making melodies  
I will sing from the valley low  
I will sing because of Your love I will sing  
You're my King, I will sing  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
Joyfully, joyfully, joyfully

Maker of the Heavens  
Keeper of my heart

Standing in Your presence

I look to You where my help comes from  
The Lord watches over me  
Your mercies are new with the morning sun  
The Lord watches over me  
  
You've never failed me, God  
  
Keeper of my heart  
Keeper of my heart

Listen for the Lord  
Hear the voice of His spirit  
Call upon His name

In the valley of the unknown  
I will lift my voice  
In the shifting, in the shadow  
I know You are with me  
  
Lord over all  
You will be my rescue  
You will never fail  
Lord, through it all  
I will choose to trust You  
You will never fail  
  
In the searching and the waiting  
You quiet my soul  
In the stillness of Your presence  
I know You are with me  
  
Out of this darkness  
Into Your promise  
You will deliver me  
Eternal Savior  
You stand forever  
You are my victory

If my heart is overwhelmed  
And I cannot hear your voice  
I hold on to what is true  
Though I cannot see  
  
If the storms of life they come  
And the road ahead gets steep  
I will lift these hands in faith  
I will believe  
  
I'll remind myself  
Of all that you've done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son  
  
Love came down and rescued me

I am yours  
Lord I'm forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
When my heart is filled with hope  
Every promise comes my way  
When I feel your hands of grace  
Rest upon me  
  
Staying desperate for you, god  
Staying humble at your feet  
I will lift these hands in praise  
I will believe  
  
I'll remind myself  
Of all that you've done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son

Take the sun  
Take the moon  
Take the earth and watch it move  
Under Your control  
Cause You're all I know  
  
Here's my life and all my heart  
I give it all but every part  
Is under Your control  
Lord You're all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
'til You tell them to  
The faith in my heart will still sing  
Of what Your love can do  
And even when life weighs heavy on me  
I know You're in control  
And You're all I need  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
'til You tell them to  
  
Take the sea  
Take the tide  
Take the waters watch them rise  
Giving praise to You  
Always praising You  
Here's my voice  
And all my soul  
Singing freely when  
Lord, I'm giving praise to You  
Lord I'm praising You  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The clouds will rain  
The seasons change  
(Cause You told them to)  
The sun will shine  
Your burning light  
(Cause You told it to)  
When You speak your words through my soul  
So I know it's true  
You're in control  
In control  
In control  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there  
The faith in my heart will sting sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The stars in the sky will hang there

Father, I love Your ways  
You came in Your mercy and died in my place  
All I can do is bow  
Because of Your goodness and Your sovereign grace  
That You sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Tears rolling down my face  
Because of Your love and Your sweet embrace  
The peace that just overflows  
It's here that I know You have been waiting to  
Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
(Sweep me away, sweep me away)  
Just You and me Lord  
Sweep me away  
(Sweep me away, away in Your love)  
Sweep me away in Your love  
(Sweep me away, sweep me away)  
Sweep me away in Your love  
(Sweep me away, away in Your love)  
Sweep me away in Your love  
Oh, away in Your love, sweep  
Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Sweep me away, sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Just You and me, just You and me  
Sweep me away, oh Lord  
Your grace, it covers me  
Your love, it covers me

You never change, you are the God you say you are  
When I'm afraid you calm and still my beating heart  
You stay the same, when hope is just a distant thought  
You take my pain and you lead me to the cross  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess you're always enough for me you're all I need  
  
I look to you, I see the scars upon your hands  
And hold the truth that when I can't you always can  
I'm standing here beneath the shadow of the cross,  
I'm overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me you're all I need  
  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me  
You're all I need  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me  
Always enough for me  
Always enough for me
