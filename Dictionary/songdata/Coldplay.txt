She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far  
The snow came down  
Get's colder day by day, I miss her  
  
I hear children singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
In these frozen and silent nights  
Sometimes in a dream, you appear  
Outside under the purple sky  
Diamonds in the snow sparkle  
  
And our hearts were singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
2000 miles is very far through the snow  
I think of you wherever you go  
2000 miles is very far through the snow  
I think of you wherever you go  
  
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far  
The snow came falling now  
Get's colder day by day, I miss you  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time  
  
I hear people singing  
It felt like Christmas time

Those who are dead, are not dead  
They're just living in my head  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well  
Oh,  
  
Time is so short and I'm sure  
There must be something more  
  
Those who are dead, are not dead  
They're just living in my head, oh  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well, oh  
  
Time is so short and I'm sure  
There must be something more.  
  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close  
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close  
  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close  
You didn't get to heaven but you oh, oh,

They're just living in my head

Oh, I think I landed in a world I hadn't seen  
When I'm feeling ordinary, when I don't know what I mean  
Oh, I think I landed where there are miracles at work  
For the thirst and for the hunger, come the conference of birds  
  
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems  
Leave your broken windows open  
And in the light just streams  
  
And you get a head  
A head full of dreams  
You can see the change you want to  
Be what you want to be  
  
When you get a head  
A head full of dreams  
Into a life I've just been spoken  
With a head full, a head full of dreams  
  
Oh, I think I landed where there are miracles at work  
When you got me open handed  
When you got me lost for words  
  
I sing oh, oh  
A head full of dreams, oh  
A head full of dreams, oh  
  
Into life I've just been spoken  
With a head full, a head full of dreams

My song is love  
Love to the lovers shone  
And it goes up  
You don't have to be alone  
  
Your heavy heart  
Is made of stone  
And it's so hard to see you  
Clearly you don't have to be on your own  
You don't have to be on your own  
  
And I'm not gonna take it back  
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that  
You're the target that I'm aiming at  
And I'll get that message home  
  
My song is love  
My song is love I know  
I'm on fire for you  
Clearly you don't have to be alone  
You don't have to be on your own  
  
And I'm not gonna take it back  
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that  
You're the target that I'm aiming at  
But I'm nothing on my own  
Got to get that message home  
  
And I'm not gonna stand and wait  
Not gonna leave it until its much too late  
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say  
That I'm nothing on my own  
And I love you, please come home  
  
My song is love, is love I know  
And I've got to get that message home

He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down  
I'm gonna put it six feet underground  
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall  
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls  
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire  
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires  
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn  
Do back the things it did to you in return  
  
Ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah  
  
He said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war  
If you can tell me something worth fighting for  
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said  
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head  
  
And honey all the movements you're starting to make  
See me crumble and fall on my face  
And I know the mistakes that I made  
See it all disappear without a trace  
And they call as they beckon you on  
They said start as you mean to go on  
Start as you mean to go on  
  
He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go  
Stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow  
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry  
You just sit down there and you wonder why  
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war  
If you can tell me something worth fighting for  
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said  
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head  
Oh to the head  
  
And honey all the movements you're starting to make  
See me crumble and fall on my face  
And I know the mistakes that I made  
See it all disappear without a trace  
And they call as they beckon you on  
They say start as you mean to go on  
As you mean to go on, as you mean to go on  
  
So meet me by the bridge, meet me by the lane  
When am I gonna see that pretty face again  
Meet me on the road, meet me where I said  
Blame it all upon  
A rush of blood to the head

Cause you're a sky  
Cause you're a sky full of stars  
I'm going to give you my heart  
Cause you're a sky  
Cause you're a sky full of stars  
And cause you light up the path

Go on and tear me apart  
I don't care if you do  
Cause in a sky  
Cause in a sky full of stars

Such a heavenly view  
You're such a heavenly view

A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper  
A whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Night turns to day  
And I still have these questions  
Bridges will break  
Should I go forwards or backwards  
Night turns to day  
And I still get no answers  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
(Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper)  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Who remembers your face  
Who remembers you when you are gone  
  
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks  
Come back and look for me  
Look for me when I am lost  
And I am just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper  
  
Oh ha ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Verse 1]  
Turn your magic on  
Umi she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
We are legends, every day  
That's what she told me  
  
[Refrain]  
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
Under this pressure, under this weight  
We are diamonds  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Now I feel my heart beating,  
I feel my heart underneath my skin  
And I feel my heart beating  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
Alive again  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said I can't go on, not in this way  
I'm a dream I die by light of day  
Gonna hold up half the sky and say  
Only I own me  
  
[Chorus 2]  
And I feel my heart beating  
I feel my heart underneath my skin  
Oh, I can feel my heart beating  
Cause you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
Alive again  
Oh, you make me feel  
Like I'm alive again  
  
[Refrain]  
Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say  
Everything you want's a dream away  
Under this pressure, under this weight  
We are diamonds taking shape  
We are diamonds taking shape  
Repeated: (Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
  
[Bridge]  
If we've only got this life  
This adventure, oh then I  
And if we've only got this life  
You get me through  
And if we've only got this life  
This adventure, oh then I  
Want to share it with you  
With you, with you  
Yeah I do  
  
[Outro]  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)  
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)

On and on  
You're told which side you're on  
You're forced, you're thrown  
To become the sythe to cut the corn  
  
And all Your friends  
They ride into the suset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they blow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they're thrown  
Into the fire  
  
Ten below  
The call comes on the radio  
Over you go  
And in the red now all the rivers flow  
The poppies grow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they blow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Ride into the sunset  
And they're taken home  
  
Open fire  
Open fire  
  
Open fire  
Open fire  
And fire  
As they ride fire

I think of you  
I haven't slept  
I think I do  
But I don't forget  
My body moves  
Goes where I will  
But though I try my heart stays still  
It never moves  
Just won't be left  
So my mouth waters to be a fate  
And you're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
  
You're always in my head  
You're always in my head  
Always in my  
You're always in my  
  
This I guess is to tell you you're choosing out of the rest

Come on, oh my star is fading  
And I swerve out of control  
If I, if I'd only waited  
I'd not be stuck here in this hole  
  
Come here, oh my star is fading  
And I swerve out of control  
And I swear I waited and waited  
I've got to get out of this hole  
  
But time is on your side  
It's on your side now  
Not pushing you down and all around  
It's no cause for concern  
  
Come on, oh my star is fading  
And I see no chance of release  
And I know I'm dead on the surface  
But I am screaming underneath  
  
And time is on your side  
Is on your side, It's on your side now  
Not pushing you down, and all around  
No it's no cause for concern  
  
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain  
And I'm on my way back down again  
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose  
Sick to the stomach  
You can say what you mean  
But it won't change a thing  
I'm sick of the secrets  
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose  
  
You came along and you cut me loose  
You came along and you cut me loose  
You came along and you cut me loose

Animals we are  
Disposable  
Collapsible and raw  
I suppose  
It's just the state I'm in  
Animals that climb  
I'm climbin' over you  
Until you say  
"Off you go, off you go"  
  
Animal I am  
Disposable  
Collapsible and raw  
I don't know which way  
I should turn  
  
Animal that runs  
I ran away from you  
And now I'm in  
"Off you go, off you go"  
(And you say)  
  
If you're gonna go, go now  
If you're gonna go, go now  
I forgot to tell you how  
If you gonna go, go now  
  
Animal I am  
I'm looking for a future  
Just like you  
Well I don't know  
Which way I turn  
  
Animals that climb  
I climb all over you  
Until I say  
And I missed my chance  
By a stone slow  
  
If you're gonna go  
Go now  
If you're gonna go  
Go now  
I forgot to tell you how  
If you gonna go  
Go now

[Verse 1]  
Been around the world, the wonders to view  
Been around the world, looking for someone like you  
Pyramids try, Babylon too  
But the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue  
  
[Chorus]  
So I never say die, aim never untrue  
I'm never so high as when I'm with you  
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through  
My army of one is gonna fight for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Been around the world, universe too  
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do  
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon  
And be standing here beside you  
Right when the storm comes through  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I never say die, aim never untrue  
I'm never so high as when I'm with you  
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through  
My army of one is gonna fight for you  
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause you reign  
All cause you reign  
All cause you reign  
My army of one is gonna call it through  
  
[Outro]  
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one  
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one  
It's my only weapon, army of one  
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one

Some saw the sun  
Some saw the smoke  
Some heard the gun  
Some bent the bow  
  
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note  
Caught in the fire, say oh  
We're about to explode  
  
Carry your world, I'll carry your world  
Carry your world, I'll carry your world  
  
Some far away  
Some search for gold  
Some dragon to slay  
Heaven we hope is just up the road  
  
Show me the way, Lord, 'cause I, I'm about to explode  
  
Carry your world, I'll carry your world  
Carry your world, I'll carry your world  
  
Carry your world, and all your hurt  
  
(Carry your world, carry your world)

Been standing in the corner  
Studying the lights  
The dreaming of escape  
Will keep you up at night  
  
But someone had put the flares up  
Got me in the rays so guess I better stay  
"Uh uh, no come on!" You say  
  
"It's a fools gold thunder  
It's just warring rain  
Don't let the fears just start  
'What if I won't see you again'  
  
Around here you never  
Want to sleep all night  
So start falling in love, start the riot  
And come on, rage with me  
  
We don't need words, we'll be birds  
Got to make our own key"  
  
Only got this moment, you and me  
Guilty of nothing but geography  
  
Come on raise it  
Come on and raise this noise  
For the million people, who got not one voice  
  
Come on it's not over!  
If you mean it say loud  
Come on all for love  
Out from the underground away with me  
  
We don't need words  
Close your eyes and see  
We'll be birds flying free  
Holding on in the mystery  
  
Fearless through this you said  
We'll go through this together  
So when you fly won't you - won't you take me too?  
In this world so cruel I think you're so cool

Hold me tight don't let go  
Forever be yours in this bright new dawn  
Open up your eyes for a big new suprize  
Listen to me now in the bright new dawn  
Fixing what's wrong seeing the people who don't belong we will try to hide are
dispise but it always comes out on the inside.  
Corus: Nobody said it was easy together we can help change the world. come
with me now on this island of love running away from all sivilization Open
your eyes to a bright new dawn  
  
Over all we have done good.  
My heart is beating ever so quickly don't shade your eyes from the bright new
dawn

Brothers and sisters unite  
It's the time of your lives its the time of your lives  
Break down, break down  
Got to spread love around, got to spread it around  
  
Brothers and sisters feel fine  
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives  
There's no sound, no sound  
Like this feeling you found like this feeling you found  
  
But just stay down  
Cause sometimes you feel  
So stay down  
And sometimes you feel  
And it's me they're lookin' for  
And it's me, I will never survive  
But we'll be around some more  
  
Brothers and sisters unite

So stay around  
And sometimes you'll feel  
And it's me they're looking for  
And it's me, I will never survive  
But well be around some more  
  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna be alright

I feel safe  
I feel warm  
When you're here, can I do no wrong?  
I am cured, when I'm by you're side  
I'm alright, yes I'm alright  
  
I'm safe when I am with you  
And I feel warm if you want me to  
I am cured, when I'm by your side  
I'm alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Careful where you stand, my love  
Careful where you lay your head  
It's true we're always there  
Looking out for one another  
  
I feel safe when I'm with you  
And I feel warm if you want me to  
I am cured when you're all alone  
I'm alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I'd like a quiet town, please  
I'd like a quiet town  
  
Oh now now  
Oh now now  
And careful where you stand  
And careful where you stand

At night they would go walking 'till the breaking of the day  
The morning is for sleeping  
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in their own way  
Save the nighttime for your weeping  
Your weeping  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
  
So we rode down to the river, where the toiling ghosts spring  
For their curses to be broken  
We'd go underneath the arches, where the witches are in the saying  
There are ghost towns in the ocean  
The ocean  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
  
God is in the houses and God is in my head  
And all the cemeteries in London  
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said  
For my heart it wasn't open  
Not open  
  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
And the night over London lay  
Singing la lalalalala la la  
There's no light over London today.

Stole a key  
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet  
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me  
To set me free  
  
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene  
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me  
  
In my scarecrow dreams  
When they smashed my heart into smithereens  
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete  
Be the cartoon heart  
  
Light a fire, light a spark  
Light a fire, a flame in my heart  
  
We'll run wild oh  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
  
All the boys, all the girls  
All that matters in the world  
All the boys, all the girls  
All that matters that occurs  
All the highs, all the lows  
As the room is spinning, oh  
  
We'll run wild  
We'll be glowing in the dark  
  
Living innocent wild  
We'll be glowing in the dark

Christmas night, another fight  
Tears we cried a flood  
Got all kinds of poison in  
Poison in my blood  
  
I took my feet  
To Oxford Street  
Trying to right a wrong  
Just walk away  
Those windows say  
But I can't believe she's gone  
  
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall  
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Up above candles on air flicker  
Oh they flicker and they float  
But I'm up here holding on  
To all those chandeliers of hope  
  
Like some drunken Elvis singing  
I go singing out of tune  
Saying how I always loved you darling  
And I always will  
  
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall  
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Still waiting for the snow to fall  
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all  
  
Those Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Down where the sea and city meet  
May all your troubles soon be gone  
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on  
  
Those Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Maybe they'll bring her back to me  
Then all my troubles will be gone  
Oh Christmas lights keep shining on  
  
Oh Christmas lights  
Light up the street  
Light up the fireworks in me  
May all your troubles soon be gone  
Those Christmas lights keep shining on

The lights go out and I can't be saved  
Tides that I tried to swim against  
Have brought me down upon my knees  
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing  
  
Come out of the things unsaid  
Shoot an apple off my head and a  
Trouble that can't be named  
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing  
  
You are, you are  
  
Confusion that never stops  
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna  
Come back and take you home  
I could not stop, that you now know, singing  
  
Come out upon my seas  
Cursed missed opportunities am I  
A part of the cure  
Or am I part of the disease, singing  
  
You are, you are  
You are, you are  
You are, you are  
  
And nothing else compares  
And nothing else compares  
And nothing else compares  
  
You are, you are  
  
Home, home, where I wanted to go  
Home, home, where I wanted to go  
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)  
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

All winter we got carried away  
Over on the rooftops, let's get married  
All summer we just hurried  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
  
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry  
And don't worry  
  
Try  
Try  
Try  
Try  
  
No I don't want to battle from beginning to end  
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends  
  
No I don't want to battle from beginning to end  
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge  
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends.  
  
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape.  
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape.

If sweet death  
Should ever conquer me  
Let me know  
Boys, let me know  
If you hear him coming  
Won't you let me flee  
Let me go, boys, let me go  
  
One day  
Death is gonna conquer me  
I'll be down  
Where the waters flow  
I hope sweet Heaven  
Is a place for me  
Let me know  
Boys, let me know  
  
If sweet death  
Should ever conquer me  
Take me down  
To some place below  
If you hear him coming  
Won't you set me free  
Let me go  
Boys, let me go  
  
If you hear him comin'  
Won't you say for me  
That I just  
Don't want to go

And if I lost the map  
If I lost it all  
I fell into the trap  
Then she goes  
  
When you're tired of waiting you just  
Find you never had to stop  
Come on baby, don't let it break your heart  
  
Those heavenly regrets  
Still on me though  
Trying to catch a cannonball  
And so burning tired  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh through my veins is flowing  
From a shipwreck I heard a call  
Well she said  
  
When you're tired of aiming your arrows  
Still you'll never hit the mark  
Oh-oh-oh even if your aims are shadows  
Still we never gonna part  
  
Come on baby don't let it  
Break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart  
  
Don't let it break your heart

Bones sinking like stones  
All that we've fought for  
Homes, places we've grown  
All of us are done for  
  
We live in a beautiful world  
Yeah we do  
Yeah we do  
We live in a beautiful world  
  
Bones sinking like stones  
All that we've fought for  
Homes, places we've grown  
All of us are done for  
  
We live in a beautiful world  
Yeah we do  
Yeah we do  
We live in a beautiful world  
  
We live in a beautiful world  
Yeah we do  
Yeah we do  
We live in a beautiful world  
  
Oh all that I know  
There's nothing here to run from  
Cause here  
Everybody here's got somebody to lean on

I know it doesn't seem that way  
But maybe it's the perfect day  
Even though the bills are piling  
And maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling  
  
But if we'd only open our eyes  
We'd see the blessings in disguise  
That all the rain clouds are fountains  
Though our troubles seem like mountains  
  
There's gold in them hills  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
Every now and then life says  
Where do you think you're going so fast  
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes  
It's a case of cruel to be kind  
  
And if we'd get up off our knees  
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees  
And we'd see the new sun rising  
Over the hills on the horizon  
  
There's gold in them hills  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose faith  
Give the world a chance to say...  
  
A word or two, my friend  
There's no telling how the day might end  
And we'll never know until we see  
That there's gold in them hills  
  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
There's gold in them hills...  
There's gold in them hills...

Honey  
It's been a long time coming  
And I can't stop now  
Such a long time running  
And I can't stop now  
Do you hear my heart beating?  
Can you hear that sound?  
'Cause I can't help thinking  
I don't look down  
  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And I could see  
Oh, the way that gravity turns for you and me  
And then I looked up at the sky  
And saw the sun  
And the way that gravity turns on everyone  
On everyone  
  
Baby  
It's been a long time waiting  
Such a long, long time  
And I can't stop smiling  
Oh I can't stop now  
Do you hear my heart beating?  
Oh, do you hear that sound?  
'Cause I can't stop crying  
And I won't look down  
  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And I could see  
Oh, the way that gravity turns on you and me  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And saw the sky  
And the way that gravity pulls on you and I  
On you and I

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on, our troubles will be far away  
  
Here we are, as in olden days  
Happy golden days of your  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us  
Once more  
  
Through the years, we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Stuck here  
In the middle of no where  
With a headache  
And a heavy heart  
  
Oh well nothing  
Was going quite right here  
And I'm tired  
I can't play no part  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
I'm in  
Come on come on  
Why won't it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
  
Oh my head  
Just won't stop achin'  
I'm sat here lickin' my ruins  
I'm shattered  
But I really doesn't matter  
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
I'm in  
Come on come on  
Why won't it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
Oh the help is just around the corner  
For us

Can anybody fly this thing  
Before my head explodes  
Or my head starts to ring  
  
We've been living life  
Inside a bubble  
We've been living life  
Inside a bubble  
  
Confidence in you  
Is confidence in me  
Is confidence in high speed  
  
Can anybody stop this thing

Anything we should know about your change?  
They put the world in a tin can,  
Black market, contraband,  
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it.  
In a long black trench coat,  
Two hands around the throat,  
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes  
  
There's so much to be scared of,  
And not much to make sense of,  
How did the clowns ever get control?  
If your hear can you let me know,  
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated?  
Ooh you just want to get it right sometimes  
You just want to get it right sometimes  
  
That's how you see the world,  
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn,  
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself,  
You're not gonna give up.  
  
And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening,  
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful?  
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped  
Ooh, we just want to get it right sometimes,  
Just want to get it right sometimes,  
  
That's how you see the world,  
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word,  
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself,  
'Cause nobody can hurt you  
  
That's how you see the world  
That's how you see the world

Here, I am  
And beyond the reach of my hands  
She's sound asleep  
And she's sweet another know why  
These dreams could've seen her  
And I watched her slipping away  
And I know I'll be hunting high and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
High and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
Find her again  
Upon this my dreams are depending  
Through the dark  
I can hear the pounding of her heart  
Next to mine  
She's the sweetest love I could find  
So I know I'll be hunting high and low  
High...  
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to  
High and low  
High...  
Do you know how it feels to love you?  
Do you know how it feels to love you?  
High and Low

Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That you're missing the mark?  
It's so cold, it's so cold  
It's so cold, it's so cold  
  
Written up in marker on a factory sign  
I struggle with the feeling  
That my life isn't mine  
It's so cold, it's so cold  
It's so cold, it's so cold  
  
See the arrow that they shot trying  
To tear us apart took the fire from my belly and  
The beat from my heart  
Still I won't let go  
Still I won't let go  
  
You, ooh, ooh  
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
On every street, every car, every surface in nature  
And at the streets are rising and you'd rather sing  
Don't let them take control  
No, we won't let 'em take control  
  
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous  
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax  
I'm coming 'round to get us  
I'm coming 'round when they don't know the facts  
  
So on a concrete canvas and a glow in the dark  
On a concrete canvas, I will make you a mark  
Armed with the spray can soul  
Let me out with the spray can soul  
  
You, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
Whoa-oh-oh  
Whoa-oh-oh  
  
Yeah, it's true, when you  
Use your heart as a weapon  
And it hurts like heaven  
  
Oh and it hurts like heaven

Oh, angel sent from up above  
You know you make my world light up  
When I was down, when I was hurt  
You came to lift me up  
  
Life is a drink and loves a drug  
Oh, now I think I must be miles up  
When I was a river dried up  
You came to rain a flood  
  
And said drink from me, drink from me  
When I was so thirsty  
Pour on a symphony, now I just can't get enough  
  
Put your wings on me, wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Pour on a symphony when I'm low, low, low, low  
  
I, oh I, oh I, got me feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
Oh I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
  
Oh, angel sent from up above  
I feel you coursing through my blood  
Life is a drink and your love's  
About to make the stars come out  
  
Put your wings on me, wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Pour on a symphony, when I'm low, low, low, low  
  
I, oh I, oh I, got me feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
Oh I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
  
I, oh I, oh I, lalala lalalala  
So high, so high  
  
I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high  
So high, so high  
  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the

In my place, in my place  
Were lines that I couldn't change  
I was lost, oh yeah  
  
I was lost, I was lost  
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed  
I was lost, oh yeah  
  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Yeah how long must you pay for it?  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Oh for it  
  
I was scared, I was scared  
Tired and under prepared  
But I wait for it  
  
If you go, if you go  
Leave me down here on my own  
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)  
  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Yeah how long must you pay for it?  
Yeah how long must you wait for it?  
Oh for it  
  
Sing it, please, please, please  
Come back and sing to me, to me, me  
Come on and sing it out, now, now  
Come on and sing it out, to me, me  
Come back and sing it  
  
In my place, in my place  
Were lines that I couldn't change  
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeah

Got a tattoo that says "2gether thru life"  
Carved in your name with my pocket knife  
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright  
Feels like there's something broken inside  
  
All I know, all I know  
Is that I'm lost whenever you go  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
Got a tattoo and the pains alright  
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
All I know, all I know  
Is that I'm lost in your fire below  
  
All I know  
Is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
See the road begin to climb  
See your stars begin to shine  
I see your colors and I'm dying of thirst  
  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
So much that it hurts

From the very start  
It came apart  
It broke up into pieces and  
There was a chance and I missed it  
It could risked it  
And I put myself into your hands  
  
Cause you're not just anyone  
You're a ladder to the sun  
Oh you're not just anyone  
You're a ladder to the sun  
  
Performing Courses  
Opposing forces  
And all men are just mortals, and  
So if you want me then you can have me  
Take me, oh baby grab me  
  
Cause if you want me then you can have me  
Cause you're not just anyone  
You're a ladder to the sun  
You're not just anyone  
You're a ladder to the sun  
  
Oh now boy what you been and done  
You set a course that you couldn't run  
Oh now boy what you been and done  
  
I had it all and I risked it  
I had it all and I risked it all  
And I risked it all  
And I risked it all  
  
A ladder to the  
A Ladder to the sun  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun  
  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun  
And I risked it all  
A ladder to the  
A ladder to the sun

Just because I'm losing  
Doesn't mean I'm lost  
Doesn't mean I'll stop  
Doesn't mean I will cross  
  
Just because I'm hurting  
Doesn't mean I'm hurt  
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve  
No better and no worse  
  
I just got lost  
Every river that I've tried to cross  
And every door I ever tried was locked  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off.  
  
You might be a big fish  
In a little pond  
Doesn't mean you've won  
'Cause along may come  
A bigger one  
And you'll be lost  
  
Every river that you tried to cross  
Every gun you ever held went off  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the firing starts  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off  
  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off  
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'till the shine wears off.
