It's one in the mornin',  
You know what time it is!  
It's one in the mornin'  
It's one in the mornin',  
You gonna have come out your clothes on this one  
It's one in the mornin'  
  
Yeah I'm still at it, the microphone addict  
You get your dome splattered, 'cause homey will not have it  
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic  
For actin' like you a teenage chick with her bra padded  
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge  
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin' through they cabbage  
You know my track record, L battle like a savage  
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage  
Uncle LL, I got product for sale  
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail  
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community  
Gotta get this money while y'all march for unity  
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on  
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on  
The realest brother, you Nicole Kidman, one of 'The Others'  
Children shiverin' under the covers  
The man in black, the tilted Fedora hat  
I'm bringin' it raw, you never want your money back  
I'm focused baby, livin' like a quarterback  
Playin' in the wishbone, L keep options black  
Systematically, burn you like calories  
Watch your mouth, go earn your lil' salary  
I'm a classic like Nike Airs and Wallabees  
You could catch it like the flu, homey follow me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's one in the mornin', flash the dough  
It's one in the mornin', crack the Mo'  
It's one in the mornin', get on the flo'  
It's one in the mornin', who want to go?  
  
That's right Sleeping Beauty, wake up see the light  
That Tylenol PM got you caught for your BM  
Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin' coliseums  
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin' for per diem  
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum  
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him  
Money's my slave, it do what I say  
It cry for me, like Denzel in "Glory"  
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty  
I wonder if you hatin' on the low, probably!  
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels  
Damn! Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal  
But you lack the discipline to do what I do  
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension  
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot  
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Aye yo E it's one o'clock  
Time to get one and bounce baby  
It's time to get one and bounce,  
You know what time it is  
  
Your honor, last week he punched me in my face  
I want twenty million, you know he liftin' weights  
Last week, me and the President was takin' flicks  
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick  
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks  
That cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it  
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted  
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Sumit  
The Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know  
My po'tfolio was sicker than polio  
For real God is good, he took me out the hood  
Got me livin' in a mansion like a big boy should  
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes  
Knowin' how I live, bed extra big  
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch  
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out  
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce  
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce  
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo  
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago  
But no, in real life cats catch it  
It's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Yeah yeah  
It's the definition  
Definition  
Definition potna, eleven in a row!

Six minutes, six minutes  
Six minutes, six minutes  
  
I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Hey yo, baby, I know why you're here  
I know what you're doing  
I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'  
I know what it is, but we're still cool  
And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby  
I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go  
Cause a fool doesn't have a shoulder to cry on  
So give me a kiss and your service  
Whether you like a mister or a miss  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Baby, you're my dear, I know why you're here  
I know why you came, I know what you're thinkin'  
I know what you need, and that's what I've got  
You think I'm goin' crazy, no, I'm not drinking  
I know what you want, I made ya want it  
Take my hand, listen to the man  
You have a plan, don't even risk it  
What do you want, a biscuit?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Six minutes, six minutes  
Six minutes, six minutes  
(I ain't sayin' nothin')  
Six minutes, six minutes  
  
Honey, I know what you're up to, I know how you're livin'  
I know where you go when you leave my house  
I know what your dreams are, but I dream too  
You're with a man your, not with a mouse  
I see how you stare, I see how you smile  
I see right through, now act like you knew  
I know all about where you been runnin'  
Wipe your feet before you come in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, that's smooth, let's just sit here and relax  
While my man plays the piano for us  
Sip somethin' mellow  
And it's us while you're here  
But of course I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
Okay, now that you know I know you know that I know you know  
And that's the move, so sit right here  
Whisper in my ear, caress my chest  
And say somethin' smooth, but don't forget  
I'll know what you'll say  
Just what I thought, I know the routine  
I know the routine, just what I thought  
I know you tell the truth, I know you don't lie  
Shh, close your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't tell if you won't tell  
It's cool with me, I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know why you're here  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
  
I know you don't love me  
But I ain't sayin' nothin'  
(I know why you're here)  
I ain't sayin'

Here we go, another funky style  
Peace to my brothers on "Rikers' Isle"  
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile  
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild  
This here part is like section one  
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns  
Early mornin' light is yet to come  
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun  
Females, let your hair down  
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown  
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz  
You give me to the "sploshers", you can get your-a blast  
Enter at your own risk, some brothers got weapons  
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied  
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone  
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop  
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop  
Dosey-do your partner all night long  
And all you mothers, bring your kids along  
  
[Chorus]  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) Huh, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'  
(Yo Uncle) whats up, whats up?  
(Yo Uncle) (just kick a little somethin')  
  
Ain't no mountain high enough to overcome this  
Funky-like type of stuff  
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff  
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs  
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover  
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver  
Don't stop till you get it on  
With ya head B-boppin' like a bouncy ball  
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall  
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all  
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static  
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic  
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it  
Here we go, hand over the cash yo  
What chime? Hey yo, blast the Tabasco  
Work your body like a dime, oh no  
Do the freaky-deaky, the whole girls' cargo  
Females on the side, we gotta win 'em, yeah  
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah  
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber  
Makes me sick like an earthquake  
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make  
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house  
Must be eatin' hardy  
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya  
And clinically proven, damn!  
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz  
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound  
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound  
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down  
Put ya body in the lost and found  
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down  
What you see is what you get  
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?  
Down-home monkey, corn fed, original  
And what you do is up to you, the individual  
This is the place to be for why'all underage brothers  
With the rebel mentality  
Sweet young freaks sayin' "Rock me ?Arma-day-us?  
Skin so smooth lookin' all ?  
Video to video, tape to tape  
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate  
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge  
Too many people in the crib  
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy  
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady  
Ain't nothin' here petty  
Trip down to your laund-a-ray, I'm ready!  
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force  
And get jaws off, no matter what the cost  
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove  
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes  
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove  
I know the Marley remix to make you move  
  
[Chorus]

I know a honey named Millie, raised out in Philly  
Body so illy she make a grown man silly  
A brainiac really she pretend she dilly  
Like, "Why you always look at me like that, you feel me?"  
  
There's a girl named Wendy, love black Bentley's  
Nails in her mouth, stay tryin' to tempt me  
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly  
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty  
  
Shorty named Suzie, not quite a floozy  
Let's just say she has a problem bein' choosy  
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi  
On the celly with her man, "Love you, I'm at the movies"  
  
Bird named Chyna (baby where you find her)  
Uptown, she wrote a map down with eyeliner  
Hotness, two or three girlfriends behind her  
(On Amsterdam, lay in the lane, dippin' despite her)  
  
[Chorus]  
So after school, I take a dip in the pool  
Which is really, on the wall  
I got a color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball  
And we talkin' bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money  
Than a sucker, could ever spend  
But I couldn't give a what about them cats you with  
Get your friends baby, jump in the Benz  
  
I got a judge named Donna, I call her Your Honor  
Whylin' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas (let's go)  
  
And then there's Tamika, the sergeant gets deeper  
She turned the bass way up and wind on the speaker  
Girl named Kelly, rhinestones in her belly  
Curly red hair, crackin jokes in the telly  
Game concealed, a female Machiavelli  
Hopin and prayin that I ain't ready for the jelly  
  
What about Asia (major flavor)  
Can you feel it? nothin' can save ya  
Once again I got 'em catchin' the vapors  
  
Mr. Smith bout to get this paper  
Paparazzi, please give me a minute  
You're pushin' me to the limit, I know that I represent it  
Be easy!  
  
Tammy, down in Miami  
Fa'scheezy baby uh, I see you at the Grammy's  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody go, I want to rock right now  
LL and Diddy, we came to get down  
Yes we're internationally known  
For making movies and the microphone  
Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous  
You rollin' with us?  
You rollin' with flavor  
  
Ask Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)  
Cause after the show, there's nothin' open but Denny's (oh yeah)  
Maybe the waffle house, down South there's many  
She fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley  
  
Little Shaniqua, from Massapequa  
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her, anyway  
  
When you talk about Diddy and L  
You talk about careers that's hard to kill  
The whole entire globe recognize the grill  
Walkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody go, I want to rock right now  
LL and Diddy, we came to get down  
Yes we're internationally known  
For making movies and the microphone  
Cause we get crazy, I mean outrageous  
You rollin' with us? You rollin' with flavor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody go  
Friends to the end baby, why'knahmsayin?  
Got history baby  
Not even, no question about it  
We won't stop  
Yeah never, word up, we keepin' this money  
Ten  
Oh yeah  
Ten  
Rockin' with my man, rockin' with that Bad Boy cat  
Uncle L  
Rock the Bells  
A.K.A., Black Elvis  
P. Diddy  
Diddy  
Hottest man in the city  
Y'all see it  
Word up, please believe it  
Smile at it, love it, embrace it  
Ah, grin baby, grin  
Get used to it  
That gettin' money smile

I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather  
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather  
Last of the red hot loving MC's  
Looking for a little, that's my theory  
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting  
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting  
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder  
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater  
Looking, learning, the one you're liking  
Listen and you will love what I'm writing  
Ladies love, long, hard and lean  
And now you know what L.L. means  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get ill!  
Come on now  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
Everybody  
Let's get ill!  
  
Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie  
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys  
My literature is the land's highest law  
The man of the brand, one you look out for  
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker  
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker  
Listen to my rhyme  
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line  
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late  
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates  
First not last, leader of the class, see  
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee  
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's  
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E  
I bust your lip, my level won't slip  
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip  
Come on!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref  
When I die, there will be no lovers left  
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer  
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter  
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud  
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud  
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club  
Ladies Love, the man you dream of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never ever lost, not lonely or alone  
You can call me the last Capone  
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids  
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid  
Cause the ladies know my bass is low  
Rocking L after L ever since the intro  
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro  
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the land they listen to my jams  
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand  
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list  
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff  
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list  
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless  
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn  
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Captured effortlessly  
That's the way it was  
Happened so naturally  
I did not know it was love  
The next thing I felt was  
You holding me close  
What was I gonna do?  
I let myself go  
  
And now we're flyin' through the star  
I hope this night will last forever  
  
I've been waitin' for you  
It's been so long  
I knew just what I would do  
When I heard your song  
Filled my heart with your bliss  
Gave me freedom  
You knew I could not resist  
I needed someone  
  
And now we're flyin' through the stars  
I hope this night will last forever  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you  
  
I wait for night time to come  
And bring you to me  
Can't believe I'm the one  
I was so lonely  
I feel like no one could feel  
I must be dreamin'  
I want this dream to be real  
I need this feelin'  
  
I make my wish upon a star  
And hope this night will last forever  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you  
  
And first you put your arms around me  
Then you put your charms around me  
I can't resist this sweet surrender  
Oh my nights are warm and tender  
We stare into each other's eyes  
And what we see is no surprise  
Got a feeling most with treasure  
And a love so deep we cannot measure  
  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you

(repeat)  
  
(i promise you, I'm sad)

hey, hey, check it out homie  
Man, you need to get up out of this spot man  
And get a job man before you get smoked man  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah son)  
I know you don't want to hear it man  
But, hey, man, wait, hold up loc you got company man  
(where's my guns?)  
  
When I'm ridin' on the street I hear gunshots (rare shots)  
Crack niggas cause they moms missed flips  
So black man really care about politics  
In the ninety's, our governments so slick  
I watch CNN sometimes and I realize  
They're playin' tricks on my mind  
They want a man to work with his hands  
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn  
Rare-momma got down on her knees  
But not no more, god damn it, I make cheese  
I'm on the move and I'ma show and prove  
You might cry to my political groove  
Rest in peace,  
Sauce Brothers underneath  
I love you to death while my beats' like a reef  
In the middle of the night on the city streets  
The only thing we got left is the beat  
  
[Chorus]  
All we got left is the beat, is the beat, yo  
All we got left is the beat, huh, give it to me  
All we got left is the beat, the beat, yo  
All we got left is the beat, uh  
  
Who brings guns into the USA?  
And then makes sure that they come around the way  
Gain the points until the whole race traps  
And teach up my woman that she should call up the cops  
The projects are hell, wait a, minute  
There's nothin' we do but ride on top of an elevator  
Say the clubs, I can't get a job  
Mouth to feed, somebody's gettin' robbed  
I ain't worked, but I ain't workin' for crumbs  
You ever seen a man-shelter?  
Check out the bombs!!!  
Brother of pain, their whole lives are over  
They spent every dime tryin' not to be sober  
And all the ladies got bags of clothes  
They'll be your long lost momma, one never knows  
The streets are like a nightmare  
While the presidents secretary is chillin' in his leather chair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon  
When you need a toga-black, hire black linen  
Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job  
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob  
The black women don't understand  
Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man  
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk  
Seein' black women and white men go to work  
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real  
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal  
Hold my hand while I get it all together  
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather  
Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls  
And there's another way besides basketball  
Let me go, let me do what I do  
I'm red, black and green, then red, white and blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ridin' in the street you can feel the city heat  
A little bit of grass and a whole lot of concrete  
Creepin', I'm standin' on the corner  
And you can get robbed if you want to  
Paybacks a mother on the street  
You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats  
Brothers ride by real slow  
You get leary when they got tinted windows  
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt  
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front  
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God  
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard  
Government got a hell of a plan  
But word is born they ain't destroyin' this black man  
  
[Chorus: x2]

C'mon, and you don't stop (here go another one)  
Uh, uh, and you don't stop (here go another one)  
Uh, uh, and you don't stop (here go another one)  
(Feel me baby, it's on)  
  
Uh, I was launched off the block, straight to the top  
To yachts with helicopters, I'm so hot  
Paparazzi, blinded by the rocks  
My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked cause  
You steppin out with an entrepeneur  
I copped you more than what you bargained for  
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits  
First, let's make love in the walk-in closet  
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit  
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic  
I'm the captain of my destiny  
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see  
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such  
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch  
You stood by my side and pushed me so much  
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?  
  
It's so amazing, amazing, amazing  
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby  
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy  
To see my baby is so amazing  
  
Sing it baby  
  
I've got riches wall to wall  
Up the stairs and, down the hall of  
All the things that we have done  
You got more ideas for us to  
Live our lives and explore  
There is no topping you, you're untoppable  
  
So what you sayin'? Uh-huh  
Hehehe, I appreciate it  
  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me  
It's so amazing, your love, to me  
It's so amazing, amazing, to me  
  
It's alright  
Sometimes you work late at night (I know baby)  
(I miss you too)  
Just as long, as you don't defy my love  
Then it's on (I promise you baby)  
(I'll always love you)  
  
Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order  
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water  
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky  
A vowel on the end of everything we buy  
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie  
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie  
It feels so good it make a grown man cry  
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died  
I guess I had determination  
And baby girl kept me in the congregation  
Now it's private jets and deep conversation  
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation  
All eyes on us, the cameras flash  
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash  
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed  
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back  
  
This is like this for life baby  
This gon' always be like this  
God is my witness  
Hold you tight for the rest of my life  
Yknahmsayin?  
There's nothing I won't do for you baby  
I'm your man, I'm your man  
Our love is amazing, yeah  
  
It's so, amazing, to me

Uh uh uh uh-huh  
Uh uh that joint is hot baby!  
  
Lights, camera, action, hold up  
You know my style, I been blowed up  
Paper was young, now it's growed up  
Stacks so thick it's hard to fold up  
Yo b, find another rubber band in the truck  
Count up the money, I'ma stand in the cut  
Stroll in the party and I toast Cris' up  
Tell that a muh-hucca gets this up  
Shake that cookie like what like what  
Toss me a drop it's like lightning struck  
Look at that apple cobbler butt  
Whatchu want to do, whatchu think? Want cut  
NBA Live in my truck  
Parkin' lot like all jammed up  
If there's beef it's best you duck  
I'm gon' eat 'til I'm filled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I see (can I see) that apple pie?  
I said throw it to me, that apple cobbler  
Baby it, can I get (hey) can I get it deep fried?  
  
So much sugar it's makin' my head rush  
Tell me what the recipe is for that stuff  
Break me off a piece of crust  
I'm so full I'm bout to bust  
Just one slice is not enough  
Dang that thang tight like handcuffs  
What I gotta say to you for you to give it up?  
What if I was payin' you so you could live it up?  
Hoochie seats inside yo' truck  
Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts  
You be Starsky, I be Hutch  
Ride shotgun, I pop that clutch  
Juicy sweatpants drive me nuts  
Take my 2-way, stay in touch  
I'm gon' scoop you, heat you up  
Take you, bake you, eat you up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turn that hair 'round, buck them hips  
Love when your hair get stuck to your lips  
Apple cobbler sweet and thick  
I'm gon' eat you 'til I'm sick  
Yo' dessert is worth a grip  
I admit you make me trip  
Make me want to run to the mall like I'm a trick  
I can't believe you're makin' a baller have a fit  
Trippin', switchin' past my clique  
Lick that juicy, ask my clique  
Stretch them jeans girl make them fit  
Make me go outside and pit  
You know me, my cake is sick  
Me and Timbo makin' hits  
Apple cobbler, thick and rich  
Just how hot can one girl get?  
  
[Chorus]

Ah yeah  
I want to send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide  
City to city, ghetto to ghetto  
Some flavor for you and yours  
And your jeep  
  
You're the type of girl that got class and style  
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while  
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for  
Hardcore  
I know you want to come, in my jeep  
We can park on a back street  
You're checkin' out my car phone, scopin' out my jewelry  
Let's do this in a hurry  
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken  
I know you need a good stickin'  
That's when I see my man Snoop  
Peace, what up kid? loungin' duke  
As I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier  
You're gettin' hornier and hornier  
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape (flavor)  
You're legs is incredible, I do a double take  
You're puttin' on your lipstick  
I want to give you this big fat (yea)  
Quick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep  
(where at?) back seat of my jeep  
  
[Chorus]  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode  
Back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'  
  
I'm pullin' over near your building  
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'  
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this  
You got class but deep down you're real freakish  
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode  
That's when me and my jeep showed  
Up with the funk in the trunk and  
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'  
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy  
Cause I know you're feelin' frisky  
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky  
You got your eyes on the hood  
You're up to no good  
I took you in the back, you hoped I would  
You got your black on black so stacked in the back  
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track  
Windows are foggy  
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby  
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets  
I give it to you real raw in the backseat  
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)  
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)  
Don't lie  
Take it in your eye (why?)  
So buckle up, buckle up  
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh  
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live  
I'll put your numbers in the archives  
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl  
It's my jeep and your world  
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing  
'cause I can tell you want to swing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're bonin' on the dark blocks  
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock  
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it  
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it  
Workin' as a team  
Somebody, anybody (scream)  
Jump with me to the cash bar  
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' "wah"  
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip  
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip  
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)  
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth  
Extensions on the carpet  
That nice round brown is my target  
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy  
I love it when it's pushy  
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)  
The back seat of my jeep, is priceless  
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action  
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'  
  
Give me a hug  
See what I'm sayin' love?  
  
[Chorus]

I think this intro should be more dramatic  
Ah man  
It's LL season, let's ride  
  
Hands up, hands up  
Hands up, slip into the bath salt  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Uh, boss of all bosses  
Face in the car, make a young girl noxious  
Yea, this beat salad when I toss this  
Never go against me, you lack resources  
What? I skywalk with the forces  
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches  
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses  
Maserati coup, take galloping horses  
Nah, there's never been one like me  
They're looking for a new me as if there might be  
Even with a love song, that's unlikely  
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me  
Uh, killin' Queens all day  
I got what you want, what you willin' to pay?  
Your boy ladies love sound, clean on the track  
Slip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Honestly I was scared to come back  
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react  
Said my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap  
But now I teach class, put back Tony  
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass  
Giving all for my soul to have another smash  
Yea, LL Cool J  
30 years later, be me for a day  
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway  
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray  
Cats on my team, got NBA  
But it's my black, from the web we stay  
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age  
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised  
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains  
But the money's coming in in 360 ways  
  
(Push it) never 'cuz I have to  
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard  
(Push it) and I got the game mastered  
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment  
(Push it) we back to the basement  
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement  
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
(Push it) slip into the bath salt  
Push it real good  
  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
Lookin' kinda salty over there  
They's are kinda salty over there

Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers  
Candy apple M3's, slidin' out gently  
Rollin up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then  
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons  
  
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough  
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough  
Your man was locked up 'cause the cops popped up  
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up  
  
He was yo' crush, you was his crutch  
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch  
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much  
Now it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust  
  
Standin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses  
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it  
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'  
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
Her boyfriend's comin' through with them hickeys on his neck  
He claims he's lovin' her but never shows her no respect  
All she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress  
Big momma, huh momma, now lil' momma is next  
  
You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect  
'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps  
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex  
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh  
  
somethin' new, nothin' borrowed, nothin' blue, no weddin' dress  
But that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left  
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself  
There's no love until you love you remind yourself  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
To all my ghetto girls all around the world  
You know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls  
Keep fightin', uh baby girl keep fightin', yeah, yeah  
To all my ghetto queens survivin' by all means  
  
There's a rock and a hard place you somewhere in between  
Keep fightin', uh baby girl keep fightin', yeah  
To all my single mommas you been strugglin' with drama  
Doin' what you gotta but still keepin' your honor  
Keep fightin', uh, baby girl keep fightin', yeah yeah, sing it  
  
We gon' get it poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
This is for the girls  
With all those ghetto curves  
But we gon' get to poppin' now girl  
Get your best dress on tonight  
  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Get your best dress on tonight  
Get your best dress on tonight

There's only one king homie  
Ice style Ice style Ice style Ice style Ice style  
Glove on the Bentley wheel  
Look at how I'm spinnin  
You're boy's so real  
Number one in the world  
Imagine how it feel  
To hit up Sony for a Billion on a deal  
Buy out the Beatles  
Tell Paul to chill  
Too to talk  
Y'all read it in my will  
Ain't no question on who's the boss  
So when I give orders I can talk real soft  
There's one king There's one king  
There's one king There's one king  
There's one king of pop  
Nothin' else poppin' off  
Comparin' him to me  
Oh please knock it off  
All of y'all emanate from one source  
You try to imitate it  
But you can't pull it off  
Too unique with it  
The pimp is sweet with it  
When I'm freakin' it  
It's like I'm teachin' it  
The world is an apple  
They see me eatin' it  
Haters get to makin' up stuff  
Then leakin' it  
How y'all sound talkin' bout a scandal  
750 mill, aw man  
That's why I keep my brim real low  
And a soda can filled up with Merlot  
And a private jet on deck ready to go  
And a hundred mill wouldn't make me wanna tow?  
  
The smooth criminal  
I'm running from the law  
Cos I've got the biggest? That your pops ever saw  
No on my pocket  
No sons on my lap  
The king wears a crown  
Not a Santa Claus hat  
I peel off some bills  
Tell em to fall back  
It's only 20 mill  
It's not all that  
  
Hold my Hold my Hold my Hold my  
Hold my umbrella  
Give me some support  
While I dance on the roof  
Of the truck at the court  
Can't pull me down  
I don't know what y'all thought  
Think what you want  
But I never got caught  
K (k) I(i) N(n) G(g)  
You wanna kick off on the recipe  
You see paparazzi stressin' me  
Cos Marie Presley is undressin' me  
Dead or alive  
Nobody's alive as me  
A close to lead to my prophecy  
Be remembered as the greatest in history  
This whole industry is my legacy  
  
I'm something something something something  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon  
(Repeat)  
  
Yo, yo the crazy thing is  
I had a dream  
Michael Jackson wrote that for me in a dream  
That's crazy right  
Word up, I had a dream  
And homeboy wrote it for me in a dream  
I saw it on the paper  
I just woke up and just jotted it all down  
It was crazy  
Yo Mike that's for you baby  
I love you  
From the goat to the King of Pop  
You're the king homie  
Rest in Peace  
  
Take a look at my sales  
And fix your face  
Know what I mean  
I'll do what I want  
I'm the king  
I'll put my nose on my chest if I want to

You're not a chicken-head going "hee-shey"  
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"  
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"  
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawking me  
Is it the, invisible settings on the baguettes?  
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?  
Or the, wood-grain in the convertible Lex  
Be ease, shopping sprees, what designer is next?  
Is it the, Diablo, parked on Rodeo?  
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello  
Could it be I'm, anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip  
Hat low, doing donuts when I pull up out the dealership  
Is it the, the Fortune 500 covers?  
The family man that got one baby mother?  
The way I brainwash y'all to love one another  
And got the whole community bouncing in unity  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
(Born to love you baby) Why?  
(You know I love you baby) Why?  
(Kiss and hug you baby) Why?  
(I'll always love you baby) Why?  
  
You're not a chicken-head going "hee-shey"  
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"  
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"  
I can't figure out the reason you be hawking me  
Is it the, twenty million I be grabbing a flick?  
Or my four-hundred million dollar Fubu clique?  
Is it the, "In the House" syndication chips  
Popping two bottles, shorty read my lips  
They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather  
Simple ain't it, uh, but quite clever  
Is it the, fact I melt in liquid ice?  
Tapped it once, you felt it twice  
Is it the, multiple O's I'm known for those  
Temptation Island, wilding cause my neck froze  
Is it the, bowlegged, hard-headed  
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?  
Forget it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're not a chicken-head going "hee-shey"  
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"  
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"  
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawking me  
Is it the, way I caress and hold you close?  
The iller, villa in Barbados?  
Is it the, Countache rolling up to your door? Yeah  
Tell your roommate you ain't dancing no more, yeah  
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah  
Tell 'em bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah  
Is it the, the way that I defend your honor?  
Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?  
Is it the, way the Maserati hug her body  
Make you want to be my next hottie, uh-huh  
From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise it don't stop  
  
[Chorus]

When you was seventeen and I was nineteen  
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens  
We didn't know a thing about love  
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug  
Held you tightly and promised you the world  
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl  
When I think about it now makes me smile  
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while  
  
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades  
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)  
Of the darkness and bitter memories  
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity  
I promised you I'd love you to the end  
Always and forever since way back when  
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend  
You taste better now than you did back then  
  
[Chorus]  
You will always be my candy  
One day we will start a family  
You will always be my candy girl  
(You'll be my candy girl forever)  
You will always be my candy  
Want your love girl, understand me  
You will always be my candy girl  
  
While you sucked caramel apple lollipops  
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock  
We used to walk down the block hold hands  
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man  
And any guys that want to socialize  
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries  
My peeps used to say I was whipped  
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped  
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt  
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt  
I would look up at ya I remember  
The afternoon you surrendered  
We made love the temperature was high as could be  
You said "Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me"  
And as we went our separate ways you turned back  
Smiled, I remember all that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Take it to the bridge)  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
I need your love  
Each and every day  
  
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call  
Of days when love was true I slept and held you  
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you  
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts  
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught  
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me  
Sweet love strictly  
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side  
Take you for a mental and emotional ride  
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind  
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time  
And as long as you support my dreams  
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team  
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of  
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Candy girl  
You are my world  
Look so sweet  
You're a special treat  
(You'll be my candy girl forever)  
Candy girl  
All I want to say  
(Word is bond sweetheart)  
I need your love  
(I swear I'm down for whatever)  
Candy girl  
(sometimes you gotta go back home)  
Look so sweet  
(I love you)  
Candy girl

Yeah, uh-huh  
Uh-huh, I can't explain it  
  
You know it's that moment  
It's just that moment  
Y'knahmsayin? I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't explain it  
My love when we're together  
You're the greatest, nobody does it better  
When you hold me  
I wish that I could be your, one and only  
Nobody does it better  
  
I understand you want canaries on your hand  
Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band  
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand  
You don't want to make it happen unless it's the right man  
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me  
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me  
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender  
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender  
Let me kiss your eyes  
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe  
I pull back to stare at your eyes  
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized  
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile  
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style  
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while  
Let's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle  
I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Straight up, you beautiful b  
I don't think you understand what you doin' to me  
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin' TV  
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin' me  
uh then we kiss for real  
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel  
You go to the bathroom for a second  
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)  
That's when you come back and walk to me slow  
That's when you change up and let it all flow  
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow  
I love to take my time, love to give you a show  
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below  
Use my ears like handlebars, take control  
Ain't no sense in stayin' calm and playin' the role  
Baby relax, let me touch your soul  
I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks  
with sound effects and whatnot (mmm)  
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch  
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch  
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean  
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen  
You the 6 I needed you like a fix  
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click  
I pick up the pace  
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face  
I look at your lips and take a taste  
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist  
We whylin' out, we all over the place  
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace  
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith  
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it  
  
[Chorus]

Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
Why don't you make, hah, a resolution  
Hehe, for God sake, give a contribution  
Huh, you're filthy rich huh, so help the world  
Donate some dough to the starvin' boys and girls  
They ain't eatin', we're just chillin', stop the killin'  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
Change your ways huh, start givin'  
Huh, you're livin' like every day is thanksgivin'  
Huh, cool songs huh, nice cars, clear sky, bright stars  
Funky, funky beats on the radio be pumpin'  
Hah, you're so cool, well let us tell you somethin'  
Change your ways  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
Hey you, don't be stupid, comprehend  
The words I'm speakin' to a beat  
That's crazy funky and keeps the people freakin'  
Just trust through us, you're listenin' to God talk  
Mic check 1, 2, huh, hey fellas tell 'em what they need to do  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
Come on, come on, let's do it, let's do it  
There's just so many of us, huh  
Hey yo, there ain't nothin' to it  
We're just too strong, can't nothin' stop the movement  
Hah, party people listen - the world has room for improvement  
The groove is small and I know you've  
Been thinkin' a lot about this jam  
So take his hand and take her hand  
And let's all lend a hand to our fellow man  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it  
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it  
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it  
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
We can do it, hah, that's right, but you gotta, gotta warn her  
We gotta help the junkies tastin' their dream  
Fiendin' on the corner  
Cause yo we got the power  
And man we are the world, so what you wanna do  
What you wanna do homeboys and all you fly girls?  
Put your cigarette out, throw away your drink  
Take a moment of silence to stop and think  
Hah, we gotta change our ways huh  
Or we'll never see brighter days  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways  
  
Word up, youknowhatI'msayin'?  
All we gotta do is change our ways  
And everything will be aight youknowhatI'msayin'?  
There's so far to go youknowImean?  
But we gotta keep fightin', we gotta struggle youknowhatImean?  
And we stay alive, only the strong survive  
So part of you can change your ways and you'll be aight  
Peace from LL Cool J  
  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Change your ways

No me puedo controlar aqui con el senor LL Cool J  
Y aqui estoi  
1, 2, 3 muevete!  
  
The club was far from empty  
It was crowded at the entry  
I slide right through like how I do  
This girl began to tempt me.  
She said her name Shaiyeeda  
I could tell her mama feed her  
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit  
I'm L, nice to meet ya.  
I could feel my body yearnin'  
The room just started turnin'  
Didn't wanna go out on the floor  
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance)  
My brain began to sizzle  
I'm sweatin' just a little  
On the dance floor in the middle,  
She turned around and giggled,  
She said  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
  
It's hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin' on ya  
Like I wanna,  
Like I wanna, wanna.  
  
Temptation is a mother,  
How we lust for one another  
We barely know eachother  
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh)  
The air is filled with passion  
The strobe lights are flashin'  
The hustlers throw cash n  
The bar tender keeps splashin'  
Her moves were so erotic  
Her games were so hypnotic  
I bet this girl could stop it  
But she continued to pop it  
  
You know I know you like it,  
Let me hit you on your sidekick  
Cause the after party is at my body,  
Meet me, you're invited  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
  
It's hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin' on ya  
Like I wanna,  
Like I wanna, wanna.  
  
She licked off  
Her lip gloss  
Her hips toss  
Back and forth  
Side to side and  
Up and down  
She touched the ground  
It turned me out.  
I'm battlin' desire,  
Lord help me douse this fire  
This internal inferno,  
Hotter than a shot of cuervo  
Her top was short and purple  
Belly dancin' in a circle  
When I feel like this I can't resist  
I ? don't make me hurt you  
She said  
  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make me leave my man  
  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
You got, you got, you got  
What it takes to make this boy be bad  
It's hard to control myself  
It's hard to control myself  
  
It's hard for me to control myself  
Get to hold myself  
Back from  
Jumpin' on ya  
Like I wanna,  
Like I wanna, wanna

The wind is howlin'  
The rain pours down  
Eyes are blood-shot  
Heartbeat pounds.  
Lights go out  
The whole world's in darkness  
The ground is tremblin'  
Dogs are barkless.  
In the sky there appears a great light  
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.  
Cryin' in a childless tone  
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.  
Don't smile  
Lest a innocent Chile  
The power of God is gonna get to be your Tao  
Throw like a hit from the best  
Take it in a slump  
Ha ha  
Feel it in your chest.  
Conquering the world with the words  
Leading the children like herds.  
I can feel it building  
I'm about to explode  
I'm walking on the crossroad  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
People living in a shack, at the crossroads  
Little kids selling crack, at the crossroads  
Stab you in the back, at the crossroads  
Everybody's getting jacked at the crossroads  
  
Violins and trumpets play  
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh  
On there way to the promise land.  
Deliverance  
But yet some don't understand.  
Rough on a late night thrill  
After midnight  
Kill or be killed.  
Soldiers, warriors  
At each other  
On the combat zone.  
Supreme power on the throne.  
Lighting strikes in every home.  
Terrified men run down the street.  
So many dead bodies  
It's hard to eat.  
Come, we gotta rise  
Above the wall.  
To see what no man has seen before.  
Blindin' light  
That got you through the night.  
God is on your side  
To got in a fight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Homicide  
Suicide  
Death.  
Boom!  
Ain't nobody left.  
Oh! It's starting to take affect.  
Your on your knees  
You scared to death.  
Tornado's with a thousand people spinning.  
One fight at the cross  
And now God is wining.  
The whole Earth cracks in half.  
The sea turns red from the blood bath.  
Abandoned buildings burned  
And two remain  
Terrified.  
You feel the fire blaze.  
The ground can't hold your weight.  
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.  
Who clocked this fuck  
Not from space.  
Never again  
Will you see the human race.  
19 angels leading the Devil straight to Hell!  
Torment!  
Pain!  
What you're seeing here  
You can't explain.  
All your life  
Some men  
We played the game.  
Never realize that there's a flame.  
  
[Chorus]

His realm is a new horizon of cuts  
They expand from his hand as he conducts  
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography  
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography  
  
The lyrical virtual also makes his return  
All adversaries should be concerned  
LL Cool J is back again  
Let me allow to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator  
  
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves  
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave  
English revision he endure any collision  
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision  
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate  
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best  
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter  
All you sucker DJ's will scatter  
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy  
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name  
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain  
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains  
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change  
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry  
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous  
  
"I need a beat"  
  
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished  
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished  
My scenario, four-door stereo  
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio  
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J  
Say: "Ole", to what we just played  
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade  
And all competitors will be slayed  
Any comment is a compliment  
No groups' talent can be the equivalent  
Of mine and his combined  
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme  
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass  
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place  
A performance underrated, it's not narrated  
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated  
He's dangerous  
  
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second  
I called an old phrase from my last record  
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels  
Except I came hear to raise some hell  
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like the blade  
He the scuser dry-smudge and make Coolay  
I drink at steady, the record turns many  
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete  
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved as the record revolves  
DJ's dissolve, usually, physically, mentally  
He's an innovator, greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader  
Sometime I gotta check what I invest  
All Farmers Boulevard is where I rest  
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego  
Such palms kill a France, say, en Italiano  
The mouth protects and I'll inject into your ears  
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unfair  
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail  
I'm dangerous

Yo Yvette, there's a lot of rumors goin' around  
They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town  
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you  
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew  
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon  
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room  
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap  
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap  
Cause girl your momma should of taught you better  
I'ma sit down and write you a long letter.  
  
[Chorus]  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
  
I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was  
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant cause  
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume  
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom  
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone  
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was "Moan".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't really know if the story is so  
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe  
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe  
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho  
In every disco you say hello  
Like you're a little angel, but we all know  
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way  
You always got in bed when you wanted to play  
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva  
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro  
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow  
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze  
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.  
That's a General Education on Decency  
One day you'll see, and agree with me  
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93  
For you there's no fee, everything is free  
This is from me to you, not you to me  
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight  
You try to shake your butt with all your might  
I don't really wanna dis nobody  
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette  
How bad can a girl's reputation get?  
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met  
If you're desperate ask Yvette, cause she'll say "Bet".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
B-Boys are hard on the boulevard  
The Reverend at the church said you was barred  
Homeboys on the block love you a lot  
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not  
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'  
Let me explain to you who is talkin'  
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way  
You boogie down to my records almost every day  
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still  
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill  
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.  
The guy at the desk said it was OK  
For you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay  
Greg G. and Garfield yelled "Hooray"  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, yeah, checkin' 'em out  
Special shout-out, keepin' on  
Check it out y'all, my man in the house  
  
Corkunrun absolute killer of all  
Take her blood, bouncin' heads like balls  
Murderer, somethin' mutilator of Amiga  
I get ill, so blood spills, every time I speak  
Drivin' Bombs that inveterate your ego  
Suckers all weird, no let the best go migo  
They talk and talk, I invade and take over  
Forget Mako, you gonna need a make-over  
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal  
On the mic, I'm a cannibal  
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms  
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm  
I'm two with the Universe and I'ma make you  
Diverse, make I kill quick, so you'll win from crew to hers  
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened  
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened  
There's a  
  
[Chorus]  
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland  
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland  
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland  
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland  
  
For bow-take to far cynical of Egypt  
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped  
To decapatate, amputate and take titles  
The legend of leather, I'ma real live idol  
Damn I take souls, condemn we men  
And make microphones men again and again  
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me  
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me  
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole  
When I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal  
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out  
Only difference, no time to feel a track out  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come forward, admit you're guilty  
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me  
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L  
Now know that I handle mine, very well  
I burn buildings, eat emcee's  
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please  
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God  
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd  
King Posse ruler and high roller  
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a Monar, the Warlord of life  
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight  
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper  
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper  
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled  
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample  
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary  
So what your name in the bituary  
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings  
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things  
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer  
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist  
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal  
You can never make a move on me cause you're still premado  
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis  
And when I'm through you face baralysis  
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner  
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner  
It's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who gets the roughest, you know the answer  
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther  
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'  
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo  
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad  
Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad  
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards  
Introducin' the original Todd  
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound  
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throw down  
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy  
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti  
Techniques and styles, they ain't ready  
Ah, ah, yeah, full of horsepower and I'ma devour  
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower  
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse  
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse  
No threat exist, no man can stand  
Say mic check and expect to take the man  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus: x4]  
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down, down (blow)  
Down, down, diggy, diggy, down  
  
Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down  
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found  
This, the season for murder, isn't no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'  
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high  
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen  
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young people, with no education, politicians, deny and segregation  
Young infants, deserted and abandoned  
Step parents, lack in understandin'  
Homelessness, all across the land, war, man against man  
Treachery and evil fillin' our communities  
And all these hypocrites, aiyyo, they're stealin' from our charities  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
People are gettin' hurt, people are gettin' hurt up  
People are gettin' done, people are gettin' done up (we gotta rise)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down  
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found  
This, the season for murder, isn't no reason  
To hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'  
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high  
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies  
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen  
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Many poisonous chemicals and (uh) boom!  
Many devilish goals are up (uh) soon!  
No love where loves' ya dwell in  
Mother-earth transformed into hell an'  
Ice, murders, conspiracy and (uh) schemes!  
Young boys will reveal their, dreams!  
Handguns in the hands of the young  
And diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We need to rise (rise), as if we live with our eyes (eyes)  
Stay away from the hate (hate), before it's too late (before it's too late)  
We go ah  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
We gotta rise

Yea, check out it baby, make it hot.  
Bring the drama, uh, DefJam, ha, yea, word 'em up, make 'em bounce.  
  
It's the first time together and I'm feelin' kind of horny,  
Conventional methods of makin' love kind of bore me,  
I want to knock your block off, get my rocks off,  
Blow your socks off, make sure your G spots off.  
I'll call ya big daddy and scream your name,  
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain.  
So which you sayin', I get my swerve on, bring it live,  
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat is tied  
Daddy slow down your flow,  
Put it on me like a G baby, nice and slow,  
I need a rough neck mega man dingle in a sec,  
Who ain't afraid, pull my hands and spank me from the back.  
No doubt, I'm the player that you're talking about.  
But do you think you could really work it out.  
I guarantee ya shorty is real, baby stick out, here comes the man of steel.  
  
[Chorus]  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn.  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
Doin' it, doin' it, and doin' it well  
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn.  
  
I'm in the mix now searching for the right spot to hit now, get down.  
Damn, I love your dig down, you was a lover, damn right, you are my lover, all
night,  
The putty good to ya hard to lover, mad tight.  
The only thing left to do is climax, let's make it last,  
Word we ain't goin' out like that,  
All this time you've been telling me that you was a dove.  
I tried to warn ya girl, you wouldn't listen, now lets get it on,  
You make me wild don't do that, chill wait a minute baby let me please your
back.  
You talk a good one, shorty love ya making sweat, how's do a live nigga like
it girl.  
Nice and wet, get on til the break dawn, damn you're large,  
How's do a big girl like it daddy.  
Nice and hard, safe sexin' it, flexin' it,  
Gettin' that affectionate, true in it, oh while we doing it.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, I want to hit it in the worst way,  
Make it hot, been sceaming on that ass since the first day, don't stop,  
Damn I love when you talk like that, make it bounce, sugar.  
As along as you can bounce me back,  
More flesh than a Greek fest, roll up the incense,  
Pass the Hennesey, put my body to the test.  
Way, way, way back many niggas ago,  
I was a young girl listenin' to a higher flow,  
Now here's my chance to hit you off,  
Daddy I've grown from the back to the side, right I'm in the zone.  
One of a kind when it's time to do mine,  
Camcorder in the whole shit, press rewind, let it flow on screen  
While we puff the L, laying back in the cut while we're under the spell.  
Word life, I like the way the end go down,  
Go to sleep tomorrow I'll take ya back downtown  
We'll be  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
DefJam, Baby Criss, Big Shawn, Word is born,  
Make it hot.  
Uh, DefJam, LeShaun, Baby Criss, Big Shawn, Rock On  
Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn, Go Brooklyn

Yeah, uh-huh  
I can't believe it  
  
[Chorus]  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
No need for the coping now  
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar  
Made a vow before God to love me  
And finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I will never second guess us how  
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together  
Having kids together, my life begins right now  
  
Finally the day has arrived  
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle  
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild  
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles  
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it  
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it  
Take the vow to be together forever  
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever  
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds  
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out  
I was blind to love, God showed me you  
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say "I do"  
And I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Butterflies, my palms are sweaty  
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready  
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere  
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here  
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand  
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand  
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right  
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight  
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife  
Us both dressed alike in the purest white  
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around  
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a beautiful and heavenly day  
As the pastor asks, "Who gives this woman away?"  
Your father says "I do" and gives me a hand  
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand  
He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and  
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'  
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'  
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment  
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live  
But still find time for you and homework with the kids  
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded  
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, "I do"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
We made a vow baby  
I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)  
Waiting for me at the altar  
And I make a vow before God to love you  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I'll, never second guess you

Just like Pauline you all-in  
  
Oh,  
Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace  
I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace  
In any case, yo, I'm moving like a steeplechase  
MC soldiers, about face  
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff  
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft  
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this  
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist  
Whipper-snapper back up for coming crap up  
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em  
Phony, so skip the baloney  
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony  
And roll, cause you're just a rookie  
When it was time for rap school, you must of played hooky  
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper  
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper  
Just getting warmer, I'm a transform a  
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer  
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough  
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged  
I drop like a sandbag  
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag  
Best of the batch, no man can catch up  
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mis match  
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat  
And avoid combat like a diplomat  
But when it's time for back lash, jacked or killed  
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill  
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes  
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime  
I rock the mic unlike  
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, pysch!  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Dropping 'em  
  
Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin  
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline  
I get busy like it's two of me  
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's  
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax  
And take the crowd to the climax  
Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray  
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way  
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz  
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz  
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made  
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade  
MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck  
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck  
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy  
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys  
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox  
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox  
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull  
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful  
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult  
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult  
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum  
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Yo E, dropping 'em  
  
Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper  
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper  
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper  
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a  
Emcee, like he's one of the two  
Break him into fragments right in front of you  
Mic check one two, is too fundamental  
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental  
In the center, I had to enter  
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor  
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers  
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a  
Rude awakening, you can't do anything  
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring  
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence  
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced  
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator  
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader  
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker  
Eating up the world, acre by acre  
I'm dropping 'em  
  
Word to mother, dropping 'em!  
Know what I'm saying? Straight til 1999, dropping 'em!  
Yo, year two thousand, ya know what I'm saying?  
Audi man  
  
Yo I'm dropping 'em

(Sip somethin')  
Uh, sip somethin'  
(Sip somethin')  
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you  
  
[Chorus]  
With every sip of my drink (uh)  
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)  
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)  
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)  
I wasn't tryin' to be mean  
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)  
Cause your persistence overpowers me  
I know you rollin' out with me  
  
I was stayin' at the Shore Club, leanin' in the red room  
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms  
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage  
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice  
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white  
That's when I realized it'll be a long night  
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white  
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic  
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might  
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things  
DJ rubbin' my thing, makin' my head swing  
All the honies was schemin'  
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin', oh God I must be dreamin'  
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'  
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled  
What would you do, if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?  
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it to the bridge  
  
I can't call it, I can't tell  
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)  
And me, I can not believe (lay back baby)  
This night out is windin' down (uh)  
You keep buyin' all these rounds for me (aw man)  
I know what you want from me (yeah)  
I know what you want  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Rollin out with me (roll out)  
Rollin out with me (uh, roll out)  
Roll out (roll out)  
Yeah (uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out)  
(uh, uh, roll out, yeah)  
(Yo Timbo! Bar's on you baby, hahahaha)  
(Yeah!)

(Right now)  
I'm bout to show you how it's done, you can  
(Shut down)  
Yo, my Uzi weights a ton, you can  
(Beat down)  
And you can pump it in your system till it  
(Blow out)  
Whatever dog, no doubt, I'm bout to  
(Smack up)  
Anybody who front like he  
(Hardcore)  
Don't he know I stay raw? This is  
(LL)  
Competition, they fell because I  
(Do this)  
Bringing drama and truth cause I don't  
(Play that)  
And I be reaping up cash since  
(Way back)  
Put your honey on my lap and make her  
(Heat up)  
Got her begging me to beat it up  
(Raw dog)  
Throw your wacky on the floor, straight  
(Kill that)  
Have her gargling nuts until I  
(Spill that)  
You better play like En Vogue and  
(Hold on)  
You wanna battle? Set it off baby  
(Come on)  
Come one, Come on, Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
Because my flavor's the best  
I get my hustle off all day  
Reck my block, knee all far  
I gotta hold it down wit my man  
Big up to my nigga E Love  
Keep the ill rims on the car  
I repped it, what more can I say, son  
Farmers (What)  
Farmers (What)  
  
(Murder)  
Little niggas getting money on the  
(Hot block)  
He got the chrome shit spinning up on  
(Linden)  
Look at the ice and leather, the way it  
(Blending)  
Pass the spit hot Linden from here to  
(Mary)  
You think you hot, Cool Jane? Ever  
(Here it)  
And when it comes to this I'm not a  
(Soldier)  
I'm a General crack King  
(I told ya)  
I proved I'm the greatest rapper, nigga  
(What now)  
Tell your man step up, then watch he  
(Go down)  
Game one, do or die like  
(Bedside)  
Nobody even coming close, nigga  
(Why try)  
From the Bronx to Shaolin to  
(Uptown)  
Like Buckshot said nigga  
(Duck down)  
You better play like En Vogue and  
(Hold on)  
You know I'm going out nigga  
(Come on)  
Come on, Come one, Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(No doubt)  
I'll take your block and air it out, stay  
(Ice out)  
Me and my man, Little Sharp in the  
(Double R)  
Whole block, lined up wit all the  
(Hot cars)  
Nigga, never be afraid you gotta  
(Get paid)  
No matter what I do, I keep it  
(Sexy)  
Me and my team spending cream on the  
(Club scene)  
On Performance Boulevard out in  
(Killa Queens)  
This joint knocked in the tunnel bout  
(One o'clock)  
They like them raw, not the watered down  
(Hip Hop)  
The broad money and alah zay it  
(Don't Stop)  
Niggas stumbling and falling off a  
(Head Ride)  
When I'm going to Bedshaw  
(Remember me)  
I'm the greast emcee there could  
(Ever be)  
You better call Def Jam, and tell 'em  
(Hold on)  
'Cause another major label told me  
(Come on)  
Come on, Come on, Come on  
  
[Chorus]

I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,  
So help me GOD  
I just felt like telling the story of my life  
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?  
We all feel pain, we all go through things  
But it's time to overcome all that  
  
If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died  
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?  
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move  
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude  
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks  
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck  
He sniffed some coke, come home  
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone  
Come on  
  
[Chorus]  
(All I ever wanted)  
All I ever wanted  
(All I ever needed)  
All I ever needed  
(Was a father)  
Was a father  
(That's all)  
That's all!  
(All I ever wanted)  
All I ever wanted  
(All I ever needed)  
All I ever needed, was a father  
(Was a father)  
  
Moms got tired of the beatings said, "Yo, we got to go"  
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'  
She said, "I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'  
I want to live to see my little Todd grow"  
I remember tear drops on my pops face  
Looking down at me standing on the staircase  
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee  
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?  
(I'm feeling you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced  
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce  
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens  
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed  
I was too young to understand the risk  
When your moms come home off the midnight shift  
She turned around heard the shotgun click  
My pops said, "You think that you could leave me?"  
He blasted my moms in the back  
She fell down screaming I can't forget that  
My grandfather tried to close the do'  
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My head was spinning, I had never seen blood  
Four years old, this don't feel like love  
Anyway, pops disappeared  
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years  
This therapist got up in her head  
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead  
You know, they fell in love with one another  
Everything seemed right that's word to mother  
Until I started getting beatings everyday  
Sometimes for going outside to play  
Late at night on my knees I'd pray  
A young child, wishing the pain would go away  
Dad where was you when he made me strip  
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip  
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow  
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'  
That's just the tip of the iceberg look  
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book  
Word is bond, that's real baby  
  
[Chorus]

Uh-huh, eh-heh  
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)  
  
You only a customer  
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers  
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range  
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed  
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls  
You can taste it, my instict's basic  
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey  
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es  
All different colors of the spectrum  
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em  
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em  
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them  
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers  
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers  
These young rookies, fail to understand  
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man  
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can  
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce  
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's  
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses  
Every bite is more delicious  
My favorite flavor  
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)  
Like caramel on vanilla sundae  
Have a scoop you'll want some day  
Cause you're my favorite flavor  
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon  
  
My flavor's unreal  
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel  
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel  
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?  
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash  
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'  
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'  
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through  
Me too! Man you know how we do  
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview  
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ  
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'  
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'  
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'  
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this  
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Uh) All I wanna do  
Is eat you up 'cause you look so good  
(Think I look alright huh?)  
(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)  
All I wanna do  
Is show you boy that I taste good too  
(I know you taste good ma)  
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)  
  
We had it out  
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about  
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline  
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams  
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine  
Low calorie leave no cavities  
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be  
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ba-bee

Hey y'all,

The same old the same old we seem to take a toll  
Tryin' to take it back take a sip all go  
And try a couple things we never did before  
Maybe you could be a freak for me at the door  
I come up to the crib you dressed ready to go  
Girl take it down low n make it clap real slow

Yeah time for you to buss out the new red pumps

Leave all my jewels cos you love it when I stunt  
Ill play any role accept being the chump  
My Jon lil' girl you love it when I crunk

Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
When Def Jam signed me  
They hit the lottery  
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery  
They underestimated me quite possibly  
It's like that when you a godfather b  
I'm the greatest of all time  
You heard that before  
But now when I say it  
It means so much more  
Cause It's so true  
No hype man, No crew  
No reason for ghost writers  
Every year I get tighter  
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire  
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire  
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire  
You think I'm hot  
You preaching to the choir  
Smiling and giggling  
Thirsting like Gilligan  
More flavor than cinnamon  
They rush with adrenaline  
I make 'em nervous  
I do it on purpose  
I come back hotter  
Every time I resurface  
Drop to ya knees baby  
Praise the king  
Now ask Russell Simmons  
Who built the west wing  
I ain't gotta be cocky  
I do the damn thing  
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting  
Internationally known and respected  
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected  
You crank call my cells disconnected  
You keep slipping but my games perfected  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
I'm a star for real my aura is crazy  
Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy  
Born with a gift to inspire the hood  
You want to out do me and I wish you would  
I'm the master separate from all these cats  
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that  
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs  
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax  
That's understandable but everybody relax  
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act  
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact  
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react  
Been had an entourage and platinum cards  
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton  
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don  
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond  
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted  
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it  
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it  
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it  
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row  
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show  
I could care less who drop and blow  
My name is LL baby that's beyond the flow  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
  
These rap cats get upset with me  
When security clear out the V.I.P  
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID  
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee  
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot  
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot  
While you waste advances on gray market rocks  
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks  
A family man but hard as a rock  
And I die for my kids so stay off my block  
They might be impressed with you but I'm not  
After all these years I still walk with a bop  
Still keep the ink hot  
Still scheme like a fox  
Still ready to battle  
You don't want your career stopped  
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot  
And ran around humble with my joint on cock  
  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop  
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all  
Freak freak y'all  
You don't stop

Check it out  
I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale  
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail  
The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted  
You could fuse it, if ya choose it 'cause it's deep rooted  
I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter  
For underestimating as I'm creating the butter  
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm dropping  
I'm wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit  
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out  
I'm wrecking niggas one-by-one but then I miscount  
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce  
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya fagots into mush  
Ya slipping, I'm gripping microphones real tight  
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night  
Deliver messages, the prophecy's in me  
His Royal Highness, you minus what you claim to be  
(Say what?)  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas  
  
I blow em, kaboom, but fuck sound effects  
Niggas was sleeping like I was off on a Star Trek  
Select my dialect, inspect all my checks  
He claim he getting money but L cast the cheque  
You sell blunt weed, Glock block, horizons  
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotizing  
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat  
Hardcore niggas be wearing panties, looking sweet  
I'm on a journey through the land of fronting niggas  
Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers  
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live  
I take my blade, insert it until ya guts give  
Execution, the destroyer of ya suspect bunch  
What? Drama! You can't believe how I deliver bomb shit  
Ya brains split, the pain hits ya little dick  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You falling backwards, leaning like a dope addict  
Rope niggas claim me, packing automatics  
Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress  
Go outside, the bitch up just like a actress  
I take ya motherfuckers one-by-one and show ya how it's done  
And dick ya down in front of everyone  
Bitch niggas ain't got no type of reason  
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season  
I'm freezing, ya bleeding heavily up out'cha rectum  
Black and blue, trying ta hide up in the spectrum  
I got ya raw ass busting straight flat  
Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that  
Operating incorporates stimulating designs  
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign  
Don't lose ya mind, concentrating on how I shine  
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time  
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip  
I can't believe you niggas forgot who rip shit  
It's '96 and niggas like to hold they dicks  
I'm breaking shit aside ya doctor's can't fix  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fuck the tricks and all them smooth singing grooves  
I'm bringing crews, in my ring you swing and lose  
With the blues light my fuse, allow me  
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be  
My technique's superb when I'm pissing on these herbs  
Crystal clear so you can hear every word  
Fuck the goodie-goodie or your moms might hear it  
I gotta keep my title locked down so niggas fear it  
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas  
I blow it, I make it hot!

[LL Cool J]  
Damn I Miss You  
It's still gone ride, it's still gone ride  
Uh uh, uh uh, c'mon, uh, uh, yeah, ride, uh  
  
Damn I miss you  
Ooh I feel better than before  
We should've never separated  
Paused or hesitated  
You rocked me to sleep  
It's like my body levitated  
Looking in the mirror  
But the heat makes it less clearer  
It's all fogged up, face me baby  
Put your fingers in my mouth, let me taste the gravy  
Reunited, feel good, real good, squeeze me  
I tell you that I Love You  
But you wouldn't believe me  
  
[Chorus: Mashonda]  
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you  
Anything you want I will do  
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you  
Anything you want I will do  
  
[Mashonda]  
Hello  
Baby  
There is something that I want to say to you  
You've been on my mind now  
For a while and I just don't know what to do  
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Mashonda]  
I know  
That we've  
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past  
If you promise to hold me down  
Then our love will have a second chance to last  
I've been thinking of holding you  
Showing you, what I'm all about  
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do  
Everything you want without a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[LL Cool J]  
Forget the past  
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on  
Back to back, through the ups and downs  
Right or wrongs, lay down  
Let me kiss you all down your back  
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around  
I apologize too  
For not recognizing the pain inside of you  
I never lie to you, again  
Last time had stress on my mind  
Had a hard time believing  
That my girl could be genuine  
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real  
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel  
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most  
From now on, til we give up the ghost  
Reunited, Baby  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Hello, hello (yo, yo)  
Call me on the telephone  
  
Whether, 2-1-2, or 7-1-8  
Or 9-1-4, I love it hardcore  
When it's over the phone, it's safe to do it raw  
Imaginary worlds we could both explore  
(Hello) Baby what you wearing right now?  
(Hot pants) My girl ain't around, let's get down  
And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap  
(I'm bouncing up and down with my shoulders back)  
(Nigga you like that?) You see I'm running up my bill  
Momma might hear me, but you just too ill  
I got your flicks lined up, stereo low  
Cherry flavored grease beneath my elbow  
If I was there what would you do? (I'd lay you on your back)  
(Ride or die daddy, and I love it like that)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans  
(Oh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens)  
(I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride 'til I'm sweating it)  
(I bet you I can make you cum first) Throw the bets in  
I'm a nasty nigga, made to order  
Kiss below the border with a warm glass of water  
Is you wit me? (Yeah) Tell me how it taste  
I promise I'll keep the telephone right in my face  
How it feel? (Feels good) Where you at? (In the hood)  
(Talking on the phone like a good girl should)  
(To my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak)  
Strawberry shortcake, good enough to eat  
(And I taste mad sweet) We big freaks  
Blasting off on the phone seven days a week  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet  
To make sure your ex-man can't compete  
Shower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil  
G-string sitting like a snake in a coil  
(Hold on, I think somebody on the other line)  
Interrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind  
Lay back, imagine us chest to chest  
Tongue-kissing deep while we spark a sess  
(Everything is crazy, L do it the best)  
Riding rough baby, put my pipe to the test  
(On the telephone?) Yeah, this is the ill zone  
I want to make you moan until it's a dial tone  
However you want it baby, I'm raw to the bone  
Three (three) two (two) one (one) telephone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, know what I'm saying? Word up, that's what I'm talking about  
All you gotta do is hit me, word, I'll call you right back  
Yeah, ? move this out  
What you want me right now  
You goin' make me crash or something, word up  
It's that real shit

"All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost."  
  
Yeah, you know  
It be buggin' me out, you know what I'm sayin'?  
That rap, how everybody, like, is using metaphors and all that  
It seems like everybody's some kind of metaphor freak  
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin', man  
You know what I'm sayin'? Word up  
So, you know what I'm saying  
You know brother's want to make a movie and all that  
You know how I mean, so I figured you know what I'm sayin'  
I'd just make a little movie with a chicken ball  
Check it  
  
If you saw the movie, Wall Street, I guess you know  
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough  
But ain't no G-funk, and far from my era  
Tales from the hood, your boyz will feel terror  
MC's contaminatin' tracks with feces  
You think of pussy until a flick like Species  
Hi-tech, ya, my pen got velocity  
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity  
And never question what I'm doin' to ya, girl  
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld  
But all metaphors, the only thing in rap  
You brothers need to stop with that  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm goin' from  
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?  
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?  
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?  
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?  
  
Check it,  
I'm makin' Speed like I'm Keanu Reeves  
But too many True Lies can make a honey please  
She said, I know you want this  
Get a Pocahontas  
I got Higher Learnin'  
And bangin' gets monotonous  
Her ass is classic  
Cheeks was Jurassic  
Servin' a Justice  
Poetic the way I last it  
I touch ground, real windy, with my lyrics  
Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit  
Hear it, pulling light strings  
Got mad cast a swing  
When I do my thing, my ballz is hairy like the Lion King  
I'm in the jungle, layin' down my mack  
You brothers need to chill with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me away  
You think I won't, fool?  
Take me away  
You think I can't, fool?  
Take me away  
You think I won't, fool?  
Take me away  
You think I can't, fool?  
It's kinda like miniature satellites floatin' in closets  
Spyin' in pockets  
Jumpin' out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy  
  
We  
Word up,  
So your man got a good job lovin' ya so much  
Boss on his back, comin' home like, 'What the fuck?'  
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin  
That's when LL come in  
Blast a ass like Apollo 13  
Sugar get the cream  
Hoppin' dom in every direction  
What a scene  
He can't understand your best friend's plan  
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man  
Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers  
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers  
Better get down before ya cryin' at home  
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone  
Some brother's won't appreciate that  
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?  
Let's run it back  
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me  
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society  
You ain't a player-hater, kid, you took her off restriction  
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction  
Kid, you know I'm game tight when you hit it tonight  
I hope she screams my name right  
This word is born kid, you know why?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Check it

I seen this girl, walking down the block  
I said, "wait!"  
"Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?"  
"Have some donuts and milk?"  
"Listen to a pop tune maybe?"  
  
Please be his ex and be my bride  
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried  
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there  
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair  
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole  
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role  
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby  
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me  
I cry out your name as you hold his hand  
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned  
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain  
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain  
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad  
Fantasize of the love we could have had  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I pour wine for two, even though it's just me  
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see  
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring  
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing  
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two  
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you  
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap  
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
The time has come, the decision's yours  
This super love story ain't working no more  
Can't you understand that my love spans  
Higher and further than any man's  
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth  
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout  
You're my only desire, I fight to the death  
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath  
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close  
To our love I toast, all he does is boast  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
A knock on the door and a tap on the glass  
Tells me you see it my way at last  
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me  
He called you up and said, "Yo baby, why you diss me?"  
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore  
You want more of what you used to ignore  
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy  
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me  
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'  
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight  
But my agony continues till it reaches night  
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall  
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall  
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon  
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon  
So I dress to impress, exit the house  
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out  
In the middle of the court yard there you stand  
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more  
  
You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction  
You won't get used if you follow my instructions  
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm  
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan  
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down  
You will find your best friend finally is found  
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white  
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight  
And tender and young, soft and wet  
It's hotter than any fantasy could get  
Cause I never met anyone like you before  
And I can give you more

My radio, believe me, I like it loud  
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd  
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat  
While my JVC vibrates the concrete  
I'm sorry if you can't understand  
But I need a radio inside my hand  
Don't mean to offend other citizens  
But I kick my volume way past 10  
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough  
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush  
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show  
But I couldn't survive without my radio  
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass  
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face  
My radio's bad from the Boulevard  
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd  
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme  
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind  
Cause I play everyday, even on the subway  
I would of got a summons but I ran away  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Suckers on my jock when I walk down the block  
I really don't care if you're jealous or not  
Cause I make the songs, you sing along  
And your radio's def when my record's on  
So get off the wall, become involved  
All your radio problems have now been solved  
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond  
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm  
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in  
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin  
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back  
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac  
Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed  
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes  
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast  
The level on my power meter will not decrease  
Suckers get mad, cause the girlies scream  
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset  
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck  
Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play  
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J  
Let your big butt bounce from right to left  
Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def  
Most definitely created by me  
Goin' down in radio history  
I'm good to go on your radio  
And I'm cold gettin' paid cause Rick said so  
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch  
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis  
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'  
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'  
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock  
Circulating through your radio non-stop  
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette  
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject  
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lot of gold  
And jams like these keep me in control  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
And I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Your energy level starts to increase  
As my big beat is slowly released  
I'm on the radio and at the jam  
LL Cool J is who I am  
I'ma make ya dance, boogie down and rock  
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot  
And to expand my musical plan  
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands  
  
That's right, so don't try to front the move  
As you become motivated by the funky groove  
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block  
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock  
See people can't stop me, neither can the police  
I'm a musical maniac to say the least  
For you and your radio I made this for  
Cool J's here to devastate once more  
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs  
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!  
Here to command the hip-hop land  
Kick it live with a box inside my hand  
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go  
But I know I can't live without my radio  
  
Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out,  
Cool out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at.

If it's a Malibu beat, subject of discussion  
Malibu beat, subject of discuss-cussion  
You're motivated-vated, to aid a percussion-cussion  
There's no glo-glory, for this story-story  
It-it rock-rock in any territory-tory  
I syncopate it and design it well-well  
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels  
All techniques are a combination  
Of skills that I have, thought narration  
  
Last year my melody, but still complete  
Providing musical energy for the street  
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect  
Jump track patt-erns on cass-ette  
Time-time snare had bass and cymbal  
Like that of a cat on the mic I'm nimble  
Ba-sic patterns, grouped and changed  
Se-quence fre-quent, seek and gain,  
Break, break, for narration  
  
Break two, break two  
  
I'm in the center of a, I'm in the center of a  
Musical skinner, some say the skins is a blow of torture  
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me  
I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry  
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands  
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll  
Give you a lift, no need to sniff  
No butts no how's no why's or if's  
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated  
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it  
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower  
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower  
I need a beat-beat  
  
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought  
You're bein'-being taken-taken, the musical boom  
I'm in full treating your eardrums  
Increasing the rate of vibration  
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know  
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show  
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures  
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure  
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist  
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist  
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user  
A million or more screaming people abuser  
I predict, this jam will hit  
The highest plateau in the world of music  
Paparazzi, wealth and fame  
The total propulsion, of my name  
  
I need a beat  
  
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes  
Have to be very acute, education level high  
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme  
The control was part of the studio design  
Track after track, culminating on wax  
The tape has slack, rewind then back  
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel  
A perfect place for MC's to duel  
  
I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard  
Ha ha, Queens! Ladies Love Cool James!  
Cut Creator!

When I'm alone in my room  
Sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind  
I hear my conscience call  
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove  
For the first time in my life, I see I need love  
There I was, giggling about the games  
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names  
Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn  
As I said to myself, "Look what you've done to her"  
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels  
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal  
Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true  
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you  
Saying amore, kissing you on the ear  
Whispering "I love you" and "I'll always be near"  
Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found  
A desire for true love, floating around  
Inside my soul, because my soul is cold  
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old  
But the other half, needs affection and joy  
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Romance, sheer delight, how sweet  
I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete  
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle  
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle  
Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat  
Kiss you on the cheek and say "Ooh girl, you're so sweet"  
It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you  
I can go on forever telling you what I'll do  
But where you at? You're neither here nor there  
I swear, I can't find you anywhere  
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug  
This love search, is really making me bugged  
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?  
Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean  
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide  
And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you  
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you  
Grind, mold, and never be alone  
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone  
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad  
I've got money but love's something I never had  
I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all  
I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall  
I watch the sun rise, in your eyes  
We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed  
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal  
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel  
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there  
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share  
Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet  
I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer  
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger  
Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration  
This whole experience has been such a revelation  
It's taught me love, and how to be a real man  
To always be considerate and do all I can  
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much  
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch  
Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time  
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine  
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man  
I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand  
I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive  
I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive  
I'd search the whole world for that special girl  
And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Girl, listen to me.  
When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall,  
Fantasies, they go through my mind.  
And, I've come to realize that, I need true love.  
And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen.  
I'll be waiting, I love you.

Blaze this one, word up!  
I'ma blaze this one  
No doubt! uh, check it, check it, check it!

I'm splittin' brothers open like a doctor  
Ya fell asleep, the vampire teeth got'cha  
I drop ya down in boilin' acid  
Ya melt like plastic, elastic, is drastic  
Violations, room vibrations, son  
Cock the hammer let the Uncle give 'em one  
Done take a flick of a wicked lunatic  
puttin' hits on your clique, got'cha wife in turnin' tricks  
What? You don't want to, I thought that you was bawlin'  
Now watch 'cause I cock ya love, ya girlies fallin'  
Uh, what's my function? Lyrical injection  
Blazin' niggas, hittin' 'em raw with no protection  
I take advantage  
Ya fear me, I'm doin' damage  
Ya hear me  
The whole scenario is dreary  
MC's is gettin' wet up in the game  
I meet you up in Memphis, just call my name  
I shot ya!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Ya want to (uh)  
Ya want to (uh)  
Ya want to hit, give me a hour (uh)  
Plus a pen and a pad (uh, check it, check it, check it!)  
I shot ya!  
  
I shot ya! (uh)  
I got ya strap to the stagin'  
Trapped in a cagin, toe kissin' a Cajun  
Ya mob's locked down underneath the surface  
Ya gettin' nervous for talkin' shit with no purpose  
Laced up, mind charmer, mad drama  
What goes around comes around, not around farmers  
Silence, sh, very deadly  
Come and battle, let me add you to my medley  
Possessin' power, takin' everything I can grasp  
Go get it now, why you always dwellin' on the past?  
Baby boys reminiscin' old school shit  
Young fools get dicked, LL rules the shit  
With a platinum fist, the relentless abyss  
I take you to a land where piranhas like to kiss  
Massacre, mmuh, blowin' up the tour bus passengers  
Chuckin' the color outta cartoon character  
Ya get serious  
Real niggas recognize what my theory is  
I shot ya!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I shot ya!  
Word up, I'ma lace this shit crazy, why'nah mean?  
Word up, we're gonna blow the spot up, kid  
No doubt about it  
Yeah, yeah, I ain't through, I ain't through, I ain't through  
  
Uh-uh-uh-oh, lookin' kinda leery  
Ya clique thought I fell off, they didn't want to hear me  
Oh really, now tell me how long have you been whinin'  
Sixteen years, twenty million albums, yeah you're climbin'  
I love your joint 'Rock The Bells', it was mad hot  
Ya record 'bout the Radio was blowin' up my spot  
My girl was on your chip when you flipped 'I Need Love'  
Your backseat count set was mad butter, son  
I loved your boomin' system it was wicked as could be  
You bad, now I'm writin' on your pink cookies  
And you had me screamin' 'Mama Said Knock Ya Out'  
Ya jinglin', baby, no doubt  
Uh, talk to me (what, what, uh, uh) become a zombie, walk to me  
Ain't a MC alive who fought with me  
Why'nah mean? Man, rock it  
Easy does it  
I gotta pluck it like buzzards  
I shot ya!  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
What, what, what, what, what  
Uh, what?  
Why'nah mean? This is how we gettin' down for crizzown  
No diggity, why'know I'm sayin'  
Trackmasters lace me, why'know I'm sayin'  
And I take care of mines, why'know I mean'  
That's it son!  
Peace!

[Ll Cool J](Puffy)  
Its gonna be a hot summer baby  
(This is the remix)  
Know what I'm saying sugar  
(Carl Thomas, yeah uncle L)  
(Let's go)  
  
When it's love at first sight  
It's all right to get caught up in the hype  
You got me staring at the ceiling late at night  
I got you calling up your girls for insight  
That's ai-ight cause I blazed it just right  
You got a man so I can't leave marks when I bite  
Can't go to your crib and conversate late at night  
But I know you think of me when he's holding you tight  
Wish I was there baby  
  
[Carl Thomas]  
It was love at first sight  
I know from the way she looked at me  
Her eyes said it all  
Long days and nights, we spent  
Until she dropped the bomb on me  
When she said that she  
Was unhappily married with children  
  
1 - And I wish I never met her at all  
Even though I love her so  
But she got love for me  
But she still belongs to someone else  
  
It hurts so bad, for sure  
Because she wants to be with me  
But she cannot be with me  
She chose to stay-hey at home  
So they could be a family  
For the children  
But what about me?  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Maybe in another life  
Things could be the way  
We both desired  
It's a catch-22  
(Catch-22)  
Even when you win, someone had to lose  
  
Repeat 1  
  
[Ll Cool J] (Puffy)  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I wanna snatch you from your man  
(That's right)  
If need be, throw some ice up on your hand  
(Come on)  
Anybody that's human will understand  
(Uh)  
No disrespect baby it's God's plan  
Your man's cool with me  
But I must take what's rightfully mine  
Even if it means I gotta cross the line  
Even if it means I got to take my time  
(Take your time)  
And send some chicks at him and disrupt his mind  
But whether he true or not  
You still hot  
(Still hot)  
At three in the morning you sit staring at the clock  
(Come on)  
Making up reasons to ride through my block  
(What?)  
I wish he'd disappear, I wish that you'd stop  
I wish that we could shop with our shorties in the drop  
(He-he)  
Cruise the clear waters in a wine colored yacht  
(I like that)  
The sun rays sparkle off your skin, so hot  
(Come on)  
It gets no better than this, we on top  
(Yeah)  
  
[Carl Thomas] (Puffy)  
Met her  
At all, at all  
Even though I love her so  
She's got love for me, oh  
(Carl Thomas, Emotions)  
But she still belongs to someone else  
(Bad Boy you know the name)  
(Sing the song)  
I wish, I wish I never met her at all, oh, oh  
(Yeah)  
I wouldn't hurt so much inside  
Oh she still belongs to someone else  
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain  
Met her at all  
If I never met her at all, at all, at all  
Oh yeah, oh yeah  
She still belongs to someone else  
(Uh yeah, uh yeah)

(Calling all cars, calling all cars)  
(Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples)  
(Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers)  
(Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east)  
(Alias L.L. Cool J)  
(He's bad)  
  
No rapper can rap quite like I can  
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand  
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop  
Make you say, "Go L.L. and do the wop"  
  
If you think you can out rhyme me, yeah boy I bet  
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet  
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good  
I got a gourmet plate that says I wish you would  
  
And when rap begin then I gotta join in and  
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win  
Cool J has arrived so you better make way  
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!  
  
Sparring competition that's my hobby and job  
I don't wear a disguise because I don't own the mob  
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped  
So many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped  
  
I'm bad  
(Cool J)  
(Cool J)  
(Cool J)  
(C C C C Cool J J)  
(Cool J)  
(C C C C C C C Cool J J J J J)  
  
I'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war  
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more  
Got concrete rhymes been rappin' for ten years and  
Even when I'm braggin' I'm bein' sincere  
  
MC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin  
They call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin  
Because I'm bad as can be got my voice all waxed  
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed  
  
I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way  
The best rapper you've heard is L.L. Cool J  
Kamikaze take a look at what I've done  
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one  
  
And can happen on time never standin' on lime  
You want to try me first you better learn how to rhyme  
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme  
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean  
  
I'm bad  
I eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks  
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk  
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame  
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane  
  
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull  
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full  
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I  
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's withstand I tie  
  
Never retire or put my mike on the shelf  
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself  
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad  
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad  
  
MC's they retreat cause they know I can beat 'em  
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em  
I'm the best takin' out all rookies  
So forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies  
  
I'm bad  
(Cool J)  
(Cool J)  
(Cool J)  
(Cool J J J)  
(Cool J J J)  
(C Cool J)  
  
Never ever no never  
Never wearin' no Levis battle me why try  
I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye  
Sparrin' MC's and I'm a never get with  
When I retire I'll get worship like a old battleship  
  
L.L. I'm bad other rappers know  
When I enter the center they say, "Yo, yo there he go!"  
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge  
Not a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large  
  
The original Todd teachin' how to be hard  
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod  
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue  
Not Atilla the Hun but no I'm Threwler his son  
  
My pulse exact like rack and pinion in a Jag  
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grab-bag  
No good scavenger catfish vulture  
My tongue's a chisel in this competition sculpture  
  
I'm bad  
(Think I'm gonna need backup)  
(Think I'm gonna need backup)  
(What you need that for?)  
(Yo this is L.L. Cool J)  
(And you'll never catch me so don't even try it)  
(I'm too bad for ya, understand)  
I'm bad!

You're the type of guy that can't control your girl  
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls  
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene  
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine  
You're the type of guy that tells her, "Stay inside"  
While you're steady fronting in your homeboy's ride  
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave  
I'm doing your girlfriend, that's something you can't believe  
Cause I'm that type of guy  
  
You're the type of guy that gets suspicious  
I'm the type of guy that says, "The pudding is delicious"  
You're the type of guy that has no idea  
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneaking in from the rear  
I'm the type of guy to eat it, when he won't  
And look in the places that your boyfriend don't  
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk  
Now knowing that your main girl's biting my chunk  
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady  
Their boyfriends are boring, and I can drive em crazy  
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop  
She gave me a sweater kiss thank you, sweetheart  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early  
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast  
You're the type of guy eating a TV dinner  
Talking about "Goddamn it, I'ma kill her"  
I'm the type of guy to make her say, "Why you're illing, Bee?"  
You're the type of guy to say, "My lower back is killing me"  
Catch my drift?  
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English  
I'm the type of guy to cold put on a pamper  
You're the type of guy to say, "What you talking bout?"  
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm that type of guy  
You know what I mean?  
Check it out  
  
T-y-p-e g-u-y  
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye  
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted  
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it  
Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time  
Swearing up and down, "That girl's all mine"  
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believing it  
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it  
I'm that type of guy  
  
I'm that type of guy  
  
Know what I mean  
  
I'm that type of guy  
  
"So ridiculous"  
  
So funny  
I don't know  
Come on down  
Yeah  
Like real cool, you know what I mean?  
I like just going to your front door ringing bells  
And just like, ha, leave

[Ll Cool J]  
  
I'm incredible, I mix up shit like cake mix  
Keep it blazin hot, rhymes burn to keep you frost bit  
Mc's is assed-out cause they lost it  
Peep my foundation, the way I reinforce it  
I monitor movements, precisely  
Makin niggas hit high notes, like the Eisley's  
Finally, some bitches I can touch up  
Tie em to the grill of my Six, pop the clutch up  
Hush up, I rush up, inside your cut  
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps  
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps  
Cause "Life is like a box of chocolate," Mr. Gump  
Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate em  
Ll platinum again, don't you hate 'I'm?  
A thin line between darkness and sunshine  
Five Percenters that was raised on swine  
Known to be wise, and you wise to understand  
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand  
I've been hot so long, I'm immune  
Your rap career get cut short like Poom-Pooms  
  
Chorus: Keith Murray (Ll Cool J)  
  
Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world,  
They all recognize we (Incredible)  
We can stand in the water and can't get wet,  
You can bet your last dollar we (Incredible)  
We gets it on in the worst way  
All the homeboys and the girls say we (Incredible)  
From one brother to another  
They agree with each other, lyrically we both (Incredible)  
  
[Keith Murray]  
  
Adios, mios, Montageune  
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled  
Your only skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul  
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes  
I have more beef than filet mignon  
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the? Como?  
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week  
And go platinum next month  
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro  
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow  
I'm three from three from a three-point land  
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand  
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee  
I add verbal assault to your mental injury  
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it  
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it  
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this  
I sew up the populace like a seamstress  
A prisoner, doing time and the bit  
A grown man, and don't play with no kids

Hey yo this is the infinite, intelligent, extravagant and eloquent  
That shit y'all talking is irrelevant  
I put it down from the gutter to the tenement  
It's LL Cool J nigga, everything I do is excellent  
And I got to represent, Q-Boro, the thorough  
Ya know what I mean? We get down, we get down baby  
Check this shit out right here, uh  
  
E Pluribus Unum is the album I'ma drop  
It'll make you bitch niggas as hard as rocks  
Giving head to the glock, pretend it's hard cock  
Splashing niggas I came slow through the block  
I'm, the original, visual, individual  
Ten times platinum your career's looking critical  
Reach for this, mother fuck being a criminal  
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal  
You wanna freestyle fuck that  
I need at least seven figures to even touch that  
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format  
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that  
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fucking with me  
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me  
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads  
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards  
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four  
And 2001'll be mine, by law  
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?  
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standing in line  
Loving the way I shine and my lyrics combine  
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find  
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits  
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch  
Back in the days it was the M fast stick  
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick  
This ones for Clue and my Riker's Island niggas  
That remember when I came through  
The big O B C C H D M 2 C 74  
Little Nasi and the crew, y'all niggas come home  
  
Word up, the new album goin' be the shit baby  
Ain't no doubt about it, E Pluribus Unum  
Out of many one, The G.O.A.T., Greatest Of All Time

My 12th album launched  
Now everything is carte blanch  
There's only one God  
Victory is all I want, let's go  
  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
Ah one, two and uh, ah one, two and uh  
Juelz, it's LL and Santana  
(You witnessin' history)  
  
To my homies who get it and get it the fast way  
To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty  
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy  
Can't wait to smash me, all they do is harass me  
  
Check it, I stay in smoke filled Benzes  
Don't see nothin', you know the whole world's tinted  
OZM so po'-po', don't sing sing  
My license and registration is good, go check it  
  
It cost to be the boss, it cost for me to floss  
Of course you see the frost, got diamonds on my neck  
I'm the big skipper, big dipper, big pot  
Big whipper, just watch, big rocks, big flipper, you dig?  
  
Big money, big spender, big getter  
Big hustler, big grinder, do you get the big picture, you dig?  
This is a club banger, trunk hopper  
Block rocker, rude boy, top shotter  
  
Ay, this is for my down South trappers  
My Midwest slabbers, you dig?

Welcome to Exit 13  
I am your host  
LL Cool J  
  
You said I was finished  
And Father Time was the blame  
You disrespected my legacy  
And threw dirt on my name  
Told DJs he's over  
He ain't spittin' the same  
What he says is irrelevant  
Hip-Hop culture has changed  
When I walk in the room  
Young boys look at me strange  
As if I am a relic  
From some long forgotten game  
It makes my blood boil  
Turns my eyes to flames  
I built an empire  
They tried to kick me out in the rain  
So I called on an inner power  
It's hard to explain  
It's like a holy spirit  
Utilizing hip hop slang  
I'm beyond the gold grills  
And logos on chains  
You see I changed rap forever  
I elevated the game  
Launched the greatest label  
In the history of rap  
And for twenty four years  
I carried it on my back  
I've always shined brighter  
When I'm under attack  
I might be down for a moment  
But I always come back  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war  
It's time for war (Check it)  
It's time for war  
  
This is a resurrection  
I'm back from the dead  
They told me quit a long time ago  
But I conquered instead  
I had dreams and visions  
Swirling around in my head  
I had this hunger deep inside of me  
That has to be fed  
Hip hop will respect  
All the blood that I shed  
I have a covenant with God  
I have swallowed the bread  
Hip hop my co-defendant  
With this mic I thee wed  
I made an entire generation  
Obey what we said  
I'm talkin' France to Germany  
From Italy to Japan  
From London to Belgium  
To Afghanistan  
From Farmers Boulevard  
Smokin' a blunt with my man  
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board  
To build Def Jam  
You see, I'm the undisputed  
King of all hip hop  
Everything after is my legacy  
Like it or not  
And I will keep making history  
I can't stop  
LL Cool J  
Eternally hot  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how easily I flipped it  
And switched the style around  
Competition losin' their footing  
I see them falling down  
They will plot against me  
It kills them because I'm ballin' now  
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone  
But I got you callin' now  
This is a job that must get done  
Even if I become public enemy number one  
If I had to pick up an Uzi  
That weighs over a ton  
I will attack hip hop  
Until competition is none  
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L  
You end up tortured  
And trapped in psychological hell  
And this is the beginning  
Of a new era in rap  
LL Cool J, feel the impact  
It's okay if you call it a comeback  
And let them know  
I'm ready for combat  
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back  
The crown looks wrong on your head  
I want that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time for war  
  
It's time for war

Just starin' at these four walls closin'  
In on me, feelin' like time's frozen  
Fadin' in and out, noddin' and dozin'  
Guilt tearin' up my brain like erosion  
What I did to you was wrong I admit it  
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'  
All alone in what used to be a home  
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in  
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'  
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron  
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through  
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you  
Talkin' slick like she ain't here  
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click  
I need to hit her with a brick  
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament  
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge  
With her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin' rain  
Whylin' out screamin' yo' name  
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell 'til you mad as hell  
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)  
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them  
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)  
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere  
And I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha  
To show you I changed shawty  
  
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat  
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat  
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that  
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?  
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin'  
Every other weekend gone until the mornin'  
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong  
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on  
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings  
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn  
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights  
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck  
That was the old me, the one I still regret  
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget  
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end  
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(i still love you!) [cars peel]  
  
I don't care if the cops got me surrounded  
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in  
My mind's in an altered state  
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake  
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes  
I already played the fool when I let you escape  
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex  
Everything about you and yours connects  
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin  
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'  
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'  
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'  
Please find it in your heart to forgive me  
Realize only god can convict me  
We all make mistakes, so have you  
If god show mercy on me, then you should too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To show you I changed shawty  
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)  
I wanna show you I changed shawty  
(I still love you!) ow!  
(I'm tellin' you I've changed)

Milky, and I'm back  
My ace in the hole was this brand new track  
I'ma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up  
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up  
I did it, but the devil didn't make me  
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me  
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint  
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint  
Your head with oil--lots of oil  
Make it run like water, watch it boil  
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it  
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---huh!  
Prince of the growl is on the prowl  
How you like me now punk? You living foul  
Here's what my game is, here is what my aim is  
A washed up rapper needs a washer, my name is--  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper  
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper  
King Hercules!  
  
Back for the payback, I must say that  
I heard your new jam, I don't play that  
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting  
This year you tried, next year you're quitting  
Last year you thought I was dying out  
But again, and again, and again without a doubt  
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound  
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around  
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff  
And this is an example of funky stuff  
When you want to make hits, you make 'em like this  
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss  
It's a strong record, a record for the strong  
For those who appreciate real rap songs  
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track  
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth  
A-k-a James Todd Smith  
Hard like penitentiary steel  
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal  
Home girls in the house, see'mon  
Home girls in the house, give it up  
You gotta want to get hotter  
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot of  
People don't know how nice I am  
People sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man  
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran  
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van  
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves  
Don't run out there ? ? ?  
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do  
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--  
  
[Chorus:]  
Break it down! x3  
Yo Bob, show that old school sucker punk what real hip hop is boy  
[scratches]  
  
"How Ya Like Me Now?" I'm getting busier  
I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier  
Check out the way I say my, display my, play my  
Ain't holding back, behind the cool without the A.Y.  
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth  
It makes me move and I'll improve  
As it goes on, as it flows on  
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on  
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown  
Pull on my jock to be down  
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down  
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down  
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees  
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LPs  
Day after day after day  
Tou smashed in the face by the vase of Cool J  
I'm--[scratches]  
  
I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker  
A killing machine, a savage street talker  
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax  
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed  
The prince of hip hop, straight from Queens  
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean  
And you've never seen anybody rock the party  
All you punks ? ? ? this beats Bacardi  
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know  
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano  
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel  
Don't let me hear you say I ain't debonair  
I'm better than any emcee out there  
As a matter of fact, suckers can't compare  
When I rocking the mic people stop and stare, at..

Yeah you know what I'm saying?  
It's real funny you know hat I mean?  
I like can't believe this y'know  
Jealousy like tried to move on me you know what I'm sayin?  
So I said nah I ain't gonna, y'know  
make no energetic hyped up yelling, type joint, know what I mean?  
I'm just goin' cool back, you know what I'm sayin?  
Word up to this slow gangster beat type thing  
Check it out yo  
  
Jealousy, I wanna kill him and shoot him  
He's a sucker, I'd like to execute him  
Recruit him, put him in my school and school him  
I said something simple, and I knew that I'd fool him  
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me  
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me  
He's just a monkey, riding my back  
In fact I kidnap, ram-sack, hijack and back slap the fool,  
see my name is Cool J  
I play for keeps, the microphone's my tool  
I've been holding back long enough I had to bring it  
Jealousy is in the house y'all, fellas sing it  
  
Jealous, jealous,  
There's no need to be  
Jealous, jealous  
Be mellow, you know what I'm saying?  
Jealous, jealous,  
Gangster groove, word up know what I'm saying?  
Jealous, Jealous..  
Check it out y'all  
  
I'm not lackadaisical or lazy on the microphone  
I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home  
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rolling  
So when they give it up, stand back and start folding  
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a  
half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber  
Cause I'ma break down all walls Jealousy built  
and then walk tall, like I'm standing on stilts yeah  
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it  
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded  
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is  
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus  
  
Jealous, jealous,  
Know what I'm saying? Smooth, word up  
Jealous, jealous,  
Huh, crazy gangster beat, you know what I'm saying?

Jealous, jealous,  
Word up, check it out

Thank you fellas, the way you sung the chorus was swift  
but now it's time to pump lyrics, and shoot the gift  
His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out  
without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout  
Cause I'ma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot  
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot  
and make mean faces, I see em in many places  
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us  
or outdo us, can't do damage and never will  
The Legend in Leather is clever, man I'ma never chill  
Allah take a break from this, yo I love swingin'  
Yo E, pop the bubbly, fellas, start singin'  
  
Jealous, Jealous,  
Know what I'm sayin?

Jealous, jealous,  
Yo, it's crazy, I am the one  
Bust it  
  
Oh yeah, now I'ma wind it up  
It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut  
and head off with a bang that sang and kicked your brain in  
I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin  
In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy  
And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be  
falling for him, I hope you understood  
Stay away from him he ain't no good  
  
You know what I'm saying man yo (that's word yeah I hear that)  
Yeah word up (can't hang out man)  
Yo it ain't nothing yo ya know what I'm saying

[Intro:]  
No cut  
Pure raw  
We sold out  
You bought more  
[Verse:]  
It was meant to be  
Hip hop died, reincarnated through me  
Now the promoters gotta double my fee  
'Cause these pop melodies ain't fucking with me  
Get back on your tour bus roll some rockly  
Hell your crew twisted in the -ahhh- not me  
Hell through (time) and the game in my speed  
'Cause water down hip hop we do not need  
Yes sir, I got the real recipe  
A little bit of old E and bon bon Z  
I guess by now you can tell you miss me  
The baddest motherfucker in rap history  
One to the temple put you out your misery  
That's not an album, that's a frisbee  
Tangle with ll boy that's risky  
Them boys is backwash, we want whiskey  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
[Verse 2:]  
Roll up on your set pull out the 4 pound  
Who's pitching out here blast them off the map  
The game got us bored, no rebounce  
Claims he's hardcore how he sound  
My radio's a bunch of noise in the background  
For a factory manufacturing pop clowns  
That's what happens when ll ain't around  
The pop stars flooding and the hip hop drowns  
Dj suffer while sarada goes round  
You screaming? Got the real creaming  
Welcome to hip hop, we're out here fiending  
Watch a program directed in the bin and  
Went from cruss group to a boy band screaming  
When it come under the car I ain't leaning  
I wish I could bump the brim creaming  
I tell you what, play my stupid -- call it even  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
[Verse 3:]  
What y'all want, no cut!  
What y'all need, pure raw  
What we do, we sold out  
All because... You bought more!  
No affects on my voice, that's my choice  
Hard raw beat make a soft voice moist  
Get the dinero bring the heat like Jon Voight  
Timbaland music, rolls royce  
Hit you in the head like a fat joint  
Back to the S's big meat in Detroit  
L so perceptive shrud in the droit  
Bad motherfucker, now you get the point?  
[Hook:]  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)  
(Jump on it! Jump on it!)

Aah, get the burner.  
Uh, the burner.  
Let loose the cannon  
Blood drippin', slippin' off my planet  
Man, the panic, funk mode  
Mechanical mix flows competition in my dojo  
Swing a hook, got the vertebrae, be brave  
Heat gain meltin' on my heatwave  
Power to the crowd, pandemonium  
Showin' 'em how I gets down  
  
[Chorus]  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
  
Triggedy, sky-high like a kite  
God diggity, every other cloud's blue  
Puff on a, yeah, puff on a  
Bring it on, off, on, baby, one-two  
Peep in the arena, death at your doorstep  
Right around the corner is the land of regret  
When ya sweat to get down, sweat to get off and on  
Till the, nothin' normal 'bout my songs  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
LL Cool, J jazzy jewel  
Takin' dime pieces to the real school  
I got 'em on nations, buckin' like fools  
Pitbulls fightin' over streets I rule  
Catch it if you can, when it's hot ta hit'cha hand  
Throw ya skunks in the air, my funk got the flair, man  
I can do division, baby, I can do math  
Multiplying fractions, now ya know the half  
Knuckle games played, must pack steel  
Oh yes, I'm livin' like real  
To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle  
Till the death of my foes, it's my show  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Baby listen here, I been gettin' paper for years  
And program directors who fronted they disappear

Paparazzi flash while I snatch niggas hoes (wow)  
Live the lifestyles so the average dime piece  
Wanna have my lovechild and roll L style  
A man hostile, but my Queens niggas run wild  
So when I skate through niggas strain to smile  
Peep my profile and my iced-out dial  
I tap my horn, say "What up?" but never smile  
And deuce ass niggas is noodles  
And your broke ass stripper weave is lookin' like a poodle  
'Scuse my French, "Je m'appelle LL"  
I'm platinum again so tell 'em to go to hell  
Then pour some Cristal for my foes that fell  
Hard as hell, big fell, I excel, rock bells (I'm)  
  
(L) I'm the G.O.A.T. I just ball a lot (L)  
And (Cool J) I'm double platinum on the hot blocks and

And (Cool J) you see my hand not what I got and

We speak, daily on the regular  
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular  
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand  
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand  
Layin up at night, peepin out stars  
Remember - when we was at the club at the bar?  
I told ya, my status, was that of a don  
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on  
But my mind has attractin qualities  
on the emotions of a young lady (word up)  
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)

[Intro: Marc Dorsey]  
This is for my number one  
This is for my number one  
This is for my number one  
True baby for I adore  
  
[Verse:]  
This is hard to say I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way  
'cause lately I been busy a lot  
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not  
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly  
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes  
Now I talk real foul and slick  
Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"  
Back in the days I was your number one pick  
Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix  
I had to dig deep inside myself  
'cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else  
It's a long journey back to the place we was  
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love  
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up  
I can't let us self-destruct  
  
[Hook: Marc Dorsey]  
Baby smile today  
'cause I been imaginin' more ways  
I'm gon' love you better  
When your friends'll see you too  
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do  
I'm gon' love you better  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When I think about the things we did  
And I think about you having my kids  
And I think about us sharing a crib  
Losin' all that, God forbid  
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things  
In addition to the sl's, baguettes and rings  
Instead I walk around like I'm a king  
And having you ain't nothing but a thing  
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good  
Too busy frontin' in the hood Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go  
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow One more chance baby and don't say
no  
'cause I got another side to show  
Some say love is painful it helps you grow Well it's time for the pain to go,
ya'know  
  
[Hook: Marc Dorsey]  
Baby smile today  
'cause I been imaginin' more ways  
I'm gon' love you better

[Bridge x2]  
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)  
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)  
So let's laugh together, cry together  
God willin' we gon' die together  
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)  
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)  
So let's laugh together, cry together  
God willin' we gon' die together  
  
[Verse 3:]  
It's a brand new me, a brand new you  
A brand new day, sky so blue  
Hold my hand while I walk with you  
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you  
No more games callin' you foul names Actin' like females is all the same  
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed  
From this day forward I'll never be the same  
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams I love you, lemme show you what I
mean Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen Watch you sleep, so peaceful
and serene  
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life  
But this time I'ma do it right  
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart  
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise  
  
[Hook: Marc Dorsey]  
Baby smile today  
'cause I been imaginin' more ways

(Outro: Marc Dorsey]  
This is for my number one  
This is for my number one  
True baby for I adore

Don't call it a comeback  
I've been here for years  
I'm rocking my peers  
Puttin' suckers in fear  
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon  
Listen to the bass go boom  
Explosions, overpowerin'  
Over the competition I'm towerin'  
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics  
That'll make you call the cops  
Don't you dare stare, you better move  
Don't ever compare  
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced  
Competition's payin' the price  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Don't you call this a regular jam  
I'm gonna rock this land  
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm  
And I'm just gettin' warm  
Just like Muhammed Ali  
They called him Cassius  
Watch me bash this beat like a skull  
That you know I've beef with  
Why do you riff with me  
The maniac psycho  
And when I pull out my jammy get ready  
Cause I might go Blaw!  
How you like me now?  
The Ripple will not allow  
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,  
Listen to my gears shift  
I'm blasting, I'm blasting  
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting  
Olde English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH  
I just don't know  
What made you forget that I was raw  
But now I gotta new tour  
I'm going insane  
Startin' the hurricane  
Releasin' pain  
Lettin' you know  
You can't gain or maintain  
Unless you say my name  
Rippin'  
Killin'  
Diggin' and drillin' a hole  
Pass the Old Gold  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
  
Shotgun blasts are heard  
When I rip and kill at will  
The man of the hour, tower of power  
I'll devour  
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand  
That I'm not your average man  
When I gotta jammy in my hand  
Damn!  
Oh!  
Listen to the way I slay  
Your crew  
Damage  
Damage  
Destruction, terror, and mayhem  
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him  
Farmers (what)  
Farmers (what)  
I'm ready (we're ready)  
I think I'm gonna bomb a town  
Get down  
Don't you never, ever  
Pull my lever  
Cause I explode  
And my nine is easy to load  
I gotta thank God  
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard  
  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out  
I'm gonna knock you out  
Mama said knock you out

Intro: I'm so high. [Puffy] Rock on!  
  
Verse One:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Black shades, three-quarter leathers and medallions  
Honies lined up ready to ride like stallions  
Since good love is hard to find  
I snatch up the real hot ones and make 'em mine  
I let my track record speak instead of me  
On a level that the halfway players will never see  
Uhh, wave your drinks in the air  
Shorty turn around keep the ass right there  
Focus your attention-let your eyes  
Get paralyzed, by the size  
Of my rocks, just remember that members of my click carry glocks  
We got it locked down  
Mo' flowin', click rollin'  
Niggaz still smokin' [L get 'em open]  
Team rough scoop the cream with the puff  
You oughtta stop sleepin', you don't dream enough  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
Oooooh baby, not tonight, I don't wanna fuss and fight  
I just wanna make it right  
Oooooooh, there's work to do  
I wanna get real close to you, I wanna get you in the mood  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And I know that you want me, baby admit it  
  
Chorus: Gimme all your love and don't stop  
My love's waiting when you reach the top  
All night long  
Come into my bedroom honey  
What I got will make you spend money  
All night long  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
You know, that I know that you love me  
So if you just give me a change  
I can still show you romance  
I know, that you still savor for my flavor baby  
So stop playin' hard to get  
Let's make love like we first met  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And you know that you want me baby admit it  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Girlfriend you get me open like Moet, cherry goes pop  
When my love drops  
Two G's in my pockets for tricks  
So tell your girlfriends to warm up and mingle with my click  
You're only a customer  
You're walking in the presence of hustlers  
I did it just right  
Spent money all night  
Magnums of Moet  
Get your lips wet  
  
Chorus 2X

Oh yeah  
Hey yo, man  
Ain't nothin' like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning  
To smooth you out  
  
Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Who's the baddest female of them all?  
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl  
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul  
Rich female, very debonair  
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair  
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo  
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's  
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle  
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles  
A guy walked over, said, "Your earring's cute."  
I said, "I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop."  
Me and Frosted went to get a drink  
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think  
She ordered potassium, calcium  
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium  
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch  
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth  
She's  
  
[Chorus]  
Milky cereal  
(Baby)  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
Milky cereal  
  
I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm  
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm  
For some reason, we walked in the rain  
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain  
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real  
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal  
So we went to be alone  
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home  
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms  
I said "Forget it, let me see your lucky charms."  
When we began, her hairstyle was neat  
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat  
Talked about marriage, I said "That's risky  
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies"  
She had a robe with the velour material  
Her pops woke up, I said "Hello Mr. Cereal  
I came this morning to deliver the paper."  
He said "Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors  
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'  
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, check this out here  
  
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough  
She was turnin' tricks to get her "coo-coo puff!"  
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact  
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat  
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks  
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks  
We called him Hungry Jack  
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack  
He invited me out to lunch  
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch  
The waiter said, "Jack, what would you like today?"  
He said "I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?"  
He said "Cool," came back with the order  
That's when I said, "Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter."  
He said "Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?"  
I said "Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes  
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing  
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King."  
He said "Go party, do some minglin'  
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'"  
I said "It's smooth, no disrespect  
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque."  
Then we walked down the aisle  
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style  
  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Milky  
  
Peace!

Yeah, yeah  
"Oh my God"  
(he's back) success (he's back)  
"They love success!"  
(Where you been?)  
Right here baby  
  
Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale  
About a mogul named Uncle L  
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision  
(He excels, they all fail)  
Undisputed, the game got so polluted  
That he turned his 'Radio' off  
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again  
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)  
With a leopard print outfit on  
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on  
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')  
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'  
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact  
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ  
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'  
"Exotic Motorcars," we want a deal on that  
  
[Chorus]  
Mirror mirror (you go baby) speak to me (you flow baby)  
What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)  
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)  
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)  
  
'Around the way girls be doin' it well'  
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)  
On the Money magazine covers  
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers  
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche  
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)  
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him  
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him  
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'  
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)  
I been his biggest fan since five years old  
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)  
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that  
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that  
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back  
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences  
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me  
  
'Hey Lover', I'm 'Loungin'  
'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain  
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'  
'(Four)-to-the-Three-Two-One', he stopped countin'  
Eliminated competition quickly  
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be  
He feel his flow deep down in your artery  
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be  
'6 Minutes of Pleasure' for 'Jack the Ripper'  
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)  
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'  
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?  
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars  
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)  
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite  
Readin' e-mails with ten on repeat, I seen it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, ten, faith, power of God  
Yeah, c'mon, work it with me baby  
Work with me ma, uh, it's been too long, ten

Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
  
Word up, this shit gon' be ill  
(Uh-huh, uh-huh..) raw like sushi  
Love paper like Ricky love Lucy  
Pop collars, L got heat  
Fifteen years, I'm thorough on the street  
Flood the rap game with product  
That bullshit video, I don't know why you shot it  
The biggest L of them all, "Hollis to Hollywood"  
and I still play the wall, y'all's get the balls  
motherfucker, Duke fold like singles  
Bass from my joint make your clitoris tingle  
That's my word scrams, stupid ass in the club  
You buy a bitch a drink, now you falling in love  
I gave y'all the love game you thought I was soft  
Now you whining like a bitch over some broad you lost  
Playboy bunny got you feeling all crummy  
Y'all niggas want the honey all we want is the money  
  
[Chorus]  
M.I. crooked letter, crooked letter  
I, nigga want to hump-that I  
M.I. crooked letter, crooked letter  
I, nigga want to hump-that I  
  
I had a bad shooby-doobie for ya  
Down in Georgetown fucking with the Hoyas  
Looking for a dark-skin chocolate chick  
Bowlegged with a perm and the ass was thick  
Blacker the berry - well you know the rest  
She got the most rhythm, she ride the best  
Talking midnight black, nappy hair with peas in the back  
Scratch my pipe up every time I hit that (oow)  
She don't look Hawaiian, she not Puerto Rican  
No disrespect mami, but tonight L creeping  
with the darkest honey I could find  
Can't hit a light-skinned dime all the time  
Get your black ass over here, you out your mind?  
I'll turn Halle Berry down for you anytime  
Black queen, dark and lovely, sippin on my bubbly  
First you got to love yourself, then you can love me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I still love you light skin, I'll pimp y'all too  
When I cruise through your hood girl, whatcha gon' do?  
I heard only pretty boys get to run wit you  
Topless in my six now, is that really true?  
Baby look at you, your whole yellow crew  
Cute baby face but look at what you bout to do?  
"Si'l vous plais ma cherie, merci beaucoup"  
When my joint up in her mouth, she like, "You speak French too?"  
  
[Chorus: x2]

LL  
N.O. Joe, hit me baby!  
  
Push it out girl, arch your back

You there, let me grab  
That thing you do keep me brick  
50 told you bout the "Magic Stick"  
c'mon, lean on me  
I'm in love with this scenery  
Poke it out  
'Pon de river, 'pon de bank baby stroke it out  
Sweat for your man  
Both hands on your hips for your man  
Me and the boys is your biggest fans  
Every time we see you we be like damn!  
Work it girl  
Move somethin', hurt me girl, oh!  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, move somethin'  
c'mon, c'mon, prove somethin'  
  
Such a pimply aura  
Way way hotter than I was before-a  
She want to sit courtside next to a baller  
Where the paper's longer and cats are taller  
  
Woo! I'm off on my own  
Do the math mami, L's on the throne  
Now take it to the floor  
Do a split if you really hardcore  
  
Man listen here  
I'm hot today, ain't concerned with last year  
I see your lil' shorty ride shotgun  
But I done left stoplights with a hot one  
  
Made her hop out, and move somethin'  
Jump in my joint, and prove somethin'  
He-he, I laugh at y'all  
Don't worry about the check, already cashed it y'all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
uh, pull it to the side  
Shake it for daddy, it's time to ride  
Make it sweat 'til it slide  
Do your thing like it's justified  
  
Tease me a little  
It's my turn to take it to the middle  
Let me palm that thing  
You got the bomb, I disarm that thing  
  
Turn it around girl, I want that thing  
You had to know the way you flaunt that thing  
Your body's jumpin'  
Ain't no frontin' when you provin' somethin'  
  
Made eye contact with me  
Now bring that thing back to me  
You do your thing so naturally  
I think I'm in love, actually  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
LL  
N.O. Joe, hit me baby!  
Hot one boy, "Definition"

Uh Mr. Smith, Mr Smith, Mr Smith  
Uh Mr Smith, it's the bomb y'knowhutI'msayin? Mr. Smith  
Mr Smith, word up kid, yeah Mr Smith, check it out  
  
I'm goin' to the top leavin' smoke in my trail  
Bitch ass gangstas put that ass on sale  
And even if I'm twice as expensive as the rest  
When I go for dolo you ain't checkin' for nothin' less  
My strategy is splittin' brain cavity's  
It's ya majesty bringin' you a tragedy  
Yeah, on the butcher block slice her like a ox  
When it's time to get down, nigga I jam like a Glock  
I bust through all types of red tape and sue papes  
Niggas come old but they always wanna infiltrate  
I'm cuttin' snakes through the belly witta icepick  
And scoopin' hotties, a strong aisle of flip trips  
It's the rebirth of murkin' niggas once again  
I drain with ink and put your blood in my pen  
I'm breakin ribs til somethin' gives  
A nigga got to live and Mr Smith is power god, kid  
  
Mr Smith you got the shit sewed up  
Work ya thang baby, show 'em how to blow up  
  
Mr Smith you got the shit sewed up  
Work ya thang baby, show 'em how to blow up  
  
Mr Smith you got the shit sewed up  
Work ya thang baby, show 'em how to blow up  
  
What? You wanna do what? You lack the vitality  
Originality, so face reality  
I'm on some ole wild shit, ya niggas can't get with  
Matter of fact, mornin yawn and suck a dick  
Nah hold up, the fuck is goin' on?  
All these cartoon character MC's gettin' airborne  
takin' off like a hot air balloon  
goin' up up up, oh no kaboom  
Bring your heroes down to ground zero  
Shotty grippin ya grill like Pesci and DeNiro  
I'm on some shit, throats is gettin' shit  
Scoopedin New Jacks and kick 'em in the fire bit  
Tell them ole Jap niggas they need to go and stick it  
Cos when it comes to this rap shit I'm mad wicked  
The grand sire bringin' flavor to the whole game  
Mr Smith is my motherfuckin' name  
  
Mr Smith you got the shit sewed up  
Work ya thang baby, show 'em how to blow up  
  
Mr Smith (I was a mack since birth)  
talkin' bout Mr Smith (I invented the taadow!) Uh  
talkin' bout Mr Smith  
talkin' bout Mr Smith  
talkin' bout  
  
Time's up, your rhyme's up, mix the lines up  
I'm about to blow the spot up with that divine touch  
I got the magnetic energetic lyrical calasthetic  
Ya better call a medic cos ya look pathetic  
Guan boy it's the champion Mr Smith  
Your niggas couldn't raise up with a forklift  
Cocked the hammer, peep out the grammar  
It's hard like Bacardi and hot like a house party  
All your so-called flavor niggas is deaded  
Your next step is where ya headed so don't forget it  
Your rhymes is beat, your steelo's scarred to scrape  
When you scream you sound muddy like a bled teeth  
I get'cha open like f-lay, 'tack you when I spray  
Lethal compositions around your way  
I'm the maniacal murderous Mr James Smith  
Rippin' ya ass out the frame with my verbal gift  
  
Mr Smith you got the shit sewed up  
Work ya thang baby, show 'em how to blow up

[Chorus:]  
Once I live a life of a millionaire  
Still do!  
Spending my money, honey ohh I didn't care  
Still don't!  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I'm a floss 'til I die, ball never fall  
Cop 'til I drop, Motherfuck 'em all  
Count paper schemin, leanin on the wall  
Money comin fast, niggas ridin balls  
I been to hell and back, I seen what you saw  
6 in the mornin, D's at the door  
I was a shorty on a bike, hangin with Alpo  
I was a shorty uptown with Rich Porter  
I was a shorty up on 1, 3, 2  
My man az he really schooled me  
My man Big Chuck, he took me to Mt. V  
I messed up the count, Kev winked at me  
What I learned is niggas need paper to burn  
And you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up  
You can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck  
Sometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up  
Follow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up  
I used to be in Queens with my man Black Just  
Before he got killed, now that nigga was real  
He took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live  
Took me to hot blocks, showed me big knots  
Him and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not  
You ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly  
Used to run to Big Kev before he got knocked  
When niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block  
125th in the Beemer with az  
He gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me  
That being a gangster don't mean you're all bad  
And niggas respect you when they know you got cash  
Remember Big dave had the dust on smash  
I was amazed the lifestyle was so fast  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'  
That was before Queens had blood in the street  
Stretch from bk had the pretty gold Benz  
He took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends  
Let me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend  
They was playing the money game and I wanted in  
I was just a young boy with dangerous friends  
If it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been  
I took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts  
Big Chuck when to jail when I was ready to start  
I guess I was destin, God pulled us apart  
But I admit, getting that street money is a art  
I was so many players I knew back in the D  
Like Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami  
'86 that nigga's Benz had tv's  
Only God knows what these niggas mean to me  
Real talk  
  
[Chorus:]

It's for the ghetto  
For the ghetto (uh) for the ghetto (yeah)  
It's for the ghetto (uh) man it's for the ghetto (yeah)  
It's for the ghetto (uh) it's for the ghetto (yeah)  
It's for the ghetto (uh) man it's for the ghetto (yeah)  
  
Leanin' dipped in rocks, pump the joint on the block  
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades, peepin' the spots  
Frostbit and I'm turnin' blue, that's why I'm so hot  
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked  
  
Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve  
Rent the presidential suite out, snatch ya bird  
My motto is dough or die, peace sign in the sky  
In the brand new 'lectric blue Bentley ridin' by  
  
Hurt these clowns, anybody that want it  
Let you borrow my crown, tell me why would you flaunt it?  
Don't you know you can get it, have your wig-piece splitted  
Meth' asked me to spit it, see my coupes is kitted  
  
And my minks is fitted, lyrically I'm sid-dick  
Honey frontin when you around, I always hit it  
The boss is home, regulatin on chrome  
Tell Russell it's line one, LL's on the phone  
  
[Chorus]  
Get off my niggy niggy nuts! (ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)  
(ha-hah, ha-hah-ha, ha ha-hah) Get off my niggy niggy nuts!  
(ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)  
(ha-hah, ha-hah-ha, ha ha-hah) Get off my niggy niggy nuts!  
  
Get them niggy nuts, now here's wiggy what  
Y'all need to do, when I come through, give it up  
Paper stackin', daddy get it crackin'  
Chains might be gold, the joints always platinum  
  
(And rims) always chrome (jeans) always pressed  
(Loot) always right (cut) always fresh  
(Gear) always dipped (honey) always bangin'  
(You hot?) Always, my niggy nuts always hangin'  
  
Hold it down, rocks by the pound  
The new 2002 b-boy sound  
Hoes stand back, I'm shakin' up the game  
You should a never tried, to SLIDE in my lane  
  
Guaranteed-to-blow-the-block-up  
When-I-ease-this milky white drop up  
Want to bang ya, that's all you need to know  
50 deep in Sumer Jam, I closed the show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nuts, y'all, baby, stay flowin!  
Hit Big B, tell him bring the Mo' in (bring it in)  
Uh, we rockin to the rhythm (all night baby)  
Uncut raw, what we give 'em  
  
Hell yes, bounce to the music! (bounce)  
When the joint come on, everybody lose it  
(This year) leave the bar, hit the floor  
Represent, let these clowns know who you are  
  
When it's bangin' like this, why stop? (Why stop?)  
Ask me why I pop Cris', why not? (Why not?)  
The flow of the century  
Got your Belve splashin' to the melody, what you tellin' me?  
  
This is fresh, 'til the day I die  
Leavin' momma with a tear in her eye  
You was frontin for a minute, now what?  
You snapped when the joint dropped  
  
[Chorus: x2]

We need to have a conversation  
  
I made you, why would I play you?  
Trade home, base four, California angel  
Swinging a fast bitch, foul out, betray you  
When I won't even wanna hit it in a day or two  
Straight home I'd run, well, that's debatable  
I can't front, I hit a slump all players do  
But tough times are minor to a major dude  
We all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues  
Now you're searching all the clubs for what's available  
A year ago, my slot was unassailable  
My feast is a famine without you to cater to  
If these walls could talk, what would they say to you?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!  
  
The dining room has an empty chair  
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair  
House full of company, but no one's here  
We singing cheers while we holding back tears  
To keep up appearances in front of our peers  
We play holiday card tricks every year  
Blackjack, poker, make the joker disappear  
The ace can't breathe when it's tension in the air  
Three clubs in one night, but nobody cares  
Cause it's still not a full house without a pair  
You tipped your hand, but the text wasn't clear  
You're dealing from the bottom queen of hearts, play fair!  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!  
  
Slip in the door, you hold my hopes so  
All I hear is love don't live here anymore  
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold  
We're sitting on a fence, so where you wanna go?  
You're the architect of your life, it's your show  
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow  
Before you burn the house down, think, take it slow  
Even arsonists need a shelter, let me know  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't understand what we gonna do  
But it's like you don't know me  
And I don't know you, no more  
Not no more!  
And it's like damn, how the hell we get here?  
No idea, but we're not what we were before  
Could it be that I don't love you and you don't love me no more?  
That girl don't live here not no more!  
Baby, baby,  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that girl no more!

One shot  
Oh lord  
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you  
Trying to pull you down  
But what you have to remember is  
It's up to you, it's your choice  
You only get one shot in life  
And you only get one shot at love  
  
Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love  
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match  
Everything is perfect, it seems divine  
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch  
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside  
One person smirks while the other one cries  
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love  
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Physical and mental, those are two different loves  
Physical's a moment, mental is forever  
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden  
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together  
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times  
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow  
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love  
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one, shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Jealousy, don't let it interfere  
Don't let it come in between  
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God  
So merciless and mean  
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships  
And pit two people against, one another  
And because of this God, the one you love so much  
Will no longer be your lover  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
Aw baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all  
  
I hope you understand what I just said  
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life  
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it  
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad  
Take it from me  
You only get one shot, and I mean that  
One shot  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
You only get you only get you only get one  
You only get you only get you only get one  
One shot at love

If I'm hot for you and you're hot for me  
What you got for me is no shock to me  
Can't believe that you're my property  
The sound of you clappin' on top of me  
The feeling of hitting the lottery  
Or passing go twice in monopoly  
But they don't compare to what you got for me  
The taste of the puddin' is so chocolaty  
I'm so conceited so obscene  
And still got my sneakers and my chain all leanin'  
And when I hit it right it start gleamin'  
Mean faces for what was the reason  
Chop it a little bit  
Its hard to read you like I'm illiterate  
But I'm ready for the graduation  
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation  
  
[Chorus]  
Give me all you got baby 2nite  
Now's the perfect time  
Come blow my mind  
Its cold out here please let me come inside  
Oh so warm at night  
You blow my mind, hey  
  
You can go ahead and talk greasy  
Tell me that you never had it this deeply  
I'm a whisper slick you respond sweetly  
Extra freaky I trick and you treat me  
I'll give you take but don't hesitate  
When you feel it go and throw it right back  
Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders  
Then you can take it like that  
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg  
On the dresser kickin' the lamp girl  
Run the shower lets go in the bathroom girl  
Cause the temperature is hotter than high noon girl  
Crack that door let the steam flow  
Ain't nobody here but me and you let it go  
You never it this good you already know  
Give me all you got girl really though  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're the sexiest woman I've ever known  
My mind is blown  
You're simple beautiful how you do it to me  
You're showin' me things id never do  
Whole 'nother side of you  
Just keep what you do it feels like oh we  
  
You can go ahead and hit a wild climax  
Ain't no way I'm bout to let you relax let me see if  
You can hold me on ya back  
Let me see ya body wine to the track  
Chop it a little bit  
Hard to read you it feels like I'm illiterate  
But I'm ready for the graduation  
Yeah go ahead and repeat that rotation

We went through this before  
Actin' like the L's can't bag 'em no more  
Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor  
Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby  
  
So butter, still relate to the gutter  
Just your life style's different, spirit uplifted  
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted  
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it  
  
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle  
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me  
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely  
I'm saying baby  
  
Touch it why don'tcha (oh) touch it why don'tcha (oh)  
Touch it why don'tcha (hey) touch it why don'tcha (mm)

Black sand, Tahiti, ten days to reminisce  
God's my witness (uh)  
I paid the price for paradise, so I'm livin' this  
  
I never limit myself, the L's fearless  
Lay back while I illuminate the darkness  
Like it smooth don'tcha  
Make it move won'tcha, think I won't?  
  
Take you to your peak I know them other cats don't  
And it won't stop, this is beyond paper  
First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya  
Never pimpin', raise my girls well  
  
Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle L.L.  
See-double, L tattooed on the bubble  
I lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle  
True love is so rare  
But don't you worry I ain't going nowhere  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trust me, trust me, trust, me, baby

Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly  
At the telly on the celly, get that money Elle  
Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it  
Then the man can achieve it, you gotta breathe it  
  
And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe  
Minimum, ten percent go to God first  
Lay back baby, close your eyes  
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs  
  
So much shade baby, the water bed fries  
Walk around nude in the suite yelling, "Recognize!"  
Do your dance, baby pour me a class  
It feels so good to have the world in a smash  
  
Touch it why don'tcha (oh) touch it why don't ya (oh)  
Touch it why don'tcha (hey) touch it why don't ya (mm)  
Hey girl, aw, girl!  
Hey girl, I want to rock your world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yea yea, gotta keep your eyes on the prize baby  
Sky's the limit  
If you can see it, you can be it  
Ha ha, it's on you, word up  
Everybody put your hands in the air  
It's high time baby  
One love, one God, recognize  
  
If you need me, just call me  
Said if you want me, just be for real  
And if you like me, come and talk to me  
And if you want me, tell me how you feel  
  
[Chorus]

Ah ah  
Baby girl was draped in Chanel  
Said she love Tupac but hates some LL  
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings  
She can take a prince, turn him into a king  
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites  
Said her man get paper but he don't live right  
All these emotions flowing inside the club  
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?  
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on  
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick  
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats  
No joke all this love, let it stay broke out  
Behind every playa is a true playette  
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check  
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist  
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce  
  
[Chorus]  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon  
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)  
  
He was king of seduction, cop a suction  
Now she was the cat that worked construction  
Starve her with the paper, abuse the mind  
Dis a new lover, when you know it's on mine  
that's on top, lap dancin' got to stop  
You play out your chick cause your game is hot  
I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew  
He's banging on my chest till it's black and blue  
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my six  
You reach it then you hear the cordless click  
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'  
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'  
Hell no, must be out Chicago  
on your knees and your elbows each and every time  
That's why I love you mami, you  
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby  
Work me out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He was all souped up, but played it just right  
Mami I was full blown, my game was air tight  
I needed to switch up and get it in gear  
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah  
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'  
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in  
I'm sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'  
Moanin' in the mirror with my Cubans on  
Let bygones be bygones, no more games  
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames  
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back  
Got it all figured out, mami I like that  
Collect tips, cop his and her whips  
The voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe  
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field  
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, getting crushed by buildings  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, getting crushed by buildings  
  
I'll take 30 electric chairs  
And put 'em in a classroom  
30 MC's  
And set'em free from their doom.  
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind  
When we begin  
The wheel of fortune it spins  
Holdin'  
The rhythm like elastic  
Moldin'  
Your whole body like plastic  
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love  
Up above  
Cause the mania  
Hysteria  
In the streets  
While ya lovers getting merrier  
In the sheets  
I met this lady named  
Sweet young thing and  
She gave me that feeling  
That sunshine bring in.  
Hordable  
Sportable  
Totally affordable  
Silky smooth  
Voice was real audible.  
I said your cool as Ice Cuba  
She said, "your that Public Enemy  
I seen on the tuba."  
No  
I'm like your Uncle baby.  
The style of your beautiful face  
Drives me crazy.  
Well can we do ya so Heavy ah D?  
She said, "You tried to play me  
Like Big Dad-dy."  
I said, "I know your Tribe,  
I Called and re-Quested  
For you to be manifested."  
She said, "You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?"  
I said, "You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?"  
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T  
Make ya feel Bran Nubian  
Instantly.  
Boogie Down  
And check this Production.  
Gimme them lips  
They look good for suction.  
She said, "Sweet tease  
Cool with a little almond joy  
On the side  
Just doin' the fly"  
You like pound cake?  
Comin' to my house  
Turn on the lights  
And see me on the couch.  
I said, "Do the jingle  
And your from around the way.  
I like your earrings  
L's  
But anyway,  
Your grand-daddy is  
Here to spread cheer.  
Something nice and smooth  
With my tongue in your ear.  
Give me a snack  
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger.  
Ice Cube T  
Or if you prefer the  
Taste of honey Kid  
Ride in my Capri and  
That's the joint  
They got the real clear CD in.  
She said, "Stars couldn't get me in a car.  
I don't know what type of man ya are.  
You might know karate  
Do me and get away  
I got a glimpse of your license plate  
N-W-A."  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She was Chubby and  
Ready to Rock  
Naughty By Nature and  
Part of my private stock and  
Riding in the relax  
Frame of mind and  
Hammer timing  
Incredible.  
So edible  
And unforgettable.  
Soft like a Q-Tip  
I'd love to get with you  
Cause I'm the type of guy that got props do  
Feel it in mo and more,  
When I get ready for a showcase  
Put together well  
I go deep  
And have an oil well  
Show and tell.  
I said, "Yo-Yo!  
You're so intelligent  
And elegant."  
I n-I never Run to be D  
With another MC  
I got what I want  
Right in front of me.  
I know a kid named K  
He's a MD.  
Last time I heard  
Yo, was getting real friendly.  
Belly to belly and  
Chest to chest  
Thigh by thigh  
Leg by leg and  
I guess.  
Ain't no way to get ya out  
Your so caught up S-E-X-U-A-L - sort  
Of a freaky situation  
With a peppermint twist  
Ricky or Mike is next on the list.  
Nastified and all-funkified  
Come'on  
Come'on  
Come'on  
Ride.  
Can you hear?  
Never fear  
Whatcha hear.  
What ya hear  
Is it clear?  
Understand  
And love ya big dear  
And I will appear  
My dear  
With a beer  
And bags full of cheer  
And waterbed,  
Yeah!  
Cause I rumble and groan.  
She said, "You got to be bad to  
Make the moanie moan."  
Ain't no reason to front  
On the way your life shown.  
Boo-ya!  
How I'm jumpin' your bones  
Like a Grand  
Master in a Flash.  
Put out your cigarette  
And rest your tired ash.  
All I wanna do  
Is make woopie  
Your my pink cookie.  
Not a wookie  
When you take it off  
I'd love a lookie.  
Cause I'ma mix it up toss style.  
Peace out  
You got the sexual profile.  
  
[Chorus]

Hit that nigga, man, fuck these niggas  
Straight up, all y'all niggas, yo, yo  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)

(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
I'm here to crack ya cats' skulls open  
Fuck ya head up more than that bullshit ya smokin'  
Niggas buzz you in the door but I blew it open  
Ya rhymes is trash that verse ain't worth a token  
Try to hop this, monotonous, murderous thoughts  
When I'm plottin' this, overthrow the government  
Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare  
Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs  
Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through  
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue  
Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin'  
My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion  
I'm ready for the showdown  
Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down  
I blow through your clique like Hurricane Floyd  
Keep rappers paranoid, kept your bodies in the game  
Is something I can't avoid, shit get tricky like Siegfried and Roy  
I seek and destroy  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
I'ma blaze y'all niggas and represent Queens  
Run up in ya cribs, fill ya tubs with gasoline  
Smash ya plaques, tie ya arms back  
What's ya worse nightmare, Black? I'm beyond that  
The mic, how I strike it, got 'em dialin' psychics  
Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it  
With niggas that's invited without recited, ignited  
It burn mad slow and that's why I'll easily light it  
Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited  
Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it  
You wanna get your ass smacked up  
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up  
But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up  
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up  
It's the L, nigga, dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head be  
And the rappers you idolized that idolized me  
I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea  
And Todd's Shop of Horrors, we battle to the death tonight  
There's no tomorrow, I'm out for revenge  
Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther  
Travel back in time, fill ya baby bottle with lava  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
This is how we put it down, this is Veteran's Day  
We work hard so we can play hard and push them big things  
Persistent, we keep comin' like some nigs  
Droppin' albums, every few years we rich  
We the best, we the vets  
We do this for the love, we thirst for that street shit  
It's P, nigga, check my record, it's flawless  
Do the knowledge to the chorus, yeah you fuckin' right  
While I was raised on my fuckin' life  
I did my time on them corners, now I lead the fuckin' life  
Large dollars, guns and ice  
Is nothin' you know my weight and the price of it  
You know how the Q dogs do cousin  
We don't follow trends, we set those so get up on it  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens got the vets  
Queens be the best  
Queens take ya heads  

Slow down baby uhh  
Slow down baby uhh  
  
You can get rugged, though, hard like P  
Trying to play my man but you couldn't touch me  
You faggot to comp rapper on a quest  
You get your head flown, boy you must be smokin' sens  
So many often wonder if MDs paid  
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way  
'Cause I clock Gs while you clock Zs  
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke M.C.s  
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take notes  
A rapper suffred from bleeding, sprains and slit throats  
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic  
Rapper choke like a curburetor, freeze up, and panic  
'Cause I clock pesos, don't sell ileyo  
Another name for cocaine, mi amigo  
That's Spanish terminology for friend  
Now sit back and rub my bozack as I send  
Bass funk with beats that thump  
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk  
My system cranking, my headlights are blinkin'  
Brother ridin' my tip, L, at the same time thinkin'  
Damn, how could a brother be so nice  
'Cause I'm the capital E-P twice M-D-E twice  
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight  
I like to write but then again some bite  
While you were bangin' on tables, I was bangin' Snow White  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
The ripper, the master, the overlordian  
Playing M.C.s like a old accordion  
I get the inspiration from a necessary station  
Them sayin' I was vacationin'  
You can't cope with your weak-ass throat  
Tryin' 'a sneak a peak in while I freak the notes  
Major M.C.s become minor B flats  
So retire the mike, get your chains and your bats  
Here's your chance to advance, gettin' your stance  
I'm 'a shoot the holster off your cowboy pants  
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment  
You're quilty, face down on the pavement  
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred  
You and your squad better praise the real god  
The undertaker droppin' thunder on fakers  
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka  
So lay the mike down slow and careful  
'Cause mine is fully loaded and I have another handful  
A clip to slip in and start rippin'  
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin'  
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds and so  
I'm down so that you clowns will know  
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated  
I got rhymes up the (huh) forget it, I'm constipated  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget  
I master on the beat down, my style's rugged  
When I attack the microphone, close the zone  
Rap sees danger, can't roam  
Security is packed and wall to wall can't fall  
A rap tank is full so I can't stall  
My microphone is filled with premium  
Any whack M.C. that flexes, I'm creamin' 'em  
Not with lotion, bust the motion, flotation  
When I'm rockin' the mike I'm like coastin'  
Underneath fatigue at my peak  
You still seek the style 'cause yours is extra weak  
New method, rip the stage at my age and get loose and kick  
Like Bruce in a rage-I'm on a rampage  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
Slow down baby

L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell  
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell  
I excel, they all fail  
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells  
  
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long  
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song  
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong  
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along  
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force  
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course  
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail  
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail  
Rock the bells  
  
The king of crowd rockers finally is back  
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax  
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap  
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap  
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way  
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J.  
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man  
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam  
Rock the bells  
  
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't  
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't  
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells  
All you washed up rappers want to do this well  
Rock the bells  
  
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not  
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot  
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader  
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator  
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels  
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile  
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater  
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator  
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed  
I go to the store and get Old Gold  
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back  
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked  
Rock the bells  
  
The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins  
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name  
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good  
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood  
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul  
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll  
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen  
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream  
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense  
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince  
Rock the bells  
  
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time  
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind  
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots  
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop  
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn  
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn  
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned  
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn  
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze  
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J.  
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells  
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well  
Rock the bells

All you do is rub my back  
Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back! Rub my back! Ohh!

Lay down for a while preety, relax a minute

Gave you that Mercedes, you better get up in it

You never seen a player flip your whole life  
Dip the Caddy on the freeway, hittin the strobe light

Uhh, Charles Jordan girl if you wanna take a hit  
Gotta? between the lippers this is it

Some call it trickin or ballin, depends on who you wit  
Him or L baby, so who you gonna pick  
Mack motor, I told ya, I want ya livin rich  
You don't know about a brother  
Blow around a brother, money flow around a brother  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: LL Cool J]  
Dont trip I know you like the rocks  
Wanna dip round the corner in the drop

[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Most thugs front when they get the chance (say what?)  
Some thugs hit the blunt when they get the chance (say what?)  
Live thugs stack chedder, then they make plans (say what?)  
  
I, Cool J, NY2K  
Rule milleniums with my compadres  
They tounges sway with really nothing to say  
They pack guns, but I stack funds  
I'm second to none  
My hot streak's just begun  
You want to bring beef? You got to serve it well-done  
You ran the wrong way, now you livin' on the run  
Not some, each one's a bum, every one  
Coughed up a lung, became my son  
Flames I brung, platinumn weighs a ton  
Heavy on the chest, I pitty all the rest  
I put 'em to the test  
I spit it like I'm blessed  
I testify  
I have no need to lie  
I buried many, still many want to die  
I zone out crazy, starin' don't faze me  
Got ya whole strategy shook  
It's too daisy  
  
[Chorus]  
Clack, relaod, clack, reload  
Got ya pictures sittin' in my lap  
He explode  
Duck when you hear the rat-tat-tat  
'Cause once you cross over baby, ain't no comin' back  
believe that  
I flows when I hit that  
Strive till I get that  
Never mind a set-back  
No time to wet that  
A lyrical hi-jack, you don't want to try that  
Creep wit' my CD, don't let 'em know you buy that  
One in the snips, one in the whip with the low jack  
Call a 911 to get the LL back  
Original bells, LL  
Rocked them till they fell  
Competition bailed  
Looked like mince green when mic had 'em swelled  
Wrote all them rhymes and never gonna sell  
Meanwhile, I'm countin' prezzies in the the 'tel  
And in the meanwhile, I throw my baby in Chanelle  
  
[Chorus]  
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on  
Unh, I'm lyrically hot tonight, come on  
Layin' low to catch you on stage so I can run on  
Matter fact, you not on my level, I throw my son on  
Mission is complete, technique is unique  
Defeat the rhyme weak and mine ya knee-deep  
Rewind a rip beats and give jeeps the heat  
Even if you walkin', wit' ya walkman in the street  
Actin' gassed up, but you really on need  
How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED?  
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up  
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up  
Put the L down, picked the other LL up  
Maybe we can straighten this out before it's toe-up  
Watch me closely, boom! I'm a blow-up  
And spend the whole rest of my life stackin' dough up  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoo, Vinnie Biggs, you hot with this one, dawg  
Roundtree  
Rock The Bells  
Unh, Brian Daughtery  
Unh, all my peeps, my peeps, my peeps across the land  
Know what I mean? we gonna keep gettin' paper  
This is real  
This is real, right here  
Rock The Bells  
It's deeper than the deepest blue sea, dawg  
Know what I'm sayin'?  
I'm feelin' it like you feelin' it  
ha ha, word up  
I'm lovin' it like you lovin' it baby  
Rewind it, it's short

Yellow canary, tennis bracelet necklace, knahmsayin?  
Three quarter black mink, shades, canaries in both ears  
Knahmsayin? Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood  
Gucci shoes, that's how I play  
  
Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps  
I was taught early on don't jeopardize the stacks  
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts  
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks  
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats  
To end up, crawlin' out of a hole in Iraq  
Try to topple my regime  
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen  
Is there a medic on the scene?  
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin'  
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in  
Slow down baby, you actin' like a clown homes  
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone  
You hear my heat rock comin' through your sheetrock  
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox  
I get my swagger on, proud as a peacock  
Bars is hot, beats is pumpin' like a ? box  
  
[Chorus]  
Shake it baby shake it  
If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Young ladies in the spot, if you came up in the place to rock, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby  
  
They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow  
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow  
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos  
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin' hollows  
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision  
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision  
It seems like greed's the world religion  
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons  
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes  
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die  
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers  
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years  
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be or not to be the man, that's the question  
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined  
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it  
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded  
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm  
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed  
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect  
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real  
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like I said  
Yellow canary tennis on the neck  
Three quarter black mink  
Gucci hat to the side, shades  
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans  
Black Phantom, oak wood  
That's how I play  
Yeah  
(Shake it baby shake it)  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby

I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick  
My talents spread around while I'm holdin' my dick  
My dingling shit flip emaculate  
Evolutionary flows y'all want more dough  
Make wit the best get the best all the rest hit 'em less  
Rip a nigga from the East to the West  
Just a lyrical maze lyrical days  
God works in mysterious ways  
I'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog  
Niggas ain't even comin' close to my low score  
Niggas fleein when I'm rippin' on the hard core beat  
That's slammin' through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back  
Nigga L never got rip by a track  
I don't fuck around, always come back  
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back  
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm  
A time-bomb blowin' up ring the alarm  
Cool double O flow well to the LL  
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell  
  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
  
To the next plateau niggas bet my flow  
Betta bet I role wit more control  
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who can't compete  
Spit razors to rip the beat  
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack  
Now off my back stack 'em drag 'em now feds waggin'  
Hear you fassen place on the blood of my veins without passion  
Mashin' take a little time to think the rhyme out  
How to find out  
Bump and grind out  
Pump the lines out  
I'ma show what the microphone is all about without doubt  
See to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo  
No I ain't checkin' for you bull shit demo  
Every time you hear me in a battle I'm lethal  
Nigga too sweet 'n low you ain't equal  
  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down (Get off me!, You can't hold me!)  
  
I can take you to the level if I let my phantom  
Nigga bout to rule the world wit one anthem  
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom  
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion  
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing  
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing  
I'ma murder every nigga in the game  
Can't stand the rain  
Fuck a maintain  
Gotta leave the world in flames  
Nigga want to live life stay out of my lanes  
Tryin' to read my name  
Here's a murderous combo wit you on your pain  
Sideways stimulator bringin' the flames  
Niggas want to feel me spit the whole clips  
Sing along it will split your lip  
45 wit' an name on the grip  
Niggas said you want to battle  
Nigga now talk shit  
  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)

Ah, ah  
  
I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothin' I can do  
  
Like an image passin' by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
(See it all so clearly)  
Answer me sincerely  
(Answer me sincerely)  
Was it a dream, a lie?  
  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through  
  
Like an image passin' by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
(See it all so clearly)  
Answer me sincerely  
(Answer me sincerely)  
Was it a dream, a lie?  
  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Yes, I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only

Yeah,  
Smoking, doping, keep your ears open  
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in  
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at  
And have em even saying how could someone say that  
They're as good as the man who just saw  
Please give me some more  
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping  
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n  
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers  
I'm snatching airplay, from all you AIDS catching singers  
It's a, special delivery on your front step  
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect  
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground  
And have you OD'n saying, y'know, J sound  
Righteous, the brother did what he had to  
I didn't talk about this, so I had you  
Sleeping, breathing saying yo he ain't keeping  
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend  
But here it is, the jam of all jams  
And from this day forth, MC's are getting slammed  
With the  
  
[Chorus]  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah!  
  
I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it  
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it  
Doing a dance in tight bike pants  
So get up on it (hoe!) you'll only get one chance  
To work out, the soreness in your muscles  
Do your own thing, even the hustle  
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known  
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone  
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner  
And look wild like you're tryin to get a part in a  
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip  
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin to flip  
With the  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving, grooving, admit that you've been  
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven  
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant  
All those rumors are small things to a giant  
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother  
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover  
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train  
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, "Wait James!"  
I do damage, use the beef to build a sandwich  
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, "How did you manage  
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?  
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed"  
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing  
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling  
On on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling  
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing  
To the  
  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
Know what I'm sayin?  
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh  
It's like a smooth joint, you know what I mean?  
Uhh, aww yeah!  
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Marvelous!

Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone  
'Cause right now it says that "We can't come to the phone"  
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
  
(It's ridiculous)  
It's been months and for some reason I just  
(Can't get over us)  
And I'm stronger than this  
  
(Enough is enough)  
No more walking round with my head down  
I'm so over being blue, crying over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory  
And now every song reminds me of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm  
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
(Leave me alone)  
Leave me alone  
(Stupid love songs)  
Don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
Turning off the radio  
  
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
Why can't I turn off the radio?

Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house  
  
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and  
Stick around while I defend my crown and  
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and  
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough  
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher  
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer  
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs  
And isn't motivated by green  
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and  
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and  
Makin' love like a medicine doctor  
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
  
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but  
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin'  
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you  
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to  
The conversation, sexy vibration  
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion  
Times are hard, I need a woman that rolls by God  
And the only man she loves is Todd  
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'  
Or could it be you never loved me at all and  
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent  
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement  
The reap reducer factor and  
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and  
Standin' by her man till the end  
Not only as a lover but a friend  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
  
Man, do things get better?  
We can look back at the whole aerators  
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it  
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and  
You held back when your loved jobs called in  
You had faith when they said they're not callin'  
You understood that what we had was good  
You stood by your man like a real queen should  
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as  
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and  
As long as I live on this earth  
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth  
  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby, (word)  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man (peace)  
You got to stand by your baby  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
You got to stand by your man  
You got to stand by your baby  
Stand by your, man, stand by your man  
You got to stand by your man

I didn't even know a young lady could look that good  
I'm ready the bounce outta queens and come to your hood  
I'm ready the change your life baby, spend some cash  
Because you got me chinky eyed like blunts mixed with hash  
When your in my Ferrari, look at the seats carve your ass  
L drive drunk baby, pass the glass  
As we run up in the club politician with thugs  
When your bra straps showin' baby girl it's love  
Cause you are the loose  
Token and sippin' honey poof  
Cause you are the loose  
Sweet as cranberry, peach snaps and apple-loops  
Runnin' with Queens finest all the way to the top  
Pass cars, hard dick and plenty money to shop  
  
[Chorus]  
Take it off,  
Come on and dance with me baby  
Take it off,  
There ain't nobody who can fade me  
Take it off,  
I'm on a hot-streak lately  
Take it off,  
You know that ass look crazy  
Take it off,  
You saw me up in that Mercedes  
Take it off,  
I know my crew look shady  
Take it off,  
You see me spendin' dubs baby  
Take it off,  
Watch me dance for you baby  
  
Wo day drive is live, Monte Carlo was ill  
Convertible limousines, def jam got the bill  
Remember R. Kelly had the house on the hill  
Well when the partys over we can go there and chill  
In London it's Big Ben style breakfast in bed  
In Paris you were on an Eifel Tower givin' me head  
Go to Switzerland, private jets over the house  
Come home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch  
Real niggas, nothin' but the platinum shit  
Keep that ass soakin wet, plus I'm spendin' his chips  
Who's fuckin' wit that, put your middle finger in the air  
Has a jet passion X-man playin' wit your hair  
  
[Chorus]  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
Dance for me baby  
  
To my man Black Jus baby RIP  
Accessory to the crime is the prime dogg three  
When we get the money baby, spreadin' the cream  
To tell your brother Joe to hold it down for Queens  
And to my cousin Will, hold ya head nigga chill  
J.T. Damon in the car let's get the squeals  
My nigga Big Bonny Puff, glad your home  
Rock the bells Melly Mell, Jimmy Love and Tone  
Baby we live cats, lookin' at where in we rides at  
Drug walls, hip-hop beats, how 'bout that  
The rest fell so far, they can't climb back  
Let's take it to the video-tape, rewind that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Take it off, greatest of all times.

Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin'  
  
Yeah alright  
But we need a beat that they can front to  
Oh, that'll work  
Be funky  
You know what I'm sayin'?  
  
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)  
(Cars ride by)  
  
Funky  
For all the cars out there  
And all the brothers  
That like to front in their rides  
Check it out  
  
You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say  
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay  
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around  
12 o'clock at night with your windows down  
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain  
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain  
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots  
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots  
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere  
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare  
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back  
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack  
Cause they don't understand why I act this way  
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day  
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by  
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly  
  
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me  
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently  
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this  
Mind your business  
Now pass it around  
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound  
People in the street see me bobbin my head  
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said  
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know  
The backseat of my car is like a disco show  
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone  
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne  
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top  
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock  
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming  
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming  
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling  
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling  
A right-hand man's here without the swing  
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings  
I can keep it up until the break of dawn  
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond  
  
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow  
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window  
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n  
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n  
That means I'm chilling  
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed  
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy  
I got the gangster tapes in the place  
Like a base-head would say I want bass  
I want a hit, I want a dose  
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close  
Cos my system is pumping loud  
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd  
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE  
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD  
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk  
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk  
  
You know what I'm saying  
Word  
So next time you're in your ride pumping it up  
Just remember  
It's Cool  
  
Peace

Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town  
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around  
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand  
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?  
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place  
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face  
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games  
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame  
Movies, records, goin' on tour  
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor  
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill  
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill  
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God  
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top  
It's harder harder than hard  
All the suckers are barred  
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred  
See the problem is you want what another man has  
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz  
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own  
Cause when you're rich you got friends  
But when you're poor you're alone  
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul  
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old  
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me  
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?  
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree  
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three  
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life  
You'll say "I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife"  
Every day is a chase, every day is a race  
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass  
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace  
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face  
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed  
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead  
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime  
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme  
Lead you to that ticket line  
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine  
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young  
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung  
Not that I killed him, it's just  
He didn't want to trust  
The words of a master that's why you must  
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear  
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear  
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest  
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best  
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight  
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right  
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck  
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck  
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone  
Tellin' all you punk ducks "Leave me the hell alone"  
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks  
Straight up and down, no special effects  
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean  
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens  
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give  
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives  
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan  
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'  
Here I am, tellin' the truth  
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth  
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam  
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans  
All you petty MC's in the state of New York  
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk  
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'  
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'  
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer  
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar  
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire  
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire  
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park  
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark  
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound  
L.L. Cool J, the baddest around.

Yeah, Hell yeah, word up  
Yeah, Hell yeah, hell yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm the G.O.A.T.  
The greatest of all time (coo-coo, coo, Cool J)  
The greatest of all time (LL)  
The greatest of All Time (coo, coo, Cool J)  
the greatest of all time  
I'm the G.O.A.T.  
the greatest of all time (coo-coo, coo, Cool J)  
the greatest of all time (LL)  
the greatest of all time (Cool J)  
I'm the greatest of all time  
  
I was on the movie set, then he hit me on the cell  
Niggas out here talk bout the King of Rap fell  
Fell where? Don't these niggas know I'm LL?  
Lemme run it throughout this album, tell Speilberg "Chill"  
My jet hit LaGuardia six in the morn  
They be waitin' in the Bentley when the plane takes on  
Straight to the studio dirty, no shower  
Threw out 5 mics in the first half hour  
Niggas know, who about to get all the dough (LL)  
Who about to hit all your homes (LL)  
Who about to spit all the flows  
That's all I can say, and I can't stands no more (We know)  
Alright then, what the fuck the deal yo?  
I's raised on some ill shit, let's be real  
Uptown, the Bronx, and Brooklyn and Queens  
Staten Island, Jersey, ya know the routine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
East Coast, y'all want it, y'all got it  
Look up in my eyes, a nigga feeling psychotic  
Look outside nigga, my cars excited  
Look at the crowd, how they respond to my product  
Like ecstasy, my crew's next to me  
It's my destiny, to make history  
I'm the emperor, Rap King  
From the streets of Paris, up north to Sing-Sing  
One question: Do I do my thing thing? (Hell Yeah)  
Then putcha L's in the air, for the Greatest Rapper All Time  
You want that other nigga album  
But that nigga bought all mine  
So get the realness  
Matter fact turn it up so you can feel this  
Ice grill all you want, I'm fearless  
Nigga, you just blue try, you can't appeal this  
I'm about to kill this  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(LL Cool J is) Break it down  
(Hard as)  
  
Feel it, yeah, blow ya whistles, yeah  
Sss, you can't fuck wit me, nigga  
Feel it  
Fuck wrong wit you?  
  
I wrote so ill that I sold ten mill  
Drop more platinum, to fo' mo' bills  
You pop mo' shit, I show mo' skill  
Greatest of All Time, and that's all real  
Ain't no reappear could do what I do  
Rip ya whole label solo, no crew  
Ain't a MC that I can't go thought  
And I only have respect for a chosen few  
But they could get it too  
Trust me, you don't want L to spit at you  
I'm the one they call when shit gets critical  
The way I conquer the world is spiritual  
I'm imperial  
Everlasting, the best who ever did it  
Holding the crown down, can't nobody get it  
Germany, Italy, France, Japan  
London, Africa, bow to The Master, The G.O.A.T.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
LL Cool J is hard as

Something real smooth  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah  
We'll get into the groove  
Power of God move  
Something real smooth  
Something you need to take heed to  
  
A base-head cleaned up his act  
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back  
Decided, he could find a much better way to live  
You know the way, positive  
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs  
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs  
Never before was a man so far behind  
And came back to rule for a long time  
Positive will explode when you light me  
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly  
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred  
When they felt the power of God  
  
Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came  
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain  
He doesn't understand the power of a ?  
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team  
Avenging angels will come and burn  
All those who saw, but refused to learn  
He has no color, no shape, and no form  
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm  
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard  
You can feel the power of God  
  
Money is small and the soul stands tall  
All those who don't realize this, fall  
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool  
And it's cool to be in school  
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift  
Your mind is a gift  
You're somebody, whether you know it or not  
Outside the weather is hot  
People walk around with their minds in a daze  
Never take the time to stop and give praise  
You're lucky to live in this world  
Even the starving boys and girls  
Cause life is a gift in itself  
And only certain people are blessed with good health  
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd  
I can feel the power of God  
  
You know I'm sayin  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Yeah  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
The power of God  
Yeah  
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em  
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em  
Shape em, and make em take form  
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm  
Harmless and innocent  
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant  
This mentality gotta be erased by faith  
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th  
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge  
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college  
It's not about being black or white  
It's about everybody being a right  
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard  
He felt the power of God  
  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Power of god  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
That was just a word to the wise  
Up rise  
Cause we definitely gotta unify  
And we need unity in times like these  
We got to stick together  
Cause we as a people  
All people  
Gotta make it to the promised land  
Peace

With the thought that you are right

[Chorus:]

Hot, fire, hot  
  
[Chorus]  
L! Who bring you the hotness?  
L! Yo, you don't want to start with  
L! Forever keeping it locked  
It's now time to rock with, L! throw your L's up  
  
Don't ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper  
Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker  
Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker  
I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha  
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture  
But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha  
I'm willing and able, to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel  
The legend is real, I'm not a fable  
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable  
If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table  
I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua  
Who's the nicest? (L, you are!)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You don't want it with L, b'ship cats'll get banged out  
Put your flow throw a filter boy, shake the old slang out  
23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out  
Makin' MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out  
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out  
My temp seizing, perfect reason to blow the game out  
Skating off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me  
But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya, yeah, gladly  
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?  
Y'all want to keep going platinum, y'all don't want to disappear?  
Stop bopping backstage like you causing me fear  
Cause you starting to get on my nerves, and that's a problem  
The vet's in here  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Tension on the mic, halftime highlights  
L Boogie banging on 'em, jumpin' through the skylight  
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight  
I'm just spitting, when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight  
Alright? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious  
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this  
Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous  
So, throwing your joint at my car was spontaneous  
Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it  
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked  
Forever I will be, the one they came to see  
Blowing mics in half baby, who else could it be but  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
I'm so hot (yeah)  
We so hot (yeah)  
You so hot (I'm so hot)  
Feel it hot (yeah)  
Are you hot (you make me hot)  
I know I'm hot (oh)  
Are you hot (yes I'm hot)  
I know I'm hot, feel it! (yeah)

No question about it  
Queens represent!  
Uh! say what?  
Queens represent! Yeah  
Come on!  
Get down baby, down down down down down now!  
Queens represent!  
Are you down now  
(Are ya's down now)  
  
[Chorus]  
You want to get paid? You want to get laid?  
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways  
Live your life in an ill real way  
Got 6 rides in your little drive-way  
You get mad puff-lie all day  
Make plans with your crime family  
Get money money, take money money  
Get money money, take money money  
  
By age 19 Tyheim is turned out  
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth  
Cop the aberrettes  
Orange and Blue  
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew  
Black superstar, Jesus piece  
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast  
Some bust blocks, feared on the block  
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top  
Drug money flowin'  
Jealousy is growin'  
Paranoia got him second guessin'  
D-T's on his back got him stressin'  
He was at the light blazin' up traum  
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon  
Ten slugs in the door made him fall  
Guess he should of never hustled at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My man Tay-Kwan like the chicks a lot  
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot  
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop  
5 baby mothers  
1 live on my block  
Shinin' in the club  
Chickens showin' love  
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs  
He a real pretty cat  
He get from his moms  
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb  
His games top notch, and he don't stop  
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot  
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks  
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick  
Met a little shorty, brought her back to Queens  
Honey got the virus, you know the routine  
Not only did he walk away with the HIV  
Her man's jealous, jooked him rediculously  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yolanda's always got a scream  
Credit cards in ATM machines  
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest  
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death  
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet  
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat  
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs  
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs  
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid  
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid  
Now she 23 full blown in the mix  
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips  
She down for whatever, as long as it pays  
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed  
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug  
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up  
Take a slug  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get paid mommy, come on, come on  
Get paid mommy, come on, come on  
Get paid mommy, come on, come on  
Get paid mommy, come on, come on  
Get paid mommy, come on, come on  
  
Nigga's they wellin' they just don't know  
It be LL and 83rd rocking the show  
Now nigga's they front, they just don't know  
But nigga's want to stick they ball in that hole

I know the Lord, will make a way  
He will make a way, yes he will  
Yes, he will  
  
Oh, I do believe that we will make it  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Uh uh  
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems  
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton  
Stress beamin' down like the sun I felt rotten  
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin'  
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him  
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up  
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders  
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya  
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar  
I tried to told ya, he he he  
Enemies gunnin', true believers ain't runnin'  
Or duckin', we ain't scared of nothin', ya feel me?  
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?  
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh  
Yeah, uh, check it out  
There's a living power, make a man out a coward  
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers  
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured  
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters  
Time to shout it, sing it louder  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, we're gonna make it  
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)  
Thank God we made it (yeah)  
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
I was feelin' like my whole world was spinnin' and spillin'  
On the ground and that God wasn't willin'  
It seemed like the only ones ballin' was the villains  
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chillin'  
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em  
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim  
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em  
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'  
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning  
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'  
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up  
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up  
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up  
Get your life lined up before time's up  
Yo, yo, you know what?  
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack  
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back  
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that  
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back  
Uh, yeah, sing it out now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley  
Never give up, press on through the storm  
Weepin' man fall, for the night seem long  
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'  
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah  
I know it feels like your back's to the wall  
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call  
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin' off  
But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost  
Stay on your course, carry your cross  
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'  
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it  
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits  
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks  
And I'm not finished, man listen  
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus  
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces  
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us  
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors  
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
We made it, we made it  
Through the storm and rain, yeah  
You can make it, yes you can  
You can make it, you got me  
I know you can, I know you can  
I know you can, yes, yeah  
I do believe we'll make it (Hallelujah!)  
(Glory! Glory!)

Haha  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Girl)  
Hey nigga what yo hood like?

[Ll Cool J]  
I am the most incredible  
I ain't disrespectin, just spittin my track record  
Way before 'Pac and B. I. G., I did it big  
Way before Hova, ll was a casanova  
Way before Nas, I had my first menage  
Way before T. I., I taught him how to be fly  
Way before Nelly, I was up in the telly  
Before J. D., I was 'Jingling Baby'  
Before Lil' Jon, I put the south on  
Before Ludacris, Ya boy was doin this  
Before Snoop Dogg, I put rappers in the morgue  
Before Dr. Dre, I was hot in L. A.  
Before 50 Cent, I was sittin on ends  
A young buck ridin in a 560 Benz  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Ll Cool J]  
I been doin this a long time man, I'm tired of gettin money  
On second thought...  
Before Master P, I was bout it bout it B  
Before Cash Money, I already stashed money  
Before dmx, I was wild on the set  
Momma Should Knock 'em out, I lay 'em on the deck  
Before Wu Tang, I was the new thang  
I whispered on shorty ear before Ying Yang  
Before Mobb Deep, I had 'em shook over the beat  
Years before Busta, I had my first customer  
I was little L before Big L  
Before E-40, my name, shit was naughty  
Before Diddy, all my whips was pretty  
Lil' wild nigga from Queens runnin through the city  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Ll Cool J]  
But I can't talk to greasy  
Gotta keep it real, ya know  
Grandmaster was flashin way before I cashed in  
Ya man Bambaata made the park jams hotter  
Ya man Elle El couldn't go outside  
When ya boy Melle Mel had the pimped out ride  
Way before me, Kurtis Blow stacked dough  
He ruled the world, I was in the front row  
Run-D. M. C. Showed me what I wanna be  
I got kicked out the studio by Kool Moe Dee  
The Cold Crush Four and the Treacherous Three  
Ain't give a damn about a snotty nose kid like me  
Houdhini, The Fat Boys and all that  
I hit 'em on the jack, them niggas never called back  
  
[Chorus: 2x]  
  
[Outro:]  
I want to dedicate the song  
To everybody who came before me  
And everybody that they came after me  
If I ain't matchin' you  
Blame it on a head not the heart  
This is real  
Ll Cool J in the building baby  
Hey yo 50  
You know you're my favorite gangsta right  
Hahaha  
Yeah we gettin' this  
Just keep gettin' money baby  
Hip hop for life you heard me?  
My name is ll Cool J!  
Better known is the truth  
Oh!

He man, I've seen ya,  
Think ya rockin' it on the floor,  
You look like a moron!  
Who let you in the door?  
To put the question bluntly  
Maybe your feet's deformed.  
They should slap you in the teeth  
When you put your dancing shoes on.  
You can't dance!  
  
Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?  
Homeboy, what's the use?  
Anytime you wanna step aside a party,  
First think of an excuse.  
You dance like a fat old lady  
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,  
But every time you try to get one move right.  
The old lady then did it twice.  
You can't dance!  
  
You've been a dancing disco disaster,  
The worst I ever saw.  
They should dropkick you on the neck  
And drag you off the floor.  
In every discotheque, I see you there  
In the middle of the crowd,  
Looking like you got eight or nine  
Left feet dragging all around.  
You can't dance!  
  
Take my advice, don't move!  
You'll never get the knack.  
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party  
And wouldn't be coming back.  
On the floor you're a dinosaur,  
Yeah boy, that's how you move.  
You look like Ralph Cramden or a Donald Duck cartoon.  
You can't dance!  
  
You wanna come to my party?  
I wouldn't give you a chance.  
You tried to take break-dance lessons,  
Ended up in an ambulance.  
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?  
You dance like you got arthritis already,  
What'll happen when you get old?  
You can't dance!  
  
Why are you so stiff?  
Is it something that your mother did?  
Maybe you grew up around "can't dance" people  
When you were a "can't dance" kid.  
You live in a "can't dance" house,  
Went out in a "can't dance" car,  
Your doofy "can't dance" father  
Got drunk in a "can't dance" bar.  
You take a "can't dance" bath,  
Put on your "can't dance" cologne.  
Go out to a "can't dance" party  
So you wouldn't have to "can't dance" all alone.  
You can't dance!  
  
Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?

The momentum of this party can only increase  
The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece  
You'll want to kick steps to the musical feast  
And witness the force I'm about to release  
You'll rock!  
  
I'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs  
In case you're unaware my beats are always strong  
I'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you  
with one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through  
I'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J  
I'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say  
Experienced, rhyme skilled, plus my voice isn't waxed  
Funky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts  
I'll dust a rapper off if I require practice  
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus  
Choreographer of rhymes, best of all times  
Composition technician with the be -boy's mind  
Terrorizin' emcee's instructions in my path  
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph  
I'm the mic dominater, best of all times  
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'ma tell you the mean behind the scratchin' sounds  
He's Cut-Creator, Philly-Philly as the DJ crown  
Me and him are imitatin' but never underatin'  
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated  
The mission ain't complete without the use of his hands  
He makes my rhymes so fresher, my beat expands  
So I'll like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him  
A Five Man Crew, me and him will defeat them  
He'll scratch and wipe out all foes  
Turntable terrorizin' and I think you should know  
That were, high calibered and my names' J  
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day  
To ring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer  
I have to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player  
Materials royal, I'm a'nating all  
Like brown with dimples and I'm six-feet tall  
And promoter of recordings that I call my own  
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home  
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears  
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare  
Emcee, a sucker natter and I just won't stop  
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock  
I'm a lyrical game on the heels of fame  
And the world is glad that Cool J came  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street  
You think about it everytime that you hear this beat  
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard  
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard  
See I'm loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal  
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel  
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J  
In the center of it all is a cute 3-A  
Forty-seven will surrender till emcee's in fear  
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here  
Quick as L's on my face I will hold my space  
And to taste, stimulate, and conduct the bait  
You'll rock!  
  
Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission  
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician  
Jammin' up the board at the rappin' commission  
Soul inventor of this composition  
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could  
Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldn't write this good  
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army  
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me  
Super bad, cold-crushed, number one be -boy  
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy  
Crown-Prince of rappin', Godfather of bees  
Emcee's that need a new lady to feed  
You'll rock!  
  
You know I'm sayin'? Break!  
You know I'm sayin'? Break! Break! Break two!

Do you remember, the first time you fell in love  
The way it felt, the way it feels  
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart  
I love you for real  
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat  
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still  
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em  
Oh what a thrill!  
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true  
They came strolling along  
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart  
I swear, I'll never do you wrong  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Nothing in the world could separate the two  
And even though you've only known that person for a short time  
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart  
  
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK  
You're too young to be so serious  
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you  
And walk away aggravated and furious  
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter  
The relationship's yours  
You feel you're maturing, and hey,  
You can fight your own battles and wars  
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them  
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm  
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging  
And keeping each other warm  
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love  
Believe me, it ain't a easy task  
We'd have one argument too many  
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?  
  
Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart  
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what  
You run out the door, I tell you come back  
I love you, you shout out, so what?  
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me  
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?  
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain  
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right  
And held you tight, every night  
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?  
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me  
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you  
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart  
That's right I admit it  
  
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go  
I struggle and fight for you against all odds  
Get down on my knees, and pray to God  
That our love is in the cards  
Cause I know you're right for me  
And I know I'm right for you  
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands  
People say forget about it, move on  
But see they don't understand  
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me  
So much in fact that I'd give my life  
To stare into your eyes and caress your face  
As the priest, announces us man and wife  
We'd live happily, ever after  
White picket fence and the whole nine yards  
And anything that anybody said  
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart  
  
So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind  
I'm begging you baby please come back home  
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed  
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones  
This can't be true, I'm losing you  
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright  
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight  
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried  
Now it's up to you baby, please understand  
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything  
Just let me take ya by the hand  
And lead ya, baby I got ya  
Protect you like a mother, protects a child  
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while  
You're my heart
