Standing in a queue of a school canteen  
Guys on the corner they were laughin' at me  
But I don't mind if they see it all  
You know I gotta come clean  
I gotta come clean  
I got a crush on you  
  
My mind don't need it but my body do  
A little bit of loving and attention for you  
Although we're only strangers  
They don't need to know  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta cum clean  
Ooh, I got a crush on you  
  
I want to get serious right away  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
What you doin' today or any other day?  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
Just one look and I go insane  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
  
Your daddy never comes to get you  
Cause lives so far away  
But his I-talian chauffeur shows up every day  
But I'll get you in the corner, I'll get you all  
alone  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta come clean  
  
I got a crush on you  
  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
I said one-two  
I got a crush on you  
  
Why should I get a crush on yet?

Friday or Saturday, what does that mean  
Short space of time needs a heavy scene  
Monday is coming like a jail on wheels  
  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight  
Thrills  
Forty eight thrills  
  
So tell me an' I'll take the tube  
You know a girl, yeah well she's bound to be rude  
Can't get nothing at the places I've been  
  
I've combed this town from top to bottom  
I try to get around but my legs are broken  
Every time I miss it 'cause I ain't got a ticket  
  
Forty eight hours needs forty eight thrills  
Kicking for kicks

Are you ready for  
Are you ready for  
War  
War  
War  
  
High above the satellites  
View the Earth  
(???) nights  
Europe switches off those lights  
  
Are you ready for  
War, all in all this sentimental  
War, wall to wall with the regimental  
War, with all the things continental  
Are you red  
  
War  
War  
War  
  
There's no use runnin' a mobile home  
Everywhere is a target zone  
Hell is ringing on the red, red phone  
  
Are you ready for  
  
War, all that is futuristic  
War, all that is realistic  
War, all that will be ballistic  
Are you red  
  
War  
War  
War  
  
Are you ready for  
Are you ready for  
  
Vodka chilled in the Kremlin bar  
Ride on the rocky (???) and hold my arm  
Raise my glass and break it on the bar  
  
Are you ready for  
War, all in all this sentimental  
War, wall to wall with the regimental  
War, with all the things continental  
Are you red  
  
Are you ready for  
War  
War  
War

Stay around don't play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
A lot of people won't get no justice tonight  
The battle is gettin' hotter  
In this iration, Armagideon time  
  
A lot of people runnin' and a hiding tonight  
A lot of people won't get no justice tonight  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you - Armagideon time...

My daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He just loved to live that way  
And he loved to steal your money  
  
Some is rich, and some is poor  
That's the way the world is  
But I don't believe in lying back  
Sayin' how bad your luck is  
  
So we came to jazz it up  
We never loved a shovel  
Break your back to earn your pay  
An' don't forget to grovel  
  
The old man spoke up in a bar  
Said I never been in prison  
A lifetime serving one machine  
Is ten times worse than prison  
  
Imagine if all the boys in jail  
Could get out now together  
Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?  
While we was being clever  
  
Someday you'll meet your rocking chair  
'Cause that's where we're spinning  
There's no point to want to comb your hair  
When it's grey and thinning  
  
Run rabbit run  
Strike out boys, for the hills  
I can find that hole in the wall  
And I know that they never will

Driiiiiiiive!!!  
Driiiiiiiive!!!  
  
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac  
Yes she did!  
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac  
She said, "Hey, come here, Daddy!"  
"I ain't never comin' back!"  
  
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?  
C'mon, sugar, just come on back to me  
She said, "Balls to you, Big Daddy."  
She ain't never coming back!  
  
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?  
Oh c'mon, just hear my plea  
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy."  
She ain't coming back to me  
  
Baby, baby drove up in a Cadillac  
I said, "Jesus Christ! Where'd you get that cadillac?"  
She said, "Balls to you, big Daddy."  
She ain't never coming back!  
She ain't never coming back!  
She ain't never coming back!

Yes, its time for the dr. goebbels  
Show!  
  
There's a tower in the heart of london  
With a radio station right at the top  
They don't make the city beat  
They're making all the action stop  
  
A long time ago there were pirates  
Beaming waves from the sea  
But now all the stations are silenced  
'cause they ain't got a government license  
  
Want to tell your problems  
Phone in from your bedsit room  
Having trouble with your partner  
Let us all in on the news  
  
If you want to hear a record  
Get the word from aiden day  
He picks all the hits to play  
To keep you in your place all day  
  
Capital radio  
In tune with nothing  
Don't touch that dial

[Chorus:]  
Charlie don't surf and we think he should  
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good  
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlie's gonna be a napalm star  
  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Must be something we get from birth  
One truth is we never learn  
Satellites will make space burn  
  
We've been told to keep the strangers out  
We don't like them starting to hang around  
We don't like them all over town  
Across the world we are going to blow them down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The reign of the super powers must be over  
So many armies can't free the earth  
Soon the rock will roll over  
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola  
  
It's a one a way street in a one horse town  
One way people starting to brag around  
You can laugh, put them down  
These one way people gonna blow us down  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Charlie don't surf he'll never learn  
Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun  
Charlie don't surf think that he should  
Charlie don't surf we really think he should  
Charlie don't surf  
  
Charlie don't surf and we think he should  
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good  
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlie don't surf

I have been a washer up  
An' he has been a scrubber up  
An' I seen him a picking up  
Dog ends in the rain  
An' he has never read a book  
Though I told him to take a look  
He lifted his pool hall cue  
For another game  
But it ain't no modern miracle  
That we found the golden rule  
What you can't buy you gotta steal  
An' what you say can't steal you better leave  
  
I don't like to hang about  
In this lonely room  
'Cause London is for going out  
And trying to hear a tune  
But people come pouncing up to me  
And say what are you doing here  
You're supposed to be a star  
Not a cheapskate bleeding queer  
  
Like a load of rats from a sinking ship  
You slag us down to save your hip  
But you don't give me the benefit  
Of your doubt  
'Cause I'll bite it off and spit it out  
  
We're cheapskates anything'll do  
We're cheapskates what are we supposed to do?  
An' we can rock  
Hey hey let's roll  
An' we can walk  
An' do the stroll  
  
Just because we're in a group  
You think we're stinking rich  
'N we all got model girls  
Shedding every stitch  
'N You think the cocaine's flowing  
Like a river up our noses  
'N every sea will part for us  
Like the red one did for Moses  
  
Well I hope you make it one day  
Just like you always said you would some day  
And I'll get out my money and make a bet  
That I'll be seein' you down the launderette

An' I want to move the town to the Clash city rockers  
You need a little jump of electrical shockers  
You better leave town if you only want to knock us  
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash city rockers  
  
You see the rate they come down the escalator  
Now listen to the tube train accelerator  
Then you realize that you got to have a purpose  
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later  
  
So don't complain about your useless employment  
Jack it in forever tonight  
Or shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it  
Think of all the money you've got  
  
An' I want to liquefy everybody gone dry  
Or plug into the aerials that poke up in the sky  
Or burn down the suburbs with the half-closed eyes  
You won't succeed unless you try  
  
You owe me a move say the bells of St. Groove  
Come on and show me say the bells of Old Bowie  
When I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter  
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I  
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I  
  
An' I want to move the town to the Clash city rockers  
You need a little jump of electrical shockers  
You better leave town if you only want to knock us  
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash city rockers  
Rock rock Clash city rockers

They said release 'Remote Control'  
But we didn't want it on the label  
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"  
The people laughed but the press went mad  
  
Ooh ooh ooh someone's really smart  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, that's a laugh  
  
On the last tour my mates couldn't get in  
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again  
At every hotel we was met by the Law  
Come for the party - come to make sure!  
  
Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song  
  
They said we'd be artistically free  
When we signed that bit of paper  
They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee  
An' worry about it later  
  
Ooh ooh ooh I'll never understand  
Ooh ooh ooh complete control - lemme see your other hand!  
  
All over the news spread fast  
They're dirty, they're filthy  
They ain't gonna last!  
  
This is Joe Public speaking  
I'm controlled in the body, controlled in the mind  
  
Total  
See-o-n control - that means you!

Rebels on the corner  
Rebels to the core  
Got a million dollar question  
What is livin' for?  
  
Hey! Man can scratch a livin'  
In a fat man's city class  
The teacher is survival  
But soon the present will be the past  
  
So!  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool on the street  
Be cool under heat  
  
When you're rockin' down  
On a cold hard night  
Pitiless eyes of the cityless souls  
Narrow in the lights  
  
Sorrow upon sorrow  
Go ganging up in your head  
You can leave it till tomorrow  
If you can balance on the edge  
  
Hey!  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool on the street  
Be cool under heat  
  
When the baby and you got to fight  
Go cool your love in the rain  
When the match refuses to strike  
Show that you really are in pain  
  
I'm giving you a warning  
Gonna burn those blue suede shoes  
Swagger in the mornin'  
Prints up front page news  
  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool under heat  
Be cool on the street  
Be cool under heat

Deny  
You're such a liar  
You won't know the truth if it hits you in the eye  
Deny  
You're such a liar  
You're selling your no-no all the time  
  
An' you said we were going out  
To the 100 club  
Then you said it ain't my scene  
But then you turned up alone  
Then you turned up alone  
  
Then you said you'd given it up  
Gone an' kicked it in the head  
You said you ain't had none for weeks  
But baby I seen your arms  
Baby I seen your arms  
  
Do you think I'm a raving idiot?  
Just got off the boat  
Step in line, sign this form - you ain't got a hope  
Baby ain't got a hope - you ain't got a hope  
  
What a liar - deny  
What a liar

When Johnny comes  
Marching home again  
He's coming by bus or underground  
A woman's eye will shed a tear  
To see his face so beaten in fear  
An' it was just around the corner in the English civil war  
  
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists  
When that well-known face got beaten to bits  
Your face was blue in the light of the screen  
As we watched the speech of an animal scream  
The new party army was marching right over our heads  
  
Alright  
  
There you are, ha ha, I told you so  
Says everybody that we know  
But who hid a radio under the stairs  
An' who got caught out on their unawares?  
When that new party army came marching right up the stairs  
  
When johnny comes marching home again  
Nobody understands it can happen again  
The sun is shining an' the kids are shouting loud  
But you gotta know it's shining through a crack in the cloud  
And the shadows keep falling when Johnny comes marching home

Why do these boys stand in groups  
Are they urban tribes of fighting troops

The mini cab  
The driver is black  
This time of night  
You better sit in the back  
  
Got a few smokes  
Under your hat  
The cops are lookin' out  
For the petrol on the black  
  
This time I think  
So what the hell  
There's that female  
I know too well  
  
Why should I lean  
Get out my mind again  
I ridin' in the back alone  
The stranger rides again  
  
To see my lovely town  
That always brings you down  
Where every drifter drifts  
For many miles around  
  
We take a casual drive  
For two miles up the road  
The cops pull us over  
And search right through our clothes  
  
They give him hell  
They check him on the air  
I sit there with the drugs in my hair  
  
As soon as I get home  
I call Heathrow  
Want a standby fare to Borneo

Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun  
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue  
But they told no one where they had begun  
Four horsemen  
  
They were given all the foods of vanity  
And all the instant promises of immortality  
But they bit the dust screamin' insanity!  
Four horsemen  
  
One was over the edge, one was over the cliff  
One was lickin' 'em dry with a bloody great spliff  
When they picked up the hiker he didn't want the lift  
From the horsemen  
  
But you!  
You're not searching, are you now?  
You're not looking anyhow  
You're never gonna ride that lonely mile  
Or put yourself up on trial  
Oh, you told me how your life was so bad  
An' I agree that it does seem sad  
But that's the price that you gotta pay  
If you're lazing all around all day  
Four horsemen coming right through  
Four horsemen and they're pissing by you  
They make you look like you're wearing a truss  
Four horsemen and it's gonna be us  
  
Well they gave us everything for bending the mind  
And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blind  
It's a long way to the finish so don't get left behind  
By those horsemen  
  
And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun  
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue  
But we still told nothing 'bout what was to come  
Four horsemen

Back in the garage with my bullshit detector  
Carbon monoxide making sure it's effective  
People ringing up making offers for my life  
But I just want to stay in the garage all night  
  
We're a garage band  
We come from garageland  
  
Meanwhile things are hotting up in the West End alright  
Contracts in the offices, groups in the night  
My bummin' slummin' friends have all got new boots  
An' someone just asked me if the group would wear suits  
  
I don't want to hear about what the rich are doing  
I don't want to go to where the rich are going  
They think they're so clever, they think they're so right  
But the truth is only known by guttersnipes  
  
There's twenty-two singers! But one microphone  
Back in the garage  
There's five guitar players! But one guitar  
Back in the garage  
Complaints! Complaints! Wot an old bag  
Back in the garage  
All night

I would love to be the lucky one on chill  
Avenue  
Who could keep your heart warm when ice has turned it blue  
But with the beggin' sleeping losers as they turn in for the night  
I'm looking back for home and I can see the lights  
  
I should be jumpin' shoutin' that I made it all this way  
From Camden Town station to Fortieth and Eighth  
Not many make it this far and many say we're great  
But just like them we walk on an' we can't escape our fate  
Can't you hear the sighing  
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue  
Both say they needed something new  
  
So I'm standing at the gates of the west  
I burn money at the lights of the sign  
The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime  
I'm standing at the gates of the east  
I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend  
The city casts a shadow, will I see you again?  
  
The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years  
Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers  
Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates  
He's telling the waitress he's great  
  
Ah say I know somewhere back'n'forth in time  
Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine  
Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday  
There's a move into the future for the USA.  
  
I hear them crying  
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue  
Both said they needed something new  
  
Standing at the gates of the west  
In the shadow again  
I'm standing at the gates of the west  
In the shadow again

Do the worm on the Acropolis  
Slam dance the cosmopolis  
Enlighten the populace  
  
Hungry darkness of living  
Who will thirst in the pit?  
Hooked in metropolis  
She spent a lifetime deciding  
How to run from it  
Addicts of metropolis  
Once fate had a witness  
And the years seemed like friends  
Girlfriends  
Her babies can dream  
But dreams begin like the end  
Shot into eternity  
Methadone kitty  
Iron serenity  
  
Ghetto defendant  
It is heroin pity  
Not tear gas nor baton charge  
That stops you taking the city  
  
Strung out committee  
Walled out of the city  
Clubbed down from uptown  
Sprayed pest from the nest  
Run out to barrio town  
The guards are itchy  
Forced to watch at the feast  
Then sweep up the night  
Flipped pieces of coin  
Broken bottles  
Exchanged for birthright  
Grafted in a jiffy  
  
Strung out committee  
Sitting pretty  
Graphed in a jiffy  
No pity, pretty  
  
The ghetto prince of gutter poets  
Was bounced out of the room  
Jean Arthur Rimbaud  
By the bodyguards of greed  
For disturbing the tomb  
1873  
His words like flamethrowers  
Paris commune  
Burnt the ghettos in their chests  
His face was painted whiter  
And he was laid to rest  
Died in Marseilles  
Buried in Charleville  
Shut up  
  
Soap floods oil in water  
All churn in the wake  
On the great ship of progress  
The crew can't find the brake  
Klaxons are blaring  
The admiral snores command  
Submarines boil in oceans  
While the armies fight with suns

The High Street shops are boarded up  
An' the terrace it is fenced in  
See-through shields are walled across  
The way that you came in  
But there's no need to get excited  
  
As the lorries bring the bacon in  
'cause the housewives are all singing  
Groovy times are here again  
  
They discovered one black Saturday  
That mobs don't march they run  
So you can excuse the nervous triggerman  
Just this once for jumping the gun  
As they were picking up the dead  
Out of the broken glass  
Yes it's number one, the radio said  
Groovy times have come to pass!  
  
Groovy times groovy times groovy times  
  
The intake is on the uptake  
The acceleration's pretty grim  
I can remember his first appearance  
Now look what's happened to him  
So they put him in a dog suit  
Like from 1964  
The king of early evening TV  
Groovy times forever more  
  
Groovy times

I swear by Almighty God  
To tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth  
  
Guns guns  
They torture all the women and children  
Then they've put the men to the gun  
'cause across the human frontier  
Freedom's always on the run  
  
Guns guns a-shaking in terror  
Guns guns killing in error  
Guns guns guilty hands  
Guns guns shatter the lands  
  
A system built by the sweat of the many  
Creates assassins to kill off the few  
Take any place and call it a court house  
This is a place where no judge can stand  
  
Sue the lawyers and burn all the papers  
Unlock the key of the legal papers  
A jury of a billion faces  
Shouted out condemned out of hand  
  
Guns guns, and nobody's kidding  
Guns guns, or foolin' around  
Guns guns, the violence is singing  
Guns guns, a silence the sound  
  
'N I like to be in Africa  
A-beatin' on the final drum  
'N I like to be in U.S.S.R.  
Makin' sure these things will come  
'N I like to be in U.S.A.  
Pretending that the wars are done  
'N I like to be in Europa  
Saying goodbye to everyone  
  
Guns guns there's guns on the roof  
Guns guns they're made to shoot

Well, I got a friend who's a man  
What man?  
The man who keeps me from the lovely  
He gives me what I need  
What you need? What you got?  
I need it all so badly  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me  
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free  
It's hateful  
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere  
  
This year I've lost some friends  
Some friends? What friends?  
I dunno, I ain't even noticed  
  
You see, I gotta go out again  
Again? My friend  
I gotta see that main man  
  
I killed all my nerves  
My nerves? What swerves?  
And I can't drive so steady  
  
I've lost my memory  
My mind? Behind!  
I can't see so clearly  
  
[Chorus:]

Breakin' rocks in the hot sun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I needed money 'cause I had none  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I left my baby and it feels so bad  
Guess my race is run  
She's the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the  
  
Robbin' people with a six-gun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I lost my girl and I lost my fun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I left my baby and it feels so bad  
Guess my race is run  
She's the best girl that I ever had

Make sure!  
Taking cover in the bunker tonight  
Waiting for Bo Diddley's headlights  
I feel alright  
Gotta Fender Stratosphere  
I can do anything tonight  
It's in neon lights an' global rights  
Frank? He's on the phone  
There ain't no German girl outside  
But who cares when its warm inside?  
With music  
Special mystery of music tragically  
Exchanging slaves for majesties  
Modern waves of tragedy  
Packing a two piece colt pair of shoots  
A shiny grey Mexican suit  
The blue eyed traffic can sashay by  
'Cause tonight the sailor boys have hit Shanghai  
The kick-out traffic goes creaking by  
I smash my glass and shout shanghai  
My drummer friend comes shooting by  
He said Errol Flynn will never die  
Oh no! Who am I to question why?  
And are you lonesome tonight  
And do ya need a country cowboy  
Who's just thin and tight in those  
Br' bus depot jeans  
With a squirt resistant stud stud  
Hey stoner  
  
Get over there in the spliff bunker one  
Because London Bridge was sold somehow  
But it was too old anyhow  
When Uncle Sam has broken down  
We'll make him down in old Japan  
Say ye'  
  
Well there ain't no better blend  
Than Joe Ely and his Texas Men  
Where the wind blows  
I ain't seen none like that scenery  
You can see from a bus if you pay the price  
  
Wave my arms around  
Flag one of those taxi's maybe  
I saw a girl somewhere somehow  
Forever sticks in my mind somehow  
I've just got three lines  
And a pair of two's  
Like a lucky roll of dice that you  
You cast  
  
If music could talk!  
Which means  
Whatever your mind can bring  
Like the apple fell off the tree  
Pah! Fell right on his head  
Yeah many years ago  
  
There was a man who said  
I am a shaman  
A voodoo shaman  
Got in trouble so he's going out  
Mixing up and Haiti! Oh!  
And the crickets  
Buddy Holly said it was  
Br' br' yee'  
  
If music could talk you know  
  
I feel kinda lonely  
Standing out on the floor  
Of Electric Ladyland  
  
'cause this is a good question Samson  
Are you partly Arabic?  
  
Chi man! Whatcho all about  
  
I don't want to I can't hope to  
Say it all in one go  
Occasionally once or twice  
A day I feel alive enough to say  
Let's hear what the drummer man's  
Got to say about  
He said is it Errol Flynn's birthday or not?  
Sept twelfth until October  
If they pack two piece  
Colt pair of shoots  
We got the shiny grey Mexican suits  
I'm just wasting a great big  
Corporation and the entire fund  
The girders of Wall Street  
And the temples of money  
And the high priests  
Of the expense account  
And I'm wasting the whole thing  
I come down in Yamaha-ha  
They make the best pianos-time to step-up

Yankee soldier  
He want to shoot some skag  
He met it in Cambodia  
But now he can't afford a bag  
  
Yankee dollar talk  
To the dictators of the world  
In fact it's giving orders  
An' they can't afford to miss a word  
  
I'm so bored with the U...S...A...  
But what can I do?  
  
Yankee detectives  
Are always on the TV  
'Cause killers in America  
Work seven days a week  
  
Never mind the stars and stripes  
Let's print the Watergate Tapes  
I'll salute the New Wave  
And I hope nobody escapes  
  
I'm so bored with the U...S...A...  
But what can I do?  
  
Move up Starsky  
For the C.I.A.  
Suck on Kojak  
For the USA

(Strummer)  
  
I could see as I rode in  
The ships were gone and the pit fell in  
A funeral bell tolled the hour in  
A lonely drunkard slumbering  
  
Not the twang of the guitar  
Not even the siren wail of pain  
Not the shadows of desire  
Caught in the pouring pouring rain  
  
Breeze black windows on date street  
Where I was raised up on the cheap  
(yeah, say!) ask no questions work and sleep  
'til the old tango that's on date street  
  
I can hear the sharpen of the pain  
Some lucky stranger in the rain  
Hear the sharpen of the rain  
Lucky stranger... In the rain  
  
Hammers beat in dusty times  
On these weedy rusted lines  
Mocking the sun and optomistic signs  
All these weedy gates of iron  
  
The sun won't shine my way again  
Lucky moon was on the wane  
Oh I'll never see a star again  
In the pouring pouring rain  
  
A salty band played for the train  
A sad trombone and some refrain  
The future pointed to the weather vane  
The old calypso died of shame  
  
I hear the sharpen of the pain  
Some lucky stranger in the rian  
Hear the sharpen of the pain  
Lucky stranger pouring rain  
  
Pouring rain!!!

The soldier boy for his soldiers pay  
Obeys the sergeant at arms whatever he says  
  
The sergeant will for his sergeant's pay  
Obey the general order of the battle play  
  
The generals bow to the government  
Obey the charge you must not relent  
  
What of the neighbors and the prophets in bars?  
What are they saying in the public bazaar?  
We are tired of the tune  
You must not relent  
  
At every stroke of the bell in the tower there goes  
Another boy from another side  
  
The bulletins that steady come in say those  
Familiar words at the top of the hour  
  
The jamming city increases its hum  
And those terrible words continue to come  
  
Through bras music of government hear those  
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums  
  
No-one mentions the neighboring war  
No one knows what they're fighting for  
We are tired of the tune  
You must not relent

So you're on the floor, at Fifty Four  
Think you can last - at the Palace  
Does your body go to the to and fro?  
But tonight's the night - or didn't you know  
That Ivan meets G.I. Joe  
  
He tried his tricks- that Ruskie bear  
The United Nations said it's all fair  
He did the radiation - the chemical plague  
But he could not win - with a Cossack spin  
  
The Vostok Bomb - the Stalin strike  
He tried every move - he tried to hitch hike  
He drilled a hole - like a Russian star  
He made every move in his repertoire  
  
When Ivan meet G.I. Joe  
  
Now it was G.I. Joe's turn to blow  
He turned it on - cool and slow  
He tried a payphone call to the Pentagon  
A radar scan - a leviathan  
  
He wiped the Earth - clean as a plate  
What does it take to make a Ruskie break?  
But the crowd are bored and off they go  
Over the road to watch China blow!  
  
When Ivan meets G.I. Joe

The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz  
I said, he ain't here, but he sure went past  
Oh, you're looking for Jimmy Jazz  
  
Sattamassagana for Jimmy Dread  
Cut off his ears and chop off his head  
Police came looking for Jimmy Jazz

Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side  
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz

So go look all around, you can try your luck, brother  
And see what you found  
But I guarantee that it ain't your day  
Chop! Chop!

Down the road came a Junco Partner  
For he was loaded as can be  
He was knocked out, knocked out loaded  
He was a'wobblin' all over the street  
  
Singing six months ain't no sentence  
And one year ain't no time  
I was born in Angola  
Serving fourteen to ninety nine  
  
Well I wish I had me a million dollars  
Oh one million to call my own  
I would raise meat and say, "grow for me baby"  
I would raise me a tobacco farm  
  
Well I wish I would have me a great deal of money  
Yeah and mighty good things all over town  
Now I ain't got no more money  
All of my good friends are putting me down  
  
So now I gotta pawn my rifle and pistol  
Yeah I'm gonna pawn my watch and chain  
I would have pawned my seat Gabriella  
But the smart girl she wouldn't sign her name  
  
Give me headstone when I die

I wasn't going that far  
The junkie slip!  
I said I wasn't doin' it  
The junkie slip!  
Yea thought I'd find a rhythm in the junkie town  
Thought I'd find a rhythm when the junkies hang around  
  
Thought I'd go out walking to the junkie kind of beat  
Setting on those bars that the junkies meet  
The junkie slip!  
Nail it down  
The junkie slip!  
This side of town  
The junkie slip!  
And whatcha knowing before you's a doin'  
The things they's a-knowing  
You pawn your coat and your car  
Pawned your cigar and your old guitar  
You pawned your guitar and your saxophone  
You're pawning everything in your mother's home  
  
'cause it's a junkie slip!  
Just like rock n' roll  
A junkie slip!  
Like Johnny did the stroll  
And you know it feels alright  
But what's that feeling on a Saturday night?  
  
You're itching itching itching in your pillow in the day  
You're itching itching itching and you gave your coat away  
Itching itching itching and then in your sleeping bag  
There's a little packet that you thought you never had  
  
It's a junkie slip!  
Every night  
Junkie slip!  
Cold water fright  
It's a junkie slip  
And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon  
All afternoon and in the middle of the night  
  
You're worse for the difference and it don't sleep tight  
Don't pull the curtains fon't put on the light  
See-see-see-'cause it's a junkie slip!  
What's goin' on?  
Was early night  
I lit the fire  
Finish alright  
Yeh Edi-Edi-Edi-Yeh Edi-Juan  
Him going to live with Indian  
Come in the car, it's an old machine  
Riding from Brookway on a magazine  
Be on that corner with a magazine  
  
Do ya do ya do ya follow your friends?  
Do I hear you saying that you're going back again?  
It's a junkie slip!  
Where? Did it end?  
But did it ah did it did it ever end?  
When did it ever end?  
Don't ask me when on a Wednesday night  
Don't ask me when on a Thursday night  
I said oh? Who the hell are you?  
You said oh! Well you met me  
I said I can guess why

Stay around don't play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Runnin' and a hiding tonight  
Justice tonight  
  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you through Armageddon time  
It's Armageddon  
It's not Christmas time  
  
A lot of people  
A lot of people use a calculator  
A lot of people won't get no supper tonight  
A lot of people sittin' down by the light  
  
The battle is gettin' hotter  
Armageddon time  
Armageddon  
  
Remember to kick it over  
Armageddon time  
  
A lot of people ain't got no supper tonight  
A lot of people got to stand out back

Trailers for sale of rent  
Rooms to let 50 cents, now  
No phone, no pool, no pets  
I ain't got no cigarettes  
  
Now two hours of shoving broom  
But an eight-by-twelve four bed room  
I'm a man of means by no means  
King of the road  
  
Third box-car on the midnight tube  
Destination Hangar Lane  
Old worn out suit and shoes  
I don't pay no union dues  
  
I smoke old stogies I have found  
Short but not too big around  
Man of means by no means  
King a' the road

In these days you can get no rice  
No razor blades but you can get knife  
In these days see the people run  
They have no food but the boy have gun  
In these days they don't throw the stone  
Nor use the voice they use the gun alone  
In these days to be an oddity  
Be hunted down like a scarcity  
  
In these days don't beg for life  
Want to take Kingston advice?  
Oh please don't beg for your life  
  
In these days the beat is militant  
Must be a clash there's no alternative  
In these days nations are militant  
We have slavery under government  
In these days in the firmament  
I look for signs that are permanent  
  
In these days with no love to give  
The world will turn with no one left to live  
  
In these days I don't know what to do  
The more I see the more I'm destitute  
In these days I don't know what to sing  
The more I know the less my tune can swing  
  
In these days you can get no rice  
No razor blades but you can get knife  
In these days see the people run  
They have no food but the boy have gun

Elevator! Going up!  
In the gleaming corridors of the 51st floor  
The money can be made if you really want some more  
Executive decision-a clinical precision  
Jumping from the windows-filled with indecision  
  
I get good advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isn't any  
So freeze, man, freeze  
  
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power  
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour  
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot  
You won't need a launderette, you can send them to the vet!  
  
I get my advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isn't any  
So freeze, man, freeze  
  
Koka Kola advertising and kokaine  
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain  
Neon light sign says it  
I read it in the paper-they're crazy!  
Suit your life, maybe so  
In the White House-I know  
All Over Berlin (they've been doing it for years)  
And in Manhattan!  
  
Coming through the door is a snub nose forty four  
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor  
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs  
And your tongue feels like a fish  
You're leaping from the windows-saying don't  
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh!  
Don't give me none of this!  
  
I get good advice from the advertising world  
Treat me nice says the party girl  
Koke adds life where there isn't any  
So freeze, man, freeze  
Hit the deck!

Summon up the mas! Play on the pan!  
Staring dreads are jerking their locks  
As the white star liner sank in the docks  
But on the drummers face, there is a look of dread  
As he drums away 400 years of dread  
The dancer man-in the power of mas  
Is smoking ti the mighty sparrow's blast  
  
But you better be careful  
You still got to watch yourself  
  
You want to be crazy  
So you want to go crazy  
Let's go crazy  
So you want to be crazy  
Then let's go crazy  
Let's go crazy  
  
The lawful force are here of course  
For special offenders for the special court  
But the young men know when the sun has set  
Darkness comes to settle the debt  
Owed by a year of S.U.S. and suspect  
Indiscriminate use of the power of arrest  
  
They're waiting for the sun to set  
  
The mighty observer who keeps his cabinets hot  
A great meeting of rhythm and face  
A humming of values and a children's place  
But the sticks man gives the copper good excuse  
To shut off the ganja and control the juice  
  
To control the juice  
  
So you want to go crazy? Then let's go crazy  
So take it on crazy! So they get all crazy  
Bricks and bottles corrugated iron  
Shields and helmets carnival time  
'N moa ambassa, sledgehammer sound  
Ray symbolic from jamdown town

Hey anybody got a cigarette?  
  
Has anybody got a cigarette  
Haven't you declared a disaster zone  
Ho! Your car is a total wreck  
And I just can't go back home  
  
My girl if she had the dope  
We'd get the messieurs on the phone  
I still got to get up and go home  
Don't start driving on my headstone  
  
Go!

Gets you a floor and a (???)

A guitar or a blank cassette  
Hey! The last thing he'd expect in his bar  
Gonna chart the rise of my star

Make him want to stop, gonna fall on me  
Life is wild life is free

Ok, ah, we're back again and of course you're listening to W.B.A.I. in New
York and this program is labrish  
My name is Hab? Salashi and we're speaking with Baba, or maybe Rash Baboa  
Can I try and give a message? Hallo?  
Go, go ahead man  
Yeah, I just like to say, uhm, lets have some music now eh  
Ok, ok, thank you  
Yo right  
  
Now lightning strikes in old New York  
It may be dark but I wanna talk  
It might rain, it might snow  
There's too many things I got to know  
If this is spring than it's time to sing  
Never mind the l'il birdies wing  
Look out, look out, old New York  
New York's coming and New York talks  
Hey, strike  
Not once, strike, but twice  
Get out your money, peel a slab  
Roll some notes and hail a cab  
Drive in church, drive in back  
Drive down Seventh in a tank  
Take in the sights, feel the breeze  
See New York's one and only tree  
It can be found in Garbage park  
But don't inspect it after dark, no  
Strike  
New York  
Lightning  
Not once but twice  
Accidental hike in the transit strike  
Roller skate or ride a bike  
Three to a car, Brooklyn Bridge  
You won't get far if you're privileged  
Graffiti Jack sprays in black  
An Englishman, can he read it back?  
Deli Joe, he ought to know  
He runs the gang on Pastrami Row  
Strike  
Lightning  
Strike  
Because glass to glass, street to street  
Buildings touch St. Peter's feet  
From car to bar, from prez to shah  
Everything is in the jar  
The four winds blow 'cause the four winds know  
Takes a special hustle to make a roll  
Honey girl on her feet  
I wish everything to make her sweet  
(Strike) Strike  
Yeah, strike hits twice  
Not once but twice (Strike)  
Ok, so roll  
Ya'll  
Serieus  
Ya'll  
From Harlem  
Strike one  
Lightning strike  
  
Harlem slum to penthouse block  
On every door I already knocked  
There wasn't anybody that I didn't leave alone  
Somebody lying under every stone  
Everything that a man could need is in a bag down by my knee  
That looks good and this ain't got seeds  
Cheaper than booze down in the bowery  
Lightning strike (Strike)  
Old New York  
Everything's light  
Bumb, oh, he touched you there  
(Strike) Strike  
Hey ho, such a night  
I'll see y'all when the lightning strike  
A polaroid caught in the act  
You're married too and that's a fact but I won't peek and I won't squeek  
Down by the trucks on Christopher Street  
It's Cuban Day  
Oi Vey  
Chinese New Year, let's call it a day  
Look out, lightning strike  
Tootsie  
Fox, fox, what, what've you got?  
Hey bully  
Oh, strike  
Lightning  
  
Hey, Chi man  
That melody is Puerto Rican  
Hey Chi man, is what he's speaking  
And there's the road down into London Town where many cars get broken down  
It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove  
Runs down to Old Hounslow  
Hash my brother, caught a fuff  
Because, because you know it  
Just thought I'd mention the new extention that run's down the 59th street

Did you hear the news y'all?

London's burning! London's burning!  
  
All across the town, all across the night  
Everybody's driving with full headlights  
Black or white turn it on, face the new religion  
Everybody's sitting 'round watching television!  
  
London's burning with boredom now  
London's burning dial 99999  
  
I'm up and down the Westway, in an' out the lights  
What a great traffic system - it's so bright  
I can't think of a better way to spend the night  
Then speeding around underneath the yellow lights  
  
London's burning with boredom now  
London's burning dial 99999  
  
Now I'm in the subway and I'm looking for the flat  
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that  
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home  
I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone  
  
London's burning with boredom now...  
London's burning dial 99999

Gonna scrape the trouble off my boots!  
  
As they were dancing in the evening  
And the light shone through the trees  
This girl my eye was following  
Asked the band to play her a beat  
  
Singin' she'd do that long time jerk  
She hit me where it hurts  
Ohhh your heart  
Now my heart will burst  
Oh no  
  
Ah, but it took me back to that wonderland  
I witnessed long ago  
Babbling words of preachers  
Sayin'- "Don't bury me no more"  
  
Ohh...  
  
And I've forgotten how to worry  
And I don't know how to run  
Against the odds I realize  
This struggle could be won!  
  
We dance  
  
Long time jerk  
She did it to me first  
Ohhh my heart  
With that long time jerk  
  
Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk.  
  
Bring on those tapes from the past  
They make you look better in a mirror  
Feel that long time jerkin'  
Between the taker and the giver  
  
Feel that...  
  
Long time jerk  
She hit me where it hurts  
Oh I felt my heart  
Now my heart will burst  
  
I've forgotten how to worry  
And I don't know how to run  
Against the odds I realize  
This struggle could be fun!  
  
Oh, through lanes and streets and houses  
And reversing rush of time  
She made me re-invent the world  
Before inventing time  
(Before inventing time)  
  
Long time jerk  
Oh, she hit me where it hurts  
Ohhhhh my heart  
Long time jerk  
  
Long, long, long, long, long  
Long time  
Long time jerk

Come with me. I won't hide  
We're going on a ride  
We meet each day, use time to see  
While we're young and almost free  
  
I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in  
Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in  
  
Do not turn or hate to see  
All the things you think we've got  
Do not turn or hate to see  
What happened to the wife of Lot  
  
We're alone or so they say  
We're not on our own in that way  
When we're alone it's real tough going  
We can take a part in someone else's play  
  
Come with me, I thought he said  
But that's not him anymore, he's dead  
What's it like to be so free  
So free it looks like lost to me

I searched through the drinkers  
Each propped over his glass  
I ran through each bar  
Until I found guy at last  
Guy you've been to the doctor  
No I don't think it wise  
Took one of his pills  
Boiled the blood in my eyes.  
  
When you played the master mix  
To the company man  
Took three million worldwide  
To make him understand  
You don't work for peanuts  
But they'll push you too  
It's that company trick  
We're all jumping through  
Bet you ain't had no food now  
Since you last went to sleep  
The wild seed that was sowed  
Will take forever to reap.  
  
What days and nights though  
Rocking out of ham yard  
Oh skip that fandango  
Bring the blues back down hard  
Though chuck would never admit it  
At the door of the jail  
There stood Guy Stevens  
And he was waving the bail.  
  
Guy you've finished the booze  
And you run out of speed  
But the wild side of life  
Is the one that we need.

And so we say  
We ain't got life  
Don't want a cardboard cut-out  
Don't want a plastic knife  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
And so we say  
Have you no use  
For eight million hands  
And the power of youth  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
It's gonna be a burn out!  
  
And so we say  
We ain't diggin' no graves  
We're diggin' a foundation  
For a future to be made  
  
Now I know, time can march  
With it's chargin' feet  
Now I know, words are only cheap  
It's gonna be a burn out  
All around this town  
The South is up  
But the North is down  
  
There's gonna be a killin'  
Of a woman and a man  
Trying to feed that child  
Without a coin in their hand  
  
It's gonna be a burn out!

One emotion  
It's all over the place  
You let it get out  
It cuts in your face  
  
One emotion  
Back of a shop  
Everybody wants what the next guy's got  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Don't think I don't trust  
People trample people on the daily bus  
  
One emotion  
Fighting through the night  
And if you can keep your buttons down  
When it gets right  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Smokin' through the town  
Banging on the doors  
And (???)  
  
One emotion  
Boy meets girl  
Smashing (???)  
It's that kind of world  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion  
Moving out loud  
Better get your weapon ready  
Walking through the crowd  
  
One emotion  
Back of a shop  
Everybody wants what the next guy's got  
  
One emotion  
One emotion  
All you ever know  
Is your narrow life  
One emotion  
  
One emotion

This is a message from Futura  
Don't prophesize the future  
I liven up the culture  
Because I'm deadly as a vulture  
I paint on civilization  
It's environmentally wack  
So presenting my attack  
I'll brighten up your shack  
I'm down by law  
That's a fact  
Just give me a wall.  
Any building dull or tall  
I spray clandestine night subway  
I cover red purple on top of grey  
Hey, no slashing 'cause it ain't the way  
The T.A. blew forty mil they say  
We thew down by night  
They scrubbed it off by day

Standing in the bog of a west end bar  
Guy on the right leaning over too far  
Money in my pocket gonna put it in the slot  
Open up the pack see what type I got  
  
I didn't want to hold you  
I didn't want to use you  
Protex, protex blue  
All want to do  
  
It's a fab protective for that type of a girl  
But everybody knows that she uses it well  
It's the therapeutic structure I can use at will  
But I don't think it fits my b.d. drill  
  
Sitting in a carriage of a bakerloo  
Erotica my pocket got a packet for you  
Advert on the escalator on my way home  
I don't need no skin flicks, I want to be alone  
  
I didn't want to hold you  
I didn't want to use you  
Protex, protex blue  
All I want to do

I slept and I dreamed of a time long ago  
I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air  
I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires,  
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames,  
And the rebels were waltzing on air.  
  
I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz  
That was written to be danced on the battlefield  
I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl  
A voice that called "Stand till we fall  
We stand till all the boys fall."  
  
As we danced came the news that the war was not won  
5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun  
Through the heart of the camp  
Swept the news from the front  
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food  
We knew the war could not be won.  
  
So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun  
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one  
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun  
The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing.  
The song was an old rebel one.  
  
As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field  
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees  
I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise  
A voice began to call, stand till you fall  
The tune was an old rebel one.

Who needs remote control  
From the Civic Hall  
Push a button  
Activate  
You gotta work an' you're late  
  
It's so grey in London town  
With a panda car crawling around  
Here it comes  
Eleven o'clock  
Where can we go now?  
  
Can't make a noise  
Can't get no gear  
Can't make no money  
Can't get outta here  
  
Big business it don't like you  
It don't like the things you do  
You got no money  
So you got no power  
They think you're useless  
An' so you are - puuuuuuunnnnnk!  
  
They had a meeting in Mayfair  
They got you down an'  
They want to keep you there  
It makes them worried  
Their bank accounts  
That's all that matters  
And you don't count  
  
Can't make no progress  
Can't get ahead  
Can't stop the regress  
Don't want to be dead  
  
Look out' those rules and regulations  
  
Who needs the Parliament  
Sitting making laws all day  
They're all fat and old  
Queuing for the House of Lords  
  
Repression - gonna start on Tuesday  
Repression - gonna be a Dalek  
Repression - I am a robot  
Repression - I obey

Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock  
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock  
  
Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back  
An' I'm so pilled up that I rattle  
I have got the sharpest knife, so I cut the biggest slice  
But I have no time to do battle  
  
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this  
Brand new beat  
This here music mash up the nation  
This here music cause a sensation  
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right  
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it  
Gonna be alright  
  
Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock  
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock  
  
Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide  
And you poured your beer in me hat  
With my good eye on the beat, living on fixation street  
And I ain't got no time for that

My Daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He just loved to live that way  
And he loved  
  
Never loved a shovel  
Break  
  
The old man spoke up in a bar  
Said I never been in prison  
  
Someday you'll meet your rocking chair  
'Cause that's where we're spinning  
There's  
  
Yeah  
My daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He  
  
Get away, get away  
Money  
He loved to steal your money

Now the king told the boogie men  
You have to let that raga drop  
The oil down the desert way  
Has been shakin' to the top  
The Sheik he drove his Cadillac  
He went a' cruisin' down the ville  
The muezzin was a' standing  
On the radiator grille  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Shareef don't like it  
Rock the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah  
The Shareef don't like it  
Rock the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah  
  
By order of the prophet  
We ban that boogie sound  
Degenerate the faithful  
With that craazy Casbah sound  
But the Bedouin they brought out  
The electric camel drum  
The local guitar picker  
Got his guitar picking thumb  
As soon as the Shareef  
Had cleared the square  
They began to wail  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now over at the temple  
Oh! They really pack 'em in  
The in crowd say it's cool  
To dig this chanting thing  
But as the wind changed direction  
The temple band took five  
The crowd caught a wiff  
Of that crazy Casbah jive  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The king called up his jet fighters  
He said you better earn your pay  
Drop your bombs between the minarets  
Down the Casbah way  
  
As soon as the Shareef was  
Chauffeured outta there  
The jet pilots tuned to  
The cockpit radio blare  
  
As soon as the Shareef was  
Outta their hair  
The jet pilots wailed  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He thinks it's not kosher  
Fundamentally he can't take it.  
You know he really hates it.  
Really really hates it!

Sing, Michael, sing-on the route of the nineteen bus  
Hear them sayin'  
How you get a rude and a reckless?  
Don't you be so crude and a feckless  
You been drinking brew for breakfast  
Rudie can't fail  
  
So we reply  
I know that my life make you nervous  
But I tell you that I can't live in service  
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose  
Rudie can't fail  
  
I went to the market to realize my soul  
'Cause what I need I just don't have  
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt  
We say Rudie can't fail  
  
We hear them sayin'  
Now first you must cure your temper  
Then you find a job in the paper  
You need someone for a savior  
Oh, Rudie can't fail  
  
We reply  
Now we get a rude and a reckless  
We been seen lookin' cool an' a speckless  
We been drinking brew for breakfast  
So Rudie can't fail  
  
Okay!  
So where you want to go today?  
Hey boss man!  
You're looking pretty smart  
In your chicken skin suit  
  
You think you're pretty hot  
In your pork pie hat  
But...Rudie can't fail  
Look out, look out...  
Sky juice!...ten cents a bottle!

We met when we were in school  
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools  
The teacher says we're dumb  
We're only having fun  
We piss on everyone  
In the classroom  
  
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss  
An' weekends we'd go dancing  
Down Streatham on the bus  
You always made me laugh  
  
Got me in bad fights  
Play me pool all night  
Smokin' menthol  
  
I practiced daily in my room  
You were down the crown planning your next move  
Go on a nicking spree  
Hit the wrong guy  
Each of you get three  
Years in Brixton  
  
I did my very best to write  
How was butlins?  
Were the screws too tight?  
When you lot get out  
Were gonna hit the town  
We'll burn it fuckin' down  
To a cinder  
  
'Cause years have passed and things have changed  
And I move anyway I want to go  
I'll never forget the feeling I got  
When I heard that you'd got home  
An' I'll never forget the smile on my face  
'Cause I knew where you would be  
An' if you're in the crown tonight  
Have a drink on me  
But go easy...step lightly...stay free

Oh! Mama, Mama look there!  
Your children are playing in that street again  
Don't you know what happened down there?  
A youth of fourteen got shot down there  
The Kokane guns of Jamdown Town  
The killing clowns, the blood money men  
Are shooting those Washington bullets again  
  
As every cell in Chile will tell  
The cries of the tortured men  
Remember Allende, and the days before,  
Before the army came  
Please remember Victor Jara,  
In the Santiago Stadium,  
Es verdad - those Washington Bullets again  
  
And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961,  
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun,  
For Castro is a color,  
Is a redder than red,  
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead  
For Castro is the color...  
...That will earn you a spray of lead  
  
For the very first time ever,  
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua,  
There was no interference from America  
Human rights in America  
  
Well the people fought the leader,  
And up he flew...  
With no Washington bullets what else could he do?  
  
'N' if you can find a Afghan rebel  
That the Moscow bullets missed  
Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist...  
...Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet,  
How many monks did the Chinese get?  
In a war-torn swamp stop any mercenary,  
'N' check the British bullets in his armory  
Que?  
Sandinista!

Punk rockers, hip-hoppers  
Brit poppers, show stoppers  
Beboppers, hair droppers  
Are you ready to sing?  
  
Right wing, left wing  
I want something  
To see me through (???)  
Bout what do you think  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
What?  
We are the Clash  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
With my guitar now  
(???) last dance  
I see them where they (???)  
How they usually stay  
  
Beating on a drum  
Did they tell them 'take it in'  
Got the (???)  
Where the fat boy blew  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
That's right  
We are the Clash  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match  
  
Home fires burnin'  
In motorcycle city  
The rockin' gods will choose  
If I'm worthy to live  
The first (???) engine  
(???) forty-six  
And there's no more (???)  
To imitate respect  
  
We ain't gonna be treated like trash  
We got one thing  
We are the Clash  
Don't take no shit  
We are the Clash  
Do ya hear me?  
It's like a patch  
You can strike that match

What the hell is wrong with me? I'm not  
Who I want to be  
I tired spot cream an' I tried it all I'm crawling up the wall!  
  
What's my name naaaame...naaaame....naaaame....  
  
I tried to join a ping-pong club, sign on the door said all full up!  
I got nicked, fighting in the road an' the judge didn't even know  
  
What's my name  
  
Dad go pissed so I got clocked  
Couldn't hear the Tannoy so he lost the lot  
Offers Mum a bribe through the letter box  
Drives you fucking mad  
  
What's my name  
  
Now I'm round the back of your house at night  
Peeping in the window - are you sleeping tight?  
I laugh at your locks with my celluloid strip  
An' you won't know who came  
  
What's my name

Stagger Lee met Billy and they go down to gambling  
  
Stagger Lee throwed seven  
Billy said that he throwed eight  
So Billy said, hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack  
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back  
  
Why do you try to cheat?  
And trample people under your feet  
Don't you know it is wrong?  
To cheat the trying man  
So you better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo  
  
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit  
In such a small, small game  
Don't you know it is wrong  
  
Billy Boy has been shot  
And Stagger Lee's come out on top  
Don't you know it is wrong  
To cheat the trying man  
To cheat Stagger man  
You'd better stop  
So you must start all over again-all over again  
You got to play it, Billy, play, you got to play it, Billy, play  
And you will find it is the right 'em boyo  
  
But if you must lie and deceit  
And trample people under your feet  
Don't you know it is wrong  
It is the wrong 'em boyo
