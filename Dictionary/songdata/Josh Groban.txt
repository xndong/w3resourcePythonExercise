No man, no madness  
Though their sad power may prevail  
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart  
They rise to fail  
  
She is eternal  
Long before nations' lines were drawn  
When no flags flew, when no armies stood  
My land was born  
  
And you ask me why I love her  
Through wars, death and despair  
She is the constant, we who don't care  
And you wonder will I leave her - but how?  
I cross over borders but I'm still there now  
  
How can I leave her?  
Where would I start?  
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart  
My land's only borders lie around my heart

A beautiful and blinding morning  
The world outside begins to breathe  
See clouds arriving without warning  
I need you here to shelter me  
  
And I know that only time will tell us how  
To carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake to memorize you  
Give me more time to feel this way  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
If I could make these moments endless  
If I could stop the winds of change  
If we just keep our eyes wide open  
Then everything would stay the same  
  
And I know that only time will tell me how  
We'll carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake for every moment  
Give us more time to be this way  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
We'll let tomorrow wait, you're here, right now, with me  
All my fears just fall away, when you are all I see  
  
We can't stay like this forever  
But I have you here today  
  
And I will remember  
Oh I will remember  
Remember all the love we shared today

There's a pale winter moon in the sky coming through my window  
And the park is laid out like a bed below  
It's a cold, dark night and my heart melts like the snow  
And the bells of New York City tell me not to go  
  
It's always this time of year that my thoughts undo me  
With the ghosts of many lifetimes all abound  
But from these mad heights I can always hear the sound  
Of the bells of New York City singing all around  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
Refuge from these broken dreams  
Wait right here oh wait with me  
On silent snow filled streets  
  
Sing to me one song for joy and one for redemption  
And whatever is in between that I call mine  
With the street lamp light to illuminate the gray  
And the bells of New York City calling me to stay  
The bells of New York City calling me to stay

God on high  
Hear my prayer  
In my need  
You have always been there  
  
He is young  
He's afraid  
Let him rest  
Heaven blessed  
  
Bring him home  
Bring him home  
Bring him home  
  
He's like the son  
I might have known  
If God had granted me a son  
  
The summers die  
One by one  
How soon they fly  
On and on  
  
And I am old  
And will be gone  
  
Bring him peace  
Bring him joy  
He is young  
He is only a boy  
  
You can take  
You can give  
Let him be  
Let him live  
  
If I die  
Let me die  
Let him live  
  
Bring him home  
Bring him home  
Bring him home

Tell me his name  
I want to know  
The way he looks  
And where you go  
I need to see his face  
I need to understand  
Why you and I came to an end  
  
Tell me again  
I want to hear  
Who broke my faith in all these years  
Who lays with you at night  
When I'm here all alone  
Remembering when I was your own  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll let you go  
I'll let you fly  
Why do I keep on asking why  
I'll let you go  
Now that I found  
A way to keep somehow  
More than a broken vow  
  
Tell me the words I never said  
Show me the tears you never shed  
Give me the touch  
That one you promised to be mine  
Or has it vanished for all time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I close my eyes  
And dream of you and I  
And then I realize  
There's more to life than only bitterness and lies  
I close my eyes  
  
I'd give away my soul  
To hold you once again  
And never let this promise end  
  
[Chorus]

You look at me with uncertainty  
You look at me with urgency  
You look at me with fear in your eyes  
Like you're about to fall away  
  
Don't be afraid to change your colours now  
I've known you all summer and you rose above it all  
I see you hesitate to fall now  
But it's a pretty good view from down here too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go, I will let go too  
  
I knew you when you were green and small  
Like a feather on a wing, so long  
You know I will miss you when you are gone  
But don't be afraid if you just can't hang on  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go, I will let go too  
  
When the wind takes you it takes me too  
And when you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
And when you let go, I will let go too  
  
The cold air is pushing hard on you  
I know what you're saying, I can feel it too  
You'll go through changes and I'll go through them too  
Don't be afraid now, no don't be afraid, don't be afraid  
  
Cause when the wind takes you it takes me too  
When you change colours, I'll change mine too  
Try not to think and I will try too  
When you let go, I will let go too

Something in your eyes makes me wanna lose myself  
Makes me wanna lose myself in your arms  
Something in your voice, makes my heart beat fast  
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life  
  
If you knew how lonely my life has been  
And how low I've felt for so long  
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along  
And change my world the way you've done  
  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I've come from  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
  
Another window breaks down a long, dark street  
And a siren wails in the night  
But that's alright, 'cause I have you here with me  
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light  
  
Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
And if you knew how happy you are making me  
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much  
  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I've come from  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like home to me  
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

I close my eyes  
And there in the shadows I see your light  
You come to me out of my dreams across the night  
  
You take my hand  
Though you may be so many stars away  
I know that our spirits and souls are one  
We've circled the moon and we've touched the sun  
So here we'll stay  
  
For Always  
Forever  
Beyond here and on to eternity  
For Always  
Forever  
For us there's no time and no space  
No barrier love won't erase  
Wherever you go l still know in my heart you will be with me  
  
From this day on  
I'm certain that I'll never be alone  
I know what my heart must have always known  
That love has a power that's all it's own  
  
And For Always  
Forever  
Now we can fly  
And For Always and Always  
We will go on  
Beyond  
Goodbye  
  
For Always  
Forever  
Beyond here and on to eternity  
For Always and Ever  
You'll be a part of me  
  
And For Always  
Forever  
A thousand tomorrows may cross the sky  
And For Always and Always  
We will go on  
Beyond  
Goodbye  

The world wanders with me tonight  
  
Little steps I take with you  
I follow your heart and I follow the moon  
So hidden far away from me  
The world wanders with us tonight  
  
Ahhh if only far away from here existed  
A place where to discover my heart  
  
To know if it can love you or not  
  
And it will wander and it will wander  
This heart of mine along with you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and yes yes one day it will understand  
  
It's you who wanders with me tonight  
It's you who wanders far from here  
But yes I know that you are my moon  
Something you show, something you don't  
  
There are blue roads in the sky  
There are eyes, and the sky is already there  
Yes, I think this is the stars  
Ahh, if I could stop like this  
  
And it will wander, and it will wander  
My heart far from you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and one day yes, yes it will understand  
  
Heart already far away  
Yes you are the moon  
If only I could discover it in the sky  
  
And it will wander, and it will wander  
Yes it will wander this heart of mine  
And the earth will wander, my life will wander  
And one day yes it will understand  
And one day yes it will understand you

Tanti anni ormai  
Ricordi che  
Non si cancelleranno mai  
Da dentro me  
A quelli che  
Hanno diviso anni di me  
Questa cansone canto a tutti  
  
Grazie  
Per avermi dato l'onesta  
Quando  
La menzogna domina  
Grazie  
Per aver cercato vertia  
Questo ed altro ora ho  
Tutti quanti ricordero  
  
La dignita  
Di amici che  
Non an negato mai l'amore  
Ne la lealta  
Ora che poi  
Vedo le mie immaturita  
Vi guardo con ammirazione  
  
Grazie  
Per avermi dato l'onesta  
Quando  
La menzogna domina  
Grazie  
Per aver cercato verita  
Questo ed altro ora ho  
Tutti quanti ricordero

Essere per voi un grande  
Orgoglio  
Per sempre  
  
Grazie  
  
Questo ed altro ora ho  
Tutti quanti ricordero  
Vostro amico per sempre saro

Coffee is on the table, and I  
Just can't seem to wake up this aching heart of mine  
One more day without you and I'll be fine  
I know I'm good for waiting but waiting wasted time  
  
Oh and I, I don't take it lightly,  
The trouble that I've gone through, to get you to know who I am  
Oh and I, I can't find a reason to be happy in this heartache  
'Cause I should know better than that  
I'm better than that  
  
Wicked winds are blowing through the halls  
These old familiar faces are clinging to the walls  
I know its cold but I can't feel at all  
And I know these walls are crumbling  
And I won't stay to watch them fall  
  
Oh and I, I don't take it lightly,  
The trouble that I've gone through, to get you to know who I am  
Oh and I, I can't find a reason to be happy in my heartache  
'Cause I should know better than that  
  
But I can't stop loving you  
I don't know what to do  
To keep holding on  
  
Oh and I, I don't take it lightly,  
The trouble that I've gone through, I've given you all that I am  
Oh and I, I can't find a reason to be happy in my heartache  
'Cause I should know better than that  
Oh I'm better than that

Over mountains and sky blue seas  
On great circles will you watch for me?  
The sweetest feeling I've got inside  
I just can't wait to get lost in your eyes  
And all these words that you meant to say  
Held in silence day after day  
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  
Please don't keep them  
Hidden away  
  
Sing it out so I can finally breathe  
And I can take in all you say  
Holding out for something I believe in  
All I really need today  
I want to free your heart  
I want to see your heart  
Please don't keep your heart  
Hidden away  
  
You're a wonder, how bright you shine  
A flickered candle in a short lifetime  
A secret dreamer that never shows  
If no one sees you then nobody knows  
And all these words you were meant to say  
  
Held in silence day after day  
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave  
Please don't keep them  
Hidden away  
  
Sing it out so I can finally breathe  
And I can take in all you say  
Reaching out for someone I believe in  
All I really need today  
I want to feel your love  
Will you reveal your love  
Please don't keep your love  
Hidden away  
  
I want to free your heart  
I want to see your heart  
Please don't keep your heart  
Hidden away  
  
You  
You  
You

For all the times I tried for this  
And every chance at you I missed  
I've been known to go my way, but I confess  
It made me miss you more  
  
I drew my line across the sand  
And set my flag in no man's land  
But here I am the one man band  
With a song that's meant for two  
  
And there is a light, from a higher window  
Shining down on you tonight  
And the music floats on the breeze  
Bringing an easier time  
And all of our cards are on the table  
Tell me what you want to do  
Just don't tell me that it's too late  
For me to love you  
  
How perfect we were meant to be  
Our warm and silent symmetry  
It's times like these when all, all we need  
Is to be reminded  
  
And I have flown a thousand miles  
To empty rooms and crowded isles  
And we went from cathedral bells  
To show and tell and wish you wells  
And I, I still look at you and I am blinded I am blinded  
  
Because there is a light, from a higher window  
Shining down on us tonight  
And the music floats on the breeze  
From an easier time  
  
And all of our cards are on the table  
Tell me what you want to do  
Just don't tell me that it's too late  
Don't tell me that it's too late now  
Just don't tell me that it's too late  
For me to love you

Echo star is a crossing you  
Trembling noises that come too soon  
Spatial movement which seems to you  
Resonating your mass call few  
  
Hollow talking and hollow girl  
Voicing up from the root of pain  
Never said it was good, never said it was me  
Shadow rises and you are here  
  
And then you carve  
You cut it out  
And everything  
Goes back to the beginning  
  
Silence seizes a clotted room  
Dying to shed not a breath too soon  
Darkness rises in all you do  
Standing and drawn across the room  
  
Spatial movements and butterflies  
Shadows scatter without a fight  
There has never been bad, there has always been truth  
Rooted whispers of the things you lose  
  
And then you carve  
You cut it out  
And everything  
Goes back to the beginning  
Goes back to the beginning  
  
There has never been bad, there has always been truth  
Rooted whispers of the things you lose

I know you're gone  
I watched you leave  
I always thought  
That it was me  
You made it clear  
With that last kiss  
You couldn't live a life  
With maybe's and what-if's  
  
When every boat  
Has sailed away  
And every path  
Is marked and paved  
When every road  
Has had its say  
Then I'll be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
I have the cards you sent to me  
You wrote of trains and Paris galleries  
This spring you'll draw  
Canals, and frescoed walls  
Look how far your dreaming's gone  
  
When every town looks just the same  
When every choice gets hard to make  
When every map is put away  
Then I'll be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
And now I know why you had to go alone  
Isn't there a place between  
  
When every boat  
Has sailed away  
And every path  
Is marked and paved  
  
When every road  
Has had its say  
Then I'll be bringing you back  
Home to stay  
  
Reach out to me  
Call out my name  
And I would bring you back again  
Today

Shattered dreams, worthless years  
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell  
Life began, then was done  
Now I stare into a cold and empty well  
  
The many sounds that meet our ears  
the sights our eyes behold  
Will open up our merging hearts  
And feed our empty souls  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
Without despair we will share  
And the joys of caring will not be replaced  
What has been must never end  
And with the strength we have won't be erased  
When the truths of love are planted firm  
They won't be hard to find  
And the words of love I speak to you  
will echo in your mind  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
This time  
  
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever,  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever  
  
And oh that love will call  
And if I believe you're the only one for me  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall in love, oh  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall in love, oh  
  
When I fall  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe, when I fall  
  
When I fall  
  
When I fall in love

Lately, I've been the quiet one  
Waiting searching the lines of the songs you played for me  
Sailing into the misty air  
Fading bound for I don't know where  
When I'm there I'll see  
  
And If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Weightless drifting through stars I got  
Faithless woke in the dark and I made this from my dream  
Play me all your sweet rhymes  
Recreate me, now comes the time when I'll need your truth to see  
  
And if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Walk away  
Let the fear fall away  
Into the fire you made  
Scarlet and gold  
Walk away  
Head for the light of day  
Follow a brighter way  
Out of the cold and dark  
Down to the one bright spark  
Futures that all might start  
Someday  
  
So if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Fragments shells of a long ago lifetime  
Faces that once were mine  
Thrown down by the sea  
  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Would you please follow me

Don't player hate on me, player hate somebody else  
Yo, yo yo I'm a gangster  
Where my dogs at?  
Bark with me if you're my dog  
Yo yo yo, I'm going, I'm gonna give a shout out to all the player haters  
(I don't like player haters)  
If you're a player hater don't player, player hate on me  
(player hate somebody else)  
I'm a gangster, I'm straight up  
(straight up gangster, dude)  
Grrr I'm steaming mad. Grrr  
  
I'm a gangster, I'm a straight up G  
The gangster life is the life for me  
Shooting people by day, selling drugs by night  
Being a gangster is hella tight.  
I walk around town with a stark erection, then gave your mom a yeast infection  
I saw the police man and I punched him in the eye  
To serve and protect, what A lie!  
I also don't like white people, you shouldn't too  
And don't get me started about the jews  
  
I'm a gangster  
Grrr I'm mad  
I'm a gangster  
My rhymes are bad  
I'm a gangster  
I'm iced out like a freezer  
I'm a gangster  
I don't listen to Weezer  
  
I dropped out of school at the age of 3 (why?)  
Coz all the teachers tried to player hate on me.(oh)  
My rhymes are cool, just like doing cocaine  
My rhymes are hot, like a burning flame  
Sisqo is my homie, he's a ganster too  
Me and Sisqo are the leaders of the gangster crew  
I like to be in jail and he likes to sing and dance(yay)  
Some say we're the perfect match  
  
Step off! Step back! Step awaaay! Step back! Don't step forward! Step back!
Don't step forwards! Step back! Backwards, don't step to me! Do not step to
meee! Grr  
  
I'm giving a shout out to my homies in cell block 8  
Being in jail sucks 'cause you always have to masturbate  
Except when a Jewish person goes to jail all my homies cheer  
They will make mince meat out of his rear  
Ben Peddy helped me make the gangster beat to this song  
I shot him in the face coz he looked at me wrong  
  
I'm a gangster  
I drop bombs like Hiroshima  
I'm a gangster  
Bitch suck on my wiener!  
I'm a gangster  
I drive a cool car  
I'm a gangster  
I smoke weed in a cigar  
  
Yo my gangster flow  
Yo, yo yo yo  
  
Nobody thought I'd blow up like a firestone tire-  
Oh there's no beat left  
  
(gunshots)  
Die, Die you Santa Clause die  
No I don't wanna do acapella  
  
I like to slap bitches  
I like to slap hoes...

She stares through my shadow  
She sees something more  
Believes there's a light in me  
She is sure  
And her truth makes me stronger  
Does she realize  
I awake every morning  
With her strength by my side  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
  
This world keeps on spinning  
Only she stills my heart  
She's my inspiration  
She's my northern star  
  
I don't count my possessions  
But all I call mine  
I will give her completely  
'Til the end of all time  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
  
In her eyes I see the sky  
And all I'll ever need  
In her eyes time passes by  
And she is with me  
  
I am not a hero  
I am not an angel  
I am just a man  
A man who's trying to love her  
Unlike any other  
  
In her eyes, I am  
In her eyes, I am

Jesus, joy of man's desiring  
Holy wisdom, love most bright  
  
Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring  
Soar to uncreated light  
  
Word of God, our flesh that fashioned  
With the fire of life impassioned  
Striving still to truth unknown  
Soaring, dying round Thy throne  
  
The original song continues with these words:  
Through the way where hope is guiding  
Hark, what peaceful music rings  
Where the flock, in Thee confiding  
Drink of joy from deathless springs  
Theirs is beauty's fairest pleasure  
Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure  
Thou dost ever lead Thine own  
In the love of joys unknown)

Let me fall  
Let me climb  
There's a moment when fear  
And dreams must collide  
  
Someone I am  
Is waiting for courage  
The one I want  
The one I will become  
Will catch me  
  
So let me fall  
If I must fall  
I won't heed your warnings  
I won't hear them  
  
Let me fall  
If I fall  
Though the phoenix may  
Or may not rise  
  
I will dance so freely  
Holding on to no one  
You can hold me only  
If you too will fall  
Away from all these  
Useless fears and chains  
  
Someone I am  
Is waiting for my courage  
The one I want  
The one I will become  
Will catch me  
  
So let me fall  
If I must fall  
I won't heed your warnings  
I won't hear  
  
Let me fall  
If I fall  
There's no reason  
To miss this one chance  
This perfect moment  
Just let me fall

I've tried to hold this back so long  
And we're always such a good thing when it's gone  
Would it be alright, if we just left our heads tonight  
  
Take me away from this old game  
Of saying that we're both too much the same  
  
Would it be alright, if I just stayed with you tonight  
And before I go, will I ever see you again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows  
If we'll give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows  
If it's special enough then we'll chose one another  
We'll chose each other  
  
You were the secret I loved to keep  
The name I would only sing in my sleep  
Would it be alright, if we just lose ourselves tonight  
And if you let go, will you reach out again  
She said love only knows  
  
Love only knows, if we'll give into fear and chose life undercover  
She said love only knows, if it's special enough then we'll chose one another  
We'll choose each other  
  
And I can't breathe without you and I don't  
And I can't live without love and I won't  
And I won't  
  
Love only knows  
If we'll give into fear and choose life undercover  
She said love only knows if it's special enough then we'll choose one another  
Love only knows, how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me under  
She said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each other  
And we need each other  
  
And I can't live without you and I won't

Hush now baby don't you cry  
Rest your wings my butterfly  
Peace will come to you in time  
And I will sing this lullaby  
No though I must leave, my child  
But I would stay here by your side  
And if you wake before I'm gone  
Remember this sweet lullaby  
And all love through darkness  
Don't you ever stop believing  
With love forlorn  
With love you'll find your way  
My love  
The world has turned the day to dark  
I leave this night with heavy heart  
When I return to dry your eyes  
I will send this lullaby  
Yes I will send this lullaby  
Oooooohhh  

Rising above  
Tension below  
Learn from the in-between  
  
Blinded by trust  
Asleep to the truth  
Awakened by disbelief  
  
But somewhere I've found  
Strength in my soul  
But still you refuse to see  
  
Are you sure I'm not all right  
Cause lately I've been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?  
Oh, you're a machine  
  
A world of your own  
Hollow inside  
Careful when worlds collide  
  
I'm filling my life  
With all it can hold  
I'll carry it on with pride  
  
Are you sure I'm not all right  
Cause lately I've been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?  
Oh, you're a machine  
  
The sun's still above  
All the rain that's coming down  
And I can fell the clouds drifting away  
Now the sky is open wide  
  
Turn the light on  
And you will see things so much clearer  
There's no heart, there's no heart  
And I've spent all this time feeling  
Something you can't feel at all  
You're a machine,  
Oh, you're a machine

Mi mancherai se te ne vai  
Mi manchera la tua serenita  
Le tue parole come canzoni al vento  
E l'amore che ora porti via  
  
Mi mancherai se te ne vai  
Ora per sempre non so come vivrei  
E l'allegria, amica mia  
Va via con te  
  
Mi mancherai, mi mancherai  
Perche vai via?  
Perche l'amore in te si spento  
Perche, perche?  
Non cambiera niente lo so  
E dentro sento te  
  
Mi mancherai, mi mancherai  
Perche vai via  
Perche l'amore in te si spento  
Perche, perche?  
Non cambiera niente lo so  
E dentro sento che  
  
Mi manchera l'immensita  
Dei nostri giorni e notti insieme noi  
I tuoi sorrisi quando si fa buio  
La tua ingenuita da bambina, tu  
  
Mi mancherai amore mio  
Mi guardo e trovo un vuoto  
Dentro me  
  
E l'allegria, amica mia  
Va via con te

And so my love  
From my window I can see  
A beautiful vision  
And when the music plays  
Your body rises like a bird of grace  
  
[Chorus]  
Mi morena  
I saw you dancing in the rain  
Holy water  
Shining like a silver flame  
Come like a ghost  
I will watch you dance alone  
Mi morena  
You're the light within my soul  
  
And so my love  
The way you're moving in your dress  
To a nylon guitar  
On wings of silk and lace  
You lift upon the notes and slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take this cross of feathers and bone  
Take this heart I've carved into stone  
In your name  
  
Where the setting sun surrenders to the moon  
Mi querida  
I will wait for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mi morena  
Hold your hands out to the light  
Be my lover  
I will fall into your eyes  
Sweet fire of love  
For you I'd steal the stars  
'Cause I adore you  
O my morena

Tu mia sola vita, tu mio solo cuore  
Dentro quanti cuori battelai,  
Tu mia sol aria, tu mio solo sole  
Dentro quanti occhi brillerai.  
Ti ricordi eri non uscivo fuori  
Da un dolore che non rivedrai,  
Grazie per l'honore, grazie per l'amore  
E per tutto il bene che mi dai,  
E' specialmente sai, per questi sogni miei  
Che vivono con noi  
  
Se mia per sempre, tu che lo sai  
Com'ero ieri, tu che mi volevi gia.  
Se mia per sempre, tu che eri la,  
Voce nel buio dicevi: per te sono qua.  
Tu mia sola luce, tu che mi dai voce,  
Tu che dai speranza ai giorni miei,  
Tu che mi colori tutti I miei pensieri,  
Senza te sognare non saprei.  
Vita mia tu sola, solo tu mio cuore,  
Quel che sono ti regalerei,  
Dentro una canzone troverai da sola  
Un po di quel bene che mi vuoi  
E' specialmente sai in questi sogni miei  
Che hai regalato a noi  
Se mia per sempre, tu che lo sai  
Com'ero ieri, tu che mi volevi gia  
Sei mia per sempre e sono la,  
Non piu nel buio, per dirti  
Per te io sono qua.  
Per sempre mia tu sei vorrai  
Per sempre tu mi avrai  
Per sempre nai  
Per sempre mia tu sei vorrai,  
Per sempre tuo mi avrai,  
Per sempre noi.  
  

I have been blind  
Unwilling  
To see the true love  
You're giving  
I have ignored every blessing  
I'm on my knees  
Confessing  
  
That I feel myself surrender  
Each time I see your face  
I am staggared by your beauty  
Your unassuming grace  
And I feel my heart is turning  
Falling into place  
I can't hide it  
Now hear my confession  
  
I have been wrong about you  
I thought I was strong without you  
For so long  
Nothing could move me  
For so long  
Nothing could change me  
  
Now I feel myself surrender  
Each time I see your face  
I am captured by your beauty  
Your unassuming grace  
And I feel my heart turning  
Falling into place  
I can't hide it  
Niow hear my confession  
  
You are the air that I breathe  
You're the ground beneath my feet  
When did I stop believing?

This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
This is my December  
This is my snow covered home  
This is my December  
This is me alone  
And I  
Just wish that  
I didn't feel  
Like there was  
Something I missed  
And I  
Take back all  
The things I said  
To make you  
Feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that  
I didn't feel  
Like there was  
Something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the  
Things I said to you  
  
And I give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
These are my snow covered dreams  
This is me pretending  
This is all I need  
  
And I  
Just wish that  
I didn't feel  
Like there was  
Something I missed  
And I  
Take back all  
The things I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that  
I didn't feel  
Like there was  
Something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things  
I said to you  
  
And I give it all away  
Just to have  
Somewhere to go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
  
And I give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to

So it goes, history shows  
Deserts must expand  
And camels sail like wooden ships  
Like women on the strand  
  
There's sand on Second Avenue  
And the wind blows like a train  
Taxis light up like a string of pearls  
Around the block again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
There's a bus that leaves at eight fifteen  
And another one at ten  
Should I climb aboard, risk everything  
And ride it to the end  
  
Watch the hills like roller coasters  
Up against the sky  
And wish that you were here by me  
So close that I could die  
  
You said love wrecks everything  
And none of us survive  
So I got over you last night  
And I am still alive  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again.

I watch the morning dawn upon your skin  
A splinter in the light  
It caught and frayed the very heart of us  
It's been hiding there inside for all this time  
How a sure thing winds up just like this  
Clockwork silence only knows  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's no one's fault  
There's no black and white  
Only you and me  
On this endless night  
And as the hours run away  
With another life  
Oh, darling can't you see it's now or never  
It's now or never  
  
Sweeping eggshells still at 3 am  
We're trying far too hard  
The tattered thought balloons above our heads  
Sinking in the weight of all we need to say  
Why's and what if's have since long played out  
Left us short on happy endings  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's now or never  
It's now or never  
  
You know that there's so much more  
And it's no one's fault  
There's no black and white  
Only you and me  
On our final night  
And as the hours run away  
With another life  
Oh, darling can't you see it's now or never  
It's now or never

O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord.  
  
Come and behold him,  
Born the King of angels  
  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation,  
O sing all ye citizens of heaven above  
Glory to God, Glory in the highest  
  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him  
Christ the Lord.  
  
Yes, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning  
Jesus, to thee be the glory given  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him  
Christ the Lord.

Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds  
Are far behind me  
  
And troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
  
Someday I'll wake and rub my eyes  
And in that land beyond the skies  
You'll find me  
  
I'll be a laughing daffodil  
And leave the silly cares  
That fill my mind behind me  
  
Oh somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
If birds can fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why oh why can't I?

Panis angelicus

She was morning, and I was night time  
I one day woke up  
To find her lying beside my bed  
I softly said "Come take me"  
For I've been lonely in need of someone  
As though I'd done someone wrong somewhere  
But I don't know where, I don't know where  
Come lately  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
  
Song she sang to me  
Song she brang to me  
Words that rang in me,  
Rhyme that sprang from me  
Warmed the night, and what was right  
Became me  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
  
And so it was that I came to travel  
Upon a road that was thorned and narrow  
Another place, another grace  
Would save me  
  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me  
You are the sun, I am the moon  
You are the words, I am the tune  
Play me...

Come with me and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
We'll begin with a spin  
Traveling in the world  
Of my creation  
What we'll see  
Will defy explanation  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with  
Pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
If you want to see magic land  
Close your eyes and you will see one  
Want to be a dreamer, be one  
Anytime you please  
And please save me one  
  
Come with me and you'll be  
In a world of pure imagination  
Take a look and you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
There is no place to go  
To compare with your imagination  
So go there to be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
Living there you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be

Wash away the thoughts inside  
That keep my mind away from you  
No more love and no more pride  
And thoughts are all I have to do  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and look up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the darkness I remain  
  
Tears of hope run down my skin  
Tears for you that will not dry  
They magnify the one within  
And let the outside slowly die  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and looked up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the water I remain  
  
Running down

Satellite in my eyes  
Like a diamond in the sky  
How I wonder.  
  
Satellite strung from the moon  
And the world your balloon  
Peeping Tom for the mother station.  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite  
  
Satellite headlines read  
Someone's secrets you've seen  
Eyes and ears have been  
  
Satellite dish in my yard  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Who's the king of your satellite castle?  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite  
  
Rest high above the clouds no restrictions  
Television we bounce 'round the world  
And while I spend these hours  
Five senses reeling,  
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes.  
  
Satellite in my eyes  
Like a diamond in the sky  
How I wonder.  
Satellite strung from the moon  
And the world your balloon  
Peeping Tom for the mother station  
  
Winter's cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasing  
Everything good needs replacing  
Look up, look down all around, satellite

My own love said to me  
My mother won't mind  
And my father won't smite you  
For your lack of kind  
  
She went away from me  
And this she did say  
It will not be long  
Til our wedding day  
  
She went away from me  
And she moved through the fair  
And slowly I watched her  
Move here and move there  
  
She went her way home ward  
With one star away  
As the swan in the evening  
Moves over the way  
  
I dreamed last night  
That my own love came in  
She came and so sweetly  
Her feet made no din  
  
She came close beside me  
And this, this she did say  
It will not be long love  
Til our wedding day

She's out of my life  
She's out of my life  
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry  
I don't know whether to live or die  
And it cuts like a knife  
She's out of my life  
  
It's out of my hands  
It's out of my hands  
To think for two years she was here  
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier  
Now the way that it stands  
She's out of my hands  
  
So I've learned that love's not possession  
And I've learned that love won't wait  
Now I've learned that love needs expression  
But I learned too late  
  
And she's out of my life  
She's out of my life  
Damned indecision and cursed pride  
Kept my love for her locked deep inside  
And it cuts like a knife  
She's out of my life

A waltz when she walks in the room  
She pulls back the hair from her face  
She turns to the window  
To sway in the moonlight  
Even her shadow has grace  
  
A waltz for the girl out of reach  
She lifts her hands up to the sky  
She moves with the music  
The song is her lover  
The melody's making her cry  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from a-far  
Calling me silently  
  
A waltz for the chance I should take  
But how will I know where to start?  
She's spinning between  
Constellations and dreams  
Her rhythm is my beating heart  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from a-far  
Calling me silently  
  
I can't keep on watching forever  
I give up this view just to tell her  
  
When I close my eyes, I can see  
The spotlights are bright on you and me  
We've got the floor  
And you're in my arms  
How could I ask for more?  
  
So she dances  
In and out of the crowd like a glance  
This romance is from a-far  
Calling me silently  
  
I can't keep on watching forever  
And I'm giving up this view just to tell her

All the towers of ivory are crumbling  
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks  
This is the time of our great undoing  
This is the time that I'll come running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time  
  
The light in our window is fading  
The candle gutters on the ledge  
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing  
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Once again  
  
And gone are the days of rainbows  
And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars  
For the sea will swallow up the mountains  
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks  
  
Straight at you  
But I'll come a-running  
Straight to you  
But I'll come a-running  
One more time  
  
Heaven has denied us its kingdom  
The saints are drunk and howling at the moon  
The chariots of angels are colliding  
Well, I'll run, babe, I'll come running  
  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time

Somedays, we forget to look around us,  
Somedays, we can't see the joy that surrounds us,  
So caught up inside ourselves,  
We take when we should give,  
So for tonight we pray for,  
What we know can be,  
And on this day we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though we all can still do more,  
There's so much to be thankful for,  
Look beyond ourselves,  
There's so much sorrow,  
It's way to late to say, I'll cry tomorrow  
Each of us must find our truth,  
It's so long overdue,  
So for tonight we pray for,  
  
What we know can be,  
And everyday, we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though we all can still do more,  
There's so much to be thankful for,  
Even with our differences,  
There is a place we're all connected,  
Each of us can find each others light,  
So for tonight, we pray for  
What we know can be,  
And on this day, we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though this world needs so much more  
There's so much to be thankful for.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
  
He's loaded lots of toys  
And goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said  
Many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety two,  
Although it's been said, many times many ways,  
Merry Christmas.  
Merry Christmas to you.

The First Noel, the Angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!  
  
They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East beyond them far  
And to the earth it gave great light  
So it continued both day and night.  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel!  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King, Born is the King, Born is the King of Israel!  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King, Born is the King, Born is the King of Israel!  
Israel, Israel, Born Israel, Israel, Born, Born Israel, Israel, Israel, Born
Israel,  
Born is the King of Israel!

See her as she flies  
Golden sails across the skies  
Close enough to touch  
But careful if you try  
Though she looks as warm as gold  
The moon's a harsh mistress  
The moon can be so cold  
  
Once the sun did shine  
And Lord it felt so fine  
The moon a phantom rose  
Through the mountains and the pine  
And then the darkness fell  
The moon's a harsh mistress  
It's hard to love her well  
  
I fell out of her eyes  
I fell out of her heart  
I fell down on my face, yes I did  
And I tripped and I missed my star  
And I fell and fell alone  
The moon's a harsh mistress  
The sky is made of stone  
  
The moon's a harsh mistress  
She's hard to call your own

I pray you'll be our eyes  
And watch us where we go  
And help us to be wise  
In times when we don't know  
  
Let this be our prayer  
When we lose our way  
Lead us to a place  
Guide us with your grace  
To a place where we'll be safe  
La luce che to dai  
  
I pray we'll find your light  
Nel cuore restero  
And hold it in our hearts  
A ricordarchi che  
When stars go out each night  
L'eterna stella sei  
Nella mia preghiera  
Let this be our prayer  
Quanta fede c'e  
When shadows fill our day  
Lead us to a place  
Guide us with your grace  
  
Give us faith so we'll be safe.  
Sognamo un mondo senza piu violenza  
  
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza  
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino  
Simbolo di pace e di fraternita  
  
La forza che ci dai  
We ask that life be kind  
E'il desiderio che  
And watch us from above  
Ognuno trovi amore  
We hope each soul will find  
Intorno e dentro a se  
Another soul to love  
  
Let this be our prayer  
Let this be our prayer  
Just like every child  
Just like every child  
  
Needs to find a place,  
Guide us with your grace  
Give us faith so we'll be safe  
E la fede che  
Hai acceso in noi  
Sento che ci salvera

Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me, in your memory  
  
Remember, when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
Just remember me  
  
I am the one star that keeps burning, so brightly,  
It is the last light, to fade into the rising sun  
  
I'm with you  
Whenever you tell, my story  
For I am all I've done  
  
Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me, in your memory  
Remember me  
  
I am that warm voice in the cold wind, that whispers  
And if you listen, you'll hear me call across the sky  
  
As long as I still can reach out, and touch you  
Then I will never die  
  
Remember, I'll never leave you  
If you will only  
Remember me  
  
Remember me...  
  
Remember, I will still be here  
As long as you hold me  
In your memory  
  
Remember, when your dreams have ended  
Time can be transcended  
I live forever  
Remember me  
  
Remember me  
Remember... Me...

Starry, starry night  
Paint your palette blue and grey  
Look out on a summer's day  
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  
Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and daffodils  
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colours on the snowy linen land  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
Starry, starry night  
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds and violet haze  
Reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue  
Colours changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath the artists' loving hand  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps they'll listen now  
  
For they could not love you  
But still your love was true  
And when no hope was left inside  
On that starry, starry night  
You took your life as lovers often do  
But I could have told you vincent  
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you  
  
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ragged men in ragged clothes  
The silver thorn of bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  
  
Now I think I know  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They're not listening still  
Perhaps they never will...

Fallen brother, he's a fallen husband  
He's about to be woken in his hospital bed  
He doesn't want to rest  
He just wants to run  
And he's tired of being told that he's the lucky one  
  
Caped crusader, she's a newborn leader  
But you should see her when her daughter's on the phone  
And she wipes the tears away  
And she laces up because there's still hell to pay  
And it sure feels like hell today, today  
  
And she says  
You see these hands they're bruised and brown  
They're yours alone  
Hold on love we're still going down  
Hold on love we're still fighting at home  
The war at home  
  
Innocence behind his broken expression  
He's a child of mercy he's our unlearned lesson  
And he's trying to wake up  
From this wilderness his world has now become  
He's reaching out to those he's running from  
  
And he says  
You see these hands they're bruised and brown  
They're yours alone  
Hold on now we're still going down  
Hold on now we're still fighting  
  
And it's (one step forward and two steps back)  
This is all who are marching  
(One step forward two steps back)  
This is young and old  
(One step forward two steps back)  
Through the void of silence  
You are not alone  
  
You see these hands they're a million strong  
They are yours now  
Hold on now we're all going down  
Hold on now we're all fighting at home  
The war at home

(Feat. Ladysmith Black Mambazo)  
  
I knew a man who lived in fear  
It was huge, it was angry,  
It was drawing near.  
Behind his house a secret place  
Was the shadow of the demon  
He could never face.  
  
He built a wall of steel and flame  
And men with guns to keep it tame  
Then standing back he made it plain  
That the nightmare would never ever rise again  
But the fear and the fire and the guns remain.  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
And then one day the neighbors came  
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame  
They stood around outside the wall  
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all  
"My friends," he said, "We've reached our goal  
The threat is under firm control  
As long as peace and order reign  
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain  
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remain. "  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
  
[Ladysmith's solo]  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
  
It doesn't matter now it's over anyhow  
He tells the world that it's sleeping  
But as the night came round I heard  
It's lonely sound  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping  
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.  
  
Say ah, say ah, say ah  
Say ah, say ah, say ah [to end]

What Child is this  
Who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping?  
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet,  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,  
Come Peasant, King to own Him  
The King of Kings salvation brings,  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.  
  
Oh, raise, raise a song on high,  
His mother sings her lullaby.  
Joy, oh joy for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary.  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe,  
The Son,  
Of Mary.  
  
What Child  
Is this  
Who laid  
To rest  
On Mary's lap  
On Mary's lap  
He is sleeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe,  
The Son,  
Of Mary  
  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
The Son of Mary

Kiss today goodbye  
The sweetness and the sorrow  
Wish me luck the same to hoo you  
But I can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Look, my eyes are dry  
The gift was ours to borrow  
It's as if we always knew  
And I won't forget  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
Gone, love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Love's what we'll remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Won't forget, can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love  
And I won't forget  
What I did for love  
  
Gone love is never gone  
As we travel on  
Love's what we'll remember  
  
Kiss today goodbye  
And point me toward tomorrow  
We did what we had to do  
Won't forget, can't regret  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
What I did for love  
  
What I did for love

Sometimes I remember reasons I let you go  
Inside them I see your face and all I really know  
I was scared to share the love I have inside of me  
Through all the heartache I know that I was meant to be...  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Crying eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always thought our love would see us through  
If I could follow my heart again it would be yours  
With every breath I would find a way to love you more  
I can't imagine life without your silent bravery  
And I'm grateful for every moment that I get to be...  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Loving eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always finds a way  
And if the stars should disappear  
In the dark I'll still be here  
Forever in your arms where I belong  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Loving eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always knew our love would see us through  
With you

Don't give up  
It's just the weight of the world  
When your heart's heavy  
I, I will lift it for you  
  
Don't give up  
Because you want to be heard  
If silence keeps you  
I, I will break it for you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well, I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Don't give up  
Because you are loved  
Don't give up  
It's just the hurt that you hide  
  
When you're lost inside  
I, I'll be there to find you  
Don't give up  
Because you want to burn bright  
If darkness blinds you  
I, I will shine to guide you  
Everybody wants to be understood  
  
Well, I can hear you  
Everybody wants to be loved  
Don't give up  
Because you are loved  
You are loved  
  
Ah!  
Don't give up  
It's just the weight of the world  
Don't give up  
Everyone needs to be heard  
You are loved

When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so weary  
When troubles come, and my heart burdened be  
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence  
Until you come and sit awhile with me  
  
[Chorus]  
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up to more than I can be  
  
There is no life, no life without it's hunger  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly  
But then you come, and I am filled with wonder  
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
  
You raise me up to more than I can be

When you walk through a storm  
Hold your head up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
There's a golden sky  
And the sweet silver song of the lark  
  
Walk on, through the wind  
Walk on, through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Hold your head up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
There's a golden sky  
And the sweet silver song of the lark  
  
Walk on, through the wind  
Walk on, through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone  
  
Walk on, through the wind  
Walk on, through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone  
Never walk alone

Seems like our love is on a road to nowhere fast  
All my life I thought a love like this would last  
But every road can hide a corner we can't see  
I had a vision that I woke up by your side  
I felt you breathing and our souls were intertwined  
But who controls love's destiny? Not me.  
  
We had it all right in our hands,  
We had the space to fly and still a place to land  
  
So I'm calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
I'm reaching out and praying you'll come back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
And you're the only place my heart has ever been.  
  
Maybe I'm young and in the ways of love naive  
Maybe I'm desperate for a reason to believe  
There wasn't any way I thought that we would fall.  
I've seen perfection in a rainbow in the sky  
I've seen a child make the coldest grown man cry  
But loving you I thought was greater than them all.  
  
We had it all, just you and me  
Now there's a doorway to my heart without a key  
  
So I'm calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
I'm reaching out and praying you'll come back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
And you're the only place my heart has ever been.  
  
Wherever you are right now  
Come back and show me how you feel  
Becasue I'm lost without you here  
  
Calling out, I'm calling out to the only one  
Who can save us from what we've done  
Don't leave me hanging on  
And I'm reaching out and praying you'll coem back again  
It's just darkness I'm living in  
Cause you're the only place my heart has ever been.
