Beyond the reef  
Where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone  
And my dreams grow old  
  
There'll be no tears  
There'll be no regretting  
Will she remember me  
Will she forget?  
  
I'll send a thousand flowers  
When the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart,  
'Cause I love her so  
  
Someday I know  
She'll come back again to me  
'Til then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef  
  
I'll send a thousand flowers  
Where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart,  
'Cause I love her so  
  
Someday I know  
She'll come back again to me  
'Til then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef

Oh they say some people long ago  
Were searching for a different tune  
One that they could croon as only they can  
  
They heard the breeze in the trees  
Singing weird melodies  
And they made that the start of the blues  
  
And from a jail came the wail  
Of a down-hearted frail  
And they played that as part of the blues  
  
From a whippoorwill out on a hill  
They took a new note  
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note  
  
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it  
And gave out the news  
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

Blessed assurance  
Jesus is mine  
Oh what a foretaste  
Of glory divine.  
  
Heir of salvation  
Purchase of God  
Born of his spirit  
Washed in his blood.  
  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long.  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long.  
  
Perfect submission  
All is at rest  
I in my savior  
Am happy and blessed  
Watching and waiting  
Looking above  
Filled with his goodness  
And lost in his love.  
  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long.  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long.  
Praising my savior  
All the day long

Somebody listen, I'm a voice in the distance cryin'  
Come see about me  
I am a stranger in a world filled with anger  
Come see about me  
I'm gettin' weary tryin' to carry this load all by myself  
I'm bone tired and fallin', can't you hear me callin'  
I need somebody's help  
  
I am a young man growin' wild across this land  
Come see about me  
I'm fourscore and twenty and I ain't got anybody  
Come see about me  
I'm somebody's children alone and forsaken, a wave  
That's lost at sea  
I'm right here behind you, I'm all around you,  
So slow down  
Turn around and you will see  
  
I'm your mother, your sister and your brother  
Come see about me  
I am a baby, my mother ain't no lady  
Come see about me  
I am your maker, the giver and the taker  
Come see about me

Cold house  
Just before dawn  
Oh my God  
This feels so wrong  
Clouds roll in  
And cover the sun  
A new day begins  
Day one  
  
Day one  
And it already feels like forever  
It's over and done  
So what can I do?  
Day one  
Of putting my life back together  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you  
  
Gold ring  
There on the bed  
Oh my God  
She meant what she said  
No place to hide  
No where to run  
Just dying inside  
Day one  
  
Day one  
And it already feels like forever  
It's over and done  
So what can I do?  
Day one  
Of putting my life back together  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you  
  
Day one  
Of learning to live without you

Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love  
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above  
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all  
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall  
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you  
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill  
  
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between  
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing  
And everyone is different and everyone's the same  
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill  
  
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers  
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill  
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December  
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill  
And longer than the song of the whippoorwill

All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
This world is not my home  
But it's a pretty good location  
I don't like the short-put  
That's enough conversation  
  
So while I got the chance  
I think I'll take the time to dance  
And dance and dance  
  
I'm gonna reach for the sky  
Live while I'm alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
I'm gonna let somebody else  
Take care of all the worry  
Changin' my direction  
And I won't be in a hurry  
  
I'm gonna slow it down  
While the world goes spinnin' 'round  
And 'round and 'round  
  
I'm gonna enjoy the ride  
Live while I'm alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
I can't build a mountain  
No, I can't fill up an ocean  
No, I ain't that smart  
I ain't that smart  
  
I don't know how He did it  
But I'm givin' God the credit  
God, how great Thou art  
How great Thou art  
  
How great Thou art  
  
I'm gonna bait the hook  
And let the worm do all the fishin'  
Kick back on the bank  
And be a man without a mission  
  
I'm gonna slow it down  
While the world goes spinnin' 'round  
And 'round and 'round  
  
I'm gonna enjoy the ride  
Live while I'm alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like this  
  
This world is not my home  
But it's a pretty good location  
I don't like the short-put  
That's enough conversation  
  
So while I got the chance  
I think I'll take the time to dance  
And dance and dance  
  
I'm gonna reach for the sky  
Live while I'm alive  
  
Like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that  
  
Yeah, just like that  
  
All like that and everything and all  
Everything and all like that

They took Your commandments off the schoolhouse walls  
They say, "It's a crime to even pray within the halls"  
But bless the child that lets You in and knows without a doubt  
Once you live inside a heart, they can't take You out  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Here's to those across the land, working in a place  
Where the boss man and the government say they can't share their faith  
But they know all too well they'll lose their job if they get caught  
But to win a soul for Jesus, they will risk it all because  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
In the God of all creation, we put our faith and trust  
And give our lives to You 'cause You gave Your life for us  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Everywhere we go  

I don't have faith in technology,  
Even though we created it.  
All this stuff just breaks down anyway,  
And you can never get it fixed.  
But I do have faith in you.  
  
I don't have faith in politics,  
But I do believe in the will of the people.  
I don't know much about big time religion  
But I believe in the cross on the steeple.  
And I do have faith in you.  
  
[Bridge:]  
And after all this time the lie becomes the truth  
We traded in our innocence and sacrificed our youth.  
But you give me your love the one thing I can't lose  
You believe in me,  
And I still have faith in you.  
  
[Interlude:]  
  
The more I search for my significance,  
Seems the more I disappear.  
And I wonder, have I made a difference in anybody's life  
Since I've been here.  
And I can hear your laughter it's the sweetest sound I've ever known.  
I don't know how love happens,  
But I know I'm not alone.  
And I do have faith in you.  
  
[Bridge:]  
And after all this time sometimes I see the truth  
And I'm touched by your innocence and  
Now I'm not confused.  
You give my your love, the one thing I can't lose.  
You believe in me,  
And I still have faith in...  
I do have faith in you.

Well I wanna talk to you for a minute,  
About an old man I met,  
He said,Boy, you look in trouble,  
And I bet your life's a mess,  
He said, I used to have the same problem too,  
I was way out of control,  
You know the only thing that set it right for me,  
Was a little good old rock and roll,  
(Chorus 1)  
I put my feet on the rock,  
And my name on the roll,  
When it's called up yonder,  
I won't worry 'bout my soul,  
I know my home is waiting,  
And it's something to behold,  
I put my feet on the rock,  
And my name on the roll,  
(Verse 2)  
I'd never heard the gosple,  
Spread like that before,  
I guess the message comes in many ways,  
Those simple words of wisdom,  
Can open heaven's door,  
So every time I get the chance I say,  
(Chorus 2)  
Come on, put your feet on the rock,  
And your name on the roll,  
When it's called up yonder,  
You won't worry 'bout your soul,  
You know your home is waiting,  
And it's something to behold,  
So put your feet on the rock,  
And your name on the roll,  
Repeat  

You may think that I'm talking foolish  
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free  
You may wonder how I can promise you now  
This love that I feel for you always will be  
But you're not just time that I'm killin'  
I'm no longer one of those guys  
As sure as I live, this love that I give  
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  
  
Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever, amen  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful  
I'll be happy to tell you again  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen  
  
They say time take its toll on a body  
Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray  
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair  
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway  
They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry  
Make people forget things they knew  
Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me  
I've already forgotten ev'ry woman but you  
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever  
Forever and ever, amen  
  
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather  
As long as old women sit and talk about old men  
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful  
Well, just listen to how this song ends  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen  
I'm gonna love you forever and ever  
Forever and ever, forever and ever  
Forever and ever, amen

I took you for granted  
So many years  
I gave you no hope  
Broken promises and tears  
But when I was down  
It was you who was there  
To pick up the pieces and show me you care  
  
Forever together  
Til' death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
I'll give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each other's arms  
  
You seem to know  
What we had all along  
And you had the love  
And the faith to go on  
It took some time but now I realize  
That I see it all when I look in your eyes  
  
Forever together  
Til' death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
I give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each other's arms  
Forever together  
In each other's arms

My Grandpa farmed for a livin',  
Content to live the simpler kind of life.  
My Grandma worked in the kitchen,  
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.  
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,  
Each mornin' they wake up,  
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.  
  
Here I am, ring on my finger,  
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.  
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.  
I wish they were here to see the two of us.  
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,  
Each mornin' we wake up,  
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.  
  
With the highway twice as wide,  
And the farmland sub-divided.  
It's good to know that some things never change.  
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',  
By those simple words of wisdom:  
Life an' love come down to just four things.  
  
My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,  
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.  
And each day, I count my blessings,  
To have that kind of love here by my side.  
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,  
Each mornin' we wake up,  
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.  
  
Yeah, we've got everything that we need,  
Between the two of us,  
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

I didn't come in here to fight  
I didn't come to ruin your night  
I came to see the future mister me  
I didn't come to mess things up  
I only want to wish you luck  
And shake the hand of the future mister me  
  
I only want a chance  
To see the man who'll be the man to please my baby  
The one who'll lay beside you  
And hold you just the way I used to do  
I want to know you're happy  
And I want to know he treats you like a lady  
And if I can see you're in good hands  
Maybe I can make it without you  
  
You look so happy by his side  
And I'm sure you'll make a lovely bride  
And he loves you, any fool can plainly see  
The pain is just too much for me  
So I'll just leave and let you be  
All alone with the future mister me  
  
You'll be alone here with the future mister me

Go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Hey go, tell it on that mountain  
Jesus Christ is born  
  
Go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I say go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
While shepherds kept their watching  
Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
  
Go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I said go, tell it on that mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
Down in that lonely manger  
The humble Christ was born  
God sent to us salvation  
Born that Christmas morn  
  
Hey go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I said go, tell it on that mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
I said go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I said go, tell it on that mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
I say go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I said go, tell it on that mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
Hey go, tell it on that mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
I said go, tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born

I never been too good at doing right  
Done mostly wrong most all my life  
I never found a place to settle down  
Baby I do believe I found it now  
  
I'm gonna walk that line - gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale - gonna work real hard  
Doin' anything that you want me to  
Baby I'm gonna walk that line for you  
  
Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you  
Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you  
Do anything that you want me to  
Ooh I'm gonna walk that line for you  
  
Well straight and narrow if ever was my past  
Everlasting love never seem to last  
I used to be a Tomcat out on the prowl  
But baby I'm just your puppy dog now  
  
I'm gonna walk that line - gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale - gonna work real hard  
Doin' anything that you want me to  
Baby I'm gonna walk that line for you

I never been too good at doin right  
Done mostly wrong, most all my life  
Never found a place to settle down  
But baby I do believe I found it now  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna walk that line  
Gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale  
Gonna work real hard  
Doin anything that you want me to  
'cause baby I'm gonna walk that line for you  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you.....  
  
If strait an' narrow ever was my path,  
And everlasting love never seemed to last,  
Used to be a tomcat out on the prowl  
But baby I'm just your puppy dawg now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you...  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you...  
Do anything that you want me to...  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you.....

Since the day I was led to temptation  
And in weakness did let your love down  
I have prayed that with time and compassion  
You'd come around  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep waiting for you to forgive me  
And you keep saying you can't even start  
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown  
To the hard rock bottom of your heart  
To the hard rock bottom of your heart  
  
Now this home we have built is still standing  
Its foundation is on solid ground  
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it  
Or burn it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can't just block it out we've got to talk it out  
Until our hearts get back in touch  
I need your love I miss it I can't go on like this is  
Hurts too much

There's not a mean bone in my body  
I never could be unkind  
I know we're not talking  
But there's something on my mind  
  
It ain't rightteous indignation  
I don't plan to rant or rave  
No need for us to fight and fuss  
I just want to say  
  
Have a nice rest of your life without me  
I'll be proud to be a part of your history  
If it makes you happy, honey  
Keep talking bad about me  
And have a nice rest of your life without me  
  
I know you're not heartless  
Not callous and you're not cruel  
And I know you don't mean to  
When you treat me like a fool  
  
I believe that your good nature  
Will emerge with someone else  
If I can't be beside you  
I can be beside myself.  
  
Have a nice rest of your life without me  
I'll be proud to be a part of your history  
If it makes you happy, honey  
Keep talking bad about me  
And have a nice rest of your life without me  
  
Without me  
Don't forget your pocketbook, honey  
Or your toothbrush  
Don't forget you toothbrush, dear...

He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck,  
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck.  
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck,  
I thought that he walked on water.  
  
He said he was a cowboy when he was young.  
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.  
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,  
And I thought that he walked on water.  
  
[Chorus]  
If the story's told, only heaven knows.  
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.  
And although his wings, they were never seen.  
I thought that he walked on water.  
  
Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,  
And said, "son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot."  
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot.  
Then I'd flop down beside him.  
  
And he was ninety years old in sixty-three  
And I loved him and he loved me.  
And lord, I cried the day he died,  
  
Cause I thought that he walked on water.  
  
[Chorus]

I found myself  
In a cross condition  
Maybe it was her  
Maybe it was me  
Somethin's wrong  
There was somethin' missin'  
I couldn't stand to stay  
So I had to leave  
  
A half a tank of gas  
Brought me this distance  
Half a mind to run  
Got me this far  
There's a woman willin'  
Where there ain't no witness  
'Cept the one that lives  
In my heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Won't lie to me  
It won't tell me things  
That I can't believe  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
'Cause it don't feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
I could be tastin'  
Stolen kisses  
But that might  
Tear my world apart  
When it all comes down  
To my wish of wishes  
I'd have to go with  
My heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Won't lie to me  
It won't tell me things  
That I can't believe  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
'Cause it don't feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
I better stop this thing  
Before it starts  
'Cause it don't feel right  
To my heart of hearts  
  
My heart of hearts  
Won't lie to me

Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes and let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore you  
Hope for a life spent with you  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that you're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh, so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly you came to the earth you created  
All for love's sake became poor  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that you're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross

If I'd have been all you ever wanted  
I wonder how much better I'd be  
And I know you think it's over  
'Cause you're so far away  
But darlin' you're still here with me  
  
And I will hold you always  
No matter how far we're apart  
You could be anywhere in the world tonight  
But I'd still have you here in my heart  
  
I don't try to forget you, don't cry over regrets  
And I always know right where you are  
So I'll be happy just to hold you  
Here in my heart  
Till I have you back in my arms  
  
And I will hold you always  
No matter how far we're apart  
You could be anywhere in the world tonight  
And I'd still have you here in my heart  
Darlin' you could be anywhere in the world tonight  
And I'd still have you here in my heart.

I ain't live forever but I've lived enough  
And I've learned to be gentle and I've learned to be tough  
I've found only two things that last to the end  
One is your heroes and the other your friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else  
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
I grew up with cowboys I watched on tv  
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be  
Years have gone by but now and again  
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else  
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends

A hundred cups of coffee, five hundred cigarettes  
A thousand miles of highway and I ain't forgot her yet  
But I keep on moving, I keep moving down the line  
There ain't nothing in my mirror, just a cloud of dust and smoke  
But what do you expect when some old trucker's heart gets broke  
Yeah, trucker's hearts gets broke  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
Ten miles out of nashville, I was doing a hundred and one  
State boy me over and he said, "Where's the fire, son?"  
He said, "Where's the fire son?"  
I said "Man, there ain't no fire, I'm just running from a flame  
Go on and write your ticket, but I ain't the one to blame"  
That county judge tried to rob me blind.  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
So I rolled on down to Memphis  
I had nothing left to lose  
I wanted to hear some rock and roll, but all they played was blues  
I didn't wanna hear no blues  
So I went to call up Elvis and Roger Miller grabbed the phone  
He said drive that 18 wheeler, boy, you're the king of the road  
Said I was the king of the road  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  
But them big wheels of rubber are gonna rub her off my mind  
I'm a highway junkie, I need that old white line  
  

Dirt road in the twilight, woods so cool and dark.  
Up ahead pale neon, somewhere a dog barks,  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Breaking up the pool balls, chalking up the cues  
Jukebox pumping softly, lazy summer blues  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Through the blue smoky haze, all through the haze  
Trouble seems to melt away,  
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul  
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way  
  
My arms around my baby, shufflin' on the floor  
Cigarettes and saw-dust, squeaky old screen door.  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.  
  
Outside the dark is falling, stars are twinkling bright  
That old hoot owl is calling, every-things all right  
  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.

Intro:  
Once upon a time in our life  
We held the key to every door  
And I that I desired  
Was you forever more  
I found love in a heart  
Once broken far beyond repair  
And you restored a sole  
That had forgotten how to care  
Everything we needed  
Was at our beckon call  
With you and I together  
We could conquer all  
When I needed badly  
To be cheered up for a while  
You were there  
And all you had to do was simply smile  
And holding things together  
Was so easy for us to do  
For you could turn to me for help  
And I could turn to you  
And jealousy was something  
That never entered our hearts  
For we were made for one another  
No matter where we are  
When things were at there darkest  
I could hold you next to me  
And I knew all would be okay  
For you were strong and I was weak  
So given every chance for me  
To start my life anew  
There'd be no question  
I'd do it all again with you  
  

I wake up to the silence  
In a room where I once heard "Good Morning Dear"  
I never thought I'd miss the early morning smell  
Of hairspray in the air  
All the little things I used to take for granted  
Now I miss them most of all  
Ain't it funny how a woman walking out the door  
Can bring a man to crawl  
And I'd surrender all  
To bring you back to me  
Give up everything I own  
Get down on my hands and knees  
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall  
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all  
Now I'm staring out the window  
Praying every passing car would bring you home  
So I could take you in my arms  
And give the kind of love  
You should have known  
And I'd surrender all  
To bring you back to me  
Give up everything I own  
Get down on my hands and knees  
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall  
Oh, If you would only call, I'd surrender all  
If you would only call, I'd surrender all

Well I lost my heart on the day we met.  
But I gained a lot, and that I don't regret.  
  
Then I hung around, till you said, "I do".  
  
I knew I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well it changed my thinking And it changed your name.  
And Neither one of us will ever be the same.  
  
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue,  
Cause, I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
If I didn't have you.  
I'd long ago,  
Been left in the dark, out in the cold.  
  
Blowing around from town to town.  
Like a feather in the wind.  
  
If I didn't have you.  
I know I'd be.  
Floundering around like a ship at sea.  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane,  
And that's where I'd have been.  
  
  
But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light.  
Shining, like a beacon on a cold dark night.  
And, The sun came up and The skies turned blue.  
  
No I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well I count my blessings every night I pray.  
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day.  
And, Every day he does cause, God knows too.  
  
That I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
If I didn't have you,  
I'd long ago.  
Been left in the dark, out in the cold.  
Blowing around from town to town  
Like a feather in the wind.  
  
If I didn't have you,  
I know I'd be  
Floundering around like a ship at sea.  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane,  
And that's where I'd have been.  
  
But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light.  
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night.  
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue.  
  
No I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well I've already said it but I swear its true.  
I know I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.

I'll be right here loving you  
  
As long as this world's spinning like it's supposed to do  
I'll be right here loving you

Some glad morning when this life is o'er  
I'll fly away  
To a home on God's celestial shore  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
When the shadows of this life grow have grown  
I'll fly away  
Like a bird from prison bars has flown  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
I'll fly away  
To that land where joy shall never end  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away  
  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by

I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know he'll make them right  
Then I'll ask him to forgive me  
For the things that I've done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
This world can be a struggle  
Just livin' day to day  
You'll run into the devil  
With every step you take  
I seen his face a hundred times  
As he tried to lead me wrong  
He don't understand  
That I don't walk this road alone  
I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know he'll make them right  
Then I'll ask him to forgive me  
For the things that I've done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
Lord said I could call on him  
When ever I feel low  
Any time or place I needed him  
He would gladly go  
My life has not been perfect  
No matter how I try  
But he's never turned his back on me  
And that's the reason why  
I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know he'll make them right  
Then I'll ask him to forgive me  
For the things that I've done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
I'm gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
When I get home tonight  
Gonna tell him all about my troubles  
And I know he'll make them right  
Then I'll ask him to forgive me  
For the things that I've done wrong  
Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home  
I'm Gonna have a little talk with Jesus  
Tonight when I get home

All our days are numbered  
Some live on borrowed time  
But life is what you make it  
Thank God I was so inclined  
To accept my Lord and Savior  
When the good news sunk in  
He paid a heavenly price  
By giving His life  
And I can't wait to go home to Him  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
When there's no tomorrow  
And glory has come down  
Those without Jesus  
Are lost and never to be found  
So please listen when I'm talking  
I'm just saying what needs to be said  
Make plans while your still living  
It's too late when your dead  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
Oh, once this old world sets me free

If you want someone  
Who'll always do his best  
Who'll understand  
Look no farther  
Than across this room we're in  
If you want someone  
Who'll always stand by you  
No matter where or when  
I'm your man  
Honey I'm your man  
If you need someone  
To hold you when the storms start closing in  
Someone who'll protect you  
Or walk with you hand in hand  
If you think you'd like to be adored forever  
By your best friend  
I'm your man  
Honey I'm your man  
I thank god each day  
For giving us each other  
And for making dreams reality  
By bringing us together  
So if you want someone  
Who'll love you now and forever  
And be your best friend  
I'm your man  
Honey I'm your man  
I'm your man  
Honey I'm your man  
  

In a heart like mine  
With a steady beat  
Just the right rhythm makes you feel complete  
And the rhythm's right with you and I  
And love starts pounding in a heart like mine  
  
Put a quart or two  
With a melody  
Bring in a little chill bump harmony  
Then let it build  
Til the feelings right  
And love starts playing in heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
There's a sympony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
Thre's poetry  
In truth, emotion and honesty  
So when the soul is there  
And the words all rhyme  
Love starts singing in a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
There's a symphony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
There's a sympony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine

I come to the garden alone  
While the dew  
Is still on the roses  
And the voices I hear  
Falling on my ear  
The son of God discloses.  
  
And he walks with me  
And he talks with me  
And he tells me I am his own  
And the joy we share  
As we tarry there  
None other has ever known.  
  
He speaks  
And the sound  
Of his voice  
Is so sweet the birds  
Hush their singin'  
And the melody  
That He gave to me  
Within my hearts is ringing.  
  
And he walks with me  
And he talks with me  
And he tells me I am his own  
And the joy we share  
As we tarry there  
None other has ever known.  
  
And the joy we share  
As we tarry there  
None other has ever known

Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient  
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time  
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall  
Just how the dream went  
And all but this broken heart in me I guess is doing fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is it still over, are we still through  
Since my phone still ain't ringing I assume it still ain't you  
I've half a mind to take the time to find somebody new  
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you  
  
That lie that I tried to slip by you  
Was told with good intentions  
It was just another way to say I love you  
And protect you from the truth  
Half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of pure prevention  
And trying to explain while I'm insane  
Is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
If I repeat myself it's cause I've nothing else to do  
And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

Someday, someway you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, you're going to need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
Go on, go on til you reach the end of the line  
Cause I know you'll pass my way again  
Its just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had  
  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
Remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love is a true love  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Words are spoken with chords played  
Someday and someway  
Girl you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes darling, I know you gonna need me again  
Its just a matter of time  
  
Continue singing here  
After I gave you everything I had  
You laughed and you called me a clown  
But remember in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
  
That my love was a true love  
Its just a matter of time

I'll just turn away, there's not need to watch her leaving  
I don't want to let her see me cry  
And the part of me that's breaking  
Is The part that has been taking her for granted  
And that's why she said goodbye  
I twas me that let her down and left her lonely  
But her leaving me was never in my plan  
It started with my lying  
And it ended with me crying  
And she's taken all the lonely she can stand  
It's out of my hands now  
It's over and done  
She's made her choice now  
And I'm not the one  
She'll find her future with some other man  
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see  
Now it's out of my hands.  
She tried every way she knew to make me happy  
She was more than just a lover and a friend  
I was just too blind to see  
And now she set me free  
So it's best to walk away and let it end  
It's out of my hands now  
It's over and done  
She's made her choice now  
And I'm not the one  
She'll find her future with some other man  
It was all up to me but I just couldn't see  
Now it's out of my hands.  
  

Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright.  
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleigh song tonight.  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
Come on  
  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
Play it again  
  
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square  
In the frosty air.  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go riding riding in a one-horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock.  
  
(hey, that was great.)  
(can we do it one more time guys?)"here we go were rolling"  
  
What a bright time, its the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time its a swell time  
To go riding on a one-horse sleigh  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle in the jinglin' beat  
That's the jungle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
What a bright time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Its the right time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Sing it again now  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Come one now  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Jingle, bell time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Its swell time

I remember how it used to feel  
Riding down old two mile hill  
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars  
Paying no mind to the passing cars  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here  
  
[Chorus]  
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall  
No net, just you to catch me when I fall  
Look heart, no hands.  
  
It took a little time to get up to speed  
To find the confidence and strength I need  
To just let go and reach for the sky  
You Know sometimes it felt I could fly.  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It doesn't take much, just a smile or a touch  
And I'm a kid again, I can almost feel that wind  
  
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me, all night long.  
So many lover's games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But on the other hand, there's a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else  
  
[Chorus]

At a quick shop somewhere west of Albuquerque  
Got a tank of gas and a cold drink and a beef jerky  
The cashier she gave me a smile  
So I stood there and I talk to her a while  
  
She said where you headed I hope you get there soon  
I've seen em all day long from 4am till noon  
Some are running from  
Some are running too  
Some are running blind  
Lord  
Which one are you  
  
I said it don't appear to me to be so cut and dry  
You don't know me from Adam  
can it be so black and white  
I said I got a plan you see I got it figured out  
How can you be so sure my dear what I'm all about  
  
She said Ive stood in this window for 27 years  
I can tell your cash or credit  
I can tell your brand of beer  
  
I can tell you who's a liar  
And the truth is plain to see  
That's your last twenty boy  
and don't you lie to me  
  
Theirs a girl  
In Albuquerque crying (ain't she)  
And your standing in a quick shop  
Lying (Ain't ya)  
  
Well  
She handed back my twenty  
Said you know what to do  
If you drive it steady son  
You'll be home this afternoon  
And I hate to judge you  
I don't mean to seem unkind  
But there ain't no use in running  
If you're only running blind  
  
Oh their ain't no use in running  
If you're only running blind

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He was 16, tender and tough.  
She was too, and he'd do anything to prove his love.  
With so much riding on the choice at hand,  
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man.  
  
Hearts caught fire and love ran wild.  
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child.  
With so much riding on the choice at hand,  
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man.  
  
There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right.  
But, you live with decisions that you make in your life.  
And what steers your direction is hard to understand,  
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man  
  
Now he drives a diesel out of Dallas,  
Hauling cars out to the coast.  
It ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago.  
But tonight at a truck stop, while drinking a cup,  
The waitress grins and winks at him,  
And says,

There's a land that is fairer than day  
And by faith we can see it afar  
And the father waits over the way  
To prepare us a dwelling place there.  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.  
  
To our bountiful father above  
We will offer our tribute of praise  
For the glorious gift of his love  
And the blessings that hallow our days.  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

When I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor  
I thank Him for the day that He gave me one more  
I give Him all the praise, the one that I adore  
That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus  
I was lost and all alone, my heart in need of help  
I found eternal life and lost my fear of death  
Because I know the author of my every breath  
That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus  
God of glory, majesty  
The Holy One who died for me  
Who's the one I long to see?  
That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus  
If you're a soul that's lost and in need of direction  
You wonder when you die if you go to Heaven  
Well friend I've found the answer to that very question  
That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus  
God of glory, majesty  
The Holy One who died for me  
Who's the one I long to see?  
That's Jesus, oh that's Jesus  
That's Jesus, that's Jesus  

Hope you didn't burn too many bridges  
On your way back to haunt my heart  
Cause it's safe behind these stones and ridges  
You know how us healin' victims are  
I take comfort where I find it  
In the neon and the crowds  
I guess someone like me designed it  
This place where old flames aren't allowed  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a border you can cross  
There's a wall that you can climb  
The space is drawn too wide  
Between your world and mine  
You're already broke my heart  
(And) I won? let you break my mind  
As far as your memory goes  
That's where I draw the line  
  
I'll bet this isn't how you planned it  
I've picked myself up off the ground  
These legs are shakin' but they?e standin'  
And I won? let you knock me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's where I draw the line

He was just a carpenter by trade  
He learned from his father at a very early age  
There was something special in the man  
There was much more to his life  
Than just working with his hands  
And He'd say  
"There's no home I could design  
That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind  
If you only took the time"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love your neighbor like your brother  
Treat your brother like a friend  
Always turn the other cheek  
Help the weary and the weak  
Make the time for young and old  
And as your life unfolds  
Each kindness that you've shown  
Will be the nails and hammers  
As you build your final ladder  
In the manner of the carpenter of old  
  
You could feel compassion in his eyes  
Only fools that hurt him did not realize  
That he was speaking to us all  
The righteous and the mighty  
The silent and the small  
And He'd say "  
There's no home I could design  
That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind  
If you'd only take the time"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He was just a carpenter by trade  
He learned from his father at a very early age

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!

My father's father was the wisest man i ever knew  
Sixty years of education  
Seven years of school  
Farming kept his body strong  
At night the only books he owned  
Kepted his mind sharp as a tack  
The family bible and the farmer's almanac  
  
When to plant  
When to harvest  
How you weed just what you sow  
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't  
There was a plan for defrost  
Salvation for the lost  
Words to live and die by front to back  
The family bible and the farmer's almanac  
  
One came from his mother  
Handed down the day she died  
The co-op sent the other  
Every year at Christmastime  
He knew the seasons to the day  
Knew Paul and peter by first name  
He could answer any question he was asked  
With the family bible and the farmer's almanac  
  
When to plant  
When to havest  
How you weed just what you sow  
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it don't  
There was a plan for defrost  
Salvation for the lost  
Words to live and die by front to back  
The family bible and the farmer's almanac  
  
He knew the way to get  
Through this life to the next  
While others spoke of faith  
He found the facts  
In the family bible and the farmer's almanac  
The family bible and the farmer's almanac

He was born in Bethlehem they say,  
There was a star to light the path to where He lay.  
Rich or poor they came from far and near,  
Cause they'd all heard the reason He was here.  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all.  
Put on this earth to hang there on that cross.  
Born to die so we could live.  
He had the birthday, we got the gift.  
  
They wrapped him up with gentle hands.  
God hoped the world would understand.  
Eternal life we shall receive.  
And all that He asks in return is that we just believe.  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all.  
Put on this earth to hang there on that cross.  
Born to die so we could live.  
He had the birthday, we got the gift.  
There's no way in this world we could repay  
The miracle He gave us on that day.  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all,  
put on this earth to hang there on that cross,  
born to die so we could live.  
He had the birthday, we got the gift.  
  
On our Savior's birthday, we got the gift.
