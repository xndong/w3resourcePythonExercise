Guard your body with the best barbed wire  
And ward off foe with the fiercest of fire  
But let love unguarded into the strangest of nights  
  
Wear your dresses like they're up for hire  
And leave them with your humour in the tumble dryer  
And watch yourself stumble down a lane with no lights  
  
School like life turns some men into mice  
What you need now is a little piece of mouse advice  
  
Well they say be wary of strangers  
Especially if they offer you sweets  
But there ain't no government health warning  
On half the mad fuckers you meet  
  
Save yourself personal tradegy  
Go back to the man with the sweets  
Do yourself schooling favour  
Head back to the man with the sweets  
  
Those who feared cancer never had much to say  
They bored us at parties onto forty a day  
They forced us into corners and onto forty a day  
  
The dentiist's chair is the only time  
That anybody ever looks at their mouth  
Let the dentist give their teeth something to chatter about  
  
School like life turns some men into mice  
To avoid the rat-trap take the mouse's advice  
  
Well they say be wary of strangers  
Especially if they offer you sweets  
But there ain't no government health warning  
On half the mad fuckers you meet  
  
Save yourself personal tradegy  
Go back to the man with the sweets  
Do yourself schooling favour  
Head back to the man with the sweets  

I need a little time  
To think it over  
I need a little space  
Just on my own  
I need a little time  
To find my freedom  
I need a little  
  
Funny how quick the milk turns sour  
Isn't it, isn't it  
Your face has been looking like that for hours  
Hasn't it, hasn't it  
Promises, promises turn to dust  
Wedding bells just turn to rust  
Trust into mistrust  
  
I need a little room  
To find myself  
I need a little space  
To work it out  
I need a little room  
All alone  
I need a little  
  
You need a little room for your big head  
Don't you, don't you  
You need a little space for a thousand beds  
Won't you, won't you  
Lips that promise fear the worst  
Tongue so sharp the bubble burst  
Just into unjust  
  
I've had a little time  
To find the truth  
Now I've had a little room  
To check what's wrong  
I've had a little time  
And I still love you  
I've had a little  
  
You had a little time  
And you had a little fun  
Didn't you, didn't you  
While you had yours  
Do you think I had none  
Do you, do you  
The Freedom that you wanted bad  
Is yours for good  
I hope you're glad  
Sad into unsad  
  
I had a little time  
To think it over  
Had a little room  
To work it out  
I found a little courage  
To call it off  
  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time

It's been a long day in the field for us all  
Catching balls and dropping balls  
It's been a long life in this world  
Catching hearts and dropping hearts  
Like hearts were meant to bounce  
Like hearts were meant to bounce  
I'm sure  
  
The wave that you just missed  
Could've been the big one  
The one that took you there  
The sunshine fills the air  
  
It's been a night shift of a life for us all  
Gaining friends and losing friends  
It's been a cleaner's sort of hours  
That's why we buy our flowers  
Cos when you smell of shit you love flowers  
  
And the wind that broke your kite  
Could've been the big one  
To take you out of sight  
Keep you snug at night  
  
And it's hard to know just why  
Why when you take shit  
Should you give shit?  
  
And the wind that broke your kite  
Could've been the big one  
To take you out of sight  
Keep you snug at night  
Keep you snug at night

With a minute's silence for the dead  
And a minute's silence for the long-lost lovers  
No one's really in the mood for beer  
  
With a minute's silence for the child  
And a minute's silence for the grieving mothers  
There's not much talking going down here  
  
With a minute's silence for the girl  
With a minute's silence for the younger brother  
Things have never been so clear  
  
With a minute's silence for your friend  
With a minute's silence for your long-lost folk  
A minute's silence lasts a year  
  
A minute's silence seems a year  
  
And the park is filled with pain  
For this age has laid it's claim  
And the street's about to cry  
Cos it longs for passers-by  
It longs for passers-by

No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
His own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
That's how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
And he wears his isolation  
As a widow wears a shroud  
They hammered him with discipline  
Screaming out loud  
  
As they did with Jesus  
With hammer and with nails  
Now the cell is quiet  
And the moonlight is pale  
  
No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
Tis own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
That's how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
He's standing on the bedside chair  
The moonlight fills his cell  
No one ever peeked  
In jimmy's private hell  
  
His only friend, a makeshift rope  
His only key, his only hope  
His neck breaks so easily  
And he doesn't make a sound  
  
No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
His own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
That's how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
His only friend, a makeshift rope  
His only key, his only hope  
His neck breaks so easily  
And he doesn't make a sound  
  
No piece of sky  
No piece of sky

(M. Greaves)  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear it's true  
No-one could make them  
Cry like you  
Billie Holliday would pale beside you  
Cos you sure got a way with the blues  
  
See you around, dressed to thrill  
Smile for me baby  
If looks could kill  
I bet your boyfriends don't have a clue  
That you've sure got a way with the blues  
  
Here I am  
With my souvenirs  
Standing in the wreckage of eight sweet years  
I bet everything in your life must be brand new  
Cos you've sure got a way with the blues  
  
You should be a singer  
I swear it's true  
No-one could make them cry like you  
Billie Holliday, Patsy Kline too  
I bet even Bessie Smith would pale beside you  
Cos you've sure got a way with the blues  
Oooh, with the blues

Like the contents of your handbag  
You don't know why it's there  
People ask you where you're heading  
You just answer "anywhere"  
  
We don't mean to be this vague  
It just happens that we are  
No-one asked us to elaborate  
We just shrug our shoulders and be  
  
And like the stories that just happened  
No-one thought of, no-one planned  
We could have ruled, we could have conquered  
Then we could have been a man  
  
We could be ex-husband  
We could be ex-wife  
But no-one looks at the menu in a greasy spoon life  
  
Alone, alone  
Half an hour is seven hours  
One day is several months  
Alone, alone  
A month is a calendar  
A year can be a decade spent  
Alone  
  
He knows "hello" in eighteen languages  
"I love you" in only one  
By the time he's got his phrase-book  
The chance is usually gone  
  
And we feel ourselves quite prepared  
But quite prepared for what  
We always took the lead  
Before we actually knew the plot  
  
And you can tell where we've been shopping  
By the bags beneath our eyes  
Make-up shoulders burden  
But the smile never lies  
  
We could be ex-husband  
We could be ex-wife  
But no-one looks at the menu in a greasy spoon life  
  
Alone, alone  
Half an hour is seven hours  
One day is several months  
Alone, alone  
A month is a calendar  
A year can be a decade spent  
Alone  
  
So empty at the airport  
You don't set off the doors  
We used to feel like chorus girls  
And now we feel like whores  
  
Hearts built like reservoirs  
Words built like dams  
Thoughts built like juggernauts  
Our actions built like prams  
  
And when the wind blows into our face  
We should be warmer and not colder  
Well, what price the charges  
On this cargo that we shoulder  
  
We could be ex-husband  
We could be ex-wife  
But no-one looks at the menu in a greasy spoon life  
  
Alone, alone  
Half an hour is seven hours  
One day is several months  
Alone, alone  
A month is a calendar  
A year can be a decade spent  
Alone  
  
And we only smoke when bored  
So we do two packs a day  
And we've lost the difference  
Between bored and lonely anyway

Planning permission tied to post  
We read when we're waiting for bus  
Is always double-checked 'cause we so often suspect  
They plan to build something on us  
  
What they'll build, neither here nor there  
It's what they'll bury that counts  
And how far down they'll push us this time  
And how far back up we'll bounce  
  
Angels are born with wings not springs  
Devils always born with horns  
And beautiful bird only bothers to sing  
If beautiful day ever dawns, dawns  
  
Angels and devils ain't so easy to spot  
As movies like to portray  
A devil appears with a cunning veneer  
You often only notice too late  
  
If he says he's got wings, keep an eye out for springs  
Make sure your angel is real  
And of all of these things it's the song that he sings  
And how the song makes you feel  
  
Angels are born with souls, not goals  
Devils always search for the high  
So beautiful birds sing from telegraph poles  
And devil's song fills the whole sky, sky  
  
Yes, birdsong belongs in the highest  
Of places, not where devil performs  
Beautiful bird and song shouldn't bother  
To sing if audience mutters and yawns  
  
Mutters and yawns, mutters and yawns  
Mutters and yawns, it yawns, it yawns  
Mutters and yawns, mutters and yawns

Alone in the world was poor little Anne  
As sweet a young child as you'd find  
Her parents had gone to their final reward  
Leaving their baby behind  
Did you hear this poor little child was only nine years of age  
When mother and dad went away  
Still she bravely worked at the one thing she knew  
To earn a few pennies a day  
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers  
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear  
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers  
Fashioned from Annie's despair  
With papers and shears, with wire and wax  
She made up each tulip and mum  
As snow flakes drifted in to her tenement room  
Her baby little fingers grew numb  
From artificial flowers, those artificial flowers  
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear  
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers  
Made from Annie's despair  
And they found little Annie all covered with ice  
Still clutching her poor frozen shears  
Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand  
And watered with all her young tears  
There must be a Heaven where little Annie can play  
In heavenly gardens and bowers  
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head  
A garland of genuine flowers  
No more artificial flowers, artificial flowers  
Flowers for ladies of society to wear  
Those artificial flowers, artificial flowers  
Fashioned from Annie's  
Fashioned from Annie's despair

Don't think of what we can and can't achieve  
Perfection like this can't be guaranteed  
Hearts get lost, lovers leave  
Let's just see what friendship actually needs  
And if ever you do wrong I'm right behind you  
If ever you may sin, count me in  
If that devil doubt should come to find you  
Count on me and you don't count on him  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
I'll be that back up call  
If all else fails  
I'll swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails  
I wouldn't mind being left up on that shelf  
If I hadn't actually built, built the thing myself  
But since there's only you and no one else  
I don't get too wound up about my health  
And if ever shelf may fall I'm right below you  
In need of DIY then I'm your guy  
If lack of confidence should come to know you  
Don't let those tears you cry stop you and I  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
I'll be that back up call  
If all else fails  
I'll swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails  

This is the dinner prepared  
This is the dress that I made  
This is the child I brought up  
And this is the woman you laid  
This is the woman you laid  
This is the perfume I wore  
This is the hotel we stayed  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid  
This is the woman you laid  
We promise ourselves this is no one-night stand  
Let us draw all the curtains and strike up the band  
And I'm thrilled by gentlest touch of your hand we pretend  
There's a tear, there's a tear  
Not through confusion through fear, through fear  
This is the smile that I wore  
This is the song that we played  
This is the way that I lay  
And this is the woman you laid, this is the woman you laid  
Next morning our eyes filled with sleepy regret  
A kiss and goodbye and a long cigarette  
But the pillow I lay on is cold and it's wet  
Can't pretend  
It's a tear, it's a tear  
Not through confusion, through fear, through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
Roll out the red carpets and unplug the phone  
Root out the photos you've already shown  
'cause this is one night you won't sleep alone  
Just one night  
There's a tear there's a tear  
Not through confusion through fear, through fear  
And knowing at least that love came so near  
Just adds to the weight of this bell bottomed tear  
There's a tear, there's a tear  
Not through confusion, through fear  
Not through confusion, through fear.  

Well I kept fantasizing your eyes were wide open  
and it made me long for little last night  
Yes it was frantic, it was young, it was sweet  
But a sweet worth every bite  
  
Now I'm not normally one to be greedy  
But I had to be greedy with you  
5 days, 6 days. the whole of the month  
wouldn't satisfy my only sweet tooth  
  
[chorus]  
Well it can take many years to forge a friendship  
It can take a lifetime to get close  
But we took all the shortcuts,  
used our hearts as a map  
and we still got closer than most  
  
hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
hey hey hey hey  
  
Well excuse my staring but it's just your looks  
are a standard well above myself  
Your face might mean zip to you  
But to me it's something else  
  
All I can do is thank you  
and wish that every dream you have will come true  
5 years, 6 years, the whole of your life  
I'll be wishing for the riches for you  
  
[chorus]  
  
You dashed pretty's only chance of a compliment  
and gave the plain the blues  
Turned supermodel into last year's pull  
and got her down shining your shoes  
  
And I don't mean to be hod carrier  
of the ordinary folks bad news  
But tell Miss World to fly to Mars  
If she really doesn't like to lose.  
  
[chorus]  

My Guy and Patches  
Can only hope to match  
The evil propaganda that her pen can dispatch  
And she better love him good  
Or she'll take it on the chin  
A woman is a woman  
To the enemy within  
She can put up a fight  
The man will always win  
And Danielle Steele  
The enemy within  
  
And even photo love  
With it's pages filled with sin  
Couldn't lick the boots of the enemy within  
It can only be a chapter  
'till her heart will give in  
The enemy within  
Nothing is as phallic  
As a moaning violin  
To Danielle Steele  
The enemy within  
  
It'll all be worth it  
When the cushion takes the pin  
The enemy within  
It'll all be worth it  
When the cushion takes the pin  
When the cushion takes the pin  
When the cushion takes the pin

Little sister don't you cry  
Lay your head down, close your eyes  
Your heart is aching, mine is aching for you  
  
Little sister don't you cry  
Lay your head down close your eyes  
and dream of when before your man looked at you  
diamonds always shine  
  
you'll find true love again  
the mud gets washed off with the rain  
diamonds always shine  
  
little sister look at me  
do you see the lines around my eyes?  
they trace the tracks of the tears, i cried inside  
for a boy who loved me true  
who found some how like you  
he could not see the point in going on  
diamonds always shine  
  
you'll find true love again  
the mud gets washed off with the rain  
diamonds always shine  
diamonds always shine

All our times have come  
Here but now they're gone  
Seasons don't fear the reaper  
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain  
We can be like they are  
Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper  
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper  
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper  
Baby I'm your man...  
La la la la la  
Valentine is done  
Here but now they're gone  
Romeo and Juliet  
Are together in eternity...  
Romeo and Juliet  
40,000 men and women everyday... Like Romeo and Juliet  
40,000 men and women everyday... Redefine happiness  
Another 40,000 coming everyday...We can be like they are  
Come on baby... Don't fear the Reaper  
Baby take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper  
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper  
Baby I'm your man...  
Love of two is one  
Here but now they're gone  
Came the last night of sadness  
And it was clear she couldn't go on  
Then the door was open and the wind appeared  
The candles blew and then disappeared  
The curtains flew and then he appeared  
Saying don't be afraid  
Come on baby... And she had no fear  
And she ran to him... And they started to fly  
They looked backward and said goodbye  
She had become like they are  
She had taken his hand  
She had become like they are  
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper  
Come on, come on, come on  
La la la la la  
Come on, baby  
Come on, baby  
Come on, baby  
Come on, baby

Think of you with pipe and slippers  
Think of her in bed  
Laying there just watching telly  
Think of me instead  
  
I'll never grow so old and flabby  
That could never be  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
And your love life shines like cardboard  
But your work shoes are glistening  
She's a PhD in "I told you so"  
You've a knighthood in "I'm not listening"  
  
She'll grab your sweaty bollocks  
Then slowly raise her knee  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
When the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay  
And you realise you can't make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
Those lovely Sunday mornings  
With breakfast brought in bed  
Those blackbirds look like knitting needles  
Trying to peck your head  
  
Those birds will peck your soul out  
And throw away the key  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
And the kitchen's always tidy  
And the bathroom's always clean  
She's a diploma in "just hiding things"  
You've a first in "low esteem"  
  
When your socks smell of angels  
But your life smells of Brie  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco bay  
And you realise you can't make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Don't marry her, fuck me  
  
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco bay  
And you realise you can't make it anyway  
You have to wash the car  
Take the kiddies to the park  
Don't marry her, fuck me

DJ's got the party started, there's no end in sight  
Everybody's movin' to the rhythm that's inside  
  
It's a crazy world  
But tonight's the right situation  
Don't get left behind  
  
I can feel the music moving through me everywhere  
Ain't no destination, baby, we don't even care  
  
There's a place to be  
If you need the right education  
Let it take you there  
  
Just go with the magic, baby  
I can see it there in your eyes  
(I can see it there in your eyes)  
  
Let it flow and stop the waiting  
Right here on the dance floor  
Is where you gotta let it go  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?  
DJ's got us going around, 'round  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
You can touch the moment, almost feel it in the air  
Don't know where we're goin, baby, we don't even care  
  
Ain't no mystery  
Just use your imagination  
Let it take you there  
  
Just go with the magic, baby  
I can see it there in your eyes  
(I can see it there in your eyes)  
  
Let it flow and stop the waiting  
Right here on the dance floor  
Is where you gotta let it go  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?

Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
Forget about your fears tonight  
Listen to your heart  
Let's just touch the sky  
(Listen to your heart)  
  
No need to reason why  
Just listen to the sound  
Let it make you come alive  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Can you feel the music?  
DJ's got us going around, 'round  
  
Don't stop movin'  
Find your own way to it  
Listen to the music  
Taking you to places that you've never been before, baby, now  
  
Baby now  
Baby now  
  
And DJ's got us moving around  
Right around, right around  
DJ's got us moving around

Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"  
Birds singing in the sycamore tree  
Dream a little dream of me  
Say, "Nighty-night" and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear  
Just saying this  
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave our worries behind you  
But in your dreams, whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn dear  
Just saying this  
Sweet dreams 'til sun beams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave our worries far behind you  
But in your dreams, whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
Sweet dreams 'til sun beams find you  
Sweet dreams [Incomprehensible] behind you  
But in your dreams, whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
Sweet dreams  
Sweet dreams  
Sweet dreams  
...  

It doesn't take a mathematician  
To add a simple sum  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
It doesn't take Robert The Bruce  
To see the web you've spun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
It doesn't take a Labrador  
To show a blind man sun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
The sun, the sky, the moon, the stars  
Jupiter, Neptune and Mars  
All these things I clearly see  
It don't take a telescope for you to love me  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb

Only buy this if you're lonely  
Only listen if you're blue  
If you are married and you are happy  
This song is not to do with you  
  
If you're listening at your work place  
Feeling small amongst the men  
Do not sing this to your workmates  
This song is not to do with them  
But if you're sitting on a barstool  
Wondering what on earth to do  
Don't let them tell you no-one cares  
This songs one especially for you  
  
If you are listening on your radio  
Smiling while you drive along  
Tune the band into another  
Because this song is not your song  
  
If you're working as a DJ  
Leave this record in it's sleeve  
Cause this ones not for general airplay  
This song's for the day she leaves  
  
If you've bought this and you're sinking  
And I think that you know who  
It matters not the mouth that's singing  
This song's one especially for you  
  
So this goes out to the lonely  
So this goes out to the sad  
And it goes out to the only  
One you felt you ever had  
  
If you're there in total darkness  
With a letter in your hand  
Do not bother with the letter  
lust listen to the band  
  
So only buy this if you're lonely

(M. G. Greaves)  
  
Frank loved the blue  
Big open skies  
Played an old concertina  
Singing loola lullabies  
Frank loved an angel  
With black Spanish eyes  
And a smile to remind him of heaven  
  
Frank's been missing since Delores telephoned  
Scared of his shadow he's bleached to the bone  
Washed in the tears for a love that lays dying  
Wings have a habit of flying  
  
Singer and waitress he worked in saloons  
Between big red sunsets big yellow moons  
Tears in his eyes stones in his shoes  
Howling Wolf in his blues  
  
Frank's been missing since Delores telephoned  
Scared of his shadow he's bleached to the bone  
Washed in the tears for a love that lays dying  
Wings have a habit of flying  
  
Oooh tears in his eyes stones in his shoes  
Howling Wolf in his blues

If this person that you see  
Seems a little blurred,  
It's cause I'm not all here,  
But not quite there.  
And if it's like forever  
That you're talkin' to yourself  
It's not that I feel different  
I'm just somewhere else  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
If I don't seem focused  
Maybe not quite right.  
If I seem a little distant  
Maybe I'm outta sight  
If everytime we speak  
You seem to draw a blank  
It's the ghost of my ex-friends  
That you have to thank  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god, my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew  
  
Whenever you dig deeper  
You just run against the wall  
It's cause they ripped my soul apart  
That's all  
If I can't quite place your name  
Your face I don't recall  
No doubt you know mine is:  
Mr. Free For All.  
  
If I lack a certain etiquette  
Break all the social laws  
This door is off it's hinges now  
But the choice is yours.  
  
Free for the free ride  
That was always given to you  
Fought for forgiveness  
Cause Marx forgave you too  
  
And all for almighty god  
Cause god, my aim was true  
And full stop for the candle now  
And the friendship that you blew  
That you blew

Water the plants, feed the cat  
Leave that door key under the mat  
I'm your number one from now on  
Set the code, close the door  
You don't live there anymore  
I'm your number one from now on  
Nothing grows so quickly as the vine  
That wraps you up so tight and says 'You're mine'  
No time so exciting as the time  
You pour away that bottle containing last night's wine  
Last night's wine, last night's wine  
What you're taking part in is the cleverest of crimes  
Last night's wine, just a flickering sign  
But a necessary sin from time to time  
Fold your dress, leave your hair  
Put on your jeans, you ain't goin' nowhere  
I'm your number one from now on  
Cancel the milk, unplug the phone  
Close the blinds, you ain't gonna be home  
I'm your number one from now on  
No time quite so easy as the night  
To hold her far too close or far too tight  
No catch quite so keen, so quick to bite  
Than the one that thinks love's possible first or second sight  
Love at first sight, love at first sight  
Swinging from the chandelier, it's a one way ticket flight  
Love at first sight, so wrong it's right  
Swing you by your pigtails, set your world alight  
Nothing hooks you quicker than the line  
Thrown straight and from the bank into your spine  
For family and for friends you'll surely pine  
But sentiment and nostalgia, they just ain't worth a dime  
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?  
You can leave those financial worries well behind  
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?  
I don't want that bank manager on your pretty little mind  
Now that you're mine  

It's 6.00am and even Big Ben  
Is trying to get his head down for a kip  
But no sooner is it down  
And then it's on with dressing gown  
For this city very rarely loses grip  
  
But I have a friend who's never up by 10.00  
He's fast asleep with mouth open wide  
He's lost a lot of jobs, but he's won a lot of friends  
And he says to me, he cannot tell the time  
  
It's 7.00am and we're coughing up the phlegm  
Spitting out the taste of night before  
And we'll vomit and we'll choke  
Just to climb their tatty rope  
Well this city has its charm, and its claw  
  
And he'll blame his clock  
Or he'll say he's lost his socks  
And they'll tell you that he's been bitten by a snake  
His excuses are an art  
From the bottom of his heart  
And he thinks of them whenever he awakes  
  
It's 8.00am we're on the road again  
Racing for a placing at the top  
And it says green for go  
For the people in the know  
But for the others all it says is red for stop  
  
It's cold and its damp  
And they've dug him a grave  
And the 10.15 merchants still in bed  
And scrawled upon the headboard  
For the whole wide world to see  
"Died In The Arms Of Big Ted"

Head over heels is fine  
Unless you're in stilettos  
Love knows no boundaries  
Unless your in one of love's ghettos  
  
Love climb every mountain high  
But some of us are stuck in a cell  
All you need is love, love, love  
And a bloody good tunnel as well  
  
You could get here by aeroplane or boat  
Not unreasonable demands  
But I could save myself the price of a ticket  
If I didn't let go of your hands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Love sure makes the world go round  
And takes you for a hell of a ride  
But I don't wanna waste time searching for love  
When it's already stood at my side  
  
Love will make you blind to the truth  
Romantic novels all tell  
So I'll spend a little time romancing by myself  
But that turned me blind as well  
  
You can get here by crossing sea or desert  
I can barely make Blackpool Sands  
Railroad, caravan, save it for the mad man  
Lets see if love just stands  
  
Never mind killing me getting there  
But somebody has to make plans  
First embrace shoots you into space  
And doesn't give a damn where it lands  
  
Why not take a chance on love?  
Even at a hundred to one  
If we promise that we'll never let love die  
Then within a week one of us'll be gone  
  
Does the length of journey your heart makes  
Really provide any proof?  
All it really proves is love never moves  
When it's right there under your roof  
  
My heart is in the right place  
Then what's the point in making that trip  
Stay right here with your hand on my heart  
See how often you cause it to skip  
  
See how often you cause it to skip  
See how often you cause it to skip

Girl make a list  
Go out and find yourself a new plaything  
Oh girl you need a trip  
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain  
  
So just remember how he would tell you lies  
And then pretend that everything was so sweet  
No need to sacrifice  
If you're not satisfied  
He's just a canine running round on heat  
  
Girl, you must resist  
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart  
Oh girl you must insist  
You've got to stop the fool before he starts  
  
So just remember how he was so untrue  
And all the tacky things he did to you  
No need to sympathise  
'Cause he's not worth the time  
You've got to find someone who's true to you  
  
Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad  
Girlfriend, you know you're the best he's ever had  
Girlfriend

Those that's got shall get  
Those that's not shall lose  
So the bible said and it still is true  
Mama may have  
Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
Well the strong seem to get more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have  
Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
And when you got money  
You got lots of friends  
Crawling round your door  
When the money's gone  
And all your spending ends  
They won't be around no more  
Rich relations may give you  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself but don't take too much  
'Cause Mama may have  
Papa may have  
But God bless the child that's got his own  
That's got his own  
When you got money  
You got lots of friends  
Crawling round your door  
When the money's gone  
And all your spending ends  
They won't be around no more  
Rich relations may give you  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself but don't take too much  
Mama may have  
Papa may have  
But God bless the child who can turn round and say  
I've got my own

Don't know what I'm doing here  
I'll carry on regardless  
Got enough money for one more beer  
I'll carry on regardless  
  
Good as gold, but stupid as mud  
He'll carry on regardless  
They'll bleed his heart 'til there's no more blood  
But carry on regardless  
  
Carry on with laugh  
Carry on with cry  
Carry on with brown under moonlit sky  
  
I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this  
  
Got one note to last all week  
I'll carry on regardless  
The hill to happiness is far too steep  
I'll carry on regardless  
  
Dried his mouth in the Memphis sun  
He carried on regardless  
Tried to smile and he bit his tongue  
But carry on regardless  
  
Carry on with work  
Carry on with love  
Carry on with cheering  
Anything above  
  
I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this  
  
I don't want silver, I just want gold  
Carry on regardless  
Bronze is for the sick and the old  
But carry on regardless  
  
I want my love, my joy, my laugh, my smile, my needs  
Not in the star signs  
Or the palm that she reads  
I want my sun-drenched, wind-swept Ingrid Bergman kiss  
Not in the next life  
I want it in this  
I want it in this

I've only got one real fan  
She is not woman, she is not man  
She's got her own coat of arms and her tartan and her own clan  
Her clan surpasses beauty  
always love and never duty  
A beauty that feels so alien to this land  
  
These feelings should be censored they should be banned  
But when you put a porn-star in these hands  
I'm the 6 month old with the keys to his own pram  
You got this straight to play the fool  
Miss out nursery, miss out school  
And gave the bullet train option to this old abandoned tram  
  
How do you make so special look like dross  
How do you make expensive look budget cost  
If it's power to the workers then you are the boss  
You make bluebells look like moss  
Gave a second coat to gloss  
And made Lennon's little Ono look like dross  
If prostitution was not illegal  
you'd make cheap sex look so regal  
Make the hottest little joint in town look like frost  
  
The famous they get stalkers, they get pests  
But I'd rather get a bullet right through my chest  
All that Lennon could imagine  
was not you, was just a fraction  
and all half-hearted get is second best

Why forbidden fruit  
Always looks so sweet  
Hanging down like devil's food  
From highest branch on tree  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Is better than a heaven forgot  
  
yield not to temptation  
Is only good advice  
If true love happens just the once  
And never ever twice  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Seems better than a heaven forgot  
  
We were happy with happily ever after  
But only if the plot  
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss  
And good guys we could not  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kind of drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
Yes, you're kind of drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
  
Hunt me down like your other prey  
Let your claws take hold  
If what I've chosen's truly gray  
Make tiger black and gold  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Is better than a heaven forgot  
  
We were happy with happily ever after  
But only if the plot  
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss  
And good guys we could not  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kinda drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
Yes, you're kinda drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
  
'I can't get no satisfaction'  
So sang all the guys  
The biggest single breeding ground  
For a girls, 'I will survive'  
  
We'll be happy with happily ever after  
But only when the song  
Admits 'can't get no satisfaction'  
Wasn't all our wrong  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kind of put off wafer  
When you've tasted chocolate first  
Yes, you're kinda put off wafer  
When you've tasted chocolate first  
  
Why forbidden fruit always looks so sweet?

Have fun  
And if you can't have fun  
Have someone else's fun  
'Cause someone sure had mine  
They came in  
now they're having a whale of a time  
  
You should grow a beard  
A beard to tell a thousand stories never told before  
A beard to tell you tales, whilst the fireplace roars  
The closing of relationships and the opening of doors  
The starting of hostilities and the ending of wars  
  
Take care  
And if you couldn't care  
Take someone else's care  
'Cause someone took my care  
They went there and then they were not there  
  
We should have a baby  
And then I wouldn't feel quite so sad  
Then I'd feel like Paul the Saint and not Jack the Lad  
A baby that'll make me feel so very glad  
I've had a life of booze, but that's all I've ever had  
  
'Cause I'm the King of Misery  
The Prince of the torn apart  
And you're the lighthouse keeper  
To the owner of a ship-wrecked heart  
  
Take heart  
And if you can't take heart  
Take someone else's heart  
Someone took my heart  
They came in, now I'm torn apart  
  
We should grey together  
Not that pigeon-chested Trafalgar grey  
The grey that greets you on that first October day  
The grey of Russian front, whilst wolves bay  
And the skeleton of life that love decays  
  
'Cause you're the Queen of Sadness  
The Princess of the House of Pain  
And you're the final match  
To the holder of this flickering flame  
  
Have fun

Your 'fight them on the beaches' speeches make me despair  
'Cause if there's one thing we can guarantee is you will not he there  
Tidying your room, making up your bed  
And if your diary's full that week you'll send us lot instead  
  
Send us lot instead, put a poppy by my lovers bed  
We believe you when you say you've hurt your back  
  
Have you ever been away  
Where were you when we took Calais?  
You don 't know, you don't care  
You 're just glad that you wasn't there  
Have you ever been away  
  
I'm afraid your Rule Britannia mania doesn't ring so true  
If I was captain of the waves I'd turn the gun on you  
Any last requests before you join dead?  
I'll crap into your Union Jack and wrap it round your head  
  
Wrap it round your head, take a look at all the blood we've shed  
We'll believe you when you say it was worth it  
  
Liberate the streets of Europe, give our kids a chance  
Give them Beaujolais by tap and cheap day trips to France  
But you have never seen or smelt this ungodly death  
It's like the stench of roasted lamb upon your father's breath

Here it is again it's so so mad  
Turning young and happy into old and sad  
Here it is again just passed by chance  
All the way to the lawyer from a sloppy dance  
It was another holiday argument  
But she threw him into the sea  
A glass bottomed boat pulled him up  
His face was rotting in weed  
It was rotting in weed, I've seen those people bleed  
If it never happens well it happened to me  
  
Do you know who you love  
Does anybody here have a clue  
Just who they're with  
And it was glance by glance  
And it was blow by blow  
Did they know  
Just who they loved  
  
Here it is again in the same disguise  
Clean shoes, smart tie and deep blue eyes  
Here it is again and it makes you sick  
Watch the blind man walk along without a stick  
Heads he was a beautiful lover  
Tails he was definitely bad  
Heads you're like no other  
Tails just the best he'd had  
  
You're the best he's had  
You're the best so far  
All the way to the church from the back of a car  
  
Do you know who you love  
Does anybody here have a clue  
Just who they're with  
And it was glance by glance  
And it was blow by blow  
Did they know  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved

Hey church I was thinking  
The Third World seems to be sinking  
Can't you all get over there  
And we'll have them all over here  
  
And you can learn to catch your own food  
And you can learn to build your own hut  
And we'll make up the usual excuse  
To keep them in the pubs till they're shut  
  
Hey skin, I just thought  
The doctrine Hitler has taught  
Is still kicking off in the States  
Can't you go and join with your mates  
  
Join up with the clueless clan  
Dress up in a bag and a skirt  
End up looking like a jerk  
Meanwhile we'll have gone mad  
  
And the hidden jukebox plays us a song  
For each and everyone  
For black, white, straight and the gay  
Celebrate you being away  
  
Hey Turk I was thinking  
OK so l may have been drinking  
You can come drink over here  
And we'll fuck them off over there  
  
Whisky for the Greek and the Turk  
Gin for the Arab and the Jew  
A double arsenic for Mister Le Pen  
Cause it's him who soils Europe and not you  
  
And the hidden jukebox plays us a song  
Everyone should sing along  
With a message that'll ring and ring  
These are the words that we sing

No one wrote a song for me  
Just instrumental not too long  
As sure as sure could ever be  
You'd only get the lyrics wrong  
  
No solo Chet Baker ever played  
lowered me slowly to my grave  
The prose that Keats and Yates would save  
was for King and Queen not knave  
  
I have no poem that describes my charm  
No story told that's short and sweet  
I have no hymn, I have no psalm  
This song I have it has no beat  
Yes it has no beat  
No tapping of feet  
Yes it has no beat  
  
Miles Davis played the black 'n' blues  
Did he play for me to lose?  
Cause just when round midnight falls  
That tune's not his it's Kenny Ball's  
  
Now on that graveyard on that grave  
On that tombstone in the shade  
No poem written, no accolade  
No "We loved you" ever sprayed  
  
There's just this feeling from that moss  
When epitaph you cannot read  
he must have lived it at budget cost  
So he deserves to be beneath  
  
All that William Robinson wrote  
not one of my pluses did he portray  
those lyrics stuck right down my throat  
I never hit  
It never hit  
My hit parade  

She'd given everything she could give  
Twenty years of kindness made her sad  
Kindness never made enough to live  
So she sold the very last thing that she had  
As she held her hand out to him  
As he drove around the block  
He mouthed through the window 'just hold on'  
'I've held on many years now and I haven't found a lot'  
Hold on, hold on to what?  
So hold on to what? Hold on to what?  
Holding on is harder when it's something you've not got  
I'll need a pair of stilts if I'm to ever reach the top  
So hold on! Hold on to what?  
  
Many years of service with a smile  
Up shit creek and down the Rhine  
Gibraltar Rock and now the Emerald Isle  
He'd shined every shoe that he could shine  
And as he lay in his own blood  
Screaming 'I've been shot'  
He heard the Major whisper 'just hold on'  
'I've held on all these years now, now what medal have I got?'  
Hold on, hold on to what?  
So hold on to what? Hold on to what?  
Holding on is harder when it's something you've not got  
I'll need a pair of stilts if I'm to ever reach the top  
So hold on! Hold on to what?  
So hold on to what? Hold on to what?  
  
Holding on is harder when it's something you've not got  
I'll need a pair of stilts if I'm to ever reach the top  
So hold on! Hold on to what?  
  
Sixty years and he's looking his worst  
Sitting in the park where she'd died  
Running hands through his final hair  
These are the words that he cried  
To achieve the American dream  
You need a trampoline  
To achieve the counter effect  
Get that whisky down your neck'  
And hold on, hold on to what?  
Chamberlain had his paper  
Jesus had his cross  
They held on  
We held on to what?  

Vagabonds don't fall in love  
They just wheel and they deal  
So if I turn a funny colour when you kiss me  
I can't help the way that I feel  
  
Hooligans don't fall in love  
They just break up others lives  
So when I come to you on bended knee  
Don't forget my twenty other wives  
  
So why?  
Turn to a life of violence and crime?  
So why?  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie?  
  
Because there's always someone with a bigger car  
There's always someone with a bigger cigar  
If you've been far  
There's someone who's been further than your far  
When you make your cart, you get to the start  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
There's always someone in a faster cart  
  
Gangsters don't fall in love  
They just roam from town to town  
So when we kiss and we hold and we whisper  
Please don't ever write it down  
  
Hooligans don't fall in love  
They just lie and they drink  
So if you say I won't say 'i will'  
Then I won't I think!  
  
So why?  
Turn to a life of violence and crime?  
So why?  
Why do you cheat and why do you lie?  
  
Because there's always someone with a bigger car  
There's always someone with a bigger cigar  
If you've been far  
There's always someone whos been further than your far  
At last you're straight and you make a new start  
There's always someone with a better heart  
There's always someone with a better heart  
There's always someone with a better heart  
  
But all in all we're not so bad  
We never take from our own kind  
Bad's quite good when it's all you've ever had  
And no bloody good sounds quite refined

Well the dice that I roll  
Never seems to land on six  
And that 48 card pack  
Is short of some of my old tricks  
  
The horse I bet on all those years ago  
Is probably still running round the track  
Like the marriage that I gambled on  
I'm due my money back  
  
We could've learned, we could've burned  
From the firework love ignites  
But that sparkler of romance  
It proved impossible to light  
If your country code or your green cross code  
It can leave a lasting mark  
History books have showed, follow safety code  
And stamp out your final spark  
  
Well the husband that I married once  
I should've kept him in a cage  
Kept him sitting waiting there  
To show the tortoise middle-age  
  
Cause you never back an animal  
That struggles on two legs  
I'd rather back a stray with three  
Then one that sits up and just begs  
  
Milk will curdle, cheese go off  
Expensive wine mature  
Kids grow up, parents down  
Husbands turn to tragic bore  
  
Receipts and life insurance all very well  
But don't fully cover hate  
So you can't return this idiot  
When he's past his sell-by-date

How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman has no breeze?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman, when a woman's on her knees?  
  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When a woman hasn't sinned?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When the weather, when the weather brings no wind?  
  
Look I'm sorry that I hurt you  
You look a million dollars and a dime  
Time's the greatest healer  
But love's the greatest stealer of all time  
  
I'm so sorry,  
My heart's broken, (mine's the same)  
I still love you (make it plural)  
You're so sweet!  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
  
How long's a tear take to dry  
When almighty brings is rain?  
How long's a tear take to dry  
And do tears, and do tears really stain?  
  
This heart was like a tardis  
I went and lost the key in a fight  
I've never found a locksmith  
Will you be my locksmith tonight?  
(Will I shite)  
  
I'm so sorry, (make it plural)  
My heart's broken, (mine's the same)  
I still love you (make it plural)  
You're so sweet!  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
The flowers smell sweeter, the closer you are to the grave  
  
How long does sorry really last  
Is it tattooed upon your heart?  
Or is it hung in a museum  
With your Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa ex-ass art?  
  
I have no summer, (I'll buy you summer)  
I'll buy July, if December makes you cry  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by  
A little or no trace face belies a lie of many days gone by

With a face like a crab's bus ticket  
And skin like a llama's door mat  
He was always gonna struggle  
Nature had seen to that  
  
He dreamt of those old-fashioned movies  
Where Bogart gets the dame  
But a lorry load of Lorre  
Is still the score of pain  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But I've got the bottle-opener  
He may be fat but he's got the cork-screw  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue  
  
With a chin like a tramp's jukebox  
And eyes like a rhino's ash-tray  
It was always going to be pantomime  
That made him sing and dance anyway  
  
When you feel like London  
And you look like Hull  
You think Travolta pulled Newton, John  
Who did John Hurt pull?  
  
And they compliment the compliment  
And it's driving you insane  
It's like talking to a helicopter  
When you know that you're a plane  
  
Breath like a mountain goat's satchel  
Nose like a pool of sick  
But you always leave your flies ahoy  
'Cause the world wants to suck your dick  
Let it suck!  
  
And he sings  
I may be ugly  
But I've got the bottle-opener  
He may be fat but he's got the cork-screw  
And in the party party politics of this ugly fame  
There is no orderly queue

I'm walking through these pastures  
I'm picking up sweet fruit  
I'm shaking hands with people  
That previously I'd shoot  
But nothing will dissuade me  
Nothing will dilute  
I want to execute  
I want to execute  
  
And you tend to meet a lot of scum en route  
It doesn't mean you've joined the other side  
And because I still wear shorts and my smile is oh so cute  
It doesn't mean I'll run away and hide  
  
To a world where the leaders finally confess  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
To the burning of the Stock Exchange and bombing of the press  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
  
I'm walking through these corridors  
Where crime meets pantomime  
They're laughing and they're drinking  
On the swill of overtime  
And no-one seems to know about  
The death-wish that they've signed  
Ah, life's unkind  
Ah, life's unkind  
  
And they see me as a potential new recruit  
They rub their hands, slap their backs and smile  
But I still wear suspenders underneath my business suit  
So needn't worry about me for a while  
  
So to a world without hunger, where royalty face death  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
To the breaking down of barriers of North, South,  
East and West  
(I think the answer's yes, I think the answer's yes)  
  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
I think the answer's yes, yes, yes, I think the answer's yes  
  
And no-one seems to know about  
The death-wish that they've signed  
Ah, life's unkind  
Ah, life's unkind  
Life's unkind, life's unkind  
From poor old U2 to poor old Simple Minds  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas, rope or gas, rope or gas  
No amnesty for murderers of poor old working class  
Rope or gas, rope or gas

If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two  
And grovel at  
The drop of a hat  
  
And once they've got you down there  
It's so hard to re-straighten your back  
It we crawl at two  
We could crawl at one handred and two  
  
And the target brainless don't quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought, crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail  
That is posing as tongue  
  
Curtsies, bows, thank you sirs  
And the wearing of a business suit  
Lead to complaints of backache  
And end with a Nazi salute  
  
And once they've got you down there  
It's so hard to re-straighten your back  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at two two two  
  
And the target brainless don't quite reach  
Covered so kindly in your opening speech  
Is a tiny crab of thought, crab of thought  
On a sideways beach  
  
Let lessons not the pupils teach  
Justice not the lesers breach  
And maggots not have fingers  
Wagged at by leech  
  
Well I made sure  
I wrote this song in braille  
So you could touch the words  
The words that sail  
  
From my mouth back to the jail  
You could touch the words that sail  
From the mouth back to the jail That is posing as tongue  
  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two  
If we crawl at two  
We could crawl at twenty-two  

If, if you choose that we will always lose  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you decide to give him another try  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect love song  
You would take me back  
Well I wrote it but I lost it  
And now will you take me back anyway  
  
Now if, if you insist that this is for the best  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
I'll sail this ship alone  
  
If, if you're afraid that I won't make the grade  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you agree to him instead of me  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect letter  
That I would have a chance  
Well I wrote it, and you burnt it  
And now do I have a chance anyway  
  
If, if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I burnt myself alive  
That you'd come running back

It took a few packed bags and a few slammed doors  
It took a false, false smile with a septic pause  
From my plastic moustache to your clip-on claws  
(In other words I hate you)  
  
It took a thousand fights with a thousand draws  
It took a blinkered vision for a long lost cause  
As Romeo leaves to light applause  
(And softly says I hate you)  
  
My attitude leaves a lot to be desired  
My fashion sense has never been quite right  
But I'd rather live in drainpipes  
Than with friends that I've acquired  
(In so many words I hate you)  
  
Those winter nights just spent indoors  
That criminal fizz in the drink he pours  
We smooch all night to "The Theme From Jaws"  
(In other words I hate you)  
  
What's yours is mine and mine is yours  
A screaming for a get out clause  
Here's the man with a thousand mother-in-laws  
(In other words I hate you)  
  
My looks leave a lot to be desired  
My music taste has never been the trend  
But me and Perry Como, well our patience has expired  
In so many words I hate you

This is the Awards for Industry and Free Enterprise  
So let me sit you down and tell you how I won first prize  
I took on your free enterprise and your pretty little shops  
Walked in with empty bags and walked out with the lot  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award  
  
This is the Awards for Industry and Free Enterprise  
Anyone want a gold watch in a ladies' size?  
There's a few more round the back  
I stole them from your shop  
We've got no more in silver, that's all that you'd got  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award  
  
I chatted with your guards and winked at roving eye  
A thousand hidden cameras were searching cross the sky  
But they didn't see me pinch them from underneath their eyes  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Yes, I've come for my award  
  
Hairdryer, overcoat, telly, dot-to-dot  
Video, compact disc, there's nothing we forgot  
Whilst I was busy smiling my father got the lot  
I've come for my Award

I came in here, just to see his guilty face  
I'm just checkin'  
He's been dead twenty years but I sort of miss the chase  
I'm just checkin'  
  
I've seen folk just like her, pop their noses round the door  
They're just checkin'  
If this is where their husband was between 1 and 4  
They're just checkin'  
  
Nothing hits so definite, hits so hard  
When he's moved from Old White Hart  
and he's doing the Old Graveyard  
We're running a check. On the love we had taken away  
We're running a check. That death wasn't fortnight astray  
Nothing hits so definite (repeat)  
  
The mask of sobriety for afternoons he'd save  
I'm just checkin'  
If he could fool me regularly he'd certainly fool his grave  
I'm just checkin'  
  
I've seen those widows pray for the hunt that was taken away  
They're just checkin'  
They pretend they've just popped by like they popped by yesterday  
They're just checkin'  
  
I came round here in case he left a slate  
No one settles up around here, like the widowed or the late  
We've seen folk like you settle bills or family feuds  
But no one's bought a drink for those that death excludes  
We're just checkin'  
We're just thinkin'  
We're just sinkin'  

Don't feel bad if you wake up feeling suddenly old  
More the realisation that you've let yourself be covered by mould  
Age is not something you wrap up if you're feeling the cold  
It's a laugh ten times harder at a joke eleven times told  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
Don't feel bad if you're feeling past you sell-by date  
Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate  
Oh the weather you tell them you're ready or whether you wait  
Does someone place a hand on your shoulder you point the way to the gate  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
You don't count the birthdays 'til your out on your own  
They come thicker and faster and too damn late to postpone  
And wisdom's the last thing the scientists willing to clone  
Science advances, maturity dances alone

Ce souvenir je te le rends.  
Des souvenirs, tu sais j'en ai tellement.  
Puisqu'on rva de jours errants.  
Pas la peine de changer trop...  
Ce souvenir je te le prends.  
Des souvenirs, comme ca j'en ai tout le temps.  
Si par erreur la vie nous spare,  
J'le sortirai d'mon tiroir.  
J'reve les yeux ouverts.  
A m'fait du bien.  
A ne va pas plus loin.  
J'vais pas voir derriere  
Puisque j'aime bien.  
Vivement demain.  
Un dernier verre de sherry.  
Du sherry mon amant quand je m'ennuie.  
Tous les jours se ressemblent a prsent.  
Tu me manques terriblement...  
J'reve les yeux ouverts.  
A m'fait du bien.  
A ne va pas plus loin.  
J'vais pas voir derriere  
Puisque j'aime bien.  
Vivement demain.  
Un dernier verre de sherry.  
Du sherry mon amant quand je m'ennuie.  
Tous les jours se ressemblent a prsent.  
Tu me manques terriblement

The super fly guy that you're courtin' now  
Used to be a super-swot  
And the clothes he thinks look retro  
Are more 'Land That Time Forgot'  
  
And if he knows where he was standin'  
When J.F.K was shot  
Chances are though time's passed him by  
He's still standing within yards of that spot  
  
So if your hangover feels like the dart board  
Whilst the Christians hit bulls-eye  
And paranoia that self-employer  
Is following in heavy disguise  
  
Off goes intelligence to join high tide  
To drift with all the things we let go  
Only tidal wave could possibly save  
All we let go with the flow  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written, we don't know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we won't go  
  
He who used to float like a butterfly once  
Is floatin' like a glorious moth  
And the fly girls you hung around with then  
Are lucky if they even take off  
  
Dresses and skirts you thought were in  
Everyone a dust-rag or dishcloth  
Like every flat beer that they serve around here  
We all start life as fabulous froth  
  
So why do you work yourself that hard  
When you don't even like the job?  
Why do you hate the small-time thief  
When it's your own time, you'll always rob?  
  
Off goes intelligence to join high tide  
To drift with all the things we let go  
Only tidal wave could possibly save  
All we let go with the flow  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written, we don't know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we won't go  
  
Let go with the flow  
Books we may have written, we don't know  
Let go with the flow  
Some enchanted city we won't go

Well sitting in a bar alone  
Where no-one knows your name  
Is like laying in a graveyard  
Wide awake  
You're scared that if you cough or yawn  
You might wake up the dead  
So pretend to read a paper  
Or just drink instead  
  
I'm a stand-up comedian  
But I'd sit down if I could  
The world just seems  
To want folk like me to stand  
And the punch-lines seem to disappear  
Like clouds across the sky  
And the laughter could be real  
Or could be canned  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liar's Bar  
  
Well living with a lying man  
Could never really hurt  
But living with a drunk  
Well no-one deserves  
And you're looking for your husband  
You're not sure he's still alive  
Don't bother with the cemetery  
He'll be down at liar's dive  
  
I'm a traveling businessman  
I just stopped in for one drink  
You'll find  
That I'm not like the other men  
Their noses are red  
Whilst mine is only pink  
And they didn't choose their drink  
Their drink chose them  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liar's Bar  
  
And the grave-digger's smiling  
At his reflection in his spade  
He's visiting the seediest  
The shallowest of graves  
The vocal chords of elephants  
And the characters of mice  
They're singing "whiskey, whiskey"  
So good they named it twice  
  
Well don't pass buildings with lights on  
If I said that I did I'd have lied  
'Cause what looks like a Chinese restaurant  
May have Chinese New Year inside  
And son all my life I've been searching  
The bars I've been in I forget  
The lights outside ever brighter  
But a light on the inside not yet  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liar's Bar  
  
And he's a world-wide traveler  
He's not like me or you  
But he comes in mighty regular  
For one who's passing through  
That one came in his work clothes  
He's missed his last bus home  
He's missed a hell of a lot of buses  
For a man who wants to roam  
  
If I look rough I am rough  
If I look sad I am  
If I look broke I am broke  
Just a broke down piece of man  
  
I've turned over enough leaves  
To fill an autumn  
And if I had one final wish  
I'd be your slave for a decade  
If you could take me away from this  
If you took me away from this  
I'd be different you'd see  
'Cause I didn't choose the drink  
A drink just chose me  
  
Rum by the kettle drum  
Whiskey by the jar  
At Liar's Bar  
  
Well I'm smoking like a chimney  
And I'm drinking like a fish  
At Liar's Bar

When was the last time you felt so happy  
You had to give yourself a good pinch  
When did you ever fail one of life's highs  
Without using stepladder or winch  
  
That's why the lifeless crave the past  
'Cause when they're flogged, stoned, lynched  
They can watch the living fizzle out to naught  
Without even moving one inch  
  
That's what keeps you alive  
The thought of undeserved death  
That's why cynics deep-sea dive  
Just to watch someone healthy lose breath  
  
That's what really makes you tick  
When the fearless are stopped in their tracks  
Optimism looks up counts the stars  
Pessimism looks down and counts cracks  
  
The Monday morning moaners club  
That meet every week on park bench  
At least they've earned their grumble stripes  
When they fought tooth and nail in the trench  
  
If you ever sat down in one place too long  
They'd need a fork-lift truck and a wrench  
Indecision drip feeds modesty  
But apathy fails even to quench  
  
That's what keeps you alive  
The thought of undeserved death  
That's why cynics deep-sea dive  
Just to watch someone healthy lose breath  
  
That's what really makes you tick  
When the fearless are stopped in their tracks  
Optimism looks up counts the stars  
Pessimism looks down and counts cracks  
  
And even when it's every man for himself  
You still like to stick with the bunch  
You'd rather tag along at the back of the crowd  
To risk anything on a hunch  
  
That's what keeps you alive  
The thought of undeserved death  
That's why cynics deep-sea dive  
Just to watch someone healthy lose breath  
  
That's what really makes you tick  
When the fearless are stopped in their tracks  
Optimism looks up counts the stars  
Pessimism looks down and counts cracks  
  
That's what keeps you alive

You can't write a novel from a briefcase  
You can write a poem from a trench  
You can dream a dream from A to be  
But you can't catch a bus from a bench  
  
You don't back a horse called Striding Snail  
You don't name your boat Titanic II  
So why when I see your happy smiling face  
Do I always end up singing Little Blue  
  
Little Blue, how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
How can a flower so beautiful  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
You can't build a brewery on a cemetery  
You can build a pub on a church  
And people fall quicker than buildings do  
You have to decide what comes first  
  
You don't call a plane the Flying Roman  
'Cause the Romans always walked and never flew  
So why when I see your happy smiling face  
Do I always end up singing Little Blue  
  
Little Blue, how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
Well Bukowski wrote a story from a barstool  
And Keats from the top of a hill  
So I'm going to save my special song for you  
From a grave where it's quiet and it's chill  
  
'Cause there's a queue of clouds assembled  
On the horizon of your smile  
When most think that you're holding back  
I know you're holding bile  
  
Little Blue, how do you do  
Your smile looks like heaven  
But your eyes hold a storm about to brew  
Little Blue  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue  
  
How can a flower so pretty  
Be so laden down with dew  
Little Blue

(Elo)  
  
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave  
It's like magic  
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'  
It's magic  
  
Chorus  
And you, and your sweet desire,  
You took me, ooh, woah, higher and higher, baby  
It's a livin' thing,  
It's a terrible thing to lose,  
It's a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Making believe this is what you conceived  
From your worst day, (I'm thinking of dying)  
Moving in line then you look back in time  
To the first day (I'm thinking, I'm thinking)  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Takin' a dive cause you can't halt the slide  
Floating downstream, (I'm thinking of dying)  
So let her go don't start spoiling the show  
It's a bad dream (I'm thinking, I'm thinking)  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It's a livin' thing,  
It's a terrible thing to lose,  
It's a terrible thing to lose  
What a terrible thing to lose

Look what I found in my beer  
A couple of dancing ladies and a ticket out of here  
Look what I found in my beer  
A start to being lonely and an end to my career  
  
Look what he found in his gin  
Lights' looking lively when love's looking dim  
Look what he found in his gin  
Souls look heavy when personality's thin  
  
Look what I found in the drum  
A lifelong beat and a replacement to the rum  
Look what I found in the guitar  
Another fellow thinker and a chauffeur to my heart  
  
Look what I found in the mic  
An end to screwed-up drinking and a Paul I actually like  
Look what I found in my beer  
A free test drive for a heart I cannot steer  
Look what I found in my beer  
  
Look what I found in my drink  
A brain without a plughole and a sink without a think  
Look what I found in my drink  
A "love you" to the barmaid and a too-familiar wink  
  
Look what we found in his booze  
The reflection of him and his children without shoes  
Look what we found in his booze  
This mornings jigsaw in a hill of last nights clues  
  
Look what I found in the drum  
A lifelong beat and a replacement to the rum  
Look what I found in the guitar  
Another fellow thinker and a chauffeur to my heart  
  
Look what I found in the mic  
An end to screwed-up drinking and a Paul I actually like  
Look what I found in my beer  
A free test drive for a heart I cannot steer  
Look what I found in my beer  
  
Look what we found in the dance  
Look what I've found in the song  
Low expectations in a large pile of cans  
It makes the drink seem weak,  
The friendship strong

I'm losing things  
That's what old-fashioned love brings  
Lost the key to the house  
The feeling in my mouth  
I'm losing things  
  
I'm forgetting things  
That's what old-fashioned love brings  
Forgot the number of the street  
The shoes on your feet  
I'm forgetting things  
  
'Cause I've a limited capacity in my brain  
When my brain is filled with you  
  
Like they've impaired the ability  
I had to know just what was true  
And it's a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me don't care  
I've forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
  
Well I've lost belief  
But I've found if you turn that stone,  
there's love underneath  
And when I had belief  
I spent all my time  
Cleaning the grime from my holy teeth  
  
I'm losing things  
I'm losing things  
And it's a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me don't care  
I've forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
  
Yes, I'm losing things  
Yes, yes yes I'm losing things  
And it's a real Greek Tragedy I know  
But so much of me don't care  
I've forgotten every name in my life  
But I still remember her  
That's why I'm losing things  
I'm losing things

Your wife's got beautiful skin  
Shame it's not round her body no more  
It just came away in my hands  
As I asked her up to dance  
Just cut her out of your scrapbook  
If she ever made it in  
And if there's any old photos of her  
You know where to find the bin  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
Your wife's got beautiful teeth  
Pity they're not in the mouth no more  
They just seem to crumble and fall  
As I pinned her to the wall  
Just rub her out of your diary  
Scratch her name off your list  
And if you want to see her smiling  
Take a good look at this fist  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue  
  
You took this boy  
And you showed him insanity  
You said he must abide  
He showed you beauty  
And you showed him vanity  
Can't say that I cried  
  
"Can't work it out"  
It's what I always say  
Adjourn this love into another day  
If you bite off more than you can chew  
Adjourn this love without a clue

Ooh you care, you really, really care  
From the first 12" I made to the colour of my underwear  
Ooh you know, you really, really know  
Inside, outside in, from head to toe  
  
But where were you in the colder days?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
And where will you be in years to come?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
  
So don't beg and don't plead  
You can't have the heart you made bleed  
You're in love with fame  
So whilst we love, please don't scream my name  
  
You're my friends, my only real friends  
But I'd like to know where you'll be when the party ends  
I remember your face the dance was slow  
"Easy" by The Commodores and you said 'no'  
  
But where were you in colder days?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
And where will you be in years to come?  
I'd like to know, I'd like to know  
  
So here's an invitation to this caring nation  
25 years from now will you come my cremation  
Sherry or beer, family and friends  
Will you be there? Will you be there?  
No fame, no fortune, no name in lights  
Will you be there? Will you be there?

They say always use a condom, I say always use a whip  
They say be careful where you come at night, I just shoot straight from the
hip  
When it comes to loves great fountain, I won't just take a sip  
I'll swallow and I'll gulp until the fountain makes me sick  
  
So it's me left with the baby and disease  
You can't say you didn't want it on your hands and on your knees  
You made me feel so special  
Well you were especially good  
I'm sorry that you misunderstood  
  
These neatly folded corduroys hide rubber underneath  
But the only rubber you have worn is that useless rubber sheath  
I won't have what I've got for you stolen by no thief  
'Cause the safest sex I've ever had was hanging from a tree  
  
So you've left me for another pretty face  
That's not true I left you for one half the human race  
Now I'm by myself  
A woman who knows her place  
It's not so much the chase, it's the race  
  
They say treat her like a lady and she'll treat you like her jewels  
They say cruel to be kind, I just say cruel to be cruel  
They say only marry once, I say only marry fools  
They wouldn't have made the cane if you weren't meant to break the rules  
  
Have you told them that you'll hurt them then be gone?  
I've told them that I'll hurt them if that really turns them on  
You left a bitter scar  
I tied those ropes too tight!  
I'll tie them loose for you tonight  
  
When I told you that I loved you  
I meant mini-correct  
When I said I'd never leave you  
I meant mini-correct  
A ring around your finger, a chain around your neck  
That was major correct

(M. Greaves)  
  
I was always told that time could heal  
And change the way the broken-hearted feel  
Now I know it's not true  
For I'm sad and blue  
And I'm sure missing her now  
  
When she said goodbye  
I was not sad enough to cry  
The misery I'd known  
Would end somehow  
Oh, but I'm sure missing her now  
  
I always thought the single life would soothe me  
A different girl depending on my mood  
But the dance floor is no place for a lonesome heart  
And I'd wind up nailed to a barstool

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you.  
Your so like the lady with the mystic smile.  
Is it only 'cause your lonely the have blamed you?  
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?  
  
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?  
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep.  
They just lie there and they die there.  
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?  
Or are you just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?  
  
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?  
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep.  
They just lie there and they die there.  
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Here he comes  
Mother's Pride  
With the first ever satchel she bought him swinging by his side  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
With a headful of 'get your laces tied' and 'woe betide'  
  
With a year's supply of sandwiches and fairy cakes  
That she provides for him to eat at dinner breaks  
It's no surprise at all, at ad the friends he makes  
His stomach aches  
he's Mother's Pride  
  
He's presentable, well looked after  
He's domestically disastrous  
He's adorable  
Mother's Pride  
  
Here he comes  
Father's Pride  
With a head filled up with devil dogs and genocide  
Here he comes  
Father's Pride  
He's showing all the kids his tickets for ringside  
  
He'll always roam the yard looking for a fight  
He'll pick on all the kids who're twice his height  
He's the reason dinner ladies toss and turn at night  
Teacher's Blight  
Father's Pride  
  
He's the image of his Dad  
Mickey Mouse meets Jack the Lad  
He's never sad  
Father's Pride  
  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
Here he comes Father's Pride  
Here he comes Mother's Pride  
Father's Pride  
His Mother's Pride

A winning smile of gleaming teeth  
W.O. on his handkerchief  
He does a handstand for his fans  
Have you seen those beautiful hands?  
  
Marching to the sound of drums  
Look at the guitar he strums  
He's the man with the golden gums  
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm he hums  
  
Chorus:  
Just to hear the words you speak  
Just to feel your body heat  
Just to see what's underneath this week  
So take a look at this boy  
Stand back, enjoy  
Take a look at his ploy  
He's cool, he's coy  
They go higher, higher  
'Til they set themselves on fire  
They go higher, higher  
'Til they set the neighbourhood on fire  
  
In baggy underpants and vest  
He makes a move toward his guest  
Round and round and up the spire  
Loving like a tumble dryer  
Just to see him undressed  
Put his manhood to the test  
I suppose I could have guessed  
  
Repeat chorus

(M. Greaves)  
  
I work in the steel mills  
Where the sun never shines  
The pounding of hammers is all mine  
  
And I've sailed this wide ocean  
For money and cod  
So far from my loved ones  
But nearer to God  
  
So sing a song for the working man  
And I'll sing you a love song  
  
And my name's Wild Bob Conroy  
I'm a hard man of old  
Now I'm a drinker  
Coming in from the cold  
  
I fought for the fighting  
And I fought for a wage  
And I fight for survival  
Like most men my age

I wasn't sure if it was Marx or Hitler that was in this year  
I hadn't been to Brighton for a while so it wasn't too clear  
So imagine my surprise when I opened my eyes  
To find it was the Liberals who were hip to sloganeer  
  
I'm out tonight and can't decide between Soviet hip or British pride  
  
So help me out, so help me out  
Blackpool help me out, Scarborough pull me through  
So help me out  
  
They wore enamel badges of David Steel on their sleeves  
And nuclear power no thanks, not sure and yes please  
And their faces were two fold and their teeth they were gold  
And they wore their pinstripe suits with a rip at the knee

Old Red eyes is back  
Red from the night before the night before  
Walked into the wrong bar walked into a door  
  
Old Red's in town  
And sitting late at night he doesn't make a sound  
Just adding to the wrinkles on his deathly frown  
  
They're only red from all the tears that I should've shed  
They're only red from all the women that I could've wed  
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
  
Listen up Old Red  
You never listened to a word the doctor said  
He told you if you drank another you'd be dead  
  
Old Red Eyes is back  
His shoulders ache all over and his brain is sore  
He pours a drink and listens to his body thaw  
  
They're only red from all the thoughts unused inside my head  
They're only red from all the things I could have done instead  
So when you look into these eyes I hope you realize  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
  
Blue is a street without an end  
Red is the color of my hell  
Blue is a greeting from a friend  
Red is the color of farewell  
  
Old Red he died  
And every single landlord in the district cried  
An empty bottle of whiskey laying by his side  
A lazy little tear running from each eye  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue  
They could never be blue

I once had a friend who I loved from my heart  
But I went on and left her 'fore I'd made a start  
Now I'm moaning the blues like the rest of the charts  
Take me back  
  
So I'll cry with a limp  
Just get by on a limb  
Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed  
So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek  
And farewell my sweet Northern Rose  
  
Give me one last love song  
To bring you back, bring you back  
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black  
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end  
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend  
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'  
Let it die, let it die  
  
Those bloody great ballads we hated at first  
Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse  
Save us from baldness and saving the earth  
Take me back  
  
And I'll smile with a limp  
And I'll love with a limp  
Till the clouds disappear from above  
And as the storm moves away all I can say  
Is there's a towel on the door for your love  
  
Give me one last love song  
To bring you back, bring you back  
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black  
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end  
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend  
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend'  
Let it die, let it die, let it die

She's a perfect 10, but she wears a 12  
Baby keep a little 2 for me  
She could be sweet 16, bustin' out at the seams  
It's still love in the first degree  
  
When he's at my gate, with a big fat 8  
You want to see the smile on my face  
And even at my door, with a poor poor 4  
There ain't no man can replace  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
If he's extra large well I'm in charge  
I can work this thing on top  
If he's XXL well what the hell  
Every penny don't fit the slot  
  
The anorexic chicks, the model 6  
They don't hold no weight with me  
Well 8 or 9, well that's just fine  
But I like to hold something I can see  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty  
But I've had to fit a second hand  
I've bought a calendar, and every month  
Is taken up by lover man  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight

Here comes Pockets  
His trousers hold a thousand deadly sins  
The maddest things we ever found in bins  
He clutches them and looks at you and grins  
  
Here comes Pockets  
The children wary of what they may contain  
The linen may have changed, the contents same  
A trouser-treasure island with no name  
  
And socially at the platform that the timetable forgot  
Picking up used tickets in a station of have-nots  
When you're on that train of thought  
You pass some pretty funky stops  
When you're on that train of thought  
You pass some pretty funky stops  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
  
Here comes Pockets  
Picking up the things we cannot see  
A bicycle, a dame, a Christmas tree  
Things of no value to you or me  
  
Here comes Pockets  
Reduced through history to just a crawl  
History turns the tall into the small  
But natural born trawlers love to trawl  
  
And the guitar of his dreams hangs upon some wall  
Or laying underneath the staircase in a hall  
We can carry dreams but we can't hold them all  
That's why we learn the Blues before we actually fall  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
That's the Pocket, let him be  
  
And he's clinging on to hope  
Like the oak tree to the gale  
'Cause finding one love letter in a sky high jumble sale  
Is one single reason, why the Pocket will not fail

Line one is the time  
That you, you first stayed over at mine  
And we drank our first bottle of wine  
And we cried  
  
Line two we're away  
And we both, we both had nowhere to stay  
Well the bus-shelter's always OK  
When you're young  
  
Now you're older and I look at your face  
Every wrinkle is so easy to place  
And I only write them down just in case  
That you die  
  
Let's take a look at these crows feet, just look  
Sitting on the prettiest eyes  
Sixty 25th of Decembers  
Fifty-nine 4th of Julys  
Not through the age or the failure, children  
Not through the hate or despise  
Take a good look at these crows feet  
Sitting on the prettiest eyes  
  
Line three I forget  
But I think, I think it was our first ever bet  
And the horse we backed was short of a leg  
Never mind  
  
Line four in a park  
And the things, the things that people do in the dark  
I could hear the faintest beat of your heart  
Then we did  
  
Now you're older and I look at your face  
Every wrinkle is so easy to place  
And I only write them down just in case  
You should die  
  
Lets take a look at these crows feet, just look  
Sitting on the prettiest eyes  
Sixty 25th of Decembers  
Fifty-nine 4th of Julys  
You can't have too many good times, children  
You can't have too many lines  
Take a good look at these crows feet  
Sitting on the prettiest eyes  
  
Well my eyes look like a map of the town  
And my teeth are either yellow or they're brown  
But you'll never hear the crack of a frown  
When you are here  
You'll never hear the crack  
Of a frown

You're kind of pretty you can cover in make-up  
Cover in perfume too  
Moonlight, mud fight, any kinda sunlight  
Still comes shining through  
  
Stuff it with cakes, see if it breaks  
Put it in the oven, see how she bakes  
Your kind of pretty you can gas mark 11  
But you can't ever overdo  
  
Your kinda pretty, don't need advertising  
Your kinda pretty comes with own billboard  
Newly-weds nearly-deads  
Anyone with bed-stead  
Your kinda pretty  
You're all they can't afford  
Cover your eyes, see if it dies  
Move to the city, start dating guys  
You're kind of pretty you can try to deny  
But eventually you'll thank the lord  
  
You're kind of pretty don't need an umbrella  
It knows what weather can do  
Sandstorm, rainstorm, anything a cloud's warn  
Can't hide the prettiest view  
  
Cover with paints, see if it stains  
Take it to a window, press up against  
Your kinda pretty you can drag through a hedge  
But no-one would believe you'd been through  
  
Your kinda pretty, don't need advertising  
Your kinda pretty comes with own billboard  
Newly-weds nearly-deads  
Anyone with bed-stead  
Your kinda pretty  
You're all they can't afford  
Cover your eyes, see if it dies  
Move to the city, start dating guys  
You're kind of pretty you can try to deny  
But eventually you'll thank the lord

Little seas can be big seas  
To the wrong or long of sights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
  
The Doctor told me the chemist  
He had nothing for my plights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When it's always been left in port  
  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
  
Little voyage can be big voyage  
If you sail in the middle of night  
But the Mediterranean  
Needs the compass tonight  
  
It gives cheap thrills to the seagulls  
Life to lifes little kites  
But the Mediterranean  
Is my aspirin tonight  
  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When it's always been left in port  
  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  

I hope your new man's good for you in bed  
Better than this whisky-drinking slob  
A weekend in Vienna, a boat trip on the Med  
I hope you've found the right man for the job.  
  
Oh he's fine, he's just fine  
He loves me just like you loved your wine  
When it comes to other women, I bet he doesn't touch a drop  
I think you've found the right man for the job.  
  
Chorus:  
Here's to then, and cheers  
Thanks for the friendship you've given these years  
Here's to him, and cheers  
He's given me some happiness where you just gave tears  
He must have a big yacht  
A nose in the air can't be all that he's got  
A good head on his shoulders isn't everything he's got  
I think I've found the right man for the job  
I thank you for the toffees that you gave  
And thank you for the flowers that didn't arrive  
I sent you a bouquet, but I sent it to your grave  
I didn't think that you were still alive  
  
Oh he's fine, he's still fine  
He likes to wine and dine and actually dine  
His roses are regular, his kisses on the dot  
I think I've found the right man for the job  
  
Chorus  
  
You'll be pleased to hear I've found a new romance  
Let me introduce you to my friends  
Seven gins for seven tonics begin a merry dance  
We're out every night til nighttime ends

Imagine sailing solo around the world  
Only to find you've missed a continent out  
And as your happy turns choppy and tidal wave swirls  
You're wondering why there's no one about  
  
At least Captain Scott actually stood on the spot  
Where he planned to put up Union Jack  
And though Captain Cook cursed the map that he took  
He got near enough for native's attack  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
Circling you is journey minus view  
Exploration without reason or reward  
'Cause when I get near, you use an arrow or spear  
To prevent my heart ever being shored  
  
The earth ain't flat but it's a simple doormat  
Compared to your unclimbable self  
The desolate terrain, you have to cross to your brain  
Just one of your slippery shelves  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
And if I ever get close, I'll need a banner or post  
To hang it from, first there or not  
So voyage may uncover a sister or brother  
And a friendship that Colombus forgot

I should've kept my eyes shut  
But I had to go and peep  
But when you saw what I saw  
Well, it's hard just to roll back to sleep  
  
I would've kept my eyes shut  
But I thought I heard you scream  
And I've a penchant for violence  
You don't seem to find in a dream  
  
The scene a little clearer  
My father with a rope  
And in the cage, centre-stage  
It's mother who's destined to choke  
  
And she choke and we choke  
On the words that we wish we'd not spoke  
Just when you felt you had someone to trust  
Out comes the man with the dagger and cloak  
  
I should've read the novels  
Believed every word  
But the stories they wrote  
Were so different to ones that I'd heard  
  
I should've kept my eyes shut  
My mouth should've closed  
But the mixture of vomit and blood  
Just crept up through my nose  
  
It became a little clearer  
As soon as I awoke  
My father stands with rope in hand  
A screaming mother kneels in hope  
  
And she hope and we hope  
That me words that she said won't provoke  
A smile is removed and a petal is crushed  
What once was a laugh has turned into a joke  
  
You should've kept your mouth shut

I love you from the bottom, of my pencil case  
I love you in the songs, I write and sing  
  
Love you because, you put me in my rightful place  
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring  
  
Cheap, never cheap  
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep  
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep  
And write it all down  
  
Oh Shirley, Oh Deborah, Oh Julie, Oh Jane  
I wrote so many songs about you  
I forget your name (I forget your name)  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
I forget your name  
  
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case  
I love the way you never ask me why  
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face  
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry  
  
Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap  
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovey cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Oh Cathy, Oh Alison, Oh Phillipa, Oh Sue  
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
I wrote this song for you  
  
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story  
Turned her grief into glory  
Late at night, by the typewriter light,  
She ripped his ribbon to shreds

If it ain't an epic  
Don't dust it  
If it ain't an epic  
Don't cry for it  
If it ain't perfect girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
If he ain't got style on it  
Don't bust it  
If he ain't got length on it  
Don't weep for it  
If it ain't just perfect, girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Suck harder  
If you want to make an empty shell  
Suck harder  
If you want to make an empty shell  
If it ain't no vintage  
Don't dust it  
Don't dust it  
  
If it ain't antique  
Well, Mary, don't you weep  
If it ain't well dressed  
Well sister do what's best  
If it ain't just perfect girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Suck harder if it ain't antique  
Well, Mary, don't you weep  
Don't you weep  
Suck harder

Tears have rolled down many good cheek  
So when it comes down to your turn  
Don't be afraid of admitting you're weak  
Cause these are tears that you earn  
  
Strangers, new neighbours, they'll both understand  
Who hasn't been there? Hold up your hand  
Strangers, neighbours, none of them planned  
Tears are the wage of this land  
  
When raindrop first fell to the ground  
It seemed like the brightest idea  
Even though teardrops were already around  
No one yet linked them with tear  
  
Raindrop you notice when stood under trees  
Pin-drop you can hear if down on your knees  
But if teardrop anyone sees  
It's time, gentlemen please  
  
Scars you know take longer to heal  
Whilst tears you'll not see again  
So which do we try so hard to conceal  
The ones that make fools of us men  
Bricklayer, teacher, firefighter or vet  
One thing in common, the hankies they've wet  
But hidden away in the bedroom I bet  
Tears in public, not yet  
Drums have rolled for hundreds of years  
Since we've blown one another to bits  
Generals and soldiers still holding their ears  
Cause drumbeat and teardrop don't mix  
  
When teardrops fall everyone in the band  
Makes out their music's slipped from the stand  
Leaving the singer, his head in his hands  
Public emotion, be damned  

We've come a long way from the cave  
What, you started to shave?  
Now we know just how to behave  
Since chivalry decided to bathe  
  
And as the skirts we wore were increasingly high  
Till the hem was just a cloud in the sky  
And the chat up lines got increasingly fly  
As the truth bought a suit and a tie  
  
The cat loves the mouse  
The mouse loves the cheese  
The bees love the birds  
The birds love those bees  
The bee loves that honey  
So honey please  
Why are we so different to these?  
  
So when I'm old and I'm grey  
You know you already are  
When I'm overweight  
You know you already are  
If I've overstayed my welcome by a day  
Just feel free to say  
You know I already have  
  
And as the skirts we wore were increasingly high  
Till the hem was just a cloud in the sky  
And the chat up lines got increasingly fly  
As the truth bought a suit and a tie  
  
The cat chases bird  
To the top of the tree  
The dog chases postman  
To the end of the street  
The postman he chases  
Every girl that he meets  
So why are we so different to these?  
  
I've been your bird, I've been your bitch  
I've been whatever B you ever wished  
I've been your cat, I've been your chick  
I've been which ever C you thought to pick  
I've been your bat, I've been your cow  
I've been whichever B and C that you'd allow  
I've been your dog, your dragon and your duck  
I've been whatever D you thought was cool to fuck

Woman goes to heaven, it's not important when  
'Cause as soon as she arrives God has to send her down again  
?You've got an extra five years to clean up after men?  
?I mean no disrespect God, but you better make it ten?  
  
Well if heaven's an improvement I won't mind the extra squeeze  
I've got a few more birds down there, after losing bees  
Trying to lose their bees  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
  
Alcoholic finds himself outside the pearly gates  
I've only got one worry God, a few outstanding slates  
Any tab you used to have been passed to so called mates  
And after they've paid-up they're off to the land of empty crates  
  
Heaven is a glass, neither half empty nor half full  
So do us all a favor God and give that thing a pull  
Give that thing a pull  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become the well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
  
Model turns up hours late, he had to get it right  
If you're gonna look cool in heaven wear something more than white  
Vanity's close to arrogance, just slightly more polite  
Fashion show a jumble sale at a slightly different height  
At a slightly different height  
  
So don't be shocked who queue-jumps  
Or who just calmly waits  
A certain type of behavior  
The guest list just creates  
  
No time for lively discussion  
No time for televised debates  
The well-meaning soon become the well meant  
It's the hard sell or hell at the gates, the gates  
The gates, the gates

If I walk like a fool, I've walked like that since school  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Who knows the effect,  
That whisky could've had on me  
It could've been the lure of the sea  
  
'Cause leather ain't as strong as the weather  
But leather can strangle any dream  
And leather ain't as strong as the weather  
But leather took Curtis from me  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea,  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Once I felt chained, and now, now I feel free  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Polo and Da Gama,  
Well those two had nothing on me  
Could be I'm a sucker for the sea  
  
'Cause silver, ain't as quick as the tongue  
But silver, took the M.L.K so young  
And metal ain't as strong as the petal  
But metal left the verse unsung  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea,  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Freedom's taken a liking to me  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Look in my eyes 'cause my belt's broke free  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
The Pirates Of Penzance,  
They have nothing on me  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea  
  
Maybe it's the lure of the sea, maybe it's the lure of the sea  
Suicide's just the anarchist that kicks down modesty  
But maybe it's the lure of the sea

Little seas can be big seas  
To the wrong or long of sights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
The Doctor told me the chemist  
He had nothing for my plights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When it's always been left in port  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
Little voyage can be big voyage  
If you sail in the middle of night  
But the Mediterranean  
Needs the compass tonight  
It gives cheap thrills to the seagulls  
Life to lifes little kites  
But the Mediterranean  
Is my aspirin tonight  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When it's always been left in port  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
I'd rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
'Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight

There was a pool table there at the wedding  
That most of the men stood and played  
Whilst the women danced in their melancholy  
Till the last record started to fade  
And as D. J. Turned the lights up  
And packed his records away  
He noticed a lonely figure still there  
So quietly turned to say  
  
Tears you thought lasted a lifetime  
Won't last too much more than a day  
And you'll prove that you still have your strength left  
When you wipe those tears well away, well away  
  
Roses in garden bring joy to the bleak  
Lilies save wretched from worse  
Music lifts up those too weary to speak  
So, sister you sing the next verse  
  
The path in life that you have taken  
I can figure out just from your frown  
Either it's down the up escalator  
Or maybe sometimes up the down  
And you may not feel that you have travelled  
But sure as hell been across town  
And certainly if story unravelled  
You've lost more than you ever found  
  
One thing's for certain I've travelled  
And a not too dissimilar route  
Those ups and downs and rounds after rounds  
You're wearing them just like a suit, like a suit  
  
So if roses bring joy to the bleak  
Lilies save wretched from worse  
Music lifts up those too weary to speak  
Then D. J. I'll take the next verse  
  
So sister judge strength not by muscle  
Or weight that your body can lift  
But by heavyweight heart that you carry  
That no other young woman could shift  
Hey Mr D. J. A special request  
Play that last record for me  
And make it as long and as painfully sad  
As any slow ballad could be

The opening of a new book  
A singular wave crashing  
The opening of a new book  
Sat on your chuff knowing nothing  
The opening of a new book  
A ticket on a train from nowhere to somewhere  
The opening of a new book  
Are you Elephant Man or George Michael?  
The opening of a new book  
A sip, a swig, a gulp, a mouthful, a session, a bender, a life  
The opening of a new book  
Does this personality have any brakes?  
The opening of a new book  
Does anyone know who oils the brakes?  
Are you supposed to oil them yourself?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Are you cancelled? Are you taken?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Can anyone repair me?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Are you cancelled? Are you taken in?  
  
Can you whisky? Can you gin?  
Can you speed without brakes?  
Can anyone repair me?

Love takes time we all agree  
and time's not the easiest to cheat  
The water changes one degree  
When will the shiver  
of this river  
turn to sea  
  
The river does no good, no harm  
Tempts us like pirates to its calm  
Lover's shanty, devil's psalm  
Goddamn this river  
and its shiver  
and its charm  
  
If you've got love's A to Z  
Don't go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This river's hooked the floating dead  
  
Our lives go bounding down the strewn  
When will we realize minnow dreams  
The frustration eating you and me  
Our only wish  
to be the fish  
that meets the sea  
  
We cannot tell a he or she  
But us fish can tell a we  
We know the seed we know the tree  
When will my conker  
conquer thee  
  
The cheaper woman and myself  
We've both got ladders in our tights  
When you've been left on the top shelf  
You've got those ladders in your sights

Here I walk, here I walk  
Looking for an angel's wings in the den of the hawk  
  
Here I am, here I am  
With a choice between an also ran and a sunbed tan  
  
And you thought you'd found your own little look  
How I misjudged, how I mistook  
And you thought you'd found the style of your hair  
I guess tonight I'll take, I'll take these troubles to  
the rocking chair  
  
So I'll take these high-heeled shoes  
And yes I'll take these traditional views  
I'll take this deep despair  
Of a 30 year old square, to the rocking chair  
  
Here I sit, here I sit  
Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit  
Here I stand, here I stand  
Torn between the balding drunk and no man's land  
  
And they'll tell you when you've reached your peak  
Where the wolf-whistle rung there's a deafening shriek  
Blowing kisses into thin air  
I guess tonight I'll take, I'll take these troubles to  
The rocking chair  
  
So I'll take this awkward stance  
And I'll take this sexless dance  
I'll take this deep despair of a 30 year old square  
To the rocking chair  
  
Am I skinny? A shade too fat?  
Mmm, my friend the cat knows all about that  
Am I happy?  
(Here I sit, here I sit)  
Just a little sad  
(Looking for a warming smile in a house of cold wit)  
Mmm, my friend the cat knows all about that  
Am I skinny?  
(Here I walk, here I walk)  
A shade too fat?  
(Looking for an angel's wings in the den of the hawk)  
My friend the cat knows all about that

If euro replaces the pound  
It's still likely to be shiny and round  
Rich may switch the way they feel rich  
But not the man who's alive  
Or the man who has drowned  
Keeping pound only makes sense  
If you're worth more than 99 pence Those who have a lot and those who have not  
Remain francs marks pesetas or cents  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound  
We'll be eating frogs and modeling clogs  
And you'll be hunting french  
And dutch with a hound  
Now a nation goes to the vote  
So our country has its name on the note  
Same set of people same boat  
Need their name in the back of their coat  
Heads or tails can't have been won  
On whose head graced whatever was spun  
If queen's head's not on money they've got  
It's still business and money's still fun  
If money is the root of all evil  
What does that make lover of pound  
We'll be eating frogs and modeling clogs and you'll be hunting french  
And dutch with a hound  
Now a nation goes to the vote  
So our country has its name on the note  
Same set of people same boat  
Need their name in the back of their coat

When you're too old for the swings  
You tend to choose the slide  
And they never seem to warn you  
The slide's your final ride  
And when you're at the top of it  
And you cannot see the end  
Either don't let go son - Or grab the nearest friend  
The slide is no respecter of dignity or class  
As soon as you sit down on it  
That slide has got your ass  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
When the slide was invented  
A thousand drinkers sighed  
They thought they had the copyright  
On the very word the slide  
It's a picture of innocence  
On which the innocent have fried  
Take the helter skelter son  
It's easier than the slide  
Advice to listening parents  
Or the father of the bride  
Let them marry anyone  
But don't let her take the slide  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom lies denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
It'll take you much much lower  
Than you ever would have asked  
'Cause as soon as you sit down on it  
The slide has got your ass - It's customers are fools  
And every one of them deceased  
The long and silver murderer  
The devil must have greased  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A pile of broken souls at the bottom it denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide  
Heroes and villains have tried and cried  
A broken soul at the bottom it denied  
Don't take the slide, don't take the slide

Ginger Elvis Presley looked a fraction sad  
Roaming the whole town from bin to bin  
Well living on the streets wasn't all that bad  
Where no-one seemed to know that he was King  
  
The sound of New York City  
Isn't police sirens wailing  
It's the sound of Wall Street tills  
Whilst everyone is failing  
  
Sometimes you feel expensive  
Sometimes you feels so cheap  
You can roam the streets a King  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
You can mime to any record  
With a hairbrush or a spoon  
But God help the singer out of tune  
  
A crippled Mohammad Ali  
Looked at bad luck in the mirror  
Bad luck looked back at him and sighed  
He looked a good foot smaller  
And a couple of stone thinner  
And if anyone came toward him  
He would hide  
  
The sound of North America  
Isn't Christians quietly praying  
It's the sound of shuffling feet  
That don't know where they're going  
  
Sometimes you feel expensive  
Sometimes you feels so cheap  
You can roam the streets a King  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
You can fight with anybody  
With a glimmer of a chance  
But God help the boxer with no hands  
  
A homeless Greta Garbo  
Moves across the street  
The moonlight shining clearly  
Through her skirt  
A real life living legend  
That no-one wants to meet  
And that's when being Garbo  
Really hurts  
  
The lyrics of "New York"  
May have Frank Sinatra singing  
But the rhythm and the melody  
Were dead black men swinging  
  
Sometimes you feel expensive  
Sometimes you feels so cheap  
You can roam the streets a Queen  
Whilst everyone's asleep  
You can act with anybody  
From the cradle to the crypt  
But God help the actress  
Who doesn't know the script

There's a bench in every park dedicated to  
Those who sat there once but didn't make it through  
There are names carved deep in bark on every tree  
By those who spent their time like you and me  
And wherever geography may place you now  
There's a piece of history all folk carry around  
Whatever your situation, whatever it may allow  
There's an even larger piece in every lost and found  
There is song, there's always a song  
Wherever there's perfection there's a wrong  
There's always song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond  
There's a name that we graffiti'd up on a wall  
To the folks who live there now, makes no sense at all  
And in every underpass, on every street  
A promise someone made but couldn't keep  
A tiny piece of chalk in every coat  
In every film the smallest lump in throat  
In every song you've sung in every novel read  
That unkissed love will rear, rear its head  
There is song, there's always song  
Wherever there's a right there's always wrong  
There's always a song but a broken bond  
And an unkissed frog in every village pond  

It was '96 in South Carolina,  
That's the place and not the goddamn year  
Just sittin' on the porch out at Bobby's place,  
Just tuggin' on a lukewarm beer.  
And there i was peepin like an old sidewinder,  
Just an inch or so above the mud.  
The first to find out that its rainin'  
is the last to find out it's a flood.  
  
It was Paradise Valley, Nevada,  
Not far from where the west was won.  
I am the only black face in the whole damn place  
Just a raisin in the blazing sun.  
And there i am like that old sidewinder,  
Just wishin' that her eggs ain't hatched.  
And the chain i wear has 'em wishin' for the day when it came with a ball
attached.  
  
So I'm gonna move right outta this town.  
When this old skin stops weighin' me down.  
This old skin.  
  
He was sittin' in the very same spot that  
Otis sat to watch the dock of the bay  
In the very same spot that the ships rolled in.  
Now there's nothing but the mud and the clay.  
  
I'm gonna move right outta this town.  
This old skin, it's weighin' me down.  
This old skin.  
  
Outside Orlando when the sunshine state  
Has just upped itself another degree.  
I am the very last orange of the whole years crop.  
Hangin' dearly to the branch of the tree.  
And the wind and the spring couldn't do anything.  
So im burnin' in the sun of the south.  
That old sidewinder in the dust below,  
I'm just waiting till it opens its mouth.  
  
So I'm gonna move right outta this town  
When this old skin finally touches the ground.  
this old skin  
  
He was sittin' in the very same spot that  
Otis sat to watch the dock of the bay  
In the very same spot that the ships rolled in.  
Now there's nothing but the mud and the clay.  
  
Now I'm gonna move right outta this town  
When this old skin finally touches the ground.  
This old skin  
This old skin  
This old skin  
This old skin

(The Zombies)  
  
The warmth of your love's  
Like the warmth from the sun  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
Don't let go of my hand  
Now the darkness has gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And I won't forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I won't forget  
The way you said "darling, I love you"  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now we're there  
And we've only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
The warmth of your smile  
Smile for me, little one  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
You don't have to worry  
All your worried days are gone  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And I won't forget  
The way you helped me up when I was down  
And I won't forget  
The way you said "darling, I love you"  
You gave me faith to go on  
Now we're there  
We've only just begun  
This will be our year  
Took a long time to come...  
  
And this will be our year  
Took a long time to come...

Verse one, he was pissed, an excuse that you probably missed  
'Cause his smile and his grace made your skirt ride high  
  
Verse two, still drunk and his breath most definitely stunk  
Of the lies and the shite he was spitting out  
  
Chorus:  
So won't you throw his song away  
Won't you throw his song away  
Won't you throw his song away  
  
Verse three, is the verse that'll make you smile  
And if you're able to hold back the bile and just kiss his hairy ear  
  
Verse four is as sad as a man ever gets  
Is a verse built to open your legs  
If you don't, if you don't, he'll retire  
  
Chorus  
  
You, you deserve higher than I can sing  
Deserve lower than the trumpet can swing  
You, you deserve all  
Me, I'm beyond all that ism and blues  
I'm beyond all that, I always lose  
Yes I fuck, but I win  
  
Chorus

(Ben E King)  
  
Let's not fight it anymore  
Unpack the bags and close the door  
I'll never leave you, no no  
Though you lied right from the start  
I can't convince my stupid heart  
Not to believe you, no no  
You've got two good men strung out  
And there's not the slightest doubt  
That other men have loved you before  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
If I had one ounce of pride  
I'd stand up or step aside  
But girl love you (can't you tell it)  
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop  
'Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop  
Or rise above you, no no  
Let him speak up for himself  
I speak for me and no one else  
'Cause I'm a beggar knockin' on your door  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
I'm too far gone to turn around  
To lift myself up off the ground  
And start all over, over and over  
Now he or I must win or lose  
No matter which one you may choose  
You'll be in clover (you know you will)  
While you're makin' up your mind  
I'll be prayin all the time  
Prayin' that you'll never, never ever let me go  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
  
But you work your thing so well  
I dream of Heaven and live in Hell  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore  
Till I can't take it anymore  
Take it anymore

She'd brought along the oranges  
He'd brought the tea  
They'd both brought along a sick-bag just in case  
  
The plate of chicken sandwiches  
Were lovely they agreed  
And I watched him spit the bits into her face  
  
'Do you love me like you used to' he sighs  
'I love you twice as much' she replies  
They were on the train to Venice, where else?  
I think tonight I fancy myself  
  
I'd rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
  
Later in the evening  
The sun came rolling down  
And they talked about their fantasies and fears  
  
Between the heavy breathing  
And those lighter licking sounds  
I heard him whisper this question in her ear  
  
'Would you still love me if I lost my legs?'  
'I'd see that you were loved and you were fed'  
'I end up in a car crash almost dead'  
'For richer and for partly severed head'  
  
I'd rather drink that toast to my own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
And if you drink that drink to your own health  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself  
  
The neighbours ask them out but they flatly refuse  
'We're saving up for a world-wide cruise'  
With a choice between loneliness and love-sick QE2's  
Well tonight I choose - self-abuse  
  
A four-pack in the fridge  
A good book on the shelf  
I think tonight I'd rather love myself

When we met I got wet  
Just waiting for the chance  
To dance at your feet  
And wipe your wooden seat  
  
Chorus:  
Trevor, you're bizarre  
I wish that you could tell  
Trevor, you'll go far  
I certainly wish you well  
  
He said, I am dead  
My career has passed it's peak  
And I'm weak and you're strong  
You'll have to sing this song  
  
Chorus  
  
Your words your fears  
Who do they touch on this earth  
Who gave birth  
Surely they could've done worse  
  
Chorus  
  
Shame he was nice, a nice boy  
Just filled with guts and joy  
But he died, and an audience of one cried  
Shame, he was nice  
Filled with guts and joy, filled with guts and joy  
He sang it from his heart  
And all who said they heard  
  
Said he sang it from his heart

This reign of plastic  
That replaced the reign of gold  
Couldn't have known that you  
Would feel so undersold  
If love was built on hindsight  
Then you surely would have seen  
You were joining hands  
With the Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But can you choose a Queen  
When you behave like a drone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainly never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
I didn't mean to fool you  
Into feeling King  
Of anything but plastic  
And what plastic brings  
If gold is what she had  
It's what I could've been  
The unaffordable dream  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
Yes you gave a groan  
When I took that throne  
But don't expect a gem  
When you're quarrying for stone  
Where the silverware's not expected  
And certainty never been  
That's the ideal kingdom  
Of this Tupperware Queen  
  
In future when that moan  
Has turned to prone  
And the slightest groan  
Feels so overblown  
Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb  
Runs the honeycomb  
  
Honeycomb, honey, honey  
Remember you're a drone  
And the Queen however plastic  
Runs the honeycomb  

[VERSE 1]  
Valentine.  
Won't you be my valentine.  
And introduce your heart to mine  
And be my valentine.  
[VERSE 2]  
Summertime.  
We could run and play like summertime  
With storybooks and nursery rhymes.  
So be my valentine.  
[BRIDGE]  
Candy heart.  
If anyone could, you could have a candy heart.  
You're the sweetest of all sweethearts.  
Won't you give your heart to me.  
Can't you see  
[VERSE 3]  
I love you valentine.  
Won't you be my valentine.  
And won't you share your space with mine.

Won't you be my valentine  
And introduce your heart to mine.  
And be my valentine.  
Valentine  
Valentine  
And be my valentine

And I think that I wish I was virgin  
And I smile and I think of you  
And my first, very first entry  
Clumsy and romantic  
My special mix in you  
Clumsy like the first step  
Clumsy like the first conker off the tree  
And romantic, like the wind that cuts your hair  
And romantic, like the glass that holds your drink  
Clumsy and romantic  
My special mix in you  
  
And I think that I wish I was young  
And I smile and I think of you  
And my first, very first true kiss  
Defensive and so coy  
Defensive like the jacket that holds your weight  
Defensive like the hat that holds you hair  
And coy like the first kiss, the kiss that first made you coy  
And coy like the tears, the tears that made you coy  
  
So gentle, so gentle it made you strong  
It made you strong, like the first kiss  
Clumsy and romantic, so gentle it made you strong  
Clumsy and romantic, the kiss that made you strong

There's no more little secrets we haven't yet disclosed  
We bore the living daylights of anyone too close  
And all our cards at Christmas are written to us both  
Count them up who's got the most?  
  
Said we'd be close  
Said we'd work perfectly  
Said that we'd toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
We've been through all positions and this one's definitely best  
You move Middle East and I'll move Wild West  
What happened to our friendship we could easily have guessed  
Add it up we're self-possessed  
  
Said we'd be true  
Said we'd be so so proud  
Just me an you  
We'd shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
Remember we went shopping and we went by piggyback  
I shaved all my legs and you grew hairs upon your back  
Well no-one's ever been since to this lover's shack  
It's a cul-de-sac  
  
Said we'd be close  
Said we'd work perfectly  
Said that we'd toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Said we'd be true  
Said we'd be so so proud  
Just me an you  
We'd shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a secret agent working under cover  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other

(The Dramatics)  
  
Some people are made of plastic.  
You know some people are made of wood.  
Some people have hearts of stone.  
You know some people are up to no good.  
  
But baby I'm for real, I'm as real as real can get.  
If what you're lookin' for is real love then  
What you see is what you get.  
  
What you see (what you see)  
Is what you get now (is what you get)  
X2  
Honey what you see is what you get,  
And if you've found the real thing it's the best thing yet.  
  
Some people are made of lies.  
Breed them to shame your name.  
But baby I have good intentions.  
  
But baby I'm for real, I'm as real as real can get.  
If what you're lookin' for is real love then  
What you see is what you get.

Queuing with the old folk  
There's and old man with a wicked smile  
Not through smug politeness  
He's doing it in style  
  
No savings book or flannel slacks  
No "Pardon" when I heard them ask  
Just a vodaphone and a filofax  
  
When I'm 64  
I'll dream on  
  
They all bore the milkman  
Stop him for hours at their front gate  
He just sits and thinks  
I'll make the bastard wait  
  
No dribbling or incontinence  
No longing for the old sixpence  
Just smoking weed till age makes sense  
  
When I'm 74  
I'll dream on  
  
They all save for Blackpool  
Just for the cheap companionship  
Meanwhile he counts pennies  
For a different trip  
  
No smoking pipes and drinking bitter  
No eyeing up the baby sitter  
I'll trip up kids and I'll drop my litter  
  
When I'm 84  
I'll dream on  
When I'm 84  
I'll dream on late  
I'll dream on  
And I'll whisper late  
  
You're in your nineties Arthur  
Be careful with your back  
Exercise your muscles  
I'd rather Jack  
I'd rather Jack

Who's gonna tell the orange  
They're actually brown  
Who's gonna mop up for grey  
When they've painted the town  
  
It's the news that everyone dreads  
That we're no longer painting it red  
That our gag's still funny  
But they've opted for a different clown  
  
You were great in the sixties  
But we're gonna have to pull you down  
Nothing like the sound of the shallow  
Jumping in at the deep  
  
Royalty's balloon coming down  
Is a memorable shriek  
Nothing quite like the sickening clout  
Of the dive into pool drained out  
  
You excelled as a Queen  
But you'll have to return the crown  
You were great in the sixties  
But we're gonna have to pull you down  
  
Who's gonna tell the tall  
They're beginning to shrink  
Like who's gonna tell the Swiss  
They're no longer in sync  
  
We'll have to get the maroon  
In a separate counselling room  
Say "it may be your washer  
But you seem to be fading to pink"  
  
Yesterday's ice cool  
Doesn't take long to melt and sink  
Who's gonna tell the cities  
That are acting like towns  
  
They're actually just a village  
That the posh surrounds  
The diplomatic answer  
To your 25 stone dancer  
  
Is your act's still great  
But we can't keep changing a pound  
You were Queen in your day  
But you're gonna have to give back the crown  
  
You were great in the sixties  
But we're gonna have to pull you down

(M. Greaves)  
  
You're so near  
We could touch  
You're so sad  
You cry too much  
You're so warm  
To hold on to  
We don't do  
The things we want to  
  
We can fly to the moon  
So why can't I reach you?  
Oh, oh why can't I reach you?  
  
Future's bright  
For me alright  
I close my eyes  
You saw the light  
Here it's dark  
And I'm so blue  
Here it's cold  
Wanting you  
  
I love you  
Oh, I love you so  
God, give me  
Some control

One day I'm loaded, next day I'm broke  
Spent all my money on whisky and coke  
Riding high 'till the rock hit the spoke  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
Spent all my money on a sunbed tan  
Spoke the best that a young girl can  
Ended up with a blind drunk man  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like the heartbreak hotel,  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us,  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound  
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?  
  
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like gatecrashing a field, that's not true,  
They've a harvest they yield  
Save your tears for your evening meal,  
When you're window shopping for blinds  
  
One day you're sober, next day you're not  
One day remembered, the next day forgot  
Spent all my money on cocaine and pot  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
Covered in bruises from head to toe  
No-one to speak to, and nowhere to go  
A map of nowhere, and nowhere I know  
It's like window shopping for blinds  
  
It's like the heartbreak hotel,  
With the heartbreak but nowhere to stay  
The doors are shut on us,  
The neon light fading to grey  
  
They say I drink too much, to me, well that's just profound  
How do you know you can't swim, until you have drowned?  
  
Well there's always a drop in the bottle lady  
Always a sip of the wine  
The glass doesn't seem quite so empty  
When window shopping for blinds  
  
But what if my husband should come?  
Well tell me what have you done?  
I've cherished my vodka, I've cherished my rum  
Don't mind us, we're just licking our wounds in the sun  
  
It's like writing 'I love you' in snow  
You know when you write it the message will go  
I want a message my lover will find  
Don't mind us, we're just window shopping for blinds

I spend the night in a chair  
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes  
I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes  
Then I rise to spend another day without her  
It's just no good anymore  
When you walk through the door of an empty room  
You go inside and set a table for one  
It's no fun when you have to spend a day without her  
He burst a pretty balloon  
Took it to the moon  
It was such a beautiful thing  
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie  
I said I'd rather die that be without her  
Love is such a beautiful thing  
When it knows how to swing  
And it grooves like a clock  
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part  
And it's breaking my heart to spend another day without her  
I spend the night in a chair  
Thinking she'll be there but she never comes  
I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes  
Then I rise to spend another day without her  
Can't go on without her  
There's no song without her

He was just a social drinker but social every night  
He enjoyed a pint or two or three or four  
She was just a silent thinker, silent every night  
He'd enjoy the thought of killing her before  
  
Well he was very rarely drunk but very rarely sober  
And he didn't think the problem was his drink  
But he only knew his problem when he knocked her over  
And when the rotting flesh began to stink  
  
Cry freedom for the woman in the wall  
Cry freedom for she has no voice at all  
I hear her cry all day, all night  
I hear her voice from deep within the wall  
Made a cross from knitting needles  
Made a grave from hoover bags  
Especially for the woman in the wall  
  
She'd knitted him a jumper with dominoes on  
So he wore it everyday in every week  
Pretended to himself that she hadn't really gone  
Pretended that he thought he beard her speak  
  
Then at last it seemed that he was really winning  
He felt that he had some sort of grip  
But all of his new life was sent a-spinning  
When the rotting wall began to drip

The sheets won't need changing everyday  
The freezer supply should last a year  
Those hidden little points that you're away  
Nothing much has changed since you were here  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
While you're out jogging and I'm sat snogging  
Some fool on a lakeside bench  
  
And when she calls I hope it's you that dials  
I hope it's you that feels this love inside  
And when I touch her I hope it's you that smiles  
And when I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
The family pack seems larger than it should  
Two for one's no good when there's just one  
I'd raise a bigger smile if I could  
But me minus you equals none  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out fishing and I'm sat wishing  
  
You instead of him  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out exercising and I'm there prising  
The pants of I my latest sin  
  
And when we kiss she knows it's you I kiss  
'Cause when we kiss I always start to cry  
You just can't cover up these lying lips  
When I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
An ambulance flashed past me in the street  
Just yards from where we were to meet  
I was half hoping you were dead meat  
That it was you that was under the sheet  
  
And as you lay there alone in the ward  
Fumbling for the keys to death's door  
At least I'd have summoned up the nerve  
To whisper you these words  
  
Finally! Quietly! Actually!  
I love you!

How do you feel?  
Now they've swapped that good old carthorse for a car?  
How do you feel?  
Now he's handed in his sword and taken a dart?  
Are your tiny hands starting to warm?  
Does your battered heart feel less torn?  
  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle, she shows bleeding knees  
As long as he agrees  
  
How do you feel?  
Now they've swapped your concrete cell for a padded one?  
How do you feel?  
Now every single dream you had is gone?  
Does this decay bring you to life?  
Well, I think it probably might  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle, she shows bleeding knees  
Enter perfect couple, he owns all the keys  
The blood pours from her knees  
  
You and your big ideas again  
Tell me how do you feel?

Love takes time we all agree  
And time's not the easist to cheat  
The water changes one degree  
When will the shiver of this river turn to sea ?  
The river does no good, no harm  
Tempts us like pirates to its charm  
Goddamn this river and its shiver and its charm  
  
If you've got love's A to Z  
Don't go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This river's hooked the floating dead  
  
Our lives go bounding down the stream  
When will we realise minnow dreams  
The frustration eating you and me  
Our only wish to be the fish that meets the sea  
We cannot tell a he or she  
But us fish can tell a we  
We know the seed, we know the tree  
When will my conker conquer thee  
  
If you've got love's A to Z  
Don't go dredging river bed  
Use your fins and use your head  
This river's hooked the floating dead  
The cheaper woman and myself  
We've both got ladders in our tights  
When you've been left on the top shelf  
You've got those ladders in your sights  

You just can't smile it away  
It's much more than passion it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains  
  
You just can't laugh it away  
It's too deep inside it's love  
Not just some game you can play  
For a laugh then go on your way  
  
Let's sit and talk it over  
And work it out I love you so  
And can't we just talk it over  
And see what we can do  
  
You can't just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no it's love  
And love comes eager to stay  
It won't just leave you that way  
  
You can't just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains no it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains  

You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
That's right  
The conversation we had last night  
When all I wanted to do was  
Knife you in the heart  
I kept it all in  
  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
Midnight, a husband getting ready to fight  
A daughter sleeps alone with the light  
Turned on, she bears but  
Keeps it all in  
  
Just like that murder in '73  
Just like that robbery in '62  
With all there things that have happened to me  
I kept it all in  
Why do you keep on telling me now  
  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
That's sweet  
That conversation we had last week  
When you gagged and bound me up to my seat  
You're right, I do  
I keep it all in

It was the middle of winter  
And I drove us in my car  
The snow started falling  
So we stopped off at a bar  
  
The beer started flowing  
And your mother and I took the floor  
But by the last dance we were tired  
So I booked a room next door  
  
So if anyone asks you  
If you come from Heaven above  
You're from a one star hotel  
With a five star passionate love  
  
It was a hot summers day  
And we drove there in our car  
And your father was thirsty  
So we had to find a bar  
  
Well he couldn't stop drinking  
And he couldn't stand on his feet  
We had to walk to a hotel  
And book ourselves into a suite  
  
So if the teacher asks you  
Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell  
You're from a one star drunken screw  
In a one star motel  
Yes if the teacher asks you  
Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell  
You're from a pitch black toilet  
In a highway Taco Bell  
  
I'll remember the birth  
For the rest of my time on this land  
You're mother sweating buckets  
And me holding onto her hand  
  
Well your father was absent  
He claimed he couldn't find the ward  
Just tugging on mescal  
Trying to eat the umbilical cord  
  
So if anyone asks you  
Do you know where you're from, say yes  
You're from your mother's womb  
And your father's stinking breath  
And if they ask you how you got here  
Tell them just what it took  
Your father's stinking breath  
And your mother's stinking luck  
  
Your father and I won't tell the whole truth  
Your father and I won't tell the truth

Perhaps it was the holiday we spent abroad last year  
It could have been the wine we drank last night  
Possibly the palace needs a second coat of paint  
But that doesn't condone setting it alight  
  
Why does the butler look so smug?  
And the gardener, well he looks even worse  
He's sent me every flower that he's dug  
And have you ever seen a chauffeur drive a hearse  
  
You're only jealous, Ah Ah  
You're only jealous, Ah Ah  
You're only jealous, Ah Ah  
You're only jealous, Ah Ah  
  
Perhaps it is the quantity of acres that we own  
It could be their allotment's only small  
Maybe we should reconsider giving them a wage  
But a taste of money is worse that none at all  
  
The parlourmaid's a deadly quiet lass  
Never really comes out of her shell  
But every time I talk to her, she offers me a glass  
Of a drink that she never drinks herself  
  
You're only jealous  
  
Stir it up  
  
Of the company I keep and the stars you never meet  
Of the caviar they eat whilst you're chewing at your wheat  
Of the hours that they sleep whilst you're sweating in the heat  
Of the masses at their feet and the tongue between their cheek  
Think of stronger than the weak  
Think of vulture and it's beak  
Think of oil, think of sheikh, think of lord and comfy seat  
Think of admiral and fleet, think of public school elite  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat  
Think of leaders and their sheep  
Think of butchers and their meat
