No one to talk with, all by myself  
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you  
  
I know for certain the one I love  
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
I don't go nowhere, what do I care  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, don't care to go  
I'm home about 8, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you  
  
No one to talk with, all by myself

Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

There ain't nothing I can do  
Or nothing I can say  
That folks don't criticize me  
But I'm going to do  
Just as I want to anyway  
And don't care just what people say  
If I should take a notion  
To jump into the ocean  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If I go to church on Sunday  
Then cabaret all day Monday  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If my man ain't got no money  
And I say "take all mine, honey"  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
If I give him my last nickel  
And it leaves me in a pickle  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
But I'd rather my man would hit me  
Than follow him to jump up and quit me  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
I swear I won't call no copper  
If I'm beat up by my papa  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
Nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business  
Nobody's business if I do

You took my kisses and all my love  
You taught me how to care  
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair  
  
All you took  
I gladly gave  
There is nothing left for me to save  
  
All of me  
Why not take all of me  
Can't you see  
I'm no good without you  
Take my lips  
I want to lose them  
Take my arms  
I'll never use them  
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry  
How can I go on dear without you  
You took the part that once was my heart  
So why not take all of me

Any old time you want me  
I am yours for the asking darling  
Any old time you need me  
Ill be their with love that's lasting darling.  
All through the years well stand together  
Sharing the tears and stormy weather  
And the sunshine will be yours and mine  
Any old time your blue  
You'll have our love to chase away the blues  
And any old thing you do ill see you through.  
So just remember that I am waiting dear  
If ever you want me ill be near,  
Any old time and any place you may be.  

I never knew the charm of spring  
I never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
I never missed a warm embrace  
  
Till April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom  
Holiday tables under the trees  
April in Paris, this is a feeling  
That no one can ever reprise  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
I never met it face to face  
I never new my heart could sing  
I never missed a warm embrace  
  
Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to  
What have you done to my heart

You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say I love you  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts filled with passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
It's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
Though I will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts filled with passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
It's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
Though I will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by

It's time to end my holiday and bid the country a hasty farewell.  
So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel.  
I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of
adventures and battles,  
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!  
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?  
  
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.  
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me
feel I'm home.  
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.  
  
Autumn in New  
York is often mingled with pain.  
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands,  
It's autumn in New York,  
It's good to live again.

Had my lunch all alone  
Waited for you to phone  
Said you call me at two  
So at abpout twenty of three  
I had cocktails with Lee  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Stood me up in the rain  
Tried to hurt me again  
Bet you thought I'd be blue  
I went out to a show  
With a swell guy named Joe  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
These foolish games you keep playing  
Might work with somebody else  
But I could have told you  
Right from the start  
No man is man enough  
To break my heart  
  
If you don't come tonight  
Think you'll give me a fright  
Tell you what I will do  
I'll put on my best gown  
And go painting this town  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Listen Jack you're sweet Jill  
Will be out with some Bill  
Maybe I don't cry over you

We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,  
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.  
But we all return as we live wo learn,  
That we left our happiness behind.  
  
When they sing you "Look for the Silver Lining,"  
It is silver dollars they're looking for.  
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,  
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.  
  
The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,  
Back in your own back yard,  
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,  
Back in your own back yard.  
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,  
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,  
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,  
Back In Your Own Backyard.

I'm helpless without you, baby  
I've almost lost my man  
Yes, helpless without you, baby  
I've almost lost my man  
I'm blue and confused  
Since you left me behind  
My friends all know it, baby  
The tears, I cannot hide  
My friends all know it, baby  
The tears, I cannot hide  
You've changed, you're dispositioned  
And throw my love aside  
Be fair with me, baby  
Our love can start anew  
Please be fair with me, baby  
Our love can start anew  
I'm blue and helpless, baby  
And I'm worried over you  
Yes, I'm worried  
I've got the helpless blue  

Charles trenet (jack lawrence)  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
Somewhere waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sands  
And watches the ships that go sailing  
  
Somewhere beyond the sea  
He's watching for me  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straigt to his arms I'd go sailing  
It's far beyond a star, it's near beyond the moon  
I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And never again i'll go sailing  
Some sailing

My days have grown so lonely  
For you I cry, for you dear only  
Why haven't you seen it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
  
I spend my days in longin'  
I'm wondering why it's me you're wronging  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
  
I can't believe it  
It's hard to conceive it  
That you'd throw away romance  
Are you pretending  
It looks like the ending  
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear  
  
My life a hell you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender  
Myself to you body and soul  
  
What lies before me  
A future that's stormy  
A winter that's gray and cold  
Unless there's magic the end will be tragic  
And therefor a tale that's so often told  
  
My life revolves about you  
What earthly good am I without you  
Oh I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul

There's something that rules our destiny  
Right from the first day of our birth  
although you may not care for me  
You have your mission on this earth  
You were born to love  
Sure as you live  
Born with everything heaven could give  
You have eyes and they express  
Love at a glance  
You have lips who's tenderness  
Speak of romance  
Like a dream of love, lovely to see  
You're the angel of my destiny  
And to think that you have found  
Your place on earth only to be  
Born to love and be loved by me

Love is funny or it's sad  
Or it's quit or it's mad  
It's a good thing or it's bad  
  
But beautiful  
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all  
Love is tearful or it's gay  
It's a problem or it's a play  
It's heartache either way  
  
But beautiful  
And I'm thinking if you were mine  
I'd never let you go  
And that would be  
But beautiful  
I know  
Love is beautiful  
I know

Oh listen, sister  
I love my mister man and I can't tell you why  
there ain't no reason why I should love that man  
It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan  
De chimbley's smokin'  
De roof is leakin' in  
But he don't seem to care  
He can be happy  
With jes' a sip of gin  
I even loves him when his kisses got gin  
  
Fish got to swim and birds got to fly  
I got to love man till I die  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
Tell me he's lazy  
Tell me he's slow  
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe, I know  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
When he goes away  
that's a rainy day  
And when he comes back dat day is fine  
The sun will shine  
He can come home as late as can be  
Home without him ain't no home to me  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

I say I'll move the mountains  
And I'll move the mountains  
If he wants them out of the way  
Crazy, he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love, I'd say  
  
I say I'll go through fire  
And I'll go through fire  
As he wants it, so it will be  
Crazy, he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love, you see  
  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
He moves me with a smile  
The difficult I'll do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
  
I say I'll care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy, he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love am I

Darn that dream  
I dream each night  
You say you love me and you hold me tight  
But when I awake you're out of sight  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit skies  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn that one track mind of mine  
It can't understand that you don't care  
Just to change the mood I'm in  
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream  
And bless it too  
Without that dream I never would have you  
But it haunts me and it won't come true  
  
Oh, darn that dream

Day in, day out  
That same old voodoo follows me about  
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you  
And baby I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out, day in  
I needn't tell you how my days begin  
When I awake I get up with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain, come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes  
An oceans roar, a thousand drums  
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt  
When there it is, day in, day out

Lonely grief is hounding me  
Like the lonely shadow hounding me  
It's always there just out of sight  
Like a fragling tree on a lightening night  
Lonely wind cries out my name  
  
Sad as haunted music in the rain  
It's born of grief and born of woe  
But I hear it call and I've got to go  
Where can I be headed for  
The blues call in my north  
To lick my heart once more  
Love lives in a lonely land  
Where there's no helping hand to understand  
Why does it bring this hate to me  
Why it don't matter why  
I only know misery has to be part of me  
Never hope to count on love  
To be a partner of that heaven above  
Never hope to understand  
Love is a barrel land  
A lonely land, a lonely land

Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams  
Of other one's dreams, is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word  
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But don't do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will

Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
I miss it, each night and day  
The longer I stay away  
Miss the moist covered vines  
The tall sugar pines  
Where mocking birds use to sing  
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi  
Are hurrying to spring  
The mardy grass memories  
Of creol tunes that fill the air  
I dream of Orleanders in June  
And soon I'm wishing that I was there  
Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
And there is something more  
I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans

Hush now, don't explain  
Just say you'll remain  
I'm glad your back, don't explain  
  
Quiet, don't explain  
What is there to gain  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you  
And what endures  
All my thoughts of you  
For I'm so completely yours  
  
Cry to hear folks chatter  
And I know you cheat  
Right or wrong, don't matter  
When you're with me, sweet  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my joy and pain  
My life's yours love  
Don't explain.

Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Just you forget about me  
Be happy my love  
  
Just say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day, the sensible way  
And we'll remain friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
Should be the rule  
Just give your heart and your love  
To whom ever you love  
Don't you be a fool  
  
Baby why stop and cling  
To some fading thing  
That used to be  
So if you can't forget  
Don't you worry 'bout me

Stars shining bright above you  
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"  
Birds singing in the sycamore tree  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Say nighty-night and kiss me  
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me  
While I'm alone and blue as can be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on, dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me  
  
Stars fading but I linger on, dear  
Still craving your kiss  
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear  
Just saying this  
  
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you  
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you  
But in your dreams whatever they be  
Dream a little dream of me

East of the sun and west of the moon  
We'll build a dream house of love, dear  
Near to the sun in the day, near to the moon at night  
We'll live in a lovely way dear  
  
Living our love at pale moonlight  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun and west of the moon  
  
Just you and I, forever and a day  
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way  
  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear  
East of the sun and west of the moon

Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There is nothing in life but you  
  
I never regret the years I'm giving  
They're easy to give when you're in love  
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you  
  
For you maybe I'm a fool  
But it's fun  
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand  
Darling, it's grand  
They just don't understand  
  
Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you

I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time  
In thinking such a thing could be  
That you could ever care for me  
  
I'm sure you hate to hear  
That I adore you, dear  
But grant me  
Just the same  
  
I'm not entirely to blame  
For love  
You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize  
All others above  
  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together  
That it does seem a shame  
That you can't see  
Your future with me  
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

When we want to love, we love  
When we want to kiss, we kiss  
With a little petting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
When we want to work. we work  
When we want to play, we play  
In a happy setting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
When we want to sing, we sing  
When we want to dance, we dance  
You can do your betting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life  
  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
But when we want to sing, we sing  
When we want to dance, we dance  
You can do your betting, we're getting  
Some fun out of life

Ghost of yesterday  
Stalking 'round my room  
All night long you stay  
Walk around profound gloom  
When the darkness falls  
When I've gone to bed  
Weirdly come your calls  
Mournfully, scornfully dead  
  
Folly of a love I strangled  
Pulsing heart I thought was gone  
Gives no peace  
Will not cease  
Prowling 'round till dawn  
Ghost of yesterday  
Every night you're here  
Whispering away  
"Might have been, might have been, oh, my dear"  
Foolish heart must pay  
Ghost of yesterday  
Yesterday

Look at yourself.  
If you had the sense of humor,  
You would laugh to beat the band.  
  
Look at yourself.  
Do you still believe in rumor  
that romance is simply grand?  
  
Since you took it right  
on the chin,  
you have lost that bright  
toothpaste grin.  
  
My mental state is all a jumble.  
I sit around and sadly mumble.  
  
Fools rush in, so here I am,  
very glad to be unhappy.  
  
Unrequited love's a bore,  
and I've got it pretty bad.  
But for someone you adore,  
it's a pleasure to be sad  
  
Like a straying baby lamb  
with no mammy and no pappy,  
I'm so unhappy,  
but oh, so glad.

Good morning heartache  
You old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
I turned and tossed until it seems you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now everyday I start by saying to you  
Good morning heartache what's new  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you nohow  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight to Sunday blues  
Good morning heartache  
Here we go again  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one  
Who knew me when  
Might as well get use to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache  
Sit down

I'm having myself a time  
I mean I'm having what I want  
Wanting what I have  
Doing what I like  
And liking what I do  
And I'm having myself a time  
  
I never could save a dime  
And so I'm living like a lord  
Acting like, a loon  
Lying in the sun  
And sighing in the moon  
And I'm having myself a lime  
  
When I hum songs  
They're all dumb songs  
Without reason nor rhyme  
But I'm certainly in my prime  
I friend I'm happy as a bird, flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And I'm having myself a time  
  
But I'm certainly in my prime  
I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above  
Walk a little love and get a little love  
And I'm having myself a time

'Cause he ain't got rhythm  
Every night he sits in the house alone  
He ain't got rhythm  
Every night he sits there and wears a frown  
He attracted some attention  
When he found the fourth dimension  
But he ain't got rhythm  
So no one's with him  
The loneliest man in town  
  
Oh, lonely man is he  
Bending over his books  
His wife and family  
Keep giving him dirty looks  
'Cause he ain't got rhythm  
When they call him up  
It's to call him down  
With that daring aviator  
He encircled the equator  
But he ain't got rhythm  
So no one's with him  
Loneliest man in town

I'll forget your tender kiss  
I'll be brave after this kiss  
I'll say "Hello my darling"  
It we should meet again  
  
You'll forbid the tears to slip  
You'll behave, bite your lip  
And say "Hello my darling"  
If we should meet again  
  
If we do meet again  
Our moments can't be sweet again  
Oh my love, go my love  
Though it's a bitter pill, I know my love  
  
Please remember not to sigh  
Over this last goodbye  
Just say "Hello my darling"  
If we should meet again

See the house lights start to blink  
And the sky is turnin' pink  
Gosh what will the neighbors think  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We could share a perfect day  
But we've danced the night away  
Guess you'd better hit the hay  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We saw the sunset in the sky  
Soon we'll see the dawn  
Mother Nature's about to rise  
And Father Time is marchin' on  
  
Did you hear my daddy yell?  
We've been leaning on the bell  
Kiss me quick and run like sixty  
Because here it is tomorrow again

Never had nothing  
No one to care  
That's why I seem to have  
More than my share  
I ve got a man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
When I hurt his feelings  
Once in a while  
His only answer is one little smile  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way  
  
I can see no other way  
And no better plan  
End it all and let him go  
To some better gal  
But I'm only human  
A coward at best  
I'm more than certain  
He'd follow me West  
  
Though he loves to work  
And slave for me everyday  
He'd be so much better off  
If I went away  
But why should I leave him  
He'd be unhappy without me I know  
I've got that man crazy for me  
He's funny that way

Irving berlin  
How can I tell you what is in my heart?  
How can I measure each and every part?  
How can I tell you how much I love you?  
How can I measure just how much I do?  
How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
And if I ever lost you  
How much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  

Yesterday you came my way,  
And when you smiled at me,  
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,  
That it was love at sight and  
I was right to love you as I do.  
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.  
  
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,  
I never knew what they could do.  
I can't believe that you're in love with me.  
  
You're telling ev'ry one I know  
I'm on your mind each place we go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me.  
  
I have always placed you far above me.  
I just can't imagine that you love me.  
And after all is said and done,  
To think that I'm the lucky one.  
I can't believe that you're in love with me.  
  
Skies are gray. I'm blue each day  
When you are not around.  
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found  
But when you're by my side I fill with pride  
For I'm so proud of you  
It all seems too good to me to all be true  
  
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,  
I never knew what they could do.  
I can't believe that you're in love with me.  
  
You're telling ev'ry one I know  
I'm on your mind each place we go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me.  
  
I have always placed you far above me.  
I just can't imagine that you love me.  
And after all is said and done,  
To think that I'm the lucky one.  
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Breeze, stop moanin' those weird melodies  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
Rain, your rhythm on my window pane  
Drives me insane because  
I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He don't help me, so help me  
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
I'm gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
My heart is so broken  
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy  
And if He don't help me, so help me  
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me  
  
I'm gonna end this misery  
My man has left me  
And I can't face the music  
Without singin' the blues  
  
I can't face the music

I've been around the world in a plane  
Settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But can't get started with you  
And at the golf course I'm under par  
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star  
I've got a house and a show place  
But can't get no place with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream, dream, day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
Baby but what good dose it do  
I've been consulted by Franklin D.  
Even Gabel had me to tea  
But now I'm broken hearted  
Can't get started with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream, dream, day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
But what good does it do  
I've been consulted by Franklin D.  
Even Basic had me to tea  
But now I'm broken hearted  
Can't get started with you

Once I was young  
Yesterday, perhaps  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
And now I know I was naive.  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
And I'll say it was grand.  
  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
  
Once I was old  
Twenty years or so  
Rather well preserved,  
The wrinkles didn't show.  
Once I was old,  
But not too old for fun.  
I used to hunt for little girls  
Up my imaginary gun.  
But now I ain't for only one!  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
And I'll say it was grand.  
  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.

Each night, just about sunset  
I watch you passing my door  
It's all I can do  
Not to run to you  
Cause I don't want to cry anymore  
  
Nighttime, when there is moonlight  
The same old moon I knew before  
It's all I can do  
Not to run to you  
Cause I don't want to cry anymore  
  
All that I know about happiness  
I found just being with you  
Then I would find myself losing my mind  
Over some careless thing you would do  
  
Oh, why can't I forget you  
I know so well what is in store  
A moment or two  
Up in the clouds with you  
Then back where I was before  
  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
All that I've known about happiness  
I found just being with you  
Then I would find myself losing my mind  
Over some careless thing you would do  
  
Oh, why can't I forget you  
I know so well what is in store  
A moment or two  
Up in the clouds with you  
Then back where I was before  
  
No I don't want to cry anymore

My story is much too sad to be told,  
But practically everything leaves me totally cold.  
The only exception I know is the case  
Where I'm out on a quiet spree  
Fighting vainly the old ennui  
And I suddenly turn and see  
Your fabulous face.  
  
I get no kick from champagne.  
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all,  
So tell me why should it be true  
That I get a kick out of you?  
  
Some get a kick from cocaine.  
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff  
That would bore me terrific'ly too,  
Yet I get a kick out of you.  
  
I get a kick everything I see  
You're standing there before me.  
I get a kick though it's clear to me  
You obviously don't adore me.  
  
I get no kick in a plane.  
Flying too high with some guy in the sky  
Is my idea of nothing to do,  
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to moan inside  
I gotta right to sit and cry  
Down around the river  
A certain man in this little town  
  
Keeps draggin' my poor heart around  
All I see for me is misery  
  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to moan inside  
I gotta right to sit and cry  
Down around the river  
A certain man in this little town  
  
Soon that deep blue sea  
Will be callin' me  
It must be love say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
  
I gotta right to moan and cry  
I gotta sit and sigh  
  
Down around the river  
Soon that deep blue sea  
Will be callin' me  
  
It must be love say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
  
There's nothing left for me  
I'm full of misery  
I gotta right to sing the blues

I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
The murmur of a morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music  
Mighty fine music  
The singing of a sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right near by  
That's my favorite melody  
You my angel, phoning me  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song

Don't want my mammy  
I don't need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It won't ever mend  
I ain't much carin'  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
I'm like an oven  
That's cryin' for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
It's just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
He's hot as Hades  
A lady's not safe in his arms  
When she's kissed  
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off  
And maybe I'm ruled off his list  
I'll never be missed  
  
I need that person much worse'n just bad  
I'm falf alive and it's drivin' me mad  
He's only human if he's to be had  
I must have that man  
Don't want my mammy  
I don't need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It won't ever mend  
I ain't much carin'  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
I'm like an oven  
That's cryin' for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
It's just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
He's hot as Hades  
A lady's not safe in his arms  
When she's kissed  
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off  
And maybe I'm ruled off his list  
I'll never be missed  
  
I need that person much worse'n just bad  
I'm half alive and it's drivin' me mad  
He's only human if he's to be had  
I must have that man

My love must be a kind of blind love,  
I can't see anyone but you  
And dear, I wonder if you find love,  
An optical illusion, too?  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright cause I only  
Have eyes for you.  
  
The moon may be high,  
But I can't see a thing in the sky,  
Cause I only have eyes for you.  
I don't know if we're in a garden,  
Or on a crowded avenue.  
You are here, so am I.  
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view,  
And I only have eyes for you.

I took a trip on a train  
And I thought about you  
I passed a shadowy lane  
And I thought about you  
  
Two or three cars parked under the stars  
A winding stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam, the same old dream  
  
And every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you  
When I pulled down the shade then I really felt blue  
I peeked through the crack, looked at the track  
The one going back to you  
And what did I do? I thought about you

Joys that come to others  
Seldom come to me  
But if I only were Aladdin  
How different things would be  
Every time I wish  
I wish I had you  
Every time I dream  
The dream is for two  
You're the part within my heart  
That beats all day  
Seems to say, "I love you"  
  
Everywhere I go  
You're all that I see  
Wonder if you know  
What you mean to me  
Wishes would be grand  
If only they came true  
For every time I wish  
I wish I had you

If I were you  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd give my heart a break  
Instead of trying to break my heart  
  
It I were you  
I'd do this too  
I'd string along with me  
Instead of keepin' me on a string  
  
I'd love me the whole day long  
You'd never catch me nappin'  
Wouldn't have a change of heart  
Not for fear  
That such a thing should happen  
  
It I were you  
Here's what I'd do  
I'd stick to me  
My whole life through  
It I were you

If you were mine  
I could be a ruler of kings  
And if you were mine  
I could do such wonderful things  
  
I'd say to a star  
Stop where you are  
Light up my lover's way  
And every star above you  
Would obey, say  
If you were mine  
  
I would live for your love alone  
To kneel at your shrine  
I would give up all that I own  
Yes even my heart  
Even my life  
  
I'd trade it all for you  
And think I was lucky too  
If you were mine

I'll get by, as long as I have you  
Though there'll be rain and darkness too  
I'll not complain, I'll live with you  
  
Poverty, may come to me, that's true  
But what care I  
I'll get by, as long as I have you  
  
I'll get by, as long as I have you  
Though there'll be rain and darkness too  
I'll not complain, I'll live with you  
  
Poverty may come to me, that's true  
But what care I  
I'll get by, as long as I have you

I'll never smile again  
Until I smile at you  
I'll never laugh again  
What good would it do  
For tears would fill my eyes  
My heart would realize  
That our romance is true  
I'll never love again  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll never thrill again  
  
To somebody new  
Within my heart  
I know I will never start  
To smile again  
Until I smile at you  
Within my heart  
I know I will never start  
To smile again  
Until I smile at you

Blow, ill wind, blow away  
Let me rest today  
You're blowin' me no good  
No good  
  
Go, ill wind, go away  
Skies are oh so gray  
Around my neighborhood  
And that's no good  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
You're only misleading  
The sunshine I'm needing  
Ain't that a shame  
It's so hard to keep up  
With troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere  
When love's to blame  
  
So, ill wind, blow away  
Let me rest today  
You're blowin' me no good  
No good  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
I'll wind

I'm a fool to want you  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true  
A love that's there for others too  
  
I'm a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss that Devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
But then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I had to say  
  
Take me back, I love you  
I need you  
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong  
But right or wrong I can't get along  
  
Without you

Let our friends say what they want to say  
If I'm wrong I'll be the one to pay  
No matter if it's true  
You'll find that I'm all for you  
  
Let the cards predict we'll drift apart  
And the stars forfeit of broken heart  
No matter it they do  
You'll find that I'm all for you  
  
I only know come what may  
You'll always find me by your side  
I may be a fool  
Time alone will decide  
  
Let them all say that it's just a game  
And I'm sure to lose  
But just the same no matter if I do  
You'll find that I'm all for you

I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
I'm wise to all those tricks  
You played on me  
  
I'm gonna turn my back on love  
Gonna snob the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin  
So the love bug can't get in  
  
Park my romance right along the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart  
'Please Don't Disturb'  
  
And if I never fall in love again  
That's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw the key  
  
And it I never tall in love again  
That's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key

A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
Pretending is all I do  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
  
I'm gay with the crowd  
I play with the crowd  
But oh, if they only knew  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
Must I go on carrin' on?  
  
My merry song is just pretend  
Loving you so, wanting you so  
Where will it end, how will it end?  
  
A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
But never forgetting you  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue

I'm pulling through and it's because of you!  
When I was stranded came your helping hand  
Lonely, hurt I had not known which way to turn  
'Til you said, "Try smiles, not tears, just laugh and learn"  
  
I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!  
You made me see how lovely life could be  
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost  
To find I'd gained, not lost!  
  
When I thought that hope was really gone  
You showed me I was wrong  
And you taught me how to carry on  
Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song!  
  
I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!  
I'd do the same for you if your turn came  
Hope it never will  
For I've been though the mill  
I won't get this debt  
I'm pulling trough

Ask the sky above  
And ask the earth below  
Why I'm so in love  
And why I love you so  
Couldn't tell you though I tried do  
Just why I'm yours  
When you went away  
You left a glowing spark  
Trying to be gay as  
Whistling in the dark  
I am only what you make me  
Come take me  
I'm yours  
  
How can I happy  
I would be to beg or borrow  
For sorrow  
With you  
Even though I knew  
Tomorrow  
You'd say we were through  
If we drift apart  
Then I'll be lost and alone  
Though you use my heart  
Just for a steppin' stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you  
I'm yours  
  
How can I happy  
I would be to beg or borrow  
For sorrow  
With you  
Even though I knew  
Tomorrow  
You'd say we were through  
If we drift apart  
Then I'll be lost and alone  
Though you use my heart  
Just for a steppin' stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you  
I'm yours

The weather is frightening.  
The thunder and lightning  
Seem to be having their way.  
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day.  
The turn in the weather  
Will keep us together  
So I can honestly say,  
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day  
And everything's okay.  
  
Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.  
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.  
  
Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,  
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.  
  
I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.  
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.  
  
Let the rain pitter patter  
But it really doesn't matter  
If the skies are gray.  
Long as I can be with you, it's a lovely day.

Why do I do, just as you say  
Why must I just, give you your way  
Why do I sigh, why don't I try, to forget  
  
It must have been, that something lovers call fate  
Kept me saying, "I have to wait"  
I saw them all, just couldn't fall, 'til we met  
  
It had to be you, it had to be you  
I wandered around, and finally found, the somebody who  
Could make me be true, and could make me be blue  
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you  
  
Some others I've seen, might never be mean  
Might never be cross, or try to be boss  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else, gave me a thrill,  
With all your faults, I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
It had to be you

Honestly I'm glad it's snowing  
It helps to keep our friends from knowing  
When they ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
It's funny how the blinding snow flakes  
Are right in time to hide my heartache  
Let them ask me why I'm sad  
It's easy to blame the weather  
  
When I think of the sun  
It scares me  
I wonder if I will pass  
And springtime, I hear  
Is early this year  
They'll see through me like glass  
  
I see no reason for this weather  
So let me be the first to make up  
If a reason must be had  
It's easy to blame the weather

Your sweet expression, the smile you gave me  
The way you looked when we met  
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget  
I hear you whisper, "I'll always love you"  
I know it's over and yet  
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have the lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me  
Fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have the lonely feeling  
Stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget  

It's like reaching for the moon  
It's like reaching for the sun  
It's like reaching for the stars  
Reaching for you  
  
You're so far above me  
How can I expect than an angel to love me  
Who is as divine as you are  
  
It's like flying without wings  
Playing fiddle without strings  
And a million other things  
No one can do  
Though my hopes are slender  
In my secret heart I pray you'll surrender soon  
No, it's like reaching for the moon

It's not for me to say you love me  
It's not for me to say you'll always care  
Oh, but here for the moment I can hold you fast  
And press your lips to mine  
And dream that love will last  
As far as I can see this is heaven  
And speaking just for me  
It's ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then, it's not for me to say  
  
And speaking just for me  
It's ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again  
But then, it's not for me to say

The same old story  
It's as old as the stars above  
The same old story  
Of a boy and a girl in love  
The scenes say more moonlight  
The times say more June light  
Romance's the thing  
Two hearts away deep in a dream  
  
The same old story  
It's been told much too much before  
The same old story  
But it's worth telling just once more  
It's all fun and laughter  
They lived ever after in ecstasy  
The same old story but it's new to me

It's too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Don't let's talk or even walk  
If you want to make love, okay  
  
It's too hot for words  
There's nothing like relaxation  
Can't ignore this temperature  
But if you want to make love, okay  
  
Let's find a cozy nook  
Beside a babbling brook  
Let's find a shady tree  
Let the love birds talk for you and me  
  
Cause it's much too hot for words  
Why bother with conversation  
Goodness knows my heart disclose  
All it dares to say  
All it cares to say  
It's too hot for words

I've got a date with a dream  
A dream divine  
I've got a date with a dream  
Who may be mine  
  
I've got to hurry and dress  
To meet him at seven  
When any old corner becomes a corner  
Of heaven, blue heaven  
  
I'm gonna dance with a dream  
We'll dance on air  
I'm gonna speak to a dream  
And tell him I care  
  
And when the evening is over  
I'll kiss him goodnight and then  
I'll have a date with a dream  
And meet him all over again

The snow is snowing  
The wind is blowing  
But I can weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
I can't remember  
A worse December  
Just watch those icicles form  
What do I care if icicles form  
I've got my love to keep me warm  
  
Off with my overcoat  
Off with my glove  
I need no overcoat  
I'm burnin' with love  
  
My heart's on fire  
The flame grows higher  
So I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
I've got my love to keep me warm

Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers  
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours  
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim  
  
Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire  
I never seem to set his love afire  
Gone are the years I've wasted on him  
Sometimes when I get feelin' low  
I say let's call it quits  
Then I hang on and let him go  
Breakin' my heart in bits  
  
Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me  
But even if he does you can believe me  
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim  
  
I'll go on lovin' my Jim

As Dorothy Parker once said to her boyfriend: "Fare thee well!"  
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced: "It was swell, Isabelle,
swell!  
"As Abelard said to Heloise: "Don't forget to drop a line to me, please."  
As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear: "Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear  
  
It was just one of those things,  
Just one of those crazy flings,  
One of those bells that now and then rings,  
Just one of those things.  
It was just one of those nights,  
Just one of those fabulous flights,  
A trip to moon on gossamer wings, just one of those things.  
  
If we'd thought a bit of the end of it when we started painting the town,  
We'd have been aware that our love affair was too hot not to cool down.  
So, goodbye, dear, and amen! Here's hoping we meet now and then.  
It was great fun, but it was just one of those things!

Lady sings the blues  
She's got them bad  
She feels so sad  
Wants the world to know  
Just what the blues is all about  
  
Lady sings the blues  
She tells her side  
nothing to hide  
Now the world will now  
Just what the blues is all about  
The blues ain't nothing but a pain in your heart  
when you get a bad start  
When you and your man have to part  
I ain't gonna just sit around and cry  
And now I won't die  
Because I love him  
  
Lady sings the blues  
she's got 'em bad  
She feels so sad  
The world will know  
She's never gonna sing them no more  
  
No more

You say either  
And I say either  
You say neither  
And I say neither  
Either, either, neither, neither

You like potatoes  
And I like potatoes  
You like tomatoes  
And I like tomatoes  
Potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
But oh, if we call the whole thing off  
Then we must part  
And oh, if we ever part  
Then that might break my heart  
  
So it you like pajarnas and I like pajamas  
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajamas  
For we know we need each other  
So we'd better call the calling off, off  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
So if you go for oysters  
And I go for oysters  
I'll order oysters and cancel the oysters  
For we know we need each other  
So we'd better call the calling off, off  
Let's call the whole thing off

Let's dream in the moonlight  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell the stars above me  
What's in you heart  
  
Let's dream in the moonlight  
Say you're glad you found me  
Put your arms around me  
Before we part

I can say I'm only lending  
When I give my heart to you  
  
Let's dream in the moonlight  
Let your lips touch mine  
Though we're only dreaming tonight  
Tonight

Talk to me baby  
Tell me what's the matter now  
Tell me, baby what's the matter now?  
Are you tryin' to quit me, baby  
But you don't know how  
  
I've been your slave  
Ever since I've been your babe

But my love is gone

Love is like a hydrant turns off and on  
Like some friendships when your money's gone  
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your heart's in tongs  
  
It I had some strong wings like an aeroplane  
Had some broad wings like an aeroplane  
I would fly away forever  
Hover to come again  
Oh love oh love oh loveless love  
Has said our hearts are goldiess gold  
From milkless milk and silkless silk  
We are growing used to soul-less souls  
  
Such grafting times we never saw  
That's why we have a pure full law  
In everything we find a flaw  
Even love oh love oh loveless love  
Just to fly away from loveless love

The sky was blue  
And high above  
The moon was new  
And so was love  
This eager heart of mine was singing  
Lover where can you be  
  
You came at last  
Love had its day  
That day is past  
You've gone away  
This aching heart of mine is singing  
Lover come back to me  
  
When I remember every little thing  
You used to do  
I'm so lonely  
Every road I walked along  
I walked along with you  
No wonder I am lonely  
  
The sky is blue  
The night is cold  
The moon is new  
But love is old  
And while I'm waiting here  
This heart of mine is singing  
Lover come back to me  
  
When I remember every little thing  
You used to do  
Honey I get oh so lonely  
Every road I walked along  
I walked along with you  
Ain't no wonder I am lonely  
  
The sky is blue  
The night is cold  
The moon is new  
But love is old  
And while I'm waiting here  
This heart of mine is singing  
  
Lover come back  
Lover come back  
Lover come back to me  
Lover come back  
  
Lover come back  
Lover come back to me  
Lover come on back  
Lover come on back  
  
Lover come on back to me  
Come on back to me girl  
Come on back girl  
Lover come back to me

Don't know why but I'm feeling so sad  
I long to try something I never had  
Never had no kissing  
Oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be  
  
The night is cold and I'm so alone  
I'd give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me  
But no one to love me  
Lover man, oh, where can you be  
  
I've heard it said  
That the thrill of romance  
Can be like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with a prayer  
That you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
  
Someday we'll meet  
And you'll dry all my tears  
Then whisper sweet  
Little things in my ear  
Hugging and a-kissing  
Oh, what I've been missing  
Lover man, oh, where can you be

Mandy is two  
You ought to see her eyes of cornflower blue  
They really look as it they actually knew  
That she's a big girl now  
  
Mandy is two  
You ought to see how many things she can do  
She knows her alphabet  
And ties her own shoes  
And no one showed her how  
  
If you could see her majesty  
With braids in her hair  
Almost as though her Sunday beau  
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear  
  
Mummy is blue  
Because her little girl is going on three  
But Miss Amanda she's as proud as can be  
Cause she's a big girl now

Lovable, hugable Emily Brown

The lovable little Miss Brown to you

Moanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so  
Though he's mean as can be  
He's the kind of man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by  
If I die where'll he be  
He's the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
  
Don't know any reason why  
He treats me so poorly  
What have I gone and done  
Makes me troubles double with his worries  
When surely I ain't deserving of none  
  
Moanin' low  
My sweet man is gonna go  
When he goes, oh Lordy  
He's the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me  
Moanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so  
Though he's mean as can be  
He's the kind of man needs the kind

What have I gone and done  
Makes me troubles double with his worries

My sweet man is gonna go  
When he goes, oh Lordy  
He's the kind of a man needs the kind  
Of a woman like me

It must have been moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
It must have been moonglow  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you saying  
"Dear one, hold me fast"  
And I start in praying  
Oh Lord, please let this last  
  
We seemed to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where  
And now when there's moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember that moonglow gave me you  
  
It must have been moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
It must have been moonglow  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you saying  
"Dear one, hold me fast"  
And I start in praying  
Oh Lord, please let this last  
  
We seemed to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where  
And now when there's moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember that moonglow brought me you

Pennies in a stream  
Falling leaves a sycamore  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
Gentle finger waves  
Ski trails down a mountain side  
Snow light in Vermont  
  
Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway  
As they travel each bend in the road  
And when people meet, in this romantic setting  
They're so hypnotized be the lovely  
  
Evening summer breeze  
Sweet warblings of the meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont

My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine,  
You make me smile with my heart.  
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable.  
Yet, you're my fav'rite work of art.  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
But don't change on hair for me, not if you care for me.  
Stay little Valentine, sty! Each day is Valentine's day.  
Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little wek?  
When you open it to speak, are you smart?  
But please, don't change on hair for me, not if you care for me.  
Stay little Valentine, stay! Each day is Valentine's day.

Can't you see  
What love and romance have done to me  
I'm not the same as I used to be  
This is my last affair  
  
Tragedy just seems to be the end of me  
My happiness is misery  
This is my last affair  
  
Right from the start  
You took my love  
Tore my heart apart  
Now there's nothing new to look forward to  
My dreams won't come true  
  
So I'll make a vow, make a vow  
No more to love's line will I bow  
I cross my heart and feel it now  
This is my last affair

It's cost me a lot  
But there's one thing that I've got  
It's my man  
Cold and wet, tired you bet  
But all that I soon forget  
With my man  
He's not much for looks  
And no hero out of books  
Is my man  
Two or three girls has he  
That he likes as well as me  
But I love him!  
I don't know why I should  
He isn't good, he isn't true  
He beats me too  
What can I do?  
  
Oh, my man I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despair  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright, all right  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away, When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day?  
For whatever my man is  
I am his forever more  
Oh, my man I love him  
  
Sometimes I say  
If I could just get away  
With my man  
He'd go straight sure as fate  
For it never is too late  
For a man  
I just like to dream  
Of a cottage by a stream  
With my man  
Where a few flowers grew  
And perhaps a kid or two  
Like my man  
And then my eyes get wet  
I most forget till he gets hot  
And tells me not to talk such rot  
  
Oh, my man I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despair  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright, all right  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away, When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day?  
For what ever my man is  
I am his forever more

My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But it's funny now and then  
How my thoughts go flashing back again  
To my old flame  
My old flame  
My new lovers all seem so tame  
For I haven't met a gent  
  
So innocent or elegant  
As my old flame  
  
I've met so many men  
With fascinating ways  
A fascinating gaze in their eyes  
Some who sent me up to the skies  
But their attempts at love  
Were only imitations of  
My old flame  
I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became  
Of my old flame  
  
I've met so many men

But their attempts at love

I can't even think of his name  
But I'll never be the same  
Until I discover what became

You don't act up too much  
Ain't got that glamour touch  
You're trifling lazy  
Ain't worth a cigarette ash  
Look out here mamma  
Look out here  
You carry me too fast  
You're just my good for nothin'  
My sweet hunk o' trash  
My, my how you sound  
You're very short on looks  
Dumb, when it comes to books  
Look out, baby  
Watch it, honey  
And you stay full of corn  
Just like a succotash  
What you want me to do in my idle moments  
  
You're just a good-for-nothin'  
But my sweet hunk o' trash  
Let me get a word in there honey, you running your mouth  
You said I've worried you for years  
I'm just a barfly moochin' beers  
While you sweat over a hot stove slinging hash  
Work my fingers right down to the elbows  
Yes I may be good-for-nothin'  
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash  
First to admit it baby  
You said I spread my love all around  
And with the chicks all over town  
But, how can I when you keep me broke  
So I can't spend no cash  
Yes I may be good-for-nothin'  
But I'm still your sweet hunk o' trash  
Listen hear Pops,  
You know you lie about your youth  
I don't lie baby  
I'm just careless with the truth, that's all  
How careless can you be  
Oh, no  
With all your chicks  
You try to make a flash  
Now baby  
It ain't like that, no  
But you're still my good-for-nothin'  
My sweet hunk o' trash  
Now when you stay out very late  
It sure makes me mad to wait how come, baby?  
'Cause, you come home too tired  
To raise just one eyelash  
Watch it baby  
Watch it  
You're just good-for-nothin'  
But you're my sweet hunk o' trash  
Yes indeed!

The man who only lives for making money  
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny  
Likewise the man who works for fame  
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name  
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment  
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant  
Fall in love you won't regret it  
That''s the best work of all if you can get it  
  
Holding hands at midnight  
'Neath the starry sky  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
Scrolling with the one girl  
Sighing after sigh  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if you try  
  
Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door  
Where two hearts become one  
Who could ask for more  
Loving one who loves you  
And taking that vow  
Nice work if you can get it  
And you can get it if  
Won't you tell me how?

Like the beat, beat, beat of the tomtom  
When the jungle shadows fall  
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock  
as it stands against the wall  
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops  
When the summer show'are is through  
So a voice within me keeps repeating  
You, you, you  
  
Night and day you are the one  
Only you beneath the moon and sun  
Whether near me or far  
It's no matter, darling, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
Day and night  
  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day under the hide of me  
There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
And its torment won't be trough  
'Till you spent my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
Night and day

No good man  
Lovin' all the no good things  
Never treats me as he should  
That ain't no good  
He's always bringing me down  
He's no saint  
Heaven knows that's what he ain't  
Spends his money foolishly  
Not on me  
I'm the one who gets the run-around  
  
I ought to hate him and yet I love him so  
For I require  
Love that's made of fire  
And in his arms  
I find  
I always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began  
There have been other fools like me  
Born to be  
In love with a no good man

You ain't gonna bother me no more  
No how  
Love just goes so far  
No more  
Woke up this morning and found  
I didn't care for you no more  
No how  
  
Never felt so good before  
You're down to my size  
It's over and done  
So honey, step down from your throne  
That look in your eyes  
Don't bother me none  
Can take or leave you alone  
From my window  
Sky's ain't gray no more  
Not now  
  
Here's the day  
That I've been waiting for  
Got only one heart  
One heart with no spares  
Must save it for loving  
Somebody who cares  
So you ain't gonna bother me  
No more, no more

No regrets altho' our love affair has gone astray  
No regrets I know I'll always care though you're away  
Somehow our happy romance ended suddenly  
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine  
  
No regrets because somebody new looks good to you  
No regrets sweetheart no matter what you say or do  
I know our love will linger when the other love forgets  
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine

Hey fat daddy make up your mind  
'Cause I've been waiting such a long, long time  
Now baby or never 'cause I been so good to you  
Now baby or never 'cause I've been so lonesome, too  
Now baby or never if I mean anything to you  
Now baby or never 'cause you wasted so much time  
Now baby or never 'cause you can't make up your mind  
Now baby or never and it ain't no fault of mine  
It's got to be yes or no  
It's either you stay or go  
You can't leave me on the shelf  
You gotta commit yourself  
It's either you will baby or won't fall  
In love with me  
  
Gonna call you once more on the telephone  
I'll give you till twelve then I'll be gone  
  
I waited last night for you to call  
You give me no consideration at all  
It's now baby or never 'cause you wasted so much time  
Now baby or never and you must make up your mind  
Now baby or never and it ain't no fault of mine  
It's got to be yes or no  
It's either you stay or go  
You can't leave me on the shelf  
You gotta commit yourself  
It's either you will baby or won't  
You do baby or don't  
Either you will baby or won't fall in love with me

Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But now I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
If I'd never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Going to set my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worry on the doorstep  
Just direct your feet  
To the sunny side of the street  
Can't you hear a pitter-pat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
I used to walk in the shade  
With those blues on parade  
But now I'm not afraid  
This rover crossed over  
If I'd never have a cent  
I'd be rich as Rockefeller  
Going to set my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  

It's quarter to three  
There's no one in the place, except you and me  
So set 'em' up Joe, I've got a little story, you oughta know  
We're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
  
I got the routine  
So drop another nickel in the machine  
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you've gotta be true to your code  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
  
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of a poet  
And I've got a lot of things to say  
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to mean  
Until it's talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes  
And Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close  
So thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind, my bending your ear  
This torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode  
  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road

That long, long road

One two button your shoe  
Put on your coat and hat  
I'll play a game like that  
While I'm waiting for you  
Three four open the door  
Hurry for heaven's sake  
I count every step you take  
While I'm waiting for you  
Five six my eyes are fixed  
On that picture of your charm  
Seven eight you're at the gate  
And you walk into my arms  
Nine ten kiss me again  
Tell me you get a thrill  
Just as I hope you will  
While I'm waiting for you

Our love is different dear  
It's like a mighty symphony  
I can feel its silver harmony  
Oh so tenderly, day by day  
  
Our love is different dear  
To me it's almost heavenly  
Let us guard it ever preciously  
Even jealously  
While we may  
A love like ours dear heart  
The angels send  
And as I know dear heart  
That it won't ever end  
For as the years roll by  
You'll learn my love for you is true  
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you  
For our love is different dear  
  
A love like ours dear heart  
The angels send  
And as I know dear heart  
That is won't ever end  
For as the years roll by  
You'll learn my love for you is true  
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you  
For our love is different dear

The more I read the papers  
The less I comprehend  
The world with all its capers  
And how it all will end.  
Nothing seems to be lasting.  
But that isn't our affair,  
We've got something permanent,  
I mean in the way we care.  
  
It's very clear  
Our love is here to stay,  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day.  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies,  
And in time may go.  
But, oh my dear,  
Our love is here to stay,  
Together we're going a long, long way.  
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble,  
They're only made of clay,  
But our love is here to stay.

Please don't talk about me when I'm gone  
Though our friendship ceases from now on  
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice  
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice  
We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do  
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
Just don't you talk about me when I'm gone  
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone  
Though our friendship ceases from now on  
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice  
Just don't talk at all, that's my advice  
We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do  
But here's a kiss and I hope that this brings lots of luck to you  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
Just don't talk, please don't talk  
Don't you talk about me when I'm gone  

One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret  
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget  
One little heartache left as a token  
One little plaything carelessly broken  
  
Remember the night  
The night you said, "I love you"  
Remember?  
  
Remember you vowed  
By all the stars above you  
Remember?  
  
Remember we found a lonely spot  
And after I learned to care a lot  
  
You promised that you'd forget me not  
But you forgot  
To remember
