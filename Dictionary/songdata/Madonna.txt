[Chorus]  
Ain't no big deal to say I love you still  
Call out my name  
I'll be here  
Ain't no big deal to say my love is real  
When you reach out I'll be there  
  
[Bridge]  
Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye  
Sad time is gone I got no tears to cry  
Don't say you don't know I'm right  
When I say we'll get by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Intermediate]  
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do  
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you  
Ask me what is on my mind  
So I can tell you true  
  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Ain't no big deal  
I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Baby I love you still  
[Ain't no big deal  
My love is for real]  
Ain't no big deal  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Ain't no big thing  
Uh uh uh uh  
I said (first time only)  
Ain't no big deal  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Ain't no big thing  
Uh uh uh uh  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Intermediate]  
  
[Reach out  
Reach out]  
I'll be there  
Yeah  
Oh yeah

A long long time ago  
I can still remember  
How that music used to make me smile  
And I knew that if I had one chance  
I could make those people dance  
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile  
  
Did you write the book of love  
And do you have faith in God above  
If the bible tells you so  
Now do you believe in rock n roll  
And can music save your mortal soul  
And can it teach me how to dance real slow  
Well I know that your in love with him  
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym  
You both kicked off your shoes  
And I did Gods rhythm and blues  
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck  
With a great carnation and a pick up truck  
But I knew that I was out of luck  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
I met a girl who sang the blues  
And I asked her for some happy news  
But she just smiled and turned away  
Well I went down to the sachet store  
Where I heard the music years before  
But the man there said the music wouldn't play  
Well now in the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
But not a word was spoken  
The church bells all broken  
And the three men I admire the most,  
The father, son, and the holy ghost  
They caught the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
I started singing  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
Bye bye Miss American Pie  
Drove my Chevy to the levy  
But the levy was dry  
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  
Singing  
This will be the day that I die  
This will be the day that I die  
  
We started singing  
We started singing  
We started singing  
We started singing

(che:)  
And the money kept rolling in from every side  
Eva's pretty hands reached out and they reached wide  
Now you may feel it should have been a voluntary cause  
But that's not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling in, you don't ask how  
Think of all the people guaranteed a good time now  
Eva's called the hungry to her, open up the doors  
Never been a fund like the foundation eva peron  
  
Chorus:  
  
(workers:)  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
Rollin' rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin'  
  
Rollin' on in, rollin' on in  
Rollin' on in, rollin' on in  
On in  
  
(che:)  
Would you like to try a college education?  
Own your landlord's house, take the family on vacation?  
Eva and her blessed fund can make your dreams come true  
Here's all you have to do my friends  
Write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket  
Throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it  
She will change your way of life for a week or even two  
Name me anyone who cares as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out  
  
(che:)  
And the money kept rolling out in all directions  
To the poor, to the weak, to the destitute of all complexions  
Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray  
But that's not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books  
You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out  
  
(che:)  
Eva!!!  
When the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books  
You can tell you've done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down, figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
Rollin' on out, rollin' on out  
On out

I should've known  
When we met at the late show  
You and me, dangerous  
Sittin' way too close  
2am, at my door  
Where you dropped me off  
Tell me how in the hell  
Did I end up with my hand on the barrell  
  
It's time that you paid  
I want you to clean up the mess that you made  
  
Like a bitch out of order  
Like a bat out of hell  
Like a fish out of water  
I'm scared, can't you tell  
  
Bang Bang  
Put my gun down on the table  
Before you try to blow my mind  
I used to think it was you  
Who was so unstable  
But now I'm sure I'm close behind  
  
B-B-Bang  
B-B-Bang Bang Boom  
  
I thought you were good  
You painted me bad  
Compared to the others  
The best thing I had  
But then I discovered  
It couldn't get worse  
You're buildin' my coffin  
You're drivin' the hearse  
I thought it was you  
I loved you the most  
But I was just keepin'  
My enemies close  
I made a decision to never look back  
So how did you end up with all of my jack  
  
Woh-oh-oh  
Bang Bang  
  
I should've known  
You were too good to be true  
You were hidin' both your horns  
And I was such a fool  
It's not a race  
Wasn't trying to beat you  
Trip me up, shut me down  
When I was with you  
  
Like a bitch out of order  
Like a bat out of hell  
Like a fish out of water  
I'm scared, can't you tell  
  
Bang Bang  
Put my gun down on the table  
Before you try to blow my mind  
I used to think it was you  
Who was so unstable  
But now I'm sure I'm close behind  
  
B-B-Bang  
B-B-Bang Bang Boom  
  
I thought you were good  
You painted me bad  
Compared to the others  
The best thing I had  
But then I discovered  
It couldn't get worse  
You're buildin' my coffin  
You're drivin' the hearse  
I thought it was you  
I loved you the most  
But I was just keepin'  
My enemies close  
I made a decision I had to employ  
So how did you end up with all of my toys  
  
I'm not your brother, not your lover  
And I'm not your friend  
Now that it's over you're another  
Kind of different  
A new person  
Your time is up  
And that's my blood in your dixie cup  
  
Read more:

Too much of a good thing  
Has really burnt me out  
I'm sick of satisfaction  
And living in a drought  
  
Just be yourself  
Anyway that you want to

Anyway that you can

Anyway that you want to, baby

[Verse 1]  
Just take me with all my stupid flaws  
Changing means like shooting in the dark  
Patience, please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to be  
Me, me, I want it just as bad  
Forgive me, wish I could change the past  
Take it, cause, I'll never be as perfect as you want  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I think you're confusing me with somebody else  
I won't apologize for being myself  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Verse 2]  
don't judge me, just gotta let me be  
Accept me, although I'm incomplete  
My imperfections make me unique, that's my belief  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Bridge]  
Never say never, anything is possible  
Always been a rebel, overcoming obstacles  
I can't give you perfect, but I can give you forever  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me with all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
I come to you with all my flaws  
With all my beautiful scars  
With all my beautiful scars  
Love me with all of my flaws  
My beautiful scars  
  
[Outro]  
With all of my beautiful scars  
I love you the way that you are  
  
(You got to love me, you got love me...)  
(You got to love me, you got love me...)

Today is the last day that I'm using words  
They've gone out, lost their meaning  
Don't function anymore  
  
Let's, let's, let's get unconscious honey  
Let's get unconscious honey  
  
Today is the last day that I'm using words  
They've gone out, lost their meaning  
Don't function anymore  
  
Traveling, leaving logic and reason  
Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness  
Traveling, leaving logic and reason  
Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's get unconscious honey  
Let's get unconscious  
Let's get unconscious honey  
Let's get unconscious  
  
Words are useless, especically sentences  
They don't stand for anything  
How could they explain how I feel  
  
Traveling, traveling, I'm traveling  
Traveling, traveling, leaving logic and reason  
Traveling, traveling, I'm gonna relax  
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And inside we're all still wet  
Longing and yearning  
How can I explain how I feel?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Traveling, traveling (repeat twice)  
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness  
  
And all that you've ever learned  
Try to forget  
I'll never explain again

I miss your brain  
The way you think  
But I don't miss  
The way you used to drink  
  
I miss our talks  
The Universal Law  
You had a way  
Of seeing through my thoughts  
  
It's so confusing I thought I met my match  
An intellectual would telling for a catch  
You always said we be better off as friends  
It was inevitable that it would end  
  
Your picture's off my wall  
But I'm still waiting for your call  
And every man that walks through that door  
Will be compared to you forever more  
  
Still I have no regret  
'Cause I survived the biggest test  
I cannot lie and I won't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
I miss the country side where we used to lay  
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day  
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit  
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it  
  
You wrote me poetry  
You had a way with words  
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl  
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much  
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch  
  
Your picture's off my wall  
But I'm still waiting for your call  
And every man that walks through that door  
Will be compared to you forever more  
  
Still I have no regrets  
'Cause I survived the biggest test  
I cannot lie and I won't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
Yet I have no regrets  
'Cause I survived all biggest tests  
I cannot lie and I won't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
It's so sad that had to end  
I lost my very best friend (lost my very best friend)  
Not gonna candy coat it  
And I don't want to pretend  
  
I put away your letter  
Saved the best ones that I have  
It wasn't always perfect  
But it wasn't always bad  
  
Still I have no regrets  
'Cause I survived the biggest test  
I cannot lie and I won't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
Yet I have no regrets  
'Cause I survived the biggest test  
I will not lie and I can't pretend  
But I feel like I lost my very best friend  
  
It's so sad that it had to end

Madonna "Best Night" lyrics  
  
You can call me M tonight  
You can be my man tonight  
It's gonna be like this, that's right  
Give you love that you'll never forget  
  
The city is our playground tonight  
We're gonna be like gangsters tonight  
We don't give a damn if it's wrong or right  
Lighten up, we won't have no regrets  
  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Lose your self-control, we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
We don't have to speak that much  
I hear you when I feel your touch  
Whisper in my ears, make me blush  
Feel the chill as we kiss, don't forget  
  
All you had as dreams, don't hold back  
All the fantasies you ever had  
Just do what you like, go ahead  
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets  
  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
Lose your self-control, we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
Surrender to the pleasure (wanting)  
When we breath in together (waiting)  
It's either now or never (for you)  
This feeling will take over  
  
No sex tapes, no camera (wanting)  
Just you and me together (waiting)  
Repeat it like a mantra (for you)  
I'm in love, I'm in love  
  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
  
Lose your self-control, we can go wild  
Show you what it means to feel alive  
I'll make this the best night of your life  
I'll make this the best night of your life

With all these corks we might need to have the base looked at  
So pop the hood and see what's good I need to a toolin' man  
My precious love I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown  
I heard a thumpin' on the lot  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can polish the headlights  
You can smooth out the fender  
You can start the ignition  
We can go on a bender  
  
Stuck to the seat our body heat, what will you do with those ice  
This should ... get outta here, was steppin' on the gas  
We gotta bounce, we're gone past, let's let the seat go back  
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
I'll work on the engine  
Like we blew a gasket  
Tighten up the suspension  
And you don't have to ask it  
  
I hear you work in a body shop  
I hear you work in a body shop  
  
I would drive to the ends of the Earth for you  
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do  
I would ride through the dark of the night with you  
Cross my heart and hope to die it's true  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can keep it overnight  
You can do whatever you like  
Working overtime  
Working on the line  
  
You can polish the headlights  
You can smooth out the fender  
You can start the ignition  
We can go on a bender  
  
I hear you work in a body shop

Something in the way you love me won't' let me be  
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free  
Stop playing with my heart  
Finish what you start  
When you make my love come down  
If you want me, let me know  
Baby, let it show  
Honey, don't you fool around  
  
Just try to understand (understand)  
I've given all I can  
'Cause you got the best of me  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
  
Keep on pushing me, baby  
Don't you know you drive me crazy  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Something in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me  
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see  
But then you let me down, when I look around  
Baby, you just can't be found  
Stop driving me away, I just want to stay  
There's something I just got to say  
  
Just try to understand (understand)  
I've given all I can  
'Cause you got the best of me  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Borderline,  
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
  
Keep on pushing me baby  
Don't you know you drive me crazy  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Look what your love has done to me  
Come on baby, set me free  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
(Borderline)  
You cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane  
What does it take to make you see?  
You just keep on pushing my love  
Over the borderline  
  
Keep pushing me baby  
Keep pushing me baby  
Keep pushing my love  
  
Come on baby  
Come on darling, yeah

(Eva:)  
What's new Buenos Aires?  
I'm new, I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you  
You'll be on me too  
  
I get out here, Buenos Aires  
Stand back, you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me  
Just a little touch of star quality  
  
Fill me up with your heat, with your noise  
With your dirt, overdo me  
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud  
Let it hurt, run it through me.  
Don't hold back, you are certain to impress  
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying  
  
Hello, Buenos Aires  
Get this, just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go  
We'll put on a show  
  
Take me in at your flood, give me speed  
Give me lights, set me humming  
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up  
With your nights, watch me coming  
All I want is a whole lot of excess  
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing  
  
Stand back, Buenos Aires  
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me  
Just a little touch of star quality  
  
And if ever I go too far  
It's because of the things you are  
Beautiful town, I love you  
And if I need a moment's rest  
Give your lover the very best  
Real eiderdown and silence.  
  
(musical interlude)  
You're a tramp, you're a treat  
You will shine to the death, you are shoddy  
But you're flesh, you are meat  
You shall have every breath in my body  
Put me down for a lifetime of success  
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying  
  
Rio de la Plata  
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio  
All I want to know  
  
Stand back, Buenos Aires  
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me  
Just a little touch of  
Just a little touch of  
Just a little touch of star quality

(Eva:)  
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love after all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen, I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun  
  
So I chose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it to  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune, and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired  
  
They are illusions  
They are not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have I said too much?  
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.  
But all you have to do is look at me to know  
That every word is true

You've got style  
That's what all the girls say  
Satin sheets  
And luxuries so fine  
All your suits are custom made in London  
I've got something that you'll really like  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Feel the silky touch of my caresses  
They will keep you looking so brand new  
Let me cover you with velvet kisses  
I'll create a look that's made for you  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
In my love  
All over your body  
All over your body  
In my love  
All over, all over  
From your head down to your toes  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over your body  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
In my love  
All over your body  
All over your body  
In my love  
All over, all over  
From your head down to your toes  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Dress you up in my love  
In my love  
All over your body  
  
Gonna dress you up in my love  
All over, all over  
Dress you up in my love  
In my love  
All over your body

Each time you break my heart  
Each time you break my heart  
  
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town  
I'm not gonna let you go and run around  
I need to know that you'll be true to me  
'Cause that's the way it's got to be  
  
Why can't you give your promise to me  
Is love so blind that you cannot see  
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door  
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more  
  
Chorus:  
  
Each time you break my heart  
I try to put my pride aside  
Each time you break my heart  
A little voice inside me cries  
  
No matter what you do or say  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway  
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind  
How come you can't just walk away  
  
In the beginning we were nothing but glad  
Those were the best days that we ever had  
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone  
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Intermediate:  
  
I see the look in your eyes  
I know you're hurting inside  
Let me try  
To make you love me again  
I'll say that I knew you when  
You were mine  
You were mine  
  
Each time, oh, yeah  
  
In the beginning we were nothing but glad  
Those were the best days that we ever had  
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone  
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on  
  
(intermediate)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Each time you break my heart again  
Well I can say I knew you when [each time]  
You were mine  
  
Break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
(repeat and fade)

You give me  
You give me fever  
  
Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say  
No one can love you the way I do  
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way  
  
[Chorus:]  
You give me fever, when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
My eyes light up when you call my name  
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right  
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away  
Take these arms I'll never use  
And just believe in what my lips have to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you should know  
Fever isn't such a new scene  
Fever started long ago  
  
You give me fever, fever  
You give me, you give me fever  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said Julie baby, you're my flame  
He gave her fever  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
My eyes light up when you call my name  
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Fever, with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you should know  
Fever isn't such a new scene  
Fever started long ago  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, daddy oh don't you dare  
He gives me fever  
With his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his Misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right  
  
Fever, when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever, 'til you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn (repeat twice)

Just one kiss on my lips  
Was all it took to seal the future  
Just one look from your eyes  
Was like a certain kind of torture  
  
Once upon a time  
There was a boy and there was a girl  
Just one touch from your hands  
Was all it took to make me falter  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one smile on your face  
Was all it took to change my fortune  
Just one word from your mouth  
Was all I needed to be certain  
  
Once upon a time  
There was a boy, there was a girl  
Hearts that intertwine  
They lived in a different kind of world  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one kiss, just one touch, just one look  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
Forbidden love, we save our destiny forever  
Forbidden love, forbidden love  
  
Just one kiss, just one touch, just one look, just one love  
  
One

Like a bitch out of order  
Like a bat out of hell  
Like a fish out of water  
I'm scared, can't you tell  
  
Bang Bang  
Bang Bang  
  
I thought you were good  
But you painted me bad  
Compared to the others  
you're the best thing I had  
  
Bang Bang, shot you dead  
Bang Bang, shot you dead  
  
I thought it was you  
And I loved you the most  
But I was just keeping  
My enemies close  
  
I made a decision, I would never look back  
So how did you end up with all my jack?  
  
Bang Bang, shot you dead  
Bang Bang, shot you dead (in the head)  
  
Bitch out of order  
Bat out of hell  
Fish out of water  
I'm scared, can't you tell  
  
Bang Bang, shot you dead  
Bang Bang, shot you dead

So how did you end up with all my jack?

Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head  
Bang Bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets  
Bang Bang, shot you dead in the head  
Bang Bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head  
  
And then I discovered  
It couldn't get worse  
You were building my coffin  
You were driving my hearse  
  
Bang Bang, shot you dead  
Bang Bang, in the head  
  
I thought it was you  
And I loved you the most  
But I was just keeping  
My enemies close  
I made a decision, I would never look back  
So how did you end up with all of my jack?  
  
Bang Bang, shot you dead, in the head

He deserved it  
  
And I'm going straight to hell  
And I've got a lot of friends there  
And if I see that bitch in hell  
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again  
Cause I wanna see him die  
Over and Over and Over and Over and Over and Over and Over and Over

That's right drive bitch  
  
Now if you're gonna act like a bitch  
Then you're gonna die like a bitch

Get out of bed  
And you look in the mirror  
As my hate in your head  
Doesn't get any clearer  
The boss just said  
You're gonna lose your job  
You're gonna lose your thing  
If you're late  
Later the weatherman said  
It's gonna be sunny  
And it starts to rain  
And you don't think it's funny  
So you visit your friends  
But there's no one home  
And you don't have a dime  
And you can't even call them on the phone  
So get up  
Get up [repeat 6 times]  
  
Your stomach so empty  
And you need some food  
So you just suck yourself  
But it just doesn't do any good  
You think about going home  
So you can be a mistake  
Does there never change nothing above  
About the sinners view  
And the wasting of time  
And wanna grap your hair  
And pull you in line  
So get up  
Get up [repeat 6 times]

[Verse 1]  
Maybe it was all too much  
Too much for a man to take  
Everything's bound to break  
Sooner or later, sooner or later  
You're all that I can trust  
Facing the darkest days  
Everyone ran away  
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ahh, ahh  
I know you're scared tonight  
Ahh, ahh  
I'll never leave your side  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell me how we got this far  
Every man for himself  
Everything's gone to hell  
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on  
This world has turned to dust  
All we've got left is love  
Might as well start with us  
Singing a new song, something to build on  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ahh, ahh  
I know you're scared tonight  
Ahh, ahh  
I'll never leave your side  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Bridge]  
I know we're all right, cause we'll never be alone  
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world  
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold  
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Outro]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee  
And I detest all my sins  
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell  
But most of all because I love Thee,  
And I want so badly to be good  
  
It's so hypnotic  
The way he pulls on me  
It's like the force of gravity  
Right up under my feet  
It's so erotic  
This feeling can't be beat  
It's coursing through my whole body  
Feel the heat  
  
I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re  
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re  
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re  
Here it comes  
When I hear them eight o eight drums  
It's got me singing  
  
Hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin' gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
A girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
I'm like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
The room is spinning  
It must be the tanqueray  
I'm about to go astray  
My inhibition's gone away  
I feel like sinning  
You got me in the zone  
DJ play my favorite song  
Turn me on  
  
I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re  
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re  
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re  
Here it comes  
When I hear them 808 drums  
It's got me singing  
  
Hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin' gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
I know, I know, I know  
I shouldn't act this way  
I know, I know, I know  
Good girls don't misbehave  
Misbehave  
But i'm a bad girl, anyway  
Forgive me  
  
Hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey  
Like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
Get fired up like smokin' gun  
On the floor til the daylight comes  
Girls they just wanna have some fun  
  
A girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild  
I'm like a girl gone wild  
A good girl gone wild

Needing, needing  
All at once comes the silence  
Begging, pleading  
No more emotional violence  
The withdrawal into pain  
The result to never need again  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
Bleeding, bleeding  
Then comes the recognition  
Anger seething  
I don't need your permission  
And I don't know who you are  
And this thing has gone too far  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
You're in too deep  
You cannot keep  
The promises you made  
Our happiness was free  
The end of love  
The end of the dream  
Gone, gone, gone  
And I don't know who you are  
And this thing has gone too far  
Is this love?  
I think not  
I want out  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
It's so sad  
(This love affair)  
What we had  
Gone, gone, gone  
(This love affair)  
Gone, gone, gone  
This love affair is over  
Gone, gone, gone

(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Huevo  
She is in every magazine  
Been photographed, seen, she is known  
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed  
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring  
But she won't always answer the phone  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But we have pretended enough  
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves  
  
(Che:)  
Which means...  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Che and Eva:)  
There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female  
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Emilio  
You've completed your task  
What more can we ask of you now?  
Please sign the book on the way out the door  
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call  
But I don't think that's likely somehow  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
But when we were hot, we were hot  
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared  
Which means ...  
  
[Chorus] (substituting "blame her" for "blame  
Them", sung only by Che)  
  
(Eva:)  
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz  
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower  
It's the mother and father of luxury lather  
The talk of the bath, the great ointment  
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
You're scented, you'll be sent  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon  
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio  
We'll think of you every time she's on the air  
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way  
So do up your trousers and go  
  
(Eva:)  
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
The decline into silence and doubt  
Our passion was just too intense to survive  
  
(Che:)  
Which means ...  
  
(Lovers:)  
This is a club I should never have joined  
Someone has made us look fools  
Argentine men call the sexual shots  
Someone has altered the rules  
  
(Eva:)  
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes  
Is all very well but every girl knows  
  
(Che:)  
She needs a man she can monopolize  
With fingers in dozens of different pies  
  
(Lovers:)

Cut me down the middle  
Fucked me up a little  
You said I was your queen  
I tried to give you everything  
And now you want your freedom  
  
You got just what you came for  
A bit of fame and fortune  
And I'm no longer needed  
  
You said it was over, wanted it to end  
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends  
  
You had a few secrets  
I was never told  
Now everyone's talking  
And I'm the last to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city  
Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty  
Your clever game got the best of me  
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me  
Cause I'm in heartbreak city  
  
Tore me into pieces  
Didn't have no damn reason  
I let you in my house  
You helped yourself to everything  
And left me with your mess  
  
I curse the day we met  
The memory is haunting me  
I wish I could forget  
  
You said it was over, wanted it to end  
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends  
  
You had a few secrets  
I was never told  
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm in the middle of hearbreak city  
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty  
I'm in the middle of hearbreak city  
Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty  
Your clever game the best of me  
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me  
Cause I'm in heartbreak city  
  
[Outro]  
And it's not that pretty  
And I still feel shitty

Hello and goodbye  
I just unemployed you  
You can go back to school  
You've had a good run  
I'm sure he enjoyed you  
Don't act sad or surprised  
Let's be friends, civilized  
  
Come on little one  
Don't sit there like a dummy  
The day you knew would arrive  
Is here, you'll survive  
So move, funny face  
  
I like your conversation  
You've a catchy turn of phrase  
You're obviously going through  
Some adolescent phase  
  
So what happens now  
So what happens now  
Where am I going to  
  
You'll get by  
You always have before  
  
Where am I going to  
  
Don't ask anymore

High flying, adored  
So young, the instant queen  
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents  
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint  
You were just a backstreet girl  
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting  
  
High flying, adored  
Did you believe in your wildest moments  
All this would be yours  
That you'd become the lady of them all?  
  
Were there stars in your eyes  
When you crawled in at night  
From the bars, from the sidewalks  
From the gutter theatrical  
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall  
  
High flying, adored  
What happens now, where do you go from here?  
For someone on top of the world  
The view is not exactly clear  
A shame you did it all at twenty-six  
There are no mysteries now  
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you  
  
High flying, adored  
I hope you come to terms with boredom  
So famous so easily, so soon  
It's not the wisest thing to be  
  
You won't care if they love you  
It's been done before  
You'll despair if they hate you  
You'll be drained of all energy  
All the young who've made it would agree  
  
High flying, adored  
That's good to hear but unimportant  
My story's quite usual  
Local girl makes good, weds famous man  
I was stuck in the right place at the perfect time  
Filled a gap, I was lucky  
But one thing I'll say for me  
No one else can fill it like I can

Holiday, celebrate  
Holiday, celebrate  
  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
Everybody spread the word  
We're gonna have a celebration  
All across the world  
In every nation  
It's time for the good times  
Forget about the bad times  
One day to come together  
To release the pressure  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
  
You can turn this world around  
And bring back all of those happy days  
Put your trouble down  
It's time to celebrate  
Let love shine  
And we will find  
A way to come together  
And make things better  
We need a holiday  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice  
  
Holiday, celebrate  
Holiday, celebrate  
  
If we took a holiday  
Took some time to celebrate  
Just one day out of life  
It would be  
It would be so nice

I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I'm so ashamed  
You're in so much pain  
I blamed you when things didn't go my way  
If I didn't, you'd be here  
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear  
If I took another path  
Things would be so different, but they're not  
  
I could have just kept  
my big mouth closed  
I could have just done  
what I was told  
Maybe I should turned silver into gold  
But in front of you I was cold  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not afraid to say  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I thought we had it all  
You brought out the best in me  
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream  
I though we were indestructible  
I never imagine we could fall  
You wanna know how to make a laugh  
Telling your plans  
  
We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,  
End it up with walls, It would be so cool,  
Could've gone by the s in the country sides,  
With a back of great things, kissing eye to eye  
  
We could've do the world in a private jet  
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet  
We could've find a mountain in a perfect sun set,  
Writing out names across the sky  
We could've got a building built in the echo run  
We could've got a sales in west and sold out mount  
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die  
Instead I made you cry  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
Je suis d'sol'e  
I wish I could take you back, but I can't  
  
I fucked up  
I made a mistake  
Nobody does it better than myself  
  
I'm sorry  
I'm not ashamed to say  
I wish I could have you back maybe one day

(Madonna:)  
Pride's that splendid liar  
Sworn enemy of love  
  
(Jennifer:)  
Kept my lips from saying  
Things my heart was thinking of  
  
(Madonna:)  
But now my pride you've humbled  
I've cast it to the winds  
  
(Jennifer:)  
Broken, beaten, sick at heart  
  
(Both:)  
Our compassion begins  
  
(Madonna:)  
We played the game of 'stay away'  
But it costs more than I can pay  
Without you I can't make my way  
I surrender dear  
  
(Jennifer:)  
I may seem proud, I may act gay  
It's just a pose, I'm not that way  
'Cause deep down in my heart I say  
I surrender dear  
  
(Madonna:)  
Little mean things we were doing  
Must have been part of the game  
Lending a spice to the wooing  
  
(Both:)  
But I don't care who's to blame  
  
(Madonna:)  
When stars appear  
(Jennifer:)  
When stars appear  
(Madonna:)  
And shadows fall  
(Jennifer:)  
And shadows fall  
(Madonna:)  
Why then you'll hear  
(Jennifer:)  
Why then you'll hear  
(Both:)  
My poor heart call  
To you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender dear

I, yi yi yi (repeat 3 times)  
  
Chorus:  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, but I want you to want me too,  
Want you to want me baby  
Just like I want you  
  
Da da, da da, da da da  
  
I'll give you all the love I want in return  
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling  
It's too bad, it's just too sad  
You don't want me no more  
But I'm gonna change your mind  
Some way, somehow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Da da, da da, da da da  
  
One way love is just a fantasy  
To share is precious, pure and fair  
Don't play with something you should cherish for life  
Oh baby, don't you wanna care?  
Ain't it lonely out there?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, but I want you to want me too,  
Want me baby, just like I want you.  
Da da, da da, da da da  
  
(Spoken:)  
I want you, the right way  
Want me baby  
Don't play with something you should cherish for life

[Intro: Mike Tyson]  
I'm the best the world has ever seen.  
(And the best ever! )  
'M somebody you'll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears.  
(Can't be stopped! )  
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back  
  
[Verse 1: Madonna]  
If you try and fail, get up again  
Destiny will choose you in the end  
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice  
Someone else will speak for you instead  
  
[Verse 2: Madonna]  
What you want is just within your reach  
But you gotta practice what you preach  
You paid with sweat and tears to overcome your fears  
Never let the fire inside you leave  
  
[Hook: Madonna]  
I can, Icon, two letters apart  
One step away from being lost in the dark  
Just shine your light like a beautiful star  
Show the world who you are, who you are  
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees  
There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic  
  
[Verse 3: Madonna]  
Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great  
Say I have to fight and I can't wait  
Standing in the wings, a butterfly that stings  
I will rise above because it's my fate  
  
[Hook: Madonna]  
I can, Icon,two letters apart  
One step away from being lost in the dark  
Just shine your light like a beautiful star  
Show the world who you are, who you are  
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees  
There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic  
  
[Bridge: Madonna]  
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are  
Born to be a superstar, that's exactly what you are  
  
[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]  
Alright  
Firefly chain, wanna catch you  
Wanna put you in a net for their light glow  
Yellow brick highway, paparazzi pile-up on the high road  
They just turned the sun into an idol  
They just wanna see how high the sky go  
Just to find how it feel to fall bad  
Madonna said I remind her of Michael  
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head  
Put it on your wall  
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws  
Put me in a descant in the Synagogue  
Firefly gold, wanna catch ya  
Wanna catch you when your lights go dim  
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo  
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen  
You an icon  
  
[Hook: Madonna]  
I can, Icon, two letters apart  
One step away from being lost in the dark  
Just shine your light like a beautiful star  
Show the world who you are, who you are  
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees  
There's another part that's underneath  
Baby, don't you know you were  
Meant to be, want to be, meant to be  
Iconic, iconic, ironic, iconic

(Eva:) Colonel Peron  
(Peron:) Eva Duarte  
  
(Eva and Peron:)  
I've heard so much about you  
  
(Eva and Peron:)  
I'm amazed, for I'm only an actress [a soldier]  
Nothing to shout about [One of the thousands]  
Only a girl on the air [Defending the country he loves]  
  
(Eva:)  
But when you act, the things you do affect us all  
  
(Peron:)  
But when you act, you take us away from the squalor of the real  
World  
Are you here on your own?  
  
(Eva:)  
Yes, oh yes  
  
(Peron:)  
So am I, what a fortunate coincidence  
Maybe you're my reward for my efforts here tonight  
  
(Eva:)  
It seems crazy but you must believe  
There's nothing calculated, nothing planned  
Please forgive me if I seem naive  
I would never want to force your hand  
But please understand, I'd be good for you  
  
I don't always rush in like this  
Twenty seconds after saying hello  
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss  
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so  
But you really should know, I'd be good for you  
I'd be surprisingly good for you  
  
I won't go on if I'm boring you  
But do you understand my point of view?  
Do you like what you hear, what you see  
And would you be, good for me too?  
  
I'm not talking of a hurried night  
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye  
Creeping home before it gets too light  
That's not the reason that I caught your eye  
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you  
I'd be surprisingly good for you  
  
(Peron:)  
Please go on, you enthrall me  
I can understand you perfectly  
And I like what I hear, what I see, and knowing me  
I would be good for you too  
  
(Eva:)  
I'm not talking of a hurried night  
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye  
Creeping home before it gets too light  
That's not the reason that I caught your eye  
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you

I want you to know one thing  
You know how this is  
  
If I look at the crystal moon  
At the red branch of the slow autumn at my window  
If I touch near the fire the impalpable ash  
Or the wrinkled body of the log  
Everything carries me to you  
As if everything that exists - aromas, light, metals  
Were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me  
  
Well, now  
If little by little you stop loving me  
I shall stop loving you  
Little by little  
If suddenly you forget me  
Do not look for me  
For I shall already have forgotten you  
  
If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life  
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots  
Remember  
That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms  
And my roots will set off to seek another land  
  
But if each day, each hour, you feel that you are destined for me  
With implacable sweetness  
If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me  
Ahh my love, ahh my own, in me all that fire is repeated  
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten  
My love feeds on your love, beloved  
And as long as you live, it will be in your arms without leaving mine

Like the sun, like the light, like the flame  
Like the storm I burn through everything  
Like a bomb in the night, like a train  
Thunder rings through the hills, let it rain  
  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Wanna be like us tonight  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Ride the magic bus tonight  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
Like a mon with no light of my own  
Surf's the sky for a place to call home  
I woke up with my head in the fire  
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire  
  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Ah, o-wo-o-ho  
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Wanna be like us tonight  
All the boys, all the boys and girls  
Ride the magic bus tonight  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
Praise the lord and I like it that way  
  
Hail Mary, full of grace  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross  
Died for our sins, it's such a loss  
Saint Christopher, find my way  
I'll be coming home one day  
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry  
Let those poison arrows fly  
  
Saint Anthony, lost and found  
Thomas a cryin', just stand your ground  
All those saints and holy men  
Catch me before I sin again  
  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
Oh-o-wo-ho  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,  
I'm a sinner, I like it that way  
  
You're a sinner, you're a sinner  
You're a sinner, you like it that way  
We're all sinners, we're all sinners  
We're all sinners  
  
I'm a sinner  
I'm a sinner  
I'm a sinner  
And I like it that way  
  
Hail Mary, full of grace (the lord is with me)  
Hail Mary, full of grace (your love is with me)  
Full of grace

When did your name change from a word to a charm?  
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm  
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth  
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout  
And I can't get it out  
  
When did your name change from language to magic?  
I'd write it again on the back of my hand,  
And I know it sounds tragic  
  
It feels like a drug  
And I can't get enough  
And it fits like a glove  
I'm addicted to your love  
(I'm addicted to your love)  
I'm addicted to your love  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love  
  
Now that your name  
Pumps like the blood in my veins  
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind  
It's like MDNA and that's OK  
  
It feels like a drug  
And I can't get enough  
And it fits like a glove  
I'm addicted to your love  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love  
  
I need this exchange  
I don't care if you think that I'm strange  
Something happens to me when I hear your voice  
Something happens to me and I have no choice  
  
I need to hear your name  
Everything feels so strange  
I'm ready to take this chance  
I need to dance  
  
It feels like a drug  
And I can't get enough  
And it fits like a glove  
I'm addicted to your love  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love  
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love  
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)  
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)  
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)  
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)  
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)

Hola! Ese bato loco!  
  
I'm going bananas,  
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas,  
For I'm going bananas.  
  
I'm non compos mentes,  
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,  
For I'm non compos mentes.  
  
Who knows?  
Could be the tropic heat  
Or something that I eat,  
That makes me gonzo.  
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,  
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas  
For I'm going bananas.  
  
I'm going meshuga  
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing "Booga wooga",  
But I'm going meshuga.  
  
There's bats in my belfry.  
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,  
Otherwise I might get myself free.  
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.  
  
Who knows?  
Could be the wine I drink  
Or it's the way I think,  
That makes me gonzo.  
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,  
Someone get me a bed in the "Casa de Loco" for all my mananas,  
For I'm going bananas.  
Yes, I'm going bananas.  
Si, I'm going bananas.

Is it the rain, or is it the weather  
Am I insane to wanna keep it together  
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain  
Is it my friends they'd never made it to heaven  
  
I'm in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Is it the sunlight that changes the seasons  
Monday through Sunday I am looking for reasons  
Is there an angel watching over my shoulder  
Trickin my senses or giving me shelter  
  
I'm in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
I'm in love with love  
Is it the rain, is it the weather  
Angels up above  
Is it my friends keepin us together  
  
Is it the rain or is it the weather  
Am I insane to wanna keep it together  
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain  
Is it my friends they'd never made it to heaven  
  
I'm in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
I'm in love with love  
Anyone can see  
Angels up above are watching over me  
  
Affection is perfection  
When it's done with ease  
I'm in love with love  
  
I'm in love with love  
Is it the rain or is it the weather  
Angels up above  
Is it my friends keepin us together

Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try  
No people below us, above it's only sky  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today  
  
Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do  
No need to kill or die for and no religions too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger a brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing for the world  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
Take my hand and join us  
And the world will live, will live as one

How can I be sure you're telling me the truth  
In this house of games you never you show your cards  
You claim madness it's become convenient  
I don't wanna hear your angry words again  
  
You hear voices taunting you to leave me  
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms  
You have demons, nothing can control them  
Who can blame you if you're not in charge  
  
Is this love, I think not  
I wanna get off this merry-go-round  
History will repeat itself  
And I won't let you take me down  
  
Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior  
I'm living with the stranger I used to know so well  
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture  
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?  
  
You hear voices taunting you to leave me  
Then you're sorry you hold me in your arms  
You have demons, nothing can control them  
Who can blame you if you're not in charge  
  
Is this life, I think not  
I wanna get off this merry-go-round  
History will complete itself  
And I won't let you break me down  
  
I'd like to get to know you  
You could warm up your hands on my heart  
I've got so much to show you  
But for now it's just Bon D' Accord

[Verse 1]  
Each time they take the photograph  
I lose a part I can't get back  
I wanna hide  
This is the part where I detach  
Each time they write a hateful word  
Dragging my soul into the dirt  
I wanna die  
Never [?] hurts  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna talk about it right now  
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
But I'm in the dark, yeah  
I can't be superhero right now  
Even hearts made out of steel can break down  
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet  
I'm only human  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not going down  
  
[Verse 2]  
One little lie can ruin my day  
Words are like weapons, they betray  
When I am afraid  
One word of kindness, it can save me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Being destructive is  
They couldn't say it to my face  
ONe day I won't care  
But for the moment I'm not there  
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
Anything they did to me, said to me  
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now  
Even when the world turns its back on me  
There could be a war but I'm not Joan of Arc

[Chorus:]  
  
Was it just a dream?  
Did I feel your devotion?  
Dreams are never what they seem  
Did we just go through the motions?  
  
I keep your photograph by my bed to remind me  
That I was part of your life  
I say my prayers to the sandman  
That he'll find me fast asleep  
  
Sleep has always been kind  
And in my dreams you'll always be mine  
But in the morning when I wake  
I remember that my heart does ache  
  
[chorus, repeat]  
  
I admit that I did my bit to deceive you  
But sometimes I was afraid  
That this day would come  
How could you just leave me all alone now  
  
I have always been strong  
So I know that I can go on  
But right now I feel so dead inside  
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide  
  
[chorus, repeat]  
  
All that I have, all I ask  
All my dreams, they fade so fast  
Don't wake me up, not today  
All my dreams will fade away  
  
And I want him, and I need him  
I can't live and I'd die just to see him  
Just to feel his hands on my face  
Smell his skin, and his warm embrace  
Cause it's all that I have  
And it's fading so fast  
  
Mmmm, mmmm  
Uh, uh huh  
  
Now I have always been strong  
So I know that I can go on  
But right now I feel so dead inside  
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide  
  
[chorus, repeat]  
  
All that I have, all that I ask  
All my dreams, they fade so fast  
Don't wake me up, not today  
All my dreams will fade away  
  
(Was it just a dream?)  
And I want him, and I need him  
I can't live and I'd die just to see him  
Don't wake me up, not today  
All my dreams will fade away  
  
(Was it just a dream?)  
All that I have, all that I ask  
All my dreams, they fade so fast  
Don't wake me up, not today  
All my dreams will fade away  
[repeat and fade]

Mmmm...  
  
Hey little girl, when you grow up  
Don't make the same mistakes I did  
Learn to say no, I've had enough  
Then nothing and no one can harm you  
  
Follow your heart  
And you'll be fine  
Follow your dreams  
And take all of the time that you need  
  
Little girl don't you look back  
Don't let your memories haunt you  
Learn to be strong  
All on your own  
Make sure you get what you wanted  
  
Follow your heart  
And you'll be fine  
Follow your dreams  
And take all of the time that you need  
  
Little queen, wearing your crown  
Leave all your sadness behind you  
Don't waste your time, suffering fools  
One day prince charming will find you  
  
Mmmm...  
Mmmm...  
Mmmm...  
Mmmm...  
  
Hey little girl, when you grow up  
Don't make the same mistakes I did  
Learn to say no, I've had enough  
Then nothing and no one can hurt you  
  
Follow your heart  
And you'll be fine  
Follow your dreams  
And take all of the time that you need

Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn.  
You are the dealer,  
In this strange, uncertain game,  
Take my cards and deal again,  
I can feel my life is changing.  
Woman,  
Now you taught me how to learn,  
Teach me to earn  
The love you give to me,  
The love you give to me.  
Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn.  
I was waiting  
In the darkness of the night,  
Only now I see the light  
Softly shining in the silence.  
Woman,  
If you really hold the key,  
Turn it for me,  
And help me understand,  
And help me understand.  
Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,  
I never lnew that I was born.  
Well. I like you for your body, but I love 'cause you're wise,  
I am your prisoner, Oh my Lady of the Dawn

(Eva:)  
The choice was mine, and mine completely  
I could have any prize that I desired  
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire  
Or else, or else I could choose time  
  
Remember I was very young then  
And a year was forever and a day  
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?  
I saw the lights, and I was on my way  
  
And how I lived, how they shone  
But how soon the lights were gone  
  
(Che:)  
The choice was yours and noone else's  
You can cry for a body in despair  
Hang your head because she is no longer there  
To shine, to dazzle, or betray  
How she lived, how she shone  
But how soon the lights were gone  
  
(Embalmers:)  
Eyes, hair, face, image  
All must be preserved  
Still life displayed forever  
No less than she deserved.

I can't lock my door  
Oh, I don't have no privacy  
The only thing that's mine  
Is what's inside of me  
  
When I've had enough  
A little voice inside  
It says you've got to be tough  
You've got to take it in stride  
  
Sometimes I am foolish  
I let it get the best of me  
At least I know that my mistakes  
Are my responsibility,and  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
  
I don't have a dime  
Oh, to buy those pretty things  
But I hear all the evidence  
You know it all sounds the same  
  
But I'm still waiting  
I've got my hands open wide  
You know my dream isn't fading  
I keep it hidden inside  
Oh  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I keep on trying  
  
My friends don't understand  
Oh, they think I've lost my mind  
And I'm choking back the tears  
I've got to swallow my pride  
  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
I just have to laugh to keep from crying  
  
I just have to laugh, ah  
La, ah  
Lo, oh  
La, ah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
I'm dreaming you are here with me  
Can feel your body close to me  
But every time you are touching me  
I lose some kind of tension  
  
Through shady lights you talk to me  
Your shadow's all that I can see  
But when you're looking down on me  
It's like you've lost your attention  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no don't tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah, I wanna get out  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
We're through there's nothing left to say  
Love passes, slipping out of the way  
Why can't you say it straight to me  
That you've lost your attention  
  
Around, I wanted you near me  
Those sounds you would not hear  
And all those lonely nights  
It's like you don't care  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no don't tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah, I wanna get out  
  
Say to me  
Would you run  
Cause you don't wanna be  
Kept waiting here forever  
You're plain to see  
(You're plain to see, but love was faster)  
Lies  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no don't tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah, I wanna get out  
  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh no don't tell me about it  
Lies in your eyes  
See the lies in your eyes  
Oh yeah, I wanna get out

There's a hole in my heart  
No one else can fill it  
There's a feeling I have  
No one can replace  
There's a taste in my mouth  
No one else can give me  
There's a song that I hear  
No one can erase  
Why would I want them to  
I'm still looking back at you  
Why would I want them to be you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
There's a strange melody  
Sends me straight to heaven  
There's a voice in my head  
No one else can hear  
There's a prayer that I say  
Always brings me closer  
To the presence of you  
To always have you near  
No one can take your place  
I'm still looking at your face  
No one can take the place of you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
Like a flower you grow  
Why would I want them to  
I'm still looking back at you  
Why would I want them to be you  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
You'll always be a part of me  
What you love can never let you go  
You'll always be inside of me  
Like a flower you grow  
Like a flower you grow

Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged good-bye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room

Your love is like liquid  
It fills me, it chills me  
Can't hold it, control it  
It runs from my touch  
  
It slips through my fingers  
The taste of it lingers  
Your love is like liquid  
I want it so much  
  
Chorus:  
  
Liquid love  
Pouring down like rain  
Liquid love  
Let it wash all over me  
  
Your love is like liquid  
It drenches, it quenches  
It drowns me, surrounds me  
It lies on my skin  
  
It flows through my vains  
Just like warm summer rains  
Yes, your love is like liquid  
I feel it within  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Chorus2:  
  
Liquid love  
Flowing through my veins  
Liquid love  
  
Liquid love  
  
My heart was frozen  
Til you came and melted it  
Now my heart is molten  
Turned it into  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Chorus2)  
[Chorus:]  
(Chorus2)  
  
Liquid love  
Liquid love  
Flowing through my vains

He runs through the street  
Cause his house's falling down  
And his eyes are burning as they touch the ground  
The baseball cap won't hide the pain  
There's no one here today  
He runs through a house  
And he looks for food  
He feels so bad  
But he knows he's good  
He lays down on the kitchenfloor  
He ain't hungry no more  
Little boy lost  
In little boy land  
How much does it cost  
To understand  
Little boy say  
Why do you cry  
And how much will you pay  
To know why  
Sometimes at night he wets his bed  
As you stay playing tricks inside his head  
He waits so cold  
For a longer life  
There's no one here tonight  
Little boy lost  
In little boy land  
How much does it cost  
To understand  
Little boy say  
Why do you cry  
And how much will you pay  
To know why

You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
When you lived inside of me  
There was nothing I could conceive  
That you wouldn't do for me  
Trouble seemed so far away  
You changed that right away, baby  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just emptiness and memories  
Of what we had before  
You went away  
Found another place to stay, another home  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
You're the windmills of my eyes  
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me  
Why'd ya have to go away (away)  
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
(Love don't live here anymore)  
Just a vacancy  
Love don't live here anymore  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
Live here anymore  
Love don't live here anymore  
Love don't live here anymore  
No no don't, don't live live here anymore  
  
You abandoned me  
Love don't live here anymore  
No it don't live here anymore  
Love, don't, live here (love don't live here anymore )  
Anymore  
It don't live here anymore

Is like I'm in love with a stranger  
It's nothing familiar about your touch  
And I need a way to make sense of this person I met  
As a flame that burns through my heart.  
Oh I, oh I, I never felt such heat in my life  
The passion in...  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
I love your energy is perfect chemistry,  
Our heart... cause that's what you do to me!  
Let's talk more plain, let's move, embrace  
Let your heart get away, oh yeah!  
Let's talk more plain, let's move, embrace  
Let your heart get away, oh yeah!  
Let your heart just shine and guide away!  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
Fire, fire!  
Aha! fire!  
  
Chorus:  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
When I move, the floor is on fire  
When you stare I'm aware of your desire  
When you scream, your voice gets me higher  
When we dance our love is on fire!  
  
Our love on fire!  
Uh, our love on fire!  
Our love on fire!  
Our love on fire!  
Oh, oh, yeah!  
Uh, baby!

I don't want to talk about it  
Even if you scream and shout it  
Words are nothing 'til they're actions  
I can't get no satisfaction  
  
With your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
To have your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
  
Tell your tales to someone else  
Or better keep them to yourself  
I've heard your stories  
All before you're always walking out the door  
  
With your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
To have your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
  
So get out the door with your love on the run  
Get out the door, you're just no fun  
Get out the door with your love on the run  
You're just no fun on the run  
  
You would think I've had enough  
Of all your games, it's just too much  
I could have known when I first met you  
I'm trying so hard to forget  
  
Your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
To have your love on the run  
Oh, you're just no fun  
  
So get out the door with your love on the run  
Get out the door, you're just no fun  
Get out the door with your love on the run  
You're just no fun on the run  
I Say  
Get out the door with your love on the run  
Get out the door, you're just no fun  
Get out the door with your love on the run  
You're just no fun on the run  
  
Your love on the run  
On the run you're just no fun  
Just no fun on the run  
On the run you're just no fun

(Love won't wait)  
(Love won't wait)  
When I first saw your face  
I knew that I couldn't hesitate  
You said, "Baby don't go too fast  
If we do then it may not last"  
Time went on and I waited for you  
I didn't know what else I could do  
I thought that we'd always be together  
You said, "Hold on, it just gets better"  
And I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think I'm not that strong, you know  
Love won't wait  
(Love won't wait)  
Forever and a day  
[Love won't wait)  
Love must live in the here and now  
Don't ask me how, I know  
(Love won't wait)  
(Love won't wait)  
(Love won't wait)  
So here I am with my heart on my sleeve  
You said, "Baby put your trust in me"  
But I have come to the end of the line  
And you have taken up all of my precious time  
I need to be something special to you  
Everybody's somebody's fool  
Won't be a fool, no you got me all wrong  
You won't know what you had til it's gone  
And I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think I'm not that strong, you know  
Love won't wait  
(Love won't wait)  
Forever and a day  
[Love won't wait)  
Love must live in the here and now  
Don't ask me how, I know  
(Love won't wait)  
Love takes time  
(Love takes time)  
And you've been taking too long  
(Way too long)  
And time never waited for anyone  
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone  
(Love won't wait)  
There wasn't anything that I wouldn't do  
You led me on, you even said, "I love you"  
How can we go on when it's tearing us apart  
Are you going to break my heart  
'Cause I believed you  
I kept holding on  
You think that I could never leave you  
You think I'm not that strong, you're wrong  
(Love won't wait)  
(Love won't wait)  
Love won't wait  
(Love won't wait)  
Forever and a day  
[Love won't wait)  
Love must live in the here and now  
Don't ask me how, I know  
(Love won't wait)  
Love takes time  
(Love takes time)  
And you've been taking too long  
(Way too long)  
And time never waited for anyone  
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone  
(Love won't wait)  
How much longer can I wait for you  
Can I keep holding on  
I've got to be strong  
Got to say good-bye  
(Love won't wait)  
How much longer can I wait for you  
Hesitate for you baby  
I've got to be strong  
Got to say good-bye  
Good-bye

If you were the Mona Lisa  
You'd be hanging in the Louvre  
Everyone would come to see you  
You'd be impossible to move  
It seems to me is what you are  
A rare and priceless work of art  
Stay behind your velvet rope  
But I will not renounce all hope  
  
And I'm right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I can't tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with the masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothing's indestructible  
  
From the moment I first saw you  
All the darkness turned to light  
An impressionistic painting  
Tiny particles of light  
It seem to me is what you're like  
The "look but please don't touch me" type  
And honestly it can't be fun  
To always be the chosen one  
  
And I'm right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I can't tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothing's indestructible  
Nothing's indestructible  
Nothing's indestructible  
Nothing's indestructible  
  
And I'm right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I can't tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
  
And I'm right by your side  
Like a thief in the night  
I stand in front of the masterpiece  
And I can't tell you why  
It hurts so much  
To be in love with a masterpiece  
Cause after all  
Nothing's indestructible  
Cause after all  
Nothing's indestructible

Some boys kiss me  
Some boys hug me  
I think they're ok  
If they don't give me proper credit  
I just walk away  
  
They can beg and they can plead  
But they can't see the light (that's right)  
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash  
Is always Mister Right  
  
'Cause we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Some boys romance  
Some boys slow dance  
That's all right with me  
If they can't raise my interest then I  
Have to let them be  
  
Some boys try and some boys lie but  
I don't let them play (no way)  
Only boys who save their pennies  
Make my rainy day  
  
'Cause we're living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
Living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
  
Boys may come and boys may go  
And that's all right you see  
Experience has made me rich  
And now they're after me  
  
'Cause everybody's living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
Living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
You know that we are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
A material, a material, a material, a material world  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world  
Living in a material world (material)  
Living in a material world

[Verse 1]  
I am the promise that you cannot keep  
Reap what you sow  
Find what you seek  
I am the sorceress down in the deep  
I am the earth under your feet  
I am the moon with no light of my own  
You are the sun, guarding the throne  
I heard the angels whisper to me  
"Look for the signs, he is the one."  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll be the bride that is married to life  
You are the day, I am the night  
We knew a blanket of silver and gold  
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told  
I need your strength it will keep me from harm  
I'll be your Queen, safe in your arms  
Don't want to get to the end of my days  
Saying I wasn't amazed  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
[Chorus]  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too

[Verse 1]  
They say that hate has been sent  
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)  
Before they outlaw the kiss  
Baby, give me one last hug  
There's a dream that I've been chasing  
Want so badly for it to be reality.  
And when you hold my hand  
And I understand that it's meant to be.  
'Cause baby when you're with me...  
  
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven  
(Came by and took me to heaven)  
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better  
(I don't want you to go, oh no, so)  
  
[Chorus]  
Let the music blast  
We gonna do our dance  
Bring the doubters on  
They don't matter at all  
'Cause this life's too long  
And this love's too strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
I got my favorite girl  
Not feelin', no pain, no fear  
Don't have a care in the world  
Why would I when you are here?  
There's a moment I've been chasing  
And I finally caught it out on this floor.  
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation  
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because...  
  
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to
heaven)  
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to
go, oh no, so)  
  
[Chorus]  
Let the music blast  
We gonna do our dance  
Bring the doubters on  
They don't matter at all  
'Cause this life's too long  
And this love's too strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to
heaven, girl)  
'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to
go, oh no, so)  
  
Take my hand  
Let's just dance  
Watch my feet  
Follow me  
Don't be scared,  
Girl I'm here  
If you didn't know,  
This is love  
  
Let the music blast  
We gonna do our dance  
Praise the doubters on  
They don't matter at all (oh, baby)  
'Cause this life's too long  
And this love's too strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
So don't fear.  
Don't you worry about a thing.  
I am here, by you (I'll never let you go)  
  
Don't she'd a tear.  
Whenever you need me,  
I'll be here (I'll never let you go)  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)  
Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)

Lets dance, you can do a little two-step  
Ill go anywhere that you step to, cause I'm following you.  
My feet might be falling out of rhythm,  
Don't know what I'm doing with them, but I know I'm following you.  
  
Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet  
Lets boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but whos counting?  
Encore, once again around the dance floor  
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.  
  
Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet  
Lets boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but whos counting?  
Encore, once again around the dance floor  
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.

(Che:)  
Oh what a circus, oh what a show  
Argentina has gone to town  
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron  
We've all gone crazy  
Mourning all day and mourning all night  
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right  
  
Oh what an exit, that's how to go  
When they're ringing your curtain down  
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron  
It's quite a sunset  
And good for the country in a roundabout way  
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today  
  
But who is this Santa Evita?  
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?  
What kind of goddess has lived among us?  
How will we ever get by without her?  
  
She had her moments, she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, "Eva Peron"  
But that's all gone now  
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears  
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years  
  
(Crowd:)  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
(Che:)  
You let down your people Evita  
You were supposed to have been immortal  
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for  
But in the end you could not deliver  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
And she's not coming back to you  
  
Show business kept us all alive  
Since seventeen October 1945  
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin  
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in  
  
Instead of government we had a stage  
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage  
Instead of help we were given a crowd  
She didn't say much, but she said it loud  
  
Sing you fools, but you got it wrong  
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long  
Your queen is dead, your king is through  
She's not coming back to you  
  
(Crowd:)  
Salve regina mater misericordiae  
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra  
Salve salve regina Peron  
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva  
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes  
O clemens o pia  
  
(Eva:)  
Don't cry for me Argentina  
For I am ordinary, unimportant  
And undeserving of such attention  
Unless we all are, I think we all are  
So share my glory, so share my coffin  
So share my glory, so share my coffin  
  
(Che:)  
It's our funeral too
