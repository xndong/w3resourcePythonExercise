Times have changed  
And we've often rewound the clock  
Since the Puritans got a shock  
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.  
If today  
Any shock they should try to stem  
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  
Plymouth Rock would land on them.  
  
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking.  
But now, God knows,  
Anything goes.  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four-letter words  
Writing prose.  
Anything goes.  
If driving fast cars you like,  
If low bars you like,  
If old hymns you like,  
If bare limbs you like,  
If Mae West you like,  
Or me undressed you like,  
Why, nobody will oppose.  
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-  
Truding in nudist parties in  
Studios.  
Anything goes.  
  
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)  
Can get Russian reds to "yes" her,  
Then I suppose  
Anything goes.  
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-  
Ough money to let Max Gordon  
Produce his shows,  
Anything goes.  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today,  
And black's white today,  
And day's night today,  
And that gent today  
You gave a cent today  
Once had several chateaux.  
When folks who still can ride in jitneys  
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys  
Lack baby clo'es,  
Anything goes.  
  
If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction  
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,  
Then Anna shows  
Anything goes.  
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up  
Now turns a handspring landing up-  
On her toes,  
Anything goes.  
Just think of those shocks you've got  
And those knocks you've got  
And those blues you've got  
From that news you've got  
And those pains you've got  
(If any brains you've got)  
From those little radios.  
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,  
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons  
'Cause Franklin knows  
Anything goes.

Down In The Depths"  
by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,  
Here I sit, above the town,  
In my pet-paillated gown,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor

You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
  
And we would be so grand at the game  
Carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
You'd be so easy to love  
Easy to idolize all others above  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep all the home fires burning for  
  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together that it does seem a shame  
That you can't see your future with me  
Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love  
  
Easy to love  
Easy to love

Whenever skies look gray to me  
And trouble begins to brew,  
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,  
I concentrate on you.  
  
When fortune cries "Nay! Nay!" to me  
And people declare "You're through!",  
Whenever the blues become my only song,  
I concentrate on you.  
  
On your smile so sweet, so tender,  
When at first your kiss I decline.  
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,  
And once again our arms intertwine  
  
And so, when wise men say to me  
That love's young dream never comes true,  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,  
I concentrate on you.

I hate men  
I can't abide 'em even now and then  
  
Than ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather  
For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother  
Of course, I'm awfully glad that mother deemed to marry father  
But I hate men  
  
Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy  
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy  
He may have hair upon his chest but, sister, so has Lassie  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
They should be kept like piggies in a pen  
  
Don't wed a trav'ling salesman though a tempting Tom he may be  
For on your wedding night he may be off to far Araby  
While he's away in Mandalay it is thee who have the baby  
Oh, I hate men  
  
If thou shouldst wed a businessman, be wary, oh, be wary  
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business necessary  
His business is the business with his pretty secretary  
Oh, I hate men  
  
I hate men  
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen  
  
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism  
He'll always stay at home at night and make no criticism  
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism  
Oh, I hate men  
  
From all I've read alone in bed, from A to Z, about them  
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout them  
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without them?  
Still, I hate men

It was just one of those things  
Just one of those crazy flings  
One of those bells that now and then rings  
Just one of those things  
  
It was just one of those nights  
Just one of those fabulous flights  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings  
Just one of those things  
  
If we'd thought a bit before the end of it  
When we started painting the town  
We'd have been aware that our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down  
  
So good-bye, dear, and amen  
Here's hoping we meet now and then  
It was great fun  
But it was just one of those things

When the only sound on the empty street  
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet  
That belong to a lonesome cop  
I open shop  
The moon so long has been gazing down  
On the warward ways of this wayward town  
Her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work  
Love for sale  
Appetizing young love for sale  
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled  
Love that's only slightly soiled  
Love for sale  
Who will buy  
Who would like to sample my supply  
Who's prepared to pay the price  
For a trip to paradise  
Love for sale  
Let the poets pipe of love  
In their childish ways  
I know every type of love  
Better far than they  
If you want the thrill of love  
I've been through the mill of love  
Old love  
New love  
Every love but true love  
Love for sale  
Appetizing young love for sale  
If you want to buy my wares  
Follow me and climb the stairs  
Love for sale

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down in Lover's Lane  
She strayed, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone, madam  
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam  
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam  
They strung her upon the old willow across the way  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

Night and day, you are the one  
Only you beneath the moon, under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter darlin', where you are  
  
I think of you night and day  
Night and day, why's it so  
That this longing for you, follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you night and day  
Night and day, under the hide of me  
There's an ooh, such a hungry yearning, burning inside of me  
  
And this torment won't be through  
Till you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and Night  
Night and Day

Gaze on the glistening lights below and above  
Oh, what a night of nights for people in love  
No city but this my friend, no city I know  
Gives romance such a chance to grow and grow  
  
Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above  
Paris tells lovers, love is supreme, wake up your dream and make love  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
  
Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above  
(Capitalistic, characteristic, sensualistic, they should be atheistic)  
Paris tells lovers, love is supreme, wake up your dream and make love  
(Imperialistic, I'm pessimistic, that's anti communistic)  
  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
(Militaristic, you're optimistic, du jour propaganda)  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
(Unrealistic, is individualistic and not at all collectivistic but a low  
Totalitarianistic thing)

Strange dear, but true dear,  
When I'm close to you, dear,  
The stars fill the sky,  
So in love with you am I.  
Even without you,  
My arms fold about you,  
You know darling why,  
So in love with you am I.  
In love with the night mysterious,  
The night when you first were there,  
In love with my joy delirious,  
When I knew that you could care,  
So taunt me, and hurt me,  
Deceive me, desert me,  
I'm yours, till I die.....  
So in love.... So in love....  
So in love with you, my love... Am I....

Suntanned, windblown  
Honeymooners at last alone  
Feeling far above par  
Oh, how lucky we are  
  
While I give to you and you give to me  
True love, true love  
So on and on it will always be  
True love, true love  
  
For you and I have a guardian angel  
On high, with nothing to do  
But to give to you and to give to me  
Love forever, true  
  
For you and I have a guardian angel  
On high, with nothing to do  
But to give to you and to give to me  
Love forever, true  
  
Love forever...true

I've got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I've tried so not to give in  
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well  
So why should I try to resist, when darling I know so well  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of having you near  
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night  
And repeats, repeats in my ear  
  
Don't you know little fool, you never can win  
Use your mentality, wake up to reality  
But each time I do, just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin

Have you heard? The coast of Maine just got caught in a hurricane?  
Well did you ever? What a swell party this is!  
Have you heard that poor dear Blanche got run down by an avalanche?  
Well, did you ever? What a swell party this is!  
What daiquiris! What sherry, please! What burgundy! What pommery!  
Have you heard? Professor Munch ate his wife and divorced his lunch?  
Well, did you ever ? What a swell party this is!  
  
Misses Smith in her new Hup crossed the bridge when the bridge was up,  
Well, did you ever ? What a swell part this is!  
What brandy, wow! What whiskey, here's how!  
What gin and what beer, will you sober up, dear?

I was a humdrum person  
Leading a life apart  
When love flew in through my window wide  
And quickened my hum-drum heart  
Love flew in through my window  
I was so happy then  
But after love had stayed a little while  
Love flew out again  
  
What is this thing called love?  
This funny thing called love?  
Just who can solve its mystery?  
Why should it make a fool of me?  
I saw you there one wonderful day  
You took my heart and threw it away  
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above  
What is this thing called love?  
  
You gave me days of sunshine  
You gave me nights of cheer  
You made my life an enchanted dream  
'Til somebody else came near  
Somebody else came near you  
I felt the winter's chill  
And now I sit and wonder night and day  
Why I love you still?

Since I reached the charming age of puberty  
And began to think of feminine curls  
Like a show that's typically Shuberty  
I have always had a multitude of girls  
But now that a married man at last am I  
How aware of my dear departed past am I  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
A married life may all be well  
But raising an heir could never compare  
With raising a bit of hell  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I...  
In dear Milano, where are you Momo?  
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo  
And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?  
Still peddling your pizza in the streets-a Toremina  
And in Firenze, where are you Alice?  
Still there in your pretty itty-bitty pity palace  
And sweet Lucretia, so young and gay  
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
The marriage game is quite all right  
Yes during the day it's easy to play  
But oh what a bore at night  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I...  
Where is Rebecca? My Becky-wecky-oh  
Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio?  
Where is Fedora, the wild virago?  
It's lucky I missed her gangster sister from Chicago  
Where is Venetia, who loved to chat so?  
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo?  
And lovely Lisa, where are you Lisa?  
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza  
Where is the life that late I led?  
Where is it now? Totally dead!  
Where is the fun I used to find?  
Where has it gone? Gone with the wind!  
I've oft been told of nuptial bliss  
But what do you do at quarter to two  
With only a shrew to kiss?  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I led
