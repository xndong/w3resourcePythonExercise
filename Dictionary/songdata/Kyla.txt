Seven in the evening grabbed the phone and started calling  
All my friends coz it's saturday night  
I got this funky feelin' before I start on leavin' that tonight i'll meet the
man of my life  
Pre chorus:  
Give me time so I can think about  
All those days that we have to go away  
If you feel a little insecure  
Come with me baby I will be your cure  
Chorus 2x:  
Bounce come turn it up  
Bounce to the music  
Come shake it up  
Bounce until you drop  
Ain't nobody gonna stop me  
I got this party movin'  
Everybody start on groovin'  
I feel the sound coz I know your around  
You can scream if you want to  
Jump around if it makes you  
Feel alright while you dance through the night  
Repeat pre chorus  
Repeat chorus

Fancy meeting you alone in the crowd  
Couldn't help but notice your smile  
While everybody else around us is going about  
Can we just stop and talk awhile?  
  
I've been often told our world's growing old  
And that friends are harder to find  
Do tell me more about yourself  
We could share a thought or two  
Now who would mind?  
  
Maybe then we could go for a ride  
Drive down to the countryside  
Get away from the gray  
And frenzied hurly-burly of the city life  
  
Early yet to say what lies ahead  
It's the first day of the rest of our lives  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile

Boy if I told you I love you  
That doesn't mean that I don't care, oooh  
And when I tell you I need you  
Don't you think that I'll can never be there, ooooh  
  
Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
I'm only saying what's in my heart  
Cupid doesn't lie  
But you won't know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby, true love  
Won't lie but you won't know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Boy when I ask you to trust me  
That doesn't mean that I'm gonna cheat on you  
Cause I'm gonna never do anything to hurt you  
Or mislead you, I love you  
  
Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
I'm only saying what's in my heart  
Cupid doesn't lie  
But you won't know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby, true love  
Won't lie but you won't know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Lord no, I really mean it  
I rather die before I, before I lie to you  
Never wanna leave you  
Ain't no life without you  
Never gonna leave, never gonna go,  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh  
  
Baby I'm so tired of the way you turn my words into  
Deception and lies  
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind  
I'm only saying what's in my heart  
Cupid doesn't lie  
But you won't know unless you give it a try  
Oh baby, true love  
Won't lie but you won't know unless we give it a try  
Give it a try  
  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Lord no, I really mean it  
I rather die before I, before I lie to you  
Never wanna leave you  
Ain't no life without you  
Never gonna leave, never gonna go,  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh

There was a time when I thought life was over and out  
When you went away from me  
My dying heat made it hard to breathe  
Would sit in my room  
Because I didn't want to have to go out  
And see you walking by  
One look and I'd break night down and cry  
  
Now you say that you've made a big mistake  
Never meant to take your love away  
But you can save your tired  
Apologies  
'Cause it may seem hard to believe but  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm doin'just fine  
Getting along very well  
Without you in my life  
I don't need you in my life  
I'm doin' just fine  
Time made me stronger  
You're no longer on my mind  
  
You were my earth  
My number one priority  
I gave my love to only you  
Anything you'd ask of me  
I would do  
But somewhere down the road  
You felt a change in the weather  
And told me that you had to journey on  
A kiss in the wind and you love was gone  
  
Now you say you never meant to play your games  
Boy, don't you know it's far too late  
Because you let our love just fall apart  
You no longer have a heart  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
When you said goodbye  
I felt so all alone  
There were time at night I couldn't sleep  
My heart was much to weak to make it on my own  
Baby after all the misery  
And pain you out me through  
So unfair to me boy  
You're no longer my world  
And I ain't missin' you at all

You ain't crazy  
Ain't gonna lie anymore  
What you're feelin'  
There's a reason for  
I wanna do right  
Oh, I gotta do right  
Do I love you'  
Boy, you know I've tried  
What you're after  
You can't find in my eyes  
I wanna do right  
  
darlin' tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever'  
I don't know  
Maybe were near the end  
  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
  
One by one  
Were collecting lies  
When you can't give love  
You give alibis  
I wanna do right  
This time I gotta do right  
I don't wanna leave  
I don't wanna say good-bye  
But sooner or later  
Baby there comes a time  
Oh When I gotta do right  
Oh, I gotta do right  
  
Darlin' tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
In this one last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever'  
I don't know  
Maybe were near the end  
  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
  
Why are you so torn apart'  
I need a little more lovin' in my heart  
People say that love will grow  
So how was I to know  
Love that's come through years and years  
Can't find a way back home anymore  
  
Darlin' tell me the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our final chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever'  
I don't know  
Maybe were near the end  
  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
  
Does anything last of all  
I don't know  
Maybe were near the end  
  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart

You led me to believe  
That what we have was made to be  
Your conclusions, they came too soon  
(Don't get me wrong coz I don't wanna blame you)  
It was just coz my heart was unprepared  
(For this drama, this hell in my head)  
Can't digest your reasons for letting go  
It's just not fair how love can turn so cold  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)  
  
Now after all that we've been through  
The heartaches, the pain, the laughter too  
Is the love still burning?  
Is the love still burning?  
  
I can't pretend, can't escape cuz I'm not content  
I hold on to moments built on trust  
Emotions makin me weak  
To overcome you is killin me  
(All good things come to it's end)  
Leaving a broken path which destiny has changed  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Love me (so, that you can)  
Break me (and then youll just)  
Leave me (tell me why)  
  
[Chorus:] [4x]  
Here I stand in front of you  
Naked as can be and my heart so true  
Look me in the eye and hold my hand  
(Tell me if you really love me)

Your face is beaming, you say cause it's you're dreaming of  
How good it's going to be  
You say you've been around and now you've finally found  
Everything you wanted and needed in me  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
Inside I'm dying, to see you cryin'  
How can I make you understand  
I care about you, so much about you  
Baby I'm trying to say this as gently as I can 'cause  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
You're so trusting, and open  
Hoping that love will start  
But I don't have the heart  
Oh no, I don't have the heart  
  
Chorus:  
I don't have the heart to hurt you  
It's the last thing I wanna to do  
But I don't have the heart to love you  
Not the way you want me to  
  
I don't have the heart  
Baby, I don't have the heart  
Baby, I don't have the heart

Here I am  
Alone and I don't understand  
Exactly how it all began  
The dream just walked away  
  
I'm holding on  
When all but the passion's gone  
  
And from the start  
Maybe I was tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
  
And heroes die,  
When they ignore the cause inside  
But they learn from what's left behind  
And fight for something else  
  
And so it goes  
That we have both learned how to grow  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our heart  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh it's just too much  
Takin' all the whole world all by myself  
But it's not enough  
Unless I stop trusting somebody else,  
Somebody else  
And love again  
  
[Instrumental Interlude]  
  
And from the start  
Maybe we were tryin' too hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go, no  
Maybe we were tryin' to hard  
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts  
Things can fall apart but I know,  
That I don't want you to go  
Oh no, don't want you to go

Something inside,  
My heart,  
And it feels like magic,  
It's changing my life.  
Since you came to me,  
Everything is so bright I see  
You touched my heart,  
And gave me love so real.  
This time around I wanna let it show  
There's something special,  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you,  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love  
You are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean always love you  
Because to me  
You are a dream  
Come true  
Love grows  
Everyday  
And it's hard to deny it  
You inspire me all the way  
The joy you bring  
Makes my heart keep on singing  
And all I wanna do  
Is to remain close to you  
This time around I wanna let it show  
There's something special  
In my heart you ought to know  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean I'll always love you  
Because to me you are a dream  
Come true  
You are my angel in disguise  
You are the reason I survive  
With you each moment is worthwhile  
You make me smile  
And if without you  
Surely I cry  
I feel for you  
I mean I truly love you  
In my heart and in my soul  
You are my love you are my all  
I feel for you  
I mean I'll always love you  
Because to me you are a dream(3x)  
That's what I feel for you...  

I never asked for this feeling  
I never thought I would fall  
I never knew how I felt  
Till the day you were gone  
I was lost  
I never asked for red roses  
I wasn't looking for love  
Somehow I let my emotions take hold  
And guess what all at once  
I'm in love  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I miss you so much  
I long for your love  
Its scares me  
Cause my heart gets so weak  
That I can't even breathe  
How can you take things so easily  
Baby why aren't you missing me  
  
Why did I act like you mattered  
It was silly of me to believe  
That if I just opened my heart  
Things would come naturally  
Jokes on me yeah  
I did not ask for love letters  
So why did you give them to me  
How could I let your intentions  
Get hold over me  
So in love  
So naive oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And oh how I hate what you have done  
Made me fall so deep in love  
Got no cure  
You're the only one I want  
That I love oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby why aren't you missing me  
Baby why aren't you missing me

You  
You turned and walk away  
I didn't know what to say  
I closed my eyes to hide  
The pain I felt inside  
I could never understand  
How love went out of hand  
And now there's nothing I can do  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now  
Now I'm left here all alone  
A heart without a home  
How will I ever find  
The love I left behind  
Once, the days were ours to share  
Now you don't even care  
And there's still nothing I can do  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now...  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now  
(Instrumental)  
Though the feeling hasn't passed  
Sad to say our love didn't last  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over  
When I'm done forgetting you  
You can say what you wanted to  
Please don't ask me to pretend  
'Cause I know it's over now  

Ooh...  
  
Ang bukas ko ang buhay ko  
Inialay na ang lahat sa 'yo  
Nagtiwala pang buong-buo  
Ngunit bakit ngayon tayo'y magkalayo  
  
Naghihintay sa 'yong pagbabalik  
Umaasa, nananabik  
Na pangako mo'y tutuparin  
Ako lamang ang iyong mamahalin  
  
Kung maibabalik ko lang  
Ang mga sandali na nagdaan  
Yayakapin at hahagkan  
Kung maaari lang  
  
Kung ang kahapo'y bukas pa  
Pipigilan kong lumisan ka  
Kung maaari lang, kung maaari lang  
  
Ooh...  
  
Tamis ng 'yong halik aking inaasam  
Kahit na sandali labi ko'y madampian  
Sana ay muling maramdaman  
Pag-ibig natin na tila walang hanggan  
  
Naghihintay sa 'yong pagbabalik  
Umaasa, nananabik  
Na pangako mo'y tutuparin  
Ako lamang ang iyong mamahalin  
  
Kung maibabalik ko lang  
Ang mga sandali na nagdaan  
Yayakapin at hahagkan  
Kung maaari lang  
  
Kung ang kahapo'y bukas pa  
Pipigilan kong lumisan ka  
Kung maaari lang, kung maaari lang  
  
Kung maibabalik ko lang  
Ang mga sandali na nagdaan  
Yayakapin at hahagkan  
Kung maaari lang  
  
Kung ang kahapo'y bukas pa  
Pipigilan kong lumisan ka  
Kung maaari lang, kung maaari lang...  
  
Ooh...  
Kung maaari lang...

This is my last dance with you  
This is my only chance to do all I can do  
To let you know that what I feel for you is real  
  
This is the last chance for us  
This is the moment that I just cannot let end  
Before I know that there's a chance we're more than friends  
  
So don't let go, don't let go  
Make it last all night  
This is my last chance to make you mine  
  
I kept my feelings so deep  
I kept my dreams of you and me somewhere inside  
Although I prayed that you would see it in my eyes  
  
But this is my last chance to say  
What's in my heart before you stay out of my life  
And then you'll understand the way I feel inside  
  
So hold me close cause it feels so right  
This is my last chance to make it mine  
Make this dream reality  
So close and yet so far  
Gotta find a way into your heart  
Gotta speak my mind  
Gotta open up to you this time  
I can't let you slip away tonight  
This is my last dance iwth you  
  
This is my only chance to do all I can do  
To let you know that what I feel for you is so real  
So don't let go  
Just make it last all night long  
This is my last chance to make you mine, yeah  
To make you mine

I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
You gave me your love  
You gave me your sweet lil' lips  
You showed me everything I need  
A 'lil girl liking you  
Last fragrant flowers, dining with candles  
Kissing and talking every night, is all we did  
I wish it will never end, with all the love we shared  
Wishing those memories will last forever  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
I still remember, that you will always be there  
You'd stay here with me, 'til the river runs dry  
Last fragrant flowers, dining with candles  
Kissing and talking every night, is all we did  
I wish it will never end, with all the love we shared  
Wishing those memories will last forever  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  

Saying goodbye is never an easy thing  
But you never said, you stay forever  
So if you must go darling, I'll set you free  
But I know in time, we'll be together  
I won't try to stop you now from leaving  
'Cause in my heart, I know  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
One of these nights, I'll hear your voice again  
You're gonna say, how much you miss me  
You walked out this door but someday you'll walk back in  
Darling I know, I know this will be  
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now  
To find your way back home  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
I won't try to stop you now from leaving  
'Cause in my heart I know  
Love will lead you back, I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, where you belong  
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining  
One day you will find me again, it won't be long  
One of these days our love will lead you back  
Love will lead you back, someday I just know that  
Love will lead you back to my arms, it won't be long  
One of these days my love will lead you back  

Labis ang pag-ibig  
'Di mapigil ang damdamin  
Maging sa panaginip  
Sumasagi ka parati  
  
[Chorus:]  
At paano ba ito?  
Simula sa paggising  
Lagi kang naiisip  
Nahihirapan na nang ganito  
Sawa nang manahimik  
Kailan ba masasabi  
Na mahal  
Ooh, mahal kita?  
Oo, mahal  
Mahal na mahal kita  
Ngunit 'di mo pa ko pansin  
  
Sarili'y sinisisi  
Tuwing nariyan ka na't 'di ko masambit  
Ang pag-ibig na kinikimkim  
Lalo na ngayo't ika'y katabi  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
(Instrumental)  
  
(Final Chorus)  
At paano ba ito?  
Simula sa paggising  
Lagi kang naiisip  
Nahihirapan na nang ganito  
Sawa nang manahimik  
Kailan ba masasabi  
Na mahal  
Ooh, mahal kita?  
Oo, mahal  
Mahal na mahal kita  
Oh, mahal  
Mahal kita  
Oo, mahal  
Mahal na mahal kita  
Ngunit 'di mo pa ko pansin

Darlin' I want you to listen  
I stayed up all night so I can get this thing right  
And I don't think there's anything missin'  
Coz a person like you made it easy to do  
I've waited for so long  
To sing to you this song  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole  
  
I think the angels are your brothers, yeah  
They told about me, said "you're just what she needs"  
And I find myself thanking your mother  
For giving birth to a saint  
My spirit flies when I say your name  
If there's one thing that's true  
It's that I was born to love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole  
  
You make my dreams come true over and over again  
And I honestly truly believe  
That you and me are written in the stars  
I'd live my whole life through  
Just giving thanks to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole

On the phone, its 4am  
And I'm still talkin' to my friend  
Talkin' 'bout anything  
Just to hear his voice would bring  
Happiness, inside of me  
He has such a nice personality  
He tells me things that are good  
Makes me feel like how a woman should  
  
But I'm just not too sure  
If he's into me  
But I'm definitely feelin' him  
  
He's making me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're makin' me go crazy  
  
When he's near, I talk to him  
But he acts like we're not even friends  
I wonder why he acts this way  
There's just one thing  
Nothing else to say  
  
That's why I'm not too sure  
If he's into me  
But I'm definitely feelin' him  
  
He's making me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're making me go crazy...  
  
When we're alone at home  
Talkin' on the phone  
You're so nice to me  
And all this time, you got me questioning  
Are you leading me on, you're leading me on...  
  
You got me crazy  
Don't you know you're making me crazy  
Just one kiss from you would make  
Would make me so happy  
Would make me so complete, baby  
You're makin' me go crazy

Nasaan ka na?  
  
Bakit kaya minahal pa kita?  
Ngayo'y lumuluha't ako'y nag-iisa, oh  
Di natiis ika'y umibig sa iba  
Hindi pa ba sapat lahat ng aking nagawa?  
  
Refrain one:  
Hindi ko na nadarama mga yakap sa umaga  
  
Chorus:  
Nasan ka na, tunay bang mahal mo siyang katulad ko  
Na lagi ng nasasaktan  
Ang mabuti pa kaya upang malunasan na ang pagdurusa  
Ay limutin na kita  
Sakali ay humanap ng iba, oh  
  
Kahit kailan ay ikaw ang dahilan  
Upang mabuhay pa ako ng matagal  
Kung sadya ngang ganyan, ako'y iyong iiwan  
Ay kakayanin kong ika'y mapagbigyan  
  
Refrain two:  
Nagtatanong ang puso ko pati na rin ang isip  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Bridge:  
Di mapigil ang luha sa'king mga mata  
Ano pa bang magagawa?  
  
(repeat chorus higher)

Ala-ala nating dalawa  
Sa isip ko'y di mawala  
Tanda-tanda ko pa na buong puso,  
Minahal kita  
Bakit ba iniwan mong nag-iisa  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ngayon wala ka na  
Puso'y lumuluha't nagdurusa  
Ngayon nilisan na  
Sigaw ng puso ay mahal pa rin kita  
Bawat sandali sa piling mo  
Mga pangarap ko ay natupad  
Dahil sa iyo  
Ngunit ngayon, lahat ay naglaho  
Heto pa rin ako't sa'yo nagsusumamo  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Panahong walang humpay na saya  
Pagka't kapiling ka  
Ngunit di ko inakala na ako'y  
Iiwan mo  
Pa'no na ako ngayon wala ka na  
  
[Repeat chorus 2x]

Kapag sinabing magpakailanman  
Ito'y pangako hanggang kamatayan  
Hindi tumatapat ang pagmamahal  
Tumatamis, habang tumatagal  
  
Kapag sinabi mong walang hanggan  
Hindi lamang taon ang binibilang  
Ang tunay na pag-ibig ay 'yong dinggin  
Bumubulong sa ihip ng hangin  
  
Chorus:  
Pangako ko ngayon at kailanman  
Araw gabi ikaw ay hahagkan  
Magkulang man ang panahon hinding-hindi kita tatalikdan  
Now and forever ngayon at kailanman  
  
Ooh...  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Now and forever  
Ngayon at kailanman

A million times or more I thought about you  
The years, the tears, the laughter, things we used to do  
Are memories that warm me like a sunny day  
You touched my life in such a special way  
  
I miss the way you'd run your fingers through my hair  
Those crazy nights we cuddled in your easy chair  
Oh no, I won't let foolish pride turn you away  
I'll take you back whatever price I pay  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back home again  
  
Remember those romantic walks we used to take  
You held my hand in such a way my knees would shake  
You can't imagine just how much I've needed you  
I've never loved someone as I love you  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back  
  
Old friend  
This is where our happy ending begins  
Yes, I'm sure this time that we're gonna win  
Welcome back into my life again  
  
Yes, I've tried to live my life without you  
Knowing I had lost my closest friend  
And though I'm feeling low from time to time  
Knowing I will never find the kind of love I had when you were mine  
  
Old friend  
It's so nice to feel you hold me again  
No, it doesn't matter where you have been  
My heart welcomes you back  
  
Old friend  
This is where our happy ending begins  
Yes, I'm sure this time that we're gonna win  
Welcome back into my life again  
  
Again..

One day in your life  
You'll remember a place  
Someone touching your face  
You'll come back and you'll look around you...  
  
One day in your life  
You'll remember the love you found here  
You'll remember me somehow  
Though you don't need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
You'll remember one day...  
  
One day in your life  
When you find that you're always waiting  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name, and I'll be there  
  
You'll remember me somehow  
Though you don't need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
You'll remember one day...  
  
One day in your life  
When you find that you're always lonely  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name, and I'll be there

Some time ago I told you goodbye I don't know why  
This crazy feeling has driven me mad I made you cry  
I was such a fool to see you go  
I know our love was kind and true  
Baby I can trust this feeling in me now  
Some time ago the love we shared seemed everlasting  
I never had the chance to think this paradise would end  
I was such a fool to see you go  
I know our love was oh so true  
Now I think this feeling's back in me now  
If ever I say I love you baby  
Will you ever understand me  
I figured out a way this feeling  
For quite a while it's you I'm dreaming  
Whenever I think of you there's one thing I wish  
You're thinking of me too I guess  
I hope you understand why  
That's why I'm gonna give it one more try  
Some time ago the love we shared seemed everlasting  
I never had the chance to think this paradise would end  
I was such a fool to see you go  
I know our love was oh so true  
Now I think this feeling's back in me now  
If ever I say I love you baby  
Will you ever understand me  
I figured out a way this feeling  
For quite a while it's you I'm dreaming  
Whenever I think of you there's one thing I wish  
You're thinking of me too I guess  
I hope you understand why  
Oh why  
If ever I say I love you baby  
Will you ever understand me  
I figured out a way this feeling  
For quite a while it's you I'm dreaming  
When I think of you there's one thing I wish  
You're thinking of me too I guess  
I hope you understand why  
Now I'm gonna give it one more try  
One more try  
Hmm...

Sana maulit muli  
Ang mga oras nating nakaraan  
Bakit nagkaganito  
Naglaho na ba ang pag-ibig mo  
Sana maulit muli  
Sana bigyan ng pansin ang himig ko  
Kahapon, bukas, ngayon  
Tanging wala nang ibang mahal  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
Di na sana lalapit pa  
Kung kaya ko sana  
  
Ibalik ang kahapon  
Sandaling di mapapantayan  
Huwag sana nating itapon  
Pagmamal na tapat  
Kung ako'y nagkamali minsan  
Di na ba mapagbibigyan  
O giliw, dinggin mo ang nais ko  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
Di na sana lalapit pa  
Kung kaya ko sana  
  
[Bridge:]  
Kung kaya kong sana  
Ito ang tanging nais ko  
Ang ating kahapon sana maulit muli  
Kung ako'y nagkamali minsan  
Di na ba mapagbibigyan  
O giliw dinggin mo ang nais ko  
Ang nais ko  
  
[Chorus:]  
Kung kaya kong iwanan ka  
Di na sana aasa pa  
Kung kaya kong umiwas na  
Di na sana lalapit pa  
Kung kaya ko sana  
  
O giliw o giliw

Never thought I'd fall in love again  
To find the pieces of the puzzle  
Life cannot begin  
The search begins with knowing  
I need you  
Could not imagine in my dreams  
That you need me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
There was an empty void inside my heart  
I tried to fill the space with anything  
But left it in the dark  
Then a blessing came in the form of you  
Now I know that God has smiled on me too  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart  
I didn't know when it would come  
All I know is that I wanted someone  
To take me far away from my loneliness  
So I thank you, I thank you coming  
Into my life  
Someone to love  
All my dreams have come true  
Now that I've found you  
Someone to love  
Alone I feel no more  
Since you unlocked the door to my heart

This day when you left me  
I realized how much you mean to me  
This day when you said goodbye  
I never thought that I would cry  
Our faultless dream that we used to do (faultless dream that we used to do)  
Now shattered and filled with sorrow too  
  
We can never go back to that dream again  
'coz I know my heat  
It will soon end  
  
[Chorus:]  
How could it be  
That our love can't be saved  
How can I say  
My love for you will forever embrace  
It's too late  
It's too late  
Our promised love has gone to late...  
  
This night when you left me  
I realized how much you mean to me  
This night when you said goodbye  
I never thought that I would cry  
Our faultless dream that we used to do  
Now shattered and filled with sorrow too  
  
We can never go back to that dream again  
Coz I know my heart  
It will soon end  
  
(Repeat Chorus)

I look into your eyes, so far away  
There's trouble in your mind  
You're losing faith  
Hey now, let me hold you  
It'll be okay!  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Remember when you called  
And said goodbye  
We thought we'd lost it all  
And so did I  
Even if I lost you  
I would feel the same  
Coz I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Believe in me  
I'm here to stay  
I will love you  
Till they take my heart away.  
Now we're stronger than before  
We've made it throught  
I never felt more sure  
Because of you  
Hey now! are you listening?  
Do you hear me say  
"I will love you  
Till they take my heart away"  

Mula ng makilala ka  
Mata'y lagi ng hanap ka  
Kapag hindi ka matanaw  
Mundo'y parang magugunaw  
  
Sana'y wag nang matapos pa  
Ang tunay nating pagsinta  
Di maglalaho kailanman  
Ang nadarama sa 'yo  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sana'y malaman mo  
Pag ibig ko'y ikaw  
Palagi kang laman ng puso't isip ko  
Nag-iisang sigaw, ng damdaming ito  
Na ikaw lamang ang siyang mahal  
  
Walang iba, walang iba  
Ikaw lang at walang iba

I like what I see my friend  
All our moments and all of the time  
We spend  
The way that you make me feel  
When you know my heart wants  
Something  
I know we could last till the bitter end  
But only if we'll go hand in hand  
Cause I know how you make me feel  
And you know what it is, that something  
  
[Refrain:]  
It's so amazing baby  
Been loving you like crazy  
So I thank you for your heart  
And you should know  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you  
  
Forever and another day  
That's what people always say  
A promise too often broken  
But I know we will find a way  
  
Cause we've got something  
A lot of people search for their whole life for  
And it will never, never, never end  
Coz I just want you more and more  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you  
  
You make everyday to me  
Another dream come true  
I'm just so in love with you baby  
It's more than physical  
It's a spiritual thing  
When I'm with you  
My heart wants to sing  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
When I'm with you  
I don't feel lonely  
When I'm with you  
Heaven is right here in your arms  
When I'm with you, my one and only  
I'm in paradise, when I'm with you

It feels like a lifetime,  
A thousand days have passed by  
Since I held you close to me  
If I could see that smile from my friend  
I know that I could live again  
I need you here with me  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven knows what to say  
Even though for right now  
You're so far away  
I hope and I pray  
Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay  
Girl, lately  
My sun doesn't shine without you  
Never noticed  
What it feels like to be without you  
Feels like I took my last step  
And my last breath and my life ended  
Had to say just what I was feeling, girl  
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,  
Sun doesn't shine without you  
  
This is more for me than for you  
Girl, I finally see there's no substitute  
For what we have  
Do you know how much I love you'  
And what we've shared  
I can't forget  
Girl, a love like yours  
I'll never let just slip away  
Just promise me that you'll stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever seen a flower that never blooms  
See a starless night without the moon  
Well that's me without you  
So come back and turn my night into day  
'Cause lately,  
My sun doesn't shine without you  
  
'Cause my sun doesn't shine,  
Sun doesn't shine without  
You
