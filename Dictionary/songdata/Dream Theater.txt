I can remember when,  
In the unity of our five-day sessions  
Not even once did we hear the siren song  
What kind of imagination  
Asleep in some lyrical coma  
Who's vain futile memory  
Could have been so wrong?  
  
You can make a fortune in lies  
You can keep a giant alive  
You can ride the red  
Until everybody smiles  
  
A trifling euphoria  
Was such an untimely religion  
Maybe your life can explain  
The reason for my indecision  
Here is a poor man  
The heart of this monster creation  
He said we both will be heroes  
And I was led into temptation  
  
You can make a fortune in lies  
You can keep a giant alive  
You can ride the red  
Until everybody smiles  
  
Can you show me your gold and your silver?  
A hero in frozen water  
  
"For the first time in a long time  
Everything was right in my world  
And then I woke up"  
  
Now you've made a fortune in lies  
And you kept a giant alive  
You rode the red  
You rode the red

She can't stop pacing, she never felt so alive  
Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive  
It takes a village, this she knows is true  
They're expecting her and she's got work to do  
  
He helplessly stands by  
It's meaningless to try  
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes  
He says, I've never seen her get this bad  
  
Even though she seems so high  
He knows that she can't fly  
And when she falls out of the sky  
He'll be standing by  
  
She was raised in a small Midwestern town  
By a charming and eccentric loving father  
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl  
And everyone thought highly of her  
  
And she tried everyday  
With endless drive to make the grade  
Then one day she woke up to find  
The perfect girl had lost her mind  
  
Once barely taking a break, now she sleeps the days away  
She helplessly stands by, it's meaningless to try  
And all she wants to do is cry  
No one ever knew she was so sad  
  
'Cause even though she gets so high  
And thinks that she can fly, she will fall out of the sky  
But in the face of misery, she found hopefulness  
Feeling better, she had weathered this depression  
  
Much to her advantage  
She resumed her frantic pace  
Boundless power, midnight hour  
She enjoyed the race

I touched with one  
Who made me run  
Away from my own soul  
In this world with its  
Many illusions  
We are moving like mice through a  
Maze  
  
And now I find  
What's left behind  
Has served to make me whole  
Full of doubt, deception, and delusion  
Seeking purpose to all earthly days  
  
I search within  
Beneath a skin  
That bears both pleasure and pain  
In a world full of constant confusion  
I will not be a par to the craze  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright?  
Will cold be warm?  
Will the day have no night?  
In the Afterlife?  
Will the blind have sight?  
In the Afterlife  
  
Behind closed eyes  
Some comfort lies  
In knowing the truth never spoken  
Through this world with us  
Hidden conclusion  
We'll keep moving like mice through  
A maze  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright?  
Will cold be warm?  
Will the day have no night?  
In the Afterlife?  
Will the blind have sight?  
In the Afterlife  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright?  
Will cold be warm?  
Will the day have no night?  
In the Afterlife?  
Will the blind have sight?  
In the Afterlife

Is there ever really a right time  
You had led me to believe  
Someday you'd be there for me  
When the stars above align  
When you weren't so consumed  
I kept looking for the clues  
So I waited in the shadows of my heart  
And still the time was never right  
  
Until one day I stopped caring  
And began to forget why I longed to be so close  
And I disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turned to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
  
A shell of what things could have been  
Tired bones beneath the veil  
Of guarded secrets all too frail  
Sad to think I never knew  
You were searching for the words  
For the moment to emerge  
Yet the moment never came  
You couldn't risk my fragile frame  
  
Until one day you stopped caring  
And began to forget why you tried to be so close  
And you disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turn to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
  
I would scream just to be heard  
As if yelling at the stars  
I was bleeding just to feel  
You would never say a word  
Kept me reaching in the dark  
Always something to conceal  
  
Until one day I stopped scaring  
And began to forget why I longed to be so close  
And I disappeared into the darkness  
And the darkness turned to pain and never went away  
Until all that remained was buried deep beneath the surface  
Beneath the surface

Headline: "murder, young girl killed  
Desperate shooting at echo's hill  
Dreadful ending, killer died  
Evidently suicide."  
  
A witness heard a horrifying sound  
He ran to find a woman dead and  
Lying on the ground  
  
Standing by her was a man  
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand  
Witness says he tried to help  
But he'd turned the weapon on himself  
  
His body fell across that poor young girl  
After shouting out in vain  
The witness ran to call for assistance  
A sad close to a broken love affair  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
She wanted love forever  
But he had another plan  
He fell into an evil way  
She had to let him down  
She said, "I can't love a wayward man."  
  
She may have found a reason to forgive  
If he had only tried to change  
Was their fatal meeting prearranged  
  
Had a violent struggle taken place  
There was every sign that lead there  
Witness found a switchblade on the ground  
Was the victim unaware  
They continued to investigate  
They found a note in the killer's pocket  
It could have been a suicide letter  
Maybe he had lost her love  
  
I feel there's only one thing left to do  
I'd sooner take my life away  
Than live with losing you  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
All that we learn this time  
(what we have been is what we are)  
Is carried beyond this life

Blackness awakens, visions come alive.  
Seeing through darkness with borrowed eyes.  
  
Death survivor, take me higher,  
Reunite my soul.  
Whisperer of truth, I trust in you  
To make me whole.  
  
Sun, come shine my way,  
Make healing waters bury all my pain.  
Wind, carry me home,  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart.  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again.  
  
Feeling myself slip away,  
Silently dreaming awake,  
Hidden memories flooding back.  
I will not grow in the light  
Until I pass through the darkest caverns  
Of my heart.  
  
Dance with fire, spirit guide  
Erase the world outside.  
Messenger of truth, I trust in you,  
Transform me now.  
  
Sun, come shine my way,  
Make healing waters bury all my pain.  
Wind, carry me home,  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart.  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again.  
And at last the time has come  
To unite again as one,  
To the power of the earth I'm calling.  
Crossing bridges in the sky  
On a journey to renew my life.  
Shaman, take my hand!  
  
Sun, come shine my way,  
Make healing waters bury all my pain.  
Wind, carry me home,

And at last the time has come  
To unite again as one,  
To the power of the earth I'm calling.  
Crossing bridges in the sky  
On a journey to renew my life.  
Shaman, take my hand!

Today, I will be a savior,  
Tomorrow a demon.  
You crave my erratic behavior  
And watch my every move.  
  
Obsession at all costs,  
You'll be the death of me.  
Broken and torn apart,  
Why can't you let me be?  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
I'm your guilty addiction.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
  
Today, a savior,  
Tonight, I am the new messiah you deify.  
When I'm no longer desired,  
I'll be crucified.  
  
The one who's free from sin,  
The first to cast the stone.  
Fighting the fear within,  
I won't be left alone.  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
The price I pay to live this way,  
And the fantasy stays alive.  
I can't live up, I can't let down  
And leave you falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
I'm your morning obsession.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
  
(I will be your savior)  
  
You build me up, you break me down  
Until I'm falling to pieces.  
The price I pay to live this way,  
And the fantasy stays alive.  
I can't live up, I can't let down  
And leave you falling to pieces.  
I crash and burn, I never learn,  
Your iconic fixation.  
Build me up!  
Break me down!  
Build me up!  
Break me down!

A thorn in my side  
A chip on my shoulder  
A lump in my throat  
The size of a boulder  
The chill up my spine  
Can't get any colder  
And you wonder why I can't smile  
  
A knot in my gut  
An ape on my back  
In the heat of the moment  
I'm knocked off the track  
You drop the ball  
I pick up the slack  
And you ask me why my hair's gray  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning  
The pressure keeps on  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
  
I say it's green  
And then you tell me it's red  
Keep your thoughts and ideas  
Locked inside of your head  
We've got someone  
Who can think for you instead  
And he sounds just like the last one  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning  
The pressure keeps on  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul (burning my soul)  
Burning my soul  
  
  
Responsible thinkers  
Throw caution to the wind  
But I find myself  
Speaking from within  
I can't live my life  
Walking on eggshells  
To stay on your good side  
  
Using your words  
Controlling my life  
Can't you see it's my words  
That gives you your life  
So I hurt your feelings  
Well I'm really sorry  
But I don't give a shit, no  
  
Twisting, turning  
Losing all sense of yearning  
Living and learning  
The pressure keeps on  
Burning my soul (burning my soul) [Repeat: x7]

I'll always remember  
The chill of November  
The news of the fall  
The sounds in the hall  
The clock on the wall ticking away  
"Seize the Day"  
I heard him say  
Life will not always be this way  
Look around  
Hear the sounds  
Cherish your life while you're still around  
We can learn from the past  
But those days are gone  
We can hope for the future  
But there might not be one  
The words stuck in my mind  
alive from what I've heard  
I have to seize the day  
To home I returned  
Preparing for her fight  
I held with all my might  
Fearing my deepest fright  
She walked in to the night  
She turned for one last look  
She looked me in the eye  
I said, "I Love You...Good-bye"

Silence disguised  
I watch you  
Show me the hurt  
That haunts you  
Would you despise the thrill  
If all you hide were mine?  
  
I can't hold on any longer  
These feelings keep growing stronger  
Echoes that deafen the mind  
will bury my voice in their wake  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
I've seen the path  
the one you take  
shows the truth  
for you to make  
This turn of phrase  
we might not see  
is the thirst of desire  
found so easily  
  
Try to push me 'round  
the world some more  
And make me live in fear  
I bare all that I am  
made of now  
Attractive I don't care  
'Cause even when I danced with life  
no one was there to share  
  
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?  
Does this voice the wounds of your soul?  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
Tried to live the life  
you live and saw  
It doesn't work for me  
I bare all that I am  
made of now  
Attractive, I can't be  
Inside the Dance of Life is one  
I'll never hold to me  
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.  
You can't heal the wounds of my soul.  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
Caught in a Web  
Refused by the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning a cage  
Denied and misread

Tunnel vision at blinding speed  
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me  
Void of any uncertainty  
Throughout my very soul  
  
Lost illusions of my control  
Resisting all hope of letting go  
Racing impulse of dark desire  
Drives me through the night  
  
I try to shut it down  
It leaves me in the dust  
No matter what I've found  
I can never get enough  
  
Frantic actions of insanity  
Impulsive laced profanity  
Long for elusive serenity  
Way out of my control  
  
[Chorus:]  
Traveling through both space and time  
(Out of body, out of mind)  
Out of control, my wheels in constant motion  
Spinning round and round it goes  
(I can't let up, I can't let go)  
Can't stop this flame from burning  
Forever more, into the night, blistering  
  
Focus here, focus there  
Cannot see the light  
(Falling down through the night)  
Sprawling everywhere  
Searching left, searching right  
(Panic setting in, I can no longer fight)  
When will this end?  
Accelerate, dislocate  
(Set to crash and burn, haven't got time to waste)  
Not planning to return  
Aggravate, agitate  
(When will I ever learn?)  
There's no way out of here  
Nowhere to turn  
  
Obsessive yearning  
Compulsive burning  
Still never learning  
Insane random thoughts of neat disorder  
  
Scattered wasteland surrounding me  
Tattered memories of what used to be  
Apocalyptic mind debris  
Until we meet again  
(Uh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Traveling through both space and time  
(Out of body, out of mind)  
Out of control, my wheels in constant motion  
Spinning round and round it goes  
(I can't let up, I can't let go)  
Can't stop this flame from burning  
Can't stop the wheels from turning  
  
[Chorus]

Several years ago  
In a foreign town  
Far away from home  
I met the Count of Tuscany  
  
A young eccentric man  
Bred from royal blood  
Took me for a ride  
Across the open countryside  
  
Get into my car  
Let's go for drive  
I love the way I feel uptight  
Just step inside  
  
Maybe you'll recall  
I kind of felt curious  
A character inspired by my brother's life  
  
Winding through the hills  
Seeing far behind  
On and on we drove  
Down narrow streets and dusty roads  
  
And last we came upon  
A picturesque estate  
On sprawling emerald hills  
An ancient world of times gone by  
  
Now let me introduce  
My brother  
A bitter gentleman - historian  
Sucking on his pipe  
Distinguished accent  
Making me uptight - no accident  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right  
  
I  
I don't wanna die  
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Would you like to see  
Our secret holy place?  
I come here late at night  
To pray to him by candle light  
  
Then viewing through the past  
I saw which is believed  
Still dressed in royal clothes  
A saint behind the altar  
  
History recalls  
During times of war  
Legend has been traced  
Stuck inside these castle walls  
  
Soldiers came to hide  
With barrels filled with wine  
Never to escape  
These tombs of old that's where they died  
  
Down the cellar stairs  
I disappear  
Like the angel's share  
The end is near  
  
Come and have a taste  
A rare vintage  
All the finest wines  
Improve with age  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right  
  
I  
I don't wanna die  
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Could this be the end?  
Is this the way I die?  
Sitting here alone  
No one by my side  
  
I don't understand  
I don't feel that I deserve this  
What did I do wrong?  
I just don't understand  
  
Give me one more chance  
Let me please explain  
It's all been circumstance  
I'll tell you once again  
  
It took me for a ride  
Promising a vast adventure  
Next thing that I know  
I'm frightened for my life  
  
Now wait a minute then  
That's not how it is  
You must be confused  
That isn't who I am  
  
Please don't be afraid  
I would never try to hurt you  
This is how we live  
Strange although it seems  
Please try to forgive  
  
The chapel and the Sade  
The soldiers in the wine  
The fables and the tales  
All handed down through time  
  
Of course you're free to go  
Go and tell the world my story  
Tell about my brother  
Tell them about me  
The Count of Tuscany

Cold  
Lying in my bed  
Staring into darkness  
  
Lost  
I hear footsteps overhead  
And my thoughts return  
Again  
  
Like a child who's run away  
And won't be coming back  
Time keeps passing by  
As night turns into day  
  
I'm so far away  
And so alone  
I need to see your face  
To keep me sane  
To make we whole  
  
Try to stay alive  
Until I hear your voice  
I'm gonna lose my mind  
Someone tell me why  
I chose this life  
This superficial lie  
Constant compromise  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Pain  
It saddens me to know  
The helplessness you feel  
Your light  
Shines on my soul  
While a thousand candles  
Burn  
  
Outside this barren room  
The rain is pouring down  
The emptiness inside  
Is growing deeper still  
  
You're so far away  
And so alone  
You long for love's embrace  
To keep you sane  
To make you whole  
  
Try to stay alive  
Until I hear your voice  
I'm gonna lose my mind  
  
Someone tell me why  
I chose this life  
This superficial lie  
Constant compromise  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Over the distance  
We try to make sense  
Of surviving together  
While living apart  
  
Striving for balance  
We rise to the challenge  
Of staying connected  
In spite of circumstance  
  
All you've forsaken  
And all that you've done  
So that I could live out  
This undying dream  
  
Won't be forgotten  
Or taken for granted  
I'll always remember  
Your endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice  
  
Moments wasted  
Isolated  
Time escaping  
Endless sacrifice

No one truly has the answers  
Every day I struggle through it once more  
Keep things bottled up, never speaking my mind  
Misinterpreted, I'm doing just fine  
  
Every day I put a brave face on, serves me well  
Feeling helpless, facing it alone, hard to tell  
That I can change who I am, how I feel, there's no end  
  
I have done what you asked of me  
Leaves me nothing to live for  
  
Coming undone, way too high a price I should pay  
You keep your pride while I die inside every day  
No I can't lie anymore, won't pretend I've done all I can  
  
You can't imagine the hell I'm going through  
Not asking you to save me  
I'm too far from heaven  
  
Nothing you can do to change me  
But accept me as I am

"You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light.  
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime.  
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness
remembering all you have learned.  
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present,  
feeling peaceful and refreshed.  
Open your eyes, Nicholas."  
  
Friday evening  
The blood still on my hands  
To think that she would leave me now  
For that ungrateful man  
  
Sole survivor  
No witness to the crime  
I must act fast to cover up  
I think that there's still time  
  
He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note  
They'll buy into the words that I wrote  
  
"This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
I'd take my own life before losing you"  
  
Feeling good this Friday afternoon  
I ran into Julian  
Said we'd get together soon  
  
He's always had my heart  
He needs to know  
I'll break free of the Miracle  
It's time for him to go  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
He'd kill his brother if he only knew  
  
Their love renewed  
They'd rendezvous  
In a pathway out of view  
They thought no one knew  
Then came a shot out of the night  
  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
We fade away  
  
As their bodies lie still  
And the ending draws near  
Spirits rise through the air  
All their fears disappear, it all becomes clear  
A blinding light comes into view  
An old soul exchanged for a new  
A familiar voice comes shining through  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life, I'm finally free  
No longer torn in two  
I learned about my life by living through you  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life, I'm finally free  
No longer torn in two  
Living my own life by learning from you  
  
We'll meet again my friend someday soon

"Open your eyes, Nicholas."  
  
"AAAH!"

For a while I thought I fell asleep  
Lying motionless inside a dream  
  
Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me  
She softly whispered in my ear (forsaken)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Forsaken  
I have come for you tonight  
Awaken  
Look in my eyes and take my hand  
Give yourself up to me  
  
I waited faithfully for night to fall again  
Trying to silence the fear within me  
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss  
And saw a crimson sting on her lips  
  
I have to know your name  
Where have I seen your face before?  
My dear, why don't you be afraid?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me far away  
Close your eyes and hold your breath  
Till the ends of the earth  
  
Forsaken  
I have come for you tonight  
Awaken  
Look in my eyes and take my hand  
Forsaken  
Fly away with me tonight  
Awaken  
Renew my life  
Now you are mine  
Give yourself up to me

Goodnight kiss in your nightgown  
Lavender in your bed  
So innocent as you lie down  
Sweet dreams that run through your head  
  
Are you lonely without Mommy's love?  
I want you to know I'd die for that moment  
You're just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all  
  
It's been 5 years to the day and  
My tainted blood's still the same  
I can't help acting this way and  
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay  
  
I'm so lonely without baby's love  
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment  
I'm just a poor girl  
Afraid of this cruel world  
Taken away from it all

He's just the kind of man  
You hear about  
Who leaves his family for  
An easy out  
They never saw the signs  
He never said a word  
He couldn't take another day  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your head disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years  
  
She's not the kind of girl  
You hear about  
She'll never want another  
She'll never be without  
She'll give you all the signs  
She'll tell you everything  
Then turn around and walk away  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your heads disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years  
  
Carry me to the shoreline  
Bury me in the sand  
Walk me across the water  
And maybe you'll understand  
  
Once the stone  
You're crawling under  
Is lifted off your shoulders  
Once the cloud that's raining  
Over your heads disappears  
The noise that you'll hear  
Is the crashing down of hollow years

There's a story in your eyes  
I can see the hurt behind your smile  
For every sign I recognize  
Another one escapes me  
  
Let me know what plagues your mind  
Let me be the one to know you best  
Be the one to hold you up  
When you feel like you're sinking  
  
Tell me once again  
What's beneath the pain you're feeling  
Don't abandon me  
Or think you can't be saved  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you  
  
Summon up your ghost for me  
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands  
Step inside this sacred place  
When all your dreams seem broken  
  
Resonate inside this temple  
Let me be the one who understands  
Be the one to carry you  
When you can walk no further  
  
Tell me once again  
What's below the surface bleeding  
If you've lost your way  
I will take you in  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you  
  
Oh, when everything is wrong  
Oh, when hopelessness surrounds you  
Oh, the sun will rise again  
The time you swim against will carry you back home  
So don't give up  
Don't give in  
  
I walk beside you  
Wherever you are  
Whatever it takes  
No matter how far  
Through all that may come  
And all that may go  
I walk beside you  
I walk beside you

Welcome tired pilgrim  
Into the circle  
We have been waiting  
Everyone's gathered for your arrival  
All the believers  
  
Angels fall, all for you, heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
  
I've been waiting for you,  
Weary preacher man  
You have been expected  
Now we can begin  
Let this hollow day of judgment break  
I have known you father,  
And your sacred quest  
Blessed soldier fighting  
You shall never rest  
I have known you, but do you know me?  
  
Angels fall, all for you, heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
(My soul is yours dark master, I will fight for you)  
Dark master within, I will fight for you  
Dark master of sin, now my soul is yours  
Dark master, my guide, I will die for you  
Dark master inside...  
  
I cannot see his face  
But I could feel despite  
A presence from the dead  
Abandoned by the light  
His shadow will consume me from within  
This power that I sense  
Been raged behind those eyes  
This justice straddling ghost  
A spirit deep inside  
The body and the soul both frets  
For they are one  
  
Angels fall, all for you, heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
(My soul is yours dark master, I will fight for you)  
Dark master within, I will fight for you  
Dark master of sin, now my soul is yours  
Dark master, my guide, I will die for you  
Dark master inside...  
Dark master, I'm in, I belong to you  
Dark master within...  
  
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!  
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!  
  
Don't  
Bother trying to find them  
They will be coming to you  
Fight,  
Fight and destroy until you can't take anymore  
Spill,  
Hey! Spill the blood of rebels  
They are the terror of hell  
Flesh,  
I'm being dead  
Stopping at nothing to kill  
Saint,  
Caught in a moment of weakness  
Ended the greatness of all  
Sold,  
Half of my soul  
And now I'm still waiting for you  
  
I judge us, my eyes see  
I judge and I am just  
For I speak of the beast  
That lives in all of us  
Unwelcome ones your time has come  
  
Lord,  
You are my god and my shepherd  
Nothing more shall I want  
War,  
Through the abyss  
Into the shadow of death  
  
Fear,  
There is no reason to fear now  
While you are with me  
My,  
Cup overflows  
Of my enemy's blood  
I,  
Get in the house of the lord  
Forever, amen  
Death,  
Follow me  
Oh, the wish of my life  
  
I judge us, my eyes see  
I judge and I am just  
For I speak of the beast  
That lives in all of us  
Unwelcome one your time has come  
  
Servants of the fallen  
Fight to pave the way  
For the savior's calling  
On this wicked day  
Through a veil of madness  
With a vicious play  
One man rises up  
Standing in the way  
(It's time to go, dark lord)  
  
My soul grows weaker  
He knows and he waits  
He watches over me  
Standing at the inferno gates  
In the hour of darkness  
The moment I feared has passed  
The moment I lost my faith  
Promising salvation  
My soul is my own now  
I do not fight for you, dark master

How can this be?  
Why is he the chosen one?  
Saint gone astray,  
With a scepter and a gun.  
Learn to believe  
In the mighty and the strong.  
Come bleed the beast  
Follow me it won't be long.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Straight is the path,  
Leading to your salvation.  
Slaying the weak,  
Ethnic elimination.  
Any day,  
We'll all be  
Swept away.  
You'll be saved  
As long as  
You obey  
Lies,  
Tools of the devil  
Inside,  
Written in Holy  
Disguise.  
Meant to deceive and  
Divide us all.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Blurring the lines  
Between virtue and sin,  
They can't tell  
Where God ends,  
And mankind begins.  
  
They know no other  
Life but this.  
From the cradle  
They are claimed.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Hundreds of believers,  
Lured into a doomsday cult.  
All would perish  
In the name of God.  
  
Self-proclaimed messiah,  
Led his servants  
To their death.  
Eighty murdered  
In the name of God.  
  
Forty sons and daughters,  
Unconsenting plural wives,  
Perversions  
In the name of God.  
  
Underground religion,  
Turning toward  
The mainstream light,  
Blind devotion  
In the name of God.  
  
Justifying violence,  
Citing from the Holy Book,  
Teaching hatred  
In the name of God.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Religious beliefs,  
Fanatic obsession,  
Does following faith  
Lead us to violence?  
  
Unyielding crusade,  
Divine revelation,  
Does following faith  
Lead us to violence?

Animation  
Breathes a cloudless mind  
Fascination  
Leaves the doubting blind  
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead  
The faithful live Awake  
The rest remain misled  
  
Some will transcend spinning years  
One as if time disappears  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Trinity jaded  
I break down walls to find you  
  
Callow and vain  
Fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain  
Passionless stage  
Distant like brothers  
Wearing apathetic displays  
Sharing flesh like envy in cages  
Condescending  
Not intending to end  
  
Some will transcend spinning years  
One as if time disappears  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Trinity jaded  
I break down walls to find you  
  
Beginnings get complicated  
The farther we progress  
Opinions are calculated  
Immune to openness  
  
Beyond the circle's edge  
We're driven by her blessings  
Forever hesitating  
Caught beneath the wheel  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Cynically jaded  
The child will crawl to find you

Look in the mirror  
Does it look familiar  
Cannot put my finger  
Why he kinda looks like me  
  
Used to like hooking up with you  
After waking first thing I'd do  
One sided sensation  
Watching me watching you  
  
Now I'm stuck how I feel  
I don't know if it's real  
I'm trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
Now I'm stuck in the middle  
My life is the riddle  
Trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't know why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Just wants to be left there  
  
Living a constant lie  
How much longer  
I'd rather die  
So bitter  
Tongue twisted  
Has me paralyzed  
  
They claim they know me  
Who I'm supposed to be  
A quick fix sure remedy  
Another needly plunges deep  
  
Now I'm stuck how I feel  
I don't know if it's real  
I'm trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
Now I'm stuck in the middle  
My life is the riddle  
Trying to find someone  
Who's invisible  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't know why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Just wants to be left right there  
  
No way  
I cannot lie  
I haven't felt right  
And I don't care why  
Drowning  
No coming up for air  
And part of me  
Wants to be left right there  
  
No way  
No way  
No way  
No way out  
No way  
No way  
No way  
No way out

Open your eyes  
And turn off your mind  
Step right up folks  
And you will find  
A growing trend  
An epidemic  
Spread with zen  
And hypodermics yeah  
Yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines take care of you  
Until you kill yourself and then  
The sales go through the roof  
Calculated, formulated  
Feed my head with simple thoughts  
And let me breathe instead of being taught  
All bottled up and tearing at the seams  
I'm bored, just let me breathe  
  
A daily dose of eMpTyV  
Will flush your mind right down the drain  
Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain  
Make yourself a household name yeah  
Yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines take care of you  
Until you kill yourself  
And then the sales go through the roof  
Calculated, formulated  
Feed my head with simple thoughts  
And let me breathe instead of being taught  
All bottled up and tearing at the seams  
I'm bored, just let me breathe  
  
Strike up your best angst ridden posture, whoa  
Manufactured anger  
Let's not forget my legacy  
All my heroes have failed me  
Now they're dead and buried yeah  
  
Just close your mind  
You can find all you need with your eyes  
  
The big machines  
Will take care of you  
Until the fashion fades  
And the checks go through  
My bankroll's red  
And my face is blue  
And still they'll turn their backs on you  
For someone new  
Feed my head  
With some real thoughts  
And let me think instead  
Of being taught  
I'll say things  
You won't believe  
Just stand back  
Just let me breathe

There was no time for pain  
No energy for anger  
The sightlessness of hatred slips away  
Walking through winter streets alone  
He stops and takes a breath  
With confidence and self-control  
  
I look at the world and see no understanding  
I'm waiting to find some sense of strength  
I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart  
To show me understanding  
  
I need to live life  
Like some people never will  
So find me kindness  
Find me beauty  
Find me truth  
When temptation brings me to my knees  
And I lay here drained of strength  
Show me kindness  
Show me beauty  
Show me truth  
  
The way your heart sounds  
Makes all the difference  
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel  
The way your heart beats  
Makes all the difference  
In learning to live  
  
Here before me is my soul  
I'm learning to live  
I won't give up till I've no more to give  
No more to give  
  
Listening to the city  
Whispering its violence  
I set out watching from above  
The 90's bring new questions  
New solutions to be found  
I fell in love to be let down  
  
Once again we dance in the crowd  
At times a step away  
From a common fear that's all spread out  
It won't listen to what you say  
Once you're touched you stand alone  
To face the bitter fight  
Once I reached for love  
And now I reach for life  
  
Another chance to lift my life  
Free the sensation in my heart  
To ride the wings of dreams  
Into changing horizons  
It brings inner peace within my mind  
As I'm lifted from where I spilt my life  
I hear an innocent voice  
I hear kindness, beauty and truth  
  
  
The way your heart sounds  
Makes all the difference  
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel  
The way your heart beats  
Makes all the difference  
In learning to live  
  
Spread before you is your soul  
So forever hold the dreams within our hearts  
Through nature's inflexible grace  
I'm learning to live

Daybreak  
At the bottom of lake  
It's a hundred degrees a I can't breath  
And I won't get out  
'til I figure it out  
Thought I'm weak like I can't believe  
So you tell me "trust me" I can trust you  
Just let me show you  
But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt  
Cause I don't know if I know you  
  
Doing fine, but don't waste me time  
Tell me what it is you want to say  
You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry  
I've been out in the rain all day  
So you tell me "trust you" I can trust you  
As far as I can throw you  
And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt  
'cause I don't know if I know you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't tell me you wanted me  
Don't tell me you thought of me  
I won't, I swear I won't  
(did)  
I'll try, I swear I'll try  
(lie)  
  
Mother Mary quite contrary  
Kiss the boys and make them wary  
Things are getting just a little bit scary  
It's a wonder I can still breath  
Never been much of a doubting thomas  
But nothing breaks like a broken promise  
You tell me 'bout your two more coming  
But once is just enough for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed  
She comes in apparently to fill the void  
All dogs need a leash and  
At least I'll forget it  
And she would never hurt me though she's never said it  
But I'm not gonna ask her today  
I don't want to scare her away  
Oh, Your, town, I'm all alone  
And I, just can't, stare at the phone  
I want to talk about lifelong mistakes  
And you can tell your stepfather I said so  
  
[Chorus]

He seems alone and silent  
Thoughts remain without an answer  
Afraid and uninvited  
He slowly drifts away  
  
Moved by desire and fear  
Breaking delicate wings  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
As the rain is pouring down  
Tears of sorrow wash his mind  
Drifting with the current  
This stream of life flows on  
  
He seems alone and silent  
Waiting on his hands and knees  
The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly  
  
Moved by desire and fear  
He takes a few steps away  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
And she listens openly  
  
He pours his soul into the water  
Reflecting the mystery  
She carries him away  
And the winds die slowly  
  
And she listens openly  
And she listens openly  
  
Lifting shadows  
Off a Dream once broken  
She can turn a drop of water  
Into an ocean  
  
Lifting Shadows off a Dream  
Lifting Shadows off a Dream

Would you like to sit and talk to me  
About the way things change so  
Suddenly  
When your senses come and the feeling  
Goes?  
Can you remember feeling much  
Too close?  
  
Stop your hands from shaking.  
Look at me.  
Are your senses racing endlessly  
Tracing  
Past impressions? So were mine.  
Have you ever been used  
Or will this be the first time?  
  
It's come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
It's a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
I've tried to wash from memory  
Feelings of betrayal and the incidents  
That plague me since I lost my sense  
Of innocence  
  
A history of changes now I'm loving  
Now I'm losing keeps me constantly  
In fear of hearing "I can't see where  
This is going"  
  
You lie alone with the memory  
Feeling the ceiling and walls closing  
In on  
Your Conscience - my ally  
The guilt - your affliction  
From preying on praise as you fed  
An attention addiction  
  
Someone told me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
And when it's lust to dust you can  
Crawl from the wreckage  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Lying bleeding in the dark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
It's come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain, no pain  
It's a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart

Sometimes  
For a moment of bliss  
In the passion  
We're craving  
There's a message we miss  
  
Sometimes when  
The spirit's left alone  
We must believe in something  
To find if we've grown  
  
Tragic reflex  
Shattered calm  
Static progress  
Senses gone  
Numb awareness  
Final psalm  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with the tide)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes in my hands)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns  
At my side ye ye yeah)  
Drawing lines in the sand  
  
Sometimes  
If you're perfectly still  
You can hear the virgin weeping  
For the savior of your will  
  
Sometimes  
Your castles in the air  
And the fantasies you're seeking  
Are the crosses you bear  
  
Sacred conflict  
Blessed prize  
Weeping crosses  
Stainless eyes  
Desperate addict  
Faith disguised  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with the tide)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes in my hands yeah)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns at my side)  
Drawing lines in the sand  
  
We fabricate our demons  
Invite them into our homes  
Have supper with the aliens  
And fight the war alone  
We conjure up our skeletons  
Enlist the den of thieves  
Frightened from our closets  
Then sewn upon our sleeves  
  
In the stream of consciousness  
There is a river crying  
Living comes much easier  
Once we admit  
We're dying  
  
Sometimes  
In the wreckage of our wake  
There's a bitterness we harbor  
And hate for hatred's sake  
  
Sometimes  
We dig an early grave  
And crucify our instincts  
For the hope we couldn't save  
  
Sometimes  
A view from sinless eyes  
Centers our perspective  
And pacifies our cries  
  
Sometimes  
The anguish we survive  
And the mysteries we nurture  
Are the fabrics of our lives  
  
Swept away with the tide  
(Swept away with tide yeeah)  
Through the holes in my hands  
(Through the holes  
Holes in my hands)  
Crown of thorns at my side  
(Crown of thorns at my side yeah)  
Drawing lines in the sand

I am not immortal  
I am just a man  
A power-craving tyrant  
Beyond the shadows in the sand  
  
Men have come to fear me  
Many bow and cry  
Known across the desert  
I am the one who will not die  
  
I have faced the demons of our most desperate moments  
I have been the one to defend our pride  
I have worn the banner of my abandoned brothers  
I will be the first one to give my life  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Spirit as black as coal  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul  
  
An epic novel no one's read  
Pages torn and faded  
The greatest story never told  
  
Behold the kingdom I possess  
Land of wealth and beauty  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
  
Once fearless and brave  
A realm passed away  
The ghosts of yesterday  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Spirit as black as coal  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Brutal and heartless  
Vanishing further  
Into the darkness  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul

The smile of dawn arrived early May  
She carried a gift from her home  
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear  
And of sorrow and pain  
She'll never outgrow  
Death is the first dance, eternal  
  
There's no more freedom  
The both of you will be  
Confined to this mind  
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try  
I was told there's a new love  
That's born for each one that has died  
I was told there'd be no one to  
Call on when I feel alone and afraid  
I was told if you dream of the next world  
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire  
  
As a child, I thought I could  
Live without pain without sorrow  
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me  
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid  
  
Somewhere like a scene from a memory  
There's a picture worth a thousand words  
Eluding stares from faces before me  
It hides away and will never be heard of again  
Deceit is the second without end  
  
The city's cold blood teaches us to survive  
Just keep your heart in my eyes and we'll stay alive  
The third arrives  
  
Before the leaves have fallen  
Before we lock the doors  
There must be the third and last dance  
This one will last forever  
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles  
She's taken you to your home  
  
It can only take a place  
When the struggle between  
Our children has ended  
Now the miracle and the  
Sleeper know that the third is love  
Love is the dance of Eternity

Waiting  
In the calm of desolation  
Wanting to break  
From this circle of confusion  
  
Sleeping  
In the depths of isolation  
Trying to wake  
From this daydream of illusion  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood  
  
It challenges the essence of my soul  
And leaves me in a state of disconnection  
As I navigate the maze of self control  
  
Playing a lion being led to a cage  
I turn from a thief to a beggar  
From a god to God save me  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood  
  
Playing a lion being led to a cage  
I turn from surreal to seclusion  
From love to disdain  
From belief to delusion  
From a thief to a beggar  
From a god to God save me  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood

Cut myself open wide  
Breach inside  
Help yourself  
To all I have to give  
And then you help yourself again  
And then complain  
That you didn't like the way  
I put the knife in wrong  
You didn't like the way  
My blood spilled on your brand new floor  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough  
  
Sacrifice my life  
Neglect my kids and wife  
All for you to be happy  
All those sleepness nights  
And countless fights to give you more  
And then you say how dare that  
I didn't write you back  
I must be too good for you  
I only care about myself  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough  
  
What would you say  
If I walked away  
Would you appreciate  
But then it'd be too late  
Because I can only take so much  
Of your ungrateful ways  
Everything is never enough

A single star behind me  
A red sky burns ahead  
A lonely light below me  
Awake among the dead  
An overwhelming feeling  
Leaves me numb and strange  
A sense of new beginning  
I sense a wind of change  
  
Out with the old useless  
People so cold ruthless  
Welcome in a new millenium  
How many times must I  
Live out theis nightmare I  
Can't wait until a new millenium  
  
I've got this feeling  
The tide is turning now baby  
Funny feeling  
Everything's gonna be alright now  
  
Living out a constant deja vu  
Keep your head up  
Please be patient we will get to you  
Keep your head up  
Just have some faith and you can see it through  
Keep your head up  
But faith don't pay the rent that's overdue  
Keep your head up  
All that's glittering is turning blue  
Keep your head up  
What they want from me ain't gotta clue  
Keep your head up  
Swallow pride before it swallows you  
Keep your head up  
Don't dare bite the hands that's starving you  
Keep your head up  
  
How can you keep your head  
And not go insane  
When the only light at the end  
Of the tunnel is another train  
  
The lies ten feet tall  
Have broken my fall  
Welcome you all new millenium  
It's well overdue  
And I can't wait to  
Welcome in a new millenium  
  
I've got this feeling  
The tide is turning now baby  
Funny feeling  
Everything's gonna be alright now

Standing on the backs of angels  
Destined to create  
Mounting the attack  
While heroes carry your weight  
  
We spiral towards disaster  
Survival fading faster  
  
Riding out the wave  
Content to feed off the machine  
Bleeding us to death  
The new American dream  
  
You're blinded by your hunger  
Beware your days are numbered  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
Blurring lines drawn in between  
What is right and what is wrong  
Victims on the radar string us along  
  
We're on to your agenda  
The dead end road to nowhere  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
  
Tears fall from the shameless  
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter  
Selfless are the righteous  
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

It doesn't make any sense  
This tragic ending  
In spite of the evidence  
There's something still missing  
  
Heard some of the rumors told  
A taste of one's wealth  
Did Victoria wound his soul?  
Did she bid him farewell?  
  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
We slowly fade away  
  
Here I am inside his home  
It holds the many clues  
To my suspicions  
And as I'm standing here right now  
I'm finally shown what I have always known  
  
Coincidence I can't belive  
As my childhood dreams alowly come true  
  
Are these her memories  
Awakened through my eyes  
This house has brought back to life  
  
An open door  
I walk on through  
Into his bedroom  
  
Feeling as cold as outside  
The walls disappear  
To some woman who's screaming  
A man pleads forgiveness  
His words I cannot hear

A suited man smiled said:  
"It's just a matter of time  
You can have the world at your feet  
By tomorrow  
Just sign on this line."  
Hold tight, limelight!  
Approaching the paramount  
With the sun in our eyes  
Fearing family ties, legalize,  
Compromise  
  
In a dimly lit room with a stool as his  
Stage  
A dream-stricken prince of a pauper's  
Descent  
Haunts the eavesdropping silence  
That presses his window  
As he sweats a performance  
To an audience that ticks on the wall  
  
To the practical observer  
It's just a matter of time  
"You can deviate from the com-  
Monplace  
Only to fall back in line."  
I understand mine's a risky plan  
And your system can't miss  
But is security after all a cause  
Or symptom of happiness?  
  
Brave, yet afraid, his eyes on horizon  
In a steady-set gaze  
A mariner soon from an open cocoon  
Takes a moment to summon his courage  
To stifle his grave apprehension and  
Trembling, approaches the surf  
A father's benediction as his hopeful  
Son departs  
To brave the sea of rage and conquer  
At all costs  
  
Lingers in his memory  
And visions still surviving in a logic-  
Proof shell  
That should have been held sacred, safe  
And hidden well  
Are compromised in usury  
With every rising sun that yields no  
Sight of land  
The hesitation cultivates within the  
Tired man  
And rumors spread of mutiny  
And though the time will come when  
Dream and day unite  
Tonight the only consolation causing  
Him to fight  
In fearless faith in destiny  
  
Even when plans fall to pieces  
I can still find the courage  
With promise I've found in my faith  
  
Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep  
And at odds with our senses we'll climb  
But if faith is the answer, we're already  
Reached it  
And if spirit's a sign  
Then it's only a matter of time

All wound up  
On the edge  
Terrified  
Sleep disturbed  
Restless mind  
Petrified  
Clouds of fear  
Permeate  
All I see  
Heightening  
Nervousness  
Threatens me  
  
I am paralyzed  
So afraid to die  
  
Cut of cord  
Warning signs  
Never show  
Tension strikes  
Jokingly  
Worries grow  
  
Why do I feel so numb  
Is it something to do with where I come from  
Should this be fight or flight  
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight  
  
Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest  
Agitated body in distress  
I feel like I'm in danger  
Daily life is strangled by my stress  
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins  
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane  
  
No strong hope for redemption  
A grave situation desperate at best  
  
Why do I feel so numb  
Is it something to do with where I come from  
Should this be fight or flight  
I don't know why I'm constantly feeling...  
  
Helpless hysteria  
A false sense of urgency  
Trapped in my phobia  
Possessed by anxiety  
  
Run, try to hide  
Overwhelmed by this  
Conflicts delirium  
  
Helpless hysteria  
A false sense of urgency  
Trapped in my phobia  
Possessed by anxiety  
  
Run, try to hide  
Overwhelmed by this  
Conflicts delirium

Lost in the sky  
Clouds roll by and I roll with them  
Arrows fly  
Seas increase and then fall again  
  
This world is spinning around me  
This world is spinning without me and  
Every day sends future to past  
Every breath leaves me one less to my last  
  
Watch the sparrow falling  
Gives new meaning to it all  
If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day  
  
I'll take seven lives for one  
And then my only father's son  
As sure as I did ever love him I am not afraid  
  
This world is spinning around me  
The whole world keeps spinning around me and  
All life is future to past  
Every breath leaves me one less to my last  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under I'm not afraid  
All that I feel is honor and spite  
All I can do is to set it right  
  
Dust fills my eyes  
Clouds roll by and I roll with them  
Centuries cry  
Orders fly and I fall again  
  
This world is spinning inside me  
The whole world is spinning inside me  
Every day sends future to past  
Every step brings me closer to my last  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under I'm not afraid  
Living my life too much in the sun  
Only until your will is done  
  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under I'm not afraid  
All that I feel is honor and spite  
All I can do is to set it right  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under I'm not afraid  
Living my life too much in the sun  
Only until your will is done  
  
Oh that this too  
Too solid flesh  
Would melt

Have I thanked you for your time?  
Or will your life go unrewarded  
Again?  
Never asking for a dime  
You just gave all of yourself  
Until I turned my back on you  
My friend  
  
The powers that be made you a martyr  
Conspiracy led you to slaughter  
I tried to control it but as soon as I showed it  
I was shot down again  
  
Once again outnumbered  
Appreciation slumbered  
You can ask yourself why  
But that look in your eye  
Doesn't pass the test  
You've been laid to rest my friend  
Again  
  
Tortured artist bears his soul  
Seems the pressure took its toll  
Lived a life so punishing  
Now he keeps the publishing  
  
Spilling your guts out to a pad and pen  
Communication to your silent friend  
  
Raising the knife  
To a picture of a life  
(I once knew)  
There comes a time  
Compromising my life  
(Just won't do)  
I cannot lie  
I can't try anymore  
(To reach you)  
I just can't fight  
Raise the knife  
Raise the knife  
Cut through  
  
I remember once you were the quiet type  
Content to sit and watch the motions of your life  
With false sensitivity  
You cut yourself open so people would adore you  
  
They all bought into your contrived sincerity  
And how you wore your heart and soul right on your sleeve  
Laughing sarcastically  
You turned your back on the people who adored you  
  
Self-absorbed exhaustion  
Self-esteem distortion  
Self-infused extortion  
Self-serving abortion  
  
I'll take the blame for these things that I say  
'Cause I had the heart and the will and the courage to stay  
Every day  
I won't walk away  
  
Reading through all the digests you show me  
I notice the way that you

Since the new world order  
Plagued upon our fears  
Spreading accusations  
Of radical ideas  
  
The brotherhood of wisdom  
Strength and dignity  
Its rituals and secrets  
Remain a mystery  
  
Beneath the ever watchful eye  
The angels of the temple fly  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The final stage a sacred home  
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone  
A rite of passage  
  
Men of wealth and power  
Influence and fame  
Philosophers and leaders  
All members of the trade  
  
Bound by oath honor  
Like the rose and cross  
An enigmatic union  
An esoteric thought  
  
Beneath the ever watchful eye  
The angels of the temple fly  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The final stage a sacred home  
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone  
A rite of passage  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The seven stars the rising sun  
A perfect world the new life has begun  
A rite of passage

Walls are closing  
Anxiously  
Channel surfing  
Frantically  
  
Burning City  
Smoke and fire  
Planes, we're certain.  
Faith inspired?  
  
No clues  
A complete surprise  
Who'll be  
Coming home tonight?  
  
Heads all turning  
Towards the sky  
Towers crumble  
Heroes die  
  
Who would wish this  
On our people?  
And proclaim  
That His will be done  
Scriptures they heed have misled them  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
  
Teach them  
What to think and feel  
Your ways  
So enlightening  
  
Words they preach  
I can't relate  
If God's true Love  
Are acts of Hate  
  
Who would wish this  
On our people?  
And proclaim  
That His will be done  
Scriptures they heed have misled them  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
All praise their sacrificed sons  
  
God on high  
Our mistake  
Will mankind be extinct?  
There's no time to waste  
Who serves the truth  
For Heaven's sake?

To Rise, To Fall.  
To Hurt, To Hate.  
To Want, To Wait.  
To Heal, To Save.  
  
Can't hear it  
We fear it  
Awareness won't come near it  
  
Distractive  
Reactive  
Disguised in spite of time  
  
I never bared my emotion  
My passion always strong  
I never lost my devotion  
But somewhere fate went wrong  
  
Can't let them rape me again  
Your venom's not family here  
Won't let them fill me with  
Fatalistic remedies  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly blinded by fear?  
Where would my sanctity live?  
Suddenly nobody cares.  
  
It's never enough  
You're wasting your time  
Isn't there something I could say?  
You don't understand  
You're closing me out  
How can we live our lives this way?  
  
You tell me I'm wrong  
I'm risking my life  
Still, I have nothing in return  
I show you my hands  
You don't see the scars  
Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.  
  
What if the rest of the world  
Was hopelessly drowning in vain?  
Where would our self pity run?  
Suddenly everyone cares.  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Give up on misery  
Turn your back on dissent  
Leave their distrust behind  
Wash your hands of regret  
  
Do you feel you don't know me anymore?  
And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?  
And how come you don't want me asking?  
And how come my heart's not invited?  
You say you want everyone happy  
Well, we're not laughing.  
  
And how come you don't understand me?  
And how come I don't understand you?  
Thirty years say we're in this together  
So open your eyes.  
  
People in prayer for me  
Everyone there for me  
Sometimes I feel I should face this alone  
My soul exposed  
It calms me to know that I won't  
  
Blood  
Heal me  
Fear  
Change me  
Belief will always save me  
Blood

Give up on misery

Blood  
Swearing  
Fear  
Staring  
Conviction made aware  
  
Learning from misery  
Staring back at dissent  
Leaving distrust behind  
I'm inspired and content

Freedom  
Calls my name  
  
Serenity  
Keeps me sane  
  
Happiness  
It dulls the pain  
  
Honor  
To save my fate  
  
Hoping  
To run away  
  
Willingness  
To understand  
  
Justice  
For you not judge  
  
Courtesy  
For all to start  
  
Kindness  
It's not that hard  
  
Self-restraint  
The self impaired  
  
Inventory  
My daily bread  
  
Analysis  
Until you're gone  
  
Look in the mirror  
What do you see?  
The shattered fortress that once built me  
  
Faithful ascent, through darkest fires  
I've found the path to take me higher  
  
You're smart enough for me to trust  
Go live your life now  
Just keep these steps in your life  
  
And you'll know how  
  
If you're not sure, ask yourself  
Have I done to them  
  
As I would have them do to me?  
  
Look in the mirror  
What's that you see?  
The shattered fortress, fly now, be free!  
  
Faithful ascent, through darkest fires  
I've found the path to take me higher  
  
I once thought it better to be right  
But now I have finally seen the light  
Sometimes you've got to be wrong, and learn from mistakes  
I live with serenity now, not self-righteous hate  
  
(help me be a channel of thy peace  
That were there is hatred, I may bring love)  
(that were there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness)  
(that were there is discord, I may bring harmony)  
(that were there is error, I may bring truth)  
(that were there is doubt, I may bring faith)  
  
Now that you can see all you have done  
(that were there is despair, I may bring hope. that were there is shadow, I
may bring light)  
  
It's time to take that step into the kingdom  
(that were there is sadness, I may bring joy)  
  
All your sins will help to make you strong  
(that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.  
That I may seek to understand rather than to be understood)  
  
And help you break right through the prison wall  
(that I may seek to love, rather than to be loved,  
For it is by self-forgetting that one finds,  
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven)  
  
Keep all of me, the desires  
  
That once burned me deep inside  
Help me live today and help to give me grace  
To carry out your ways  
  
I am ready, help me be all I can be  
I am ready, help guide me and keep me brave  
  
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere  
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there  
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere  
Reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there

I was sitting on the edge of his bed  
Staring at the headlines on the paper  
He said, "Look at poor Gene Kelly  
I guess he won't be singing in the rain"  
You can take away my heroes  
Can you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please don't let it rain  
Don't stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
I'm tired of this fight  
Soon I'll be knocking at your door  
  
She was standing by the edge of his bed  
Staring at the message on their faces  
He said, "What else can you do, babe?  
I guess I won't be coming home again"  
They just took away all my promises  
Make them take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Leave the cold outside  
Please don't let it rain  
Don't stumble on my pride  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
Just stay with me tonight  
I'm tired of this fight  
Soon I'll be knocking at your door  
  
His final scene  
The actor bows  
And all those years  
Are gone somehow  
The crowd applauds  
The curtain falls  
  
I was standing by the edge of the water  
I noticed my reflection in the waves  
Then I saw you looking back at me  
And I knew that for a moment  
You were calling out my name  
You took away my hero  
Will you take away my pain  
  
Take away my pain  
Let the cold inside  
It's time to let it rain  
There's nothing left to hide  
  
Take away my pain  
I'm not frightened anymore  
I'm learning to survive  
Without you in my life  
Til you come knocking at my door

(Hold it now)  
(Wait a minute)  
(Come on! whew)  
Just let me catch my breath  
I've heard the promises  
I've seen the mistakes  
I've had my fair share of tough breaks  
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way  
Take the time, reevaluate  
It's time to pick up the pieces  
Go back to square one  
I think it's time for a change  
  
There is something that I feel  
To be something that is real  
I feel the heat within my mind  
And craft new changes with my eyes  
Giving freely wandering promises  
A place with decisions I'll fashion  
I won't waste another breath  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet  
Finds clearness this trial demands  
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief  
For the fortune lies still in his hands  
If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year  
A man must learn to cope  
If his obsession's real  
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope  
  
Life is no more assuring than love  
(It's time to take the time)  
There are no answers from voices above  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
And no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
I close my eyes  
And feel the water rise around me  
Drown the beat of time  
Let my senses fall away  
I can see much clearer now I'm blind  
  
(Ora che ho perso la vista)  
(Ci vedo di piu)  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time

Look around  
Where do you belong  
Don't be afraid  
You're not the only one  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
Life is short  
So learn from your mistakes  
And stand behind  
The choices that you make  
  
Face each day  
With both eyes open wide  
And try to give  
Don't keep it all inside  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
You've got the future on your side  
You gonna be fine now  
I know whatever you decide  
You're gonna shine  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
You're ready to begin  
  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within

I'm much wiser now  
A lifetime of memories  
Run through my head  
They taught me how  
For better or worse, alive or dead  
I realize there's no turning back  
Life goes on the offbeaten track  
I sit down with my son  
Set to see the Crimson Sunset  
Many years have come and gone  
I've lived my life, but now must move on  
He's my only one  
Now that my time has come  
Now that my life is done  
We look in to the sun  
"Seize th day and don't you cry,  
Now it's time to say good-bye  
Even though I'll be gone,  
I will live on"

Over and over again  
I relive the moment  
I'm bearing the burden within  
Open wounds hidden under my skin  
  
Pain is real as a cut that bleeds  
The face I see every time I try to sleep  
Staring at me crying  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside  
  
I sever myself from the world  
And shut down completely  
All alone in my own living hell  
Overcome with irrational fear  
  
Under the weight of the world on my chest  
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath  
Tell me I'm not dying  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside  
  
I'm a burden and a travesty  
I'm a prisoner of regret  
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams  
I am hanging on the edge  
  
Disaster lurks around the bend  
Paradise came to an end  
And no magic pill  
Can bring it back again  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm running from the enemy inside  
Looking for the life I left behind  
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind  
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

Cunning, Baffling, Powerful  
Been beaten to a pulp  
Vigorous, irresistible  
Sick and tired and laid low  
Dominating, Invisible  
Black-out, loss of control  
Overwhelming, Unquenchable  
I'm powerless, have to let go  
  
I can't escape it  
It leaves me frail and worn  
Can no longer take it  
Senses tattered and torn  
  
Hopeless surrender  
Obsession's got me beat  
Losing the will to live  
Admitting complete defeat  
  
Fatal Descent  
Spinning around  
I've gone too far  
To turn back round  
  
Desperate attempt  
Stop the progression  
At any length  
Lift this obsession  
  
Crawling to my glass prison  
A place where no one knows  
My secret lonely world begins  
  
So much safer here  
A place where I can go  
To forget about my daily sins  
  
Life here in my glass prison  
A place I once called home  
Fall in nocturnal bliss again  
  
Chasing a long lost friend  
I no longer can control  
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end  
  
Run fast from the wreckage of the past  
A shattered glass prison wall behind me  
Fight past walking through the ashes  
A distant oasis before me  
  
Cry desperate crawling on my knees  
Begging God to please stop the insanity  
Help me I'm trying to believe  
Stop wallowing in my own self pity  
  
"We've been waiting for you my friend  
The writing's been on the wall  
All it takes is a little faith  
You know you're the same as us all"  
  
Help me I can't break out this prison all alone  
Save me I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own  
Heal me I can't restore my sanity alone  
  
Enter the door  
Desperate  
Fighting no more  
Help me restore  
To my sanity  
At this temple of hope  
  
I need to learn  
Teach me how  
Sorrow to burn  
Help me return  
To humanity  
I'll be fearless and thorough  
The enter this temple of hope  
  
Believe  
Transcend the pain  
Living the live  
Humility  
Opened my eyes  
This new odyssey  
Of rigorous honesty  
  
Serenity  
I never knew  
Soundness of mind  
Helped me to find  
Courage the change  
All the things that I can  
  
"We'll help you perform this miracle  
But you must set your past free  
You dug the hole, but you can't bury your soul  
Open your mind and you will see"  
  
Help me I can't break out this prison all alone  
Save me I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own  
Heal me I can't restore my sanity alone  
  
Way off in the distance I saw the door  
I tried to open  
I tried forcing with all of my will and still  
The door wouldn't open  
  
Unable to trust in my faith  
I turned and walked away  
I looked around, felt a chill in the air  
Took my will and turned it over  
  
The glass prison which once held me is now gone  
A long lost fortress  
Armed only with liberty  
And the key of my willingness  
  
Fell down on my knees and prayed  
"Thy will be done"  
I turned around, saw a light shining through  
The door was wide open

What if someone said  
Promise lies ahead  
Hopes are high in certain scientific circles  
Life won't have to end  
You could walk again  
  
What if someone said  
Problems lie ahead  
They've uncovered something highly controversial  
The right to life is strong  
Can't you see it's wrong  
  
Human kind has reached a turning point  
Poised for conflict at ground zero  
Ready for a war  
Do we look to our unearthly guide  
Or to white coat heroes  
Searching for a cure  
  
Turn to the light  
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates  
Turn to the light  
Turning away would be a terrible mistake  
  
Anarchistic moral vision  
Industries of death  
Facing violent opposition  
Unmolested breaths  
  
Ethic inquisitions breed  
Antagonistic views  
Right wing sound bite premonitions  
In a labyrinth of rules  
  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Justified in taking  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
Taking life to save life  
  
This embryonic clay  
Wrapped in fierce debate  
Would be thrown away  
Or otherwise discarded  
  
Some of us believe  
It may hold the key  
To treatment of disease  
And secrets highly guarded  
  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Justified in taking  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
  
Human kind has reached a turning point  
Poised for conflict at ground zero  
Ready for a war  
Do we look to our unearthly guide  
Or to white coat heroes  
Searching for the cure  
  
Turn to the light  
Don't be frightened of the shadows it creates  
Turn to the light  
Turning away would be a terrible mistake  
  
We're reaching  
But have we gone too far  
  
Harvesting existence  
Only to destroy  
Carelessly together  
We are sliding  
  
Someone else's future  
Four days frozen still  
Someone else's fate  
We are deciding  
  
Miracle potential  
Sanctity of life  
Faced against each other  
We're divided  
  
Should we push the boundaries  
Or should we condemn  
Moral guilt and science  
Have collided  
  
Turn to the light  
We defy our own mortality these days  
Turn to the light  
Pay attention to the questions we have raised

An Angel's kiss now fallen  
Descending scarlet cuts the sky  
Faded names left on the wall  
Honor the fighting leave life to  
Die  
  
Remembered is the sacrifice but  
No appraisal of blood still flowing  
Who were the leaders?  
What controlled the Killing Hand  
That caused this mouthing?  
  
Crossing over  
  
Lowered deep into the sea  
Being a waits to cleanse his soul  
Senses weakening time is still  
Motionless by stiffening cold  
  
The wheels race back and  
Scorch his mind  
Traveling all to find the land  
Revelation warms a touch  
And now he will begin to  
Understand  
  
Extended a view to yesterday  
Manifestation for none the same  
Walking amidst a frightening still  
No sound, no smoke, no scorching  
Flames  
  
He is risen  
  
Sipping his poison the raven sings  
Yet another to add more bodies  
Fallen  
King from below  
This one controls  
The Killing Hand that caused this  
Mourning  
  
Is it all over?  
  
[IV. Thorns]  
Evil genius this secret plan  
Mercy dealt with the losing hand  
Will he ever fall?  
Can he end it all?  
Our savior must make his stand  
  
Only a Propher of years to come  
Wanting mortality I'm all alone  
He heard my voice  
It was my choice  
I've stopped the Killing Hand  
  
When I go back again  
Will it be the same?  
I've stopped the cries  
But now they know my name  
  
The sea is calling me  
My spirit must return  
As I get closer,  
Was it really worth  
What I have learned?  
  
I'm in the valley  
And the saddened chimes I hear  
Race towards the wall to find  
One more name appears  
  
No one is left now  
My one and only land  
I laugh at what I've done  
I am the Killing Hand

Temptation,  
Why won't you leave me alone ?  
Lurking every corner-  
Everywhere I go  
  
Self Control,  
Don't turn your back on me now  
When I need you the most  
  
Constant pressure tests my will  
My will or my won't  
My self control escapes from me still  
  
Hypocrite,  
How could you be so cruel ?  
And expect my faith in return ?  
  
Resistance,  
Is not as hard as it seems  
When you close the door  
  
I spent so long trusting in you  
I trust you forgot  
Just when I thought I believed in you  
  
("What're you doing ? What're you doing ?")  
  
It's time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear,  
Why did you lie and pretend ?  
This has come to an end  
I'll never trust you again  
It's time you made your amends  
Look in the mirror my friend  
  
("That I haven't behaved as I should")  
("Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you.")  
("I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things
you can't control.")  
  
Let's stare the problem right in the eye  
It's plagued me from coast to coast  
Racing the clock to please everyone  
All but the one who matters the most  
  
Reflections of reality  
Are slowly coming into view  
How in the hell could you possibly forgive me ?  
After all the hell I put you through  
  
It's time for me to deal  
Becoming all too real  
Living in fear  
Why'd I betray my friend ?  
Lying until the end  
Living life so pretend  
It's time to make my amends  
I'll never hurt you again

Watching my window I was led like a  
Child  
As the roadway lamplight's  
Misguided my mind through the night  
A shadow of limits  
We were racing the rain  
My hands held the wheel  
My eyes tried to hold their place  
  
There must have been a time  
When I thought that you were  
Watching  
It had to be when my senses lost  
Control  
I thought I'd slipped away  
I thought I could still feel us  
Moving  
It must have been a cloud  
No bigger than a man's hand  
  
Every reason I risk my life  
To come back to you  
Is locked behind your door  
You're my immunity  
Outside I watched you burn  
Heavy hearts were bleeding  
A cry for help, a familiar voice  
My melting hands streaked the glass  
  
As I walked away  
I wondered what had really  
Happened  
Had I run out of time  
Did I push myself too far  
As my last step fell  
I felt my hands upon the wheel  
Had I come back to life  
Or did I ever leave at all  
  
In higher lives  
We seem to be  
Always a moment too late  
We're past the time  
When we looked on  
Now we're  
The ones who help to  
Set the sun  
This time for real  
I locked the door behind me  
My mind was still a wreck  
From what I saw  
For when my hands are still  
I'll recognize the message  
Never again will my senses lose  
Control  
In higher lives  
We seem to be  
Always a moment too late  
We're past the time  
When we looked on  
Now we're  
The ones who help to  
Set the sun

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant  
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief  
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man  
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief  
  
Never could have just a part of it  
I always need more to get by  
Getting right down to the heart of it  
The root of all evil has been running my whole life  
  
Dirty enough for me to lust  
Leaving nothing left to trust  
Jealous enough to still feel envious  
Lazy enough to sleep all day  
And let my life just waste away  
Selfish enough to make you wait for me  
  
Driven blindly by our sins  
Misled so easily  
Entirely ready to leave it behind  
I'm begging to break free  
  
Take all of me  
The desires that keep burning deep inside  
Cast them all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
  
Self-centered fear has got a hold me  
Clutching my throat  
Self righteous anger running all through me  
Ready to explode  
  
Procrastination paralyzing me  
Wanting me dead  
These obsessions that keep haunting me  
Won't leave my head  
  
Help to do for me what I can't do myself  
Take this fear and pain  
I can't break out of this prison all alone  
Help me break these chains  
  
Humility now my only hope  
Won't you take all of me  
Heal this dying soul  
  
I can feel my body breaking  
I can feel my body breaking  
I'm ready to let it all go  
I can feel my body shaking  
Right down to the foundation  
The root of it all  
  
Take all of me  
And the drive that keep burning deep inside  
Cast it all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
I am ready  
Come to me  
Take me away

This is so hard for me  
To find the words to say  
My thoughts are standing still  
  
Captive inside of me  
All emotions start to hide  
And nothing's getting trough  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
So much uncertainty  
I don't like this feeling  
I'm sinking like a stone  
  
Each time I try to speak  
There's a voice I'm hearing  
And it changes everything  
  
Watch me  
Crawl from  
The wreckage  
Of my silence  
Conversation  
Failing  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls  
  
Every time you choose to turn away  
Is it worth the price you pay  
Is there someone who will wait for you  
One more time  
One more time  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
It's not too late for me  
Tear down these walls for me

In the heart of your most solemn barren night  
When your soul's turned inside out  
Have you questioned all the madness you invite  
What your life is all about  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
  
Have you ever wished that you were someone else  
Traded places in your mind  
It's only a waste of your time  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
  
Feed the illusion you dream about  
Cast out the monsters inside  
  
Life begins with an empty slate  
Fragile left in the hands of fate  
Driven by love and crushed by hate  
Until the day  
The gift is gone  
And shadows remain  
  
Some of us choose to live gracefully  
Some can get caught in the maze  
And lose their way home  
Memories will fade  
Time races on  
What will they say  
After you're gone  
This is the life we belong to  
Our gift divine  
Our gift divine

She never really had a chance  
On that fateful moonlit night  
Sacrificed without a fight  
A victim of a circumstance  
  
Now that I've become aware  
And I've exposed this tragedy  
A sadness grows inside of me  
It all seems so unfair  
  
I'm learning all about my life  
By looking through her eyes  
  
Just beyond the churchyard gates  
Where the grass is overgrown  
I saw the writing on her stone  
I felt like I would suffocate  
  
In loving memory of our child  
So innocent, eyes open wide  
I felt so empty as I cried  
Like part of me had died  
  
I'm learning all about my life  
By looking through her eyes  
  
And as her image  
Wandered through my head  
I wept just like a baby  
As I lay awake in bed  
  
And I know what it's like  
To lose someone you love  
And this felt just the same  
  
She wasn't given any choice  
Desperation stole her voice  
I've been given so much more in life  
I've got a son, I've got a wife  
  
I had to suffer one last time  
To grieve for her and say goodbye  
Relive the anguish of my past  
To find out who I was at last  
  
The door has opened wide  
I'm turning with the tide  
Looking through her eyes

He is the king  
Of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow  
He rules the sandworms  
And the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow  
He is destined to be a king  
He rules over every thing  
In the land called planet Dune  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
In the deserted planet Dune  
  
Without a stillsuit  
You would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arakis  
It is a land  
That's rich in spice  
The sandriders and the 'mice'  
That they call the 'Muad'Dib'  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gorn Jabbar  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He's the ruler of the stars  
  
The time  
Will come for him  
To lay claim his crown  
And then the foe  
Yes they'll be cut down  
You'll see  
He'll be the best  
That there's been  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men  
And when the time  
For judgement's at hand  
Don't fret he's strong  
And he'll make a stand  
'Gainst evil the fire  
That spreads  
Through the land  
He has the power  
To make it all end

Under the sun  
There's nothing to hide  
Under the moon  
A stranger waits inside  
People disappear  
The music fades away  
Splashing through the rain  
I'll dream with them one day  
  
It's raining, raining  
On the streets of New York City  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
  
I may have wasted all those years  
They're not worth their time in tears  
I may have spent too long in darkness  
In the warmth of my fears  
  
Take a look at yourself  
Not at anyone else  
And tell me what you see  
  
I know the air is cold  
I know the streets are cruel  
But I'll enjoy the ride today  
  
It's raining, raining  
On the streets of New York City  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
Raining deep in heaven  
  
I may have wasted all those years  
They're not worth their time in tears  
I may have spent too long in darkness  
In the warmth of my fears  
And as I walk through all my myths  
Rising and sinking like the waves  
With my thoughts wrapped around me  
Through a trial of tears  
  
Hidden by disguise  
Stumbling in a world  
Feeling uninspired  
He gets into his car  
Not within his eyes to see  
Open up, open up  
Not much better than the man you hate  
  
Still awake  
I continue to move along  
Cultivating my own nonsense  
Welcome to the wasteland  
Where you'll find ashes  
Nothing but ashes  
Still awake  
Bringing change  
Bringing movement, bringing life  
A silent prayer  
Thrown away  
Disappearing in the air  
Rising  
Sinking  
Raining deep inside me  
Nowhere to turn  
I look for a way back home  
  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven  
It's raining, raining  
Raining deep in heaven

Standing by the window  
Eyes upon the moon  
Hoping that the memory  
Will leave her spirit soon  
  
She shuts the doors and lights and lays her body on the bed  
Where images and words are running deep  
She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head  
So quietly she lays and waits for sleep  
  
She stares at the ceiling and tries not to think  
And pictures the chain she's been trying to link again  
But the feeling is gone  
And water can't cover her memory  
And ashes can't answer her pain  
God give me the power to take breath from a breeze  
And call life from a cold metal frame  
  
In with the ashes  
Or up with the smoke from the fire  
With wings up in heaven  
Or here, lying in bed  
Palm of her hand to my head  
Now and forever curled  
In my heart and the heart of the world

Let it out, let it out  
Feel the empty Space  
So insecure find the words and let it out  
  
Staring down, staring down  
Nothing comes to mind  
Find the place turn the water into wine  
  
But I feel I'm getting nowhere  
And I'll never see the end  
  
So I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in and everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Let the feelings flow  
Close your eyes  
See the ones you used to know  
  
Open up open up  
Don't struggle to relate  
Lure it out  
Help the memory escape  
Still transparentness consumes me  
And I feel like giving up  
  
So I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
  
I wither  
And give myself away  
  
Light reflections on the cage  
The worlds want to create  
  
I drown in hesitation  
My words come crashing down  
And all my best creations  
Burning to the ground  
  
The thought of staring over  
Leaves me paralyzed  
Tear it out again  
Another one that got away  
  
I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
  
I wither  
And render myself helpless  
I give in  
And everything is clear  
I breakdown  
And let the story guide me  
I wither  
And give myself away  
  
Light reflections on the cage  
The worlds want to create  
The worlds which you create  
  
Let it out, let it out... !

Being 'round you is driving me crazy  
Watching you run is making me lazy  
You're trying to buy a place in my head  
Telling me lines I've already read  
Speaking my name to try to confuse me  
Say it again you're starting to lose me  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
You're building my prison brick by brick  
Eating your words is making me sick  
You get what you want 'cause nothing is sacred  
You're reading my mind and leaving me naked  
You say I gotta give before I receive it  
One of these days I'll believe it  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
  
  
That's alright, I'm okay  
It happens every single day  
It's all the same  
But I'm not blind  
  
It's all about you  
Not me  
It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be  
There's not enough time  
To live  
And all that you're expecting me to give  
  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me  
It's all about you  
Not  
Me

Do you need the walls to spread apart?  
Something's been sent here,  
To free you, I am told.  
A rising power that will break you,  
Break you out you'll see,  
Your fantasy unfold.  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
So many eyes that never open.  
Too many chains that bind  
The dreams that make us see.  
There are no prisons in our kingdom.  
Will you give your hand?  
Say "yes, Your Majesty!"  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
Always go on,  
Never saying you are done.  
We're always looking for  
A place where magic passion soars.  
You'll find that if you're with us,  
The magic's in your heart!  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
Now can you see  
The gift we bring...  
Your Majesty!
