Look at me my nigga  
Fantasize about a white picket fence  
With some trees my nigga  
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints  
that's all I need my nigga  
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it wrenched  
But now I see my nigga  
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since  
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced  
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limps  
Fuck being timid in the Civic  
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps  
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?  
Yeah can I get a glimpse?  
  
Last night I had a bad dream  
That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?  
They robbin' niggas on the daily  
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things  
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like  
Uh, nice watch, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
  
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams  
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold  
I know the shits not always good as it seems  
But tell me till you get it how could you know  
How could you know? How could you know?  
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich  
Fuck with me my nigga  
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick  
Cop some tree my nigga  
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip  
You gon' see my nigga  
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick  
And that's the key my nigga  
And listen up I'm bout to go and get rich  
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga  
Me I want my pockets fat about a bitch  
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga  
Watch some rollers in the fuckin' Crown Vic  
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga  
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?  
Even if you let em' kill your dream it'll haunt you nigga  
  
Last night I had a bad dream  
That I was trapped in this city  
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?  
They robbin' niggas on the daily  
Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things  
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like  
Uh, nice watch, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
Hands in the air now, hands in the air  
  
Father forgive me for me, childish ways  
I look outside and all the clouds are gray  
I need your hands to take me, miles away  
Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but  
Before you go I've got to, want you now  
Whatever goes up surely, must come down  
And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found  
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man  
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

I see your homegirl tryna sway you  
How you figure I would play you,  
Would you look at that  
The same one that caught her n-gga with some freak  
All in her sheets left for a week  
What she do, double back  
Now I know we far from perfect  
But I feel like this is perfect, do you disagree with that  
If not than holla back  
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back  
  
[Chorus:]  
My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone  
Telling how man dogging me  
My best friend say, don't tell her nothing bout me  
Cause she aint showing me no sympathy  
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go  
Home a long time ago  
My best friend say  
My best friend say  
I'll be there, I'll still be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
  
[J. Cole]  
Now, now, now, know we be arguing  
But aint you riding with me  
We breaking up we making up  
Like Dwayne Wayne, and Whitney  
You throw things, you broke things  
Use both hands and hit me  
And right when you call the law  
I'll tell my boy to come get me  
Then you, than you start listening  
To friends, and then it, gets tricky  
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky  
So you ignore the hickys, the pics of chicks and they vicky's  
That they sent me, is that real love  
You're the only one that I will love  
Damn, damn  
  
My Best friends say  
I could stay with her  
At her house, no doubt anytime I like  
My best friends say  
Don't let you in my life, cause you don't do for me  
And you don't act right  
My best friends say  
If she was me, she'll let you go along time ago  
My best friends say, my best friends say  
  
I'll still be there for you  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
I'll be there for you  
  
Anytime we meet  
You can lean on me  
Come on, come on  
I'll be there for you  
  
Girl I can see it in your eyes  
How you feeling, let me know what's on your mind  
We've been together for a long long time  
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes  
I know to you it feel like I'm never around  
Round, round, round  
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down  
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse:]  
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close  
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever  
Never, Rozay rich forever  
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever  
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight  
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked  
And just from life, knocking you on your ass  
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass  
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it  
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water  
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys  
Back in the days, I would've hated on the new boys  
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing  
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along  
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went  
A couple singles but could never be the main event  
Without substance, something for them to grab on  
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long  
I ain't even certain, one day they love you  
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you  
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you  
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you  
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train  
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane  
I pray to god end they reign  
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about  
And could've died when I came from disbelief  
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak  
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks  
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime  
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?  
  
[Outro:]  
Nah mean, nah mean?  
That was like a Jay Z drink  
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?  
You know how I used to say it  
Nah mean?  
B-are-are-ing, warm up

Cole World, South side  
Can't get enough, can't get enough  
East side, West side, worldwide, ride out  
  
Now I ain't got no kids yet,  
But this right here's for practice  
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet,  
But that's how good your ass is  
Make an old man get his glasses,  
Make Wesley pay his taxes  
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter,  
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider  
You now rocking with the best man,  
Dress game down to the sex game  
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed mane,  
Let you play with the stick, Ovechkin  
She calling, she texting,  
She's falling, but let me explain  
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl  
Cause a nigga don't play them ex games  
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting  
And I ain't coming offa my last name  
Cause I really can't take no stressing  
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit,  
Your home girl saying, "He a bad boy"  
But I'm signed to the Roc,  
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids  
  
[Chorus]  
She said, "I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes  
You be up to no good and everybody knows  
My home girls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know  
But what you got, I need a lot so I can't let you go"  
She said, "I, can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)  
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)  
"I can't get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot  
Tried to let go but I just could not, so don't you stop, I need that"  
  
Hey, Globetrotter,  
Cole hotter even way out in London town  
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound  
And I got love for the underground  
Kwali, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down  
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night,  
That'll suck all night, you just cut off lights  
Almost missed my flight,  
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?  
She be down for whatever,  
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?  
Never fuss or fight,  
On the grind tryna find this lettuce  
I love it when you give me head,  
I hate it when you give me headaches  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothing sunny  
I see 'em hating, but it ain't nothing to me  
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money  
And carry fo' fives like change for a twenty  
So what I look like scurred?  
Them niggas over there look like nerds  
Never mind that girl, let's make a track  
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr  
That's the hook, right thurr  
There's the hook, right thurr  
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track  
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr  
  
[Chorus]

[Hook:]  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker  
Aye, all you broke niggas be quiet  
  
[Verse 1: J Cole]  
I can't control this urge to fuck hoes and splurge  
My sidepieces got real jobs, nigga I don't fuck with no birds  
My main chick she got real hair, ain't never got to go shop for hers  
Got a neat freak that don't eat meat but goddamn she rocking them furs  
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna find me, now the ho wanna climb me  
If real recognize real, that's why it took a motherfucker like Hov to sign me  
Ball so hard I'm the truth nigga, All-Star game catching oops nigga  
If you a bitch and I'm a bitch, I'm Sheryl Swoopes and you hoops nigga  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: J Cole]  
Cole world, safe to say I'm cold blooded  
In this cold life the more cold you are seem like the more the hoes love you  
So I book a flight, she land today, she leave tonight with no luggage  
Got the camera on in my bedroom, shooting video with no bucket  
Only nigga up in first class, old lady tryna be friendly, ay  
She think I'm in the nba, why a nigga can't have his mba?  
Next time I'mma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her  
"You so tall what team do u play for?" No bitch I'm a doctor  
Flow hella proper, Cole never flopped, nah  
Float like a propeller no helicopter shit  
Not stick like a bowlegged chick  
Stick dick to a gold digger, won't give her dollar  
Fuck your nine I'm a whole different caliber  
Nigga say they pop cause they don't fill they collars up  
Read a book get your knowledge up, book a flight get ya mileage up  
Bitch nigga...  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]  
I'mma start off with these four bars  
I'm in a barbie at a sports bar  
I'm rockin' gold balls, whip your ass with this crowbar  
I'm like "Oh Boy, catch your girl off that rebound"  
Fix her hair up, get her a re-do  
Just my car out that paint shop, so I guess that's a mothafuckin re-coupe  
Let me demonstrate, gotta think about it before I go on a dinner date  
Might eat a rich bitch, yes I got me expensive taste  
Got my pockets on full, stomach on full, gun on full, I got full coverage  
Niggas don't know the full story, I'm smokin on gas, full service  
Money talk, true story, if you don't got none then don't say shit  
Banana clips going ape shit, if you don't make money you don't make sense  
I got gold on my bracelet, got ya girlfriend chasing it  
Bust a nut in her mouth, so now she can baby sit  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Outro: J Cole]  
This liquor I've been sippin' got me kissing all these models  
And I might not see tomorrow, I might not see tomorrow  
Please don't tell my mom I spent tuition on these bottles  
Just to pay back all these loans man we gon' have to hit the lotto'

[Chorus:]  
What can I?  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
It's cost me a lot  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Just one of them days  
A n-gga feel like flossin'  
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin  
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's  
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome  
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me  
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me  
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only  
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me  
Well look I'm back b-tch, back with an attitude  
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the sh-t I gotta prove  
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved  
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude  
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you aint believe me  
Now I'm living just like the n-ggas you see on tv  
Vip feeling like this club oughta thank me  
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', hd  
  
[Chorus:]  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Big chains, big whips with wood grain  
(It's cost me a lot)  
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Fast life and till the gas light  
Copped the type of sh-t you couldn't get at half price  
(It's cost me a lot)  
Look but don't touch muthaf-cker, think twice  
(It's cost me a lot)  
  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
Now I don't love no material things  
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring  
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)  
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)  
  
[J Cole - Verse 2]  
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy  
Somebody get the pilot and ask "is the plane ready?"  
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off  
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off  
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling  
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame  
Felt naked cause the boy rocked bout a dozen chains  
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain  
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em  
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon  
Jay put a stamp on the n-gga but wouldn't nail him  
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him huh?  
  
My chain heavy and my b-tches look very thorough  
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl  
White Range, call that Muthaf-cker Larry Bird  
I got em hanging on every word  
  
[Chorus:]  
[End]

[J. Cole]  
Yea, this is where the  
Yea, this is where the fathers aint living  
At least not with us  
Might see em round the city and won't even say wassup  
When n-ggas play tough, wont even smile in mirrors  
And we learn to f-ck hoes off trial and error  
Just a small time n-gga, big city hustle  
Glued to the tv, Jigga, Diddy, Russell  
These were our heroes, strictly for them zero's  
For that Robert Deniro, n-ggas reload on them kilo's  
Dodgin them people,  
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I'd rather not tell  
Shawty smole crack and her boyfriend too  
Sometimes he touch her daughter like them boyfriends do  
Pull up to the club where the boys went too  
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue  
A n-gga on a strecther and though I never met ya  
I'm thinking God Bless ya, they city try and get ya  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes, know the ropes lke a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts saying we miss ya  
(We miss ya)  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
[Omen]  
Yea, lets see God  
I know you only do what's best for me  
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny  
They always tellin' me it's temporary  
Than why it's feelling like a cemetary  
My dreams aint got no obituaries  
My city hurting and none of us were equiped here  
You heard me say I was ballin'  
I probably make tears  
I'm trying to get clear  
I'm tryna quit fear  
Who wrote the scripts here  
These kids live there whole life just killing time  
Running the race with no finish line  
They tryna noose us with they ropes  
But I'm tryna climb  
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide  
But I aint tryna go, no baby  
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope  
Cause I aint dying  
My words gon' last forever,  
You can hold the treasure  
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind  
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends, wiping they nose clean  
Is my neighbourhood just a smoke screen  
I think I'm in the [?] I see lo green  
Sons raised by bo queens but there's no kings  
(No kings, no kings)  
  
[J. Cole Hook]  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
Come with me,  
Run quick see, what do we have here  
Now, do you wanna ride or die  
La dadada, la la la la  
  
[J. Cole Verse 3]  
It seems like n-ggas either feel ya or they try and kill ya  
I face the sky and hope to God aint acting unfamiliar  
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar  
They tell me that it's God's will, I'm asking God will ya  
Iller a n-gga from artist pain, momma smoking cocaine as it rains out  
Am I to blame, try to stay sane so I came out-side  
Where they rock with them thangs out  
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boys brains out  
But will it change, it's like n-ggas is free but our minds still in the chains  
Brothers killing eachother, the blood spill it's a shame  
Will it ever slow up  
A lot of n-ggas getting older but they never grow up  
And do they son's like they fathers did and never show up  
Don't even cry about it, just another episode of life  
Watch the season n-gga no re-runs  
The devil buying soul's n-gga no refunds  
Man, don't let the city get ya  
F-ck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler  
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue  
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya  
Another day, another song, a mother prays  
Another gone  
But still we play like aint nothing wrong  
Like aint nothing wrong  
Cause aint nothing wrong  
I'm not as fast, I'm not as tall  
But before I pass  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
I gotta ball  
N-gga I gotta ball

Up up and away  
Would you trust me  
Would you love me  
Then it must be  
  
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'ma  
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder  
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under  
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cole ass summer  
You niggas so last summer  
Onto the new, on onto the new shit  
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me  
Two years later bitch we made it on, onto the Blueprint  
Now how's that for persistence  
Cole World comin', call back up assistance  
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls  
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress  
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned  
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball  
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you miss me?  
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?  
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?  
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?  
Then it must be a match made in heaven  
God's Gift  
God's Gift  
God's Gift  
Motherfucker this is God's gift  
  
Pussy my passion  
Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one  
Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one  
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one  
Ever since I got on  
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on  
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up  
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up  
What type of little fuck boy hitter  
Woman baby wouldn't put his hands on a nigga  
I ain't bitter boy that's all you  
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you  
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home  
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown  
I came up, fucked the game up  
Show my momma I'll survive on my own  
  
[Chorus]

I had this little bad thing something like them tens,  
She gave a nigga mad brain something like the wiz,  
But you see the sad thing fucking with her is,  
The chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch,  
  
So I tried to show her,  
About the world and about just who we really are,  
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far,  
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard,  
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra,  
And I really want is for her to go down low,  
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow,  
And all the deep shit I was previously down for  
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for  
  
You see I peeped it pussy is power,  
That proud feeling we get knowing pussy is ours,  
And how it feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that
shit,  
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit  
And all the pain the world caused she be healin' that shit,  
And nah that ain't your girl but you be feelin' that chick,  
And you just want to tell her everything she might need,  
But in the mean time its light please  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Lights please  
Lights please  
Turn off the lights,  
For now everything just seems so right,  
How you make the darkness seem so bright,  
Feeling like thing gon be alright  
  
So now we in the hotel mirrors on the ceiling,  
She say she wanna blow L's I hear her and I'm willing,  
But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone,  
So that every word I spoke I was tryna put her on,  
But she couldn't hear me,  
  
I told her all about how we been living a lie,  
And that they love to see us all go to prison to die,  
Like baby look at how the show us on the TV screen,  
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans,  
Then all I really want is for her to get on top,  
Before you know it she working jerking it nonstop,  
And all that next shit I was previously talkin',  
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in,  
  
And while that sweat drip I am reminded,  
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinding,  
I'm finding,  
The more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same,  
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all trying to play the game,  
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for giving birth,  
To a baby that took two to make,  
Coward nigga you a fake,  
How you gon look in your sons face and turn you back,  
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that,  
  
She said it's okay,  
Rubbed my head and told me to relax,  
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks,  
Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please,  
Just reach over and hit the lights please,  
  
[Chorus x2]

[Verse:]  
Yeah, Ain't nothin but to do it, nigga that's true  
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?  
It came to me like the dream that I once had  
Niggas said I couldn't do it, then I bust through  
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs  
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew  
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on  
See now it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you  
Clearly, now hear me  
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me  
Cut me deep and know it hurts severely  
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely  
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli  
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly

Six in the mornin' I'ma call Wale  
Tell J. Cole to meet us down in the A  
And bring Wiz Khalifa 'cause the green look pure  
We some real niggas, we just lookin' in the mirror  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
D.C. all up in this bitch, 'bout time I got my respect  
And now these hoes are on my line like Sally Mae on college deck  
Gotti here I'm in this shit, hey J. Cole come here this shit  
I bet you hear that white music but I don't mean top 40 hits  
  
Talk to the mirror and I don't need a cure  
And when I'm done with this muthafucker  
It'll need a urn shoppin' I'll be in Paris  
You plottin', don't even worry  
You walk in my closet your favorite style is some beaten birds  
  
You out where? We don't ever see ya  
My niggas out here they spot me like Chippy D.  
And I'm probably smokin' reefer till I got that emphysema  
How else can I emphasise I'll only let the mirror see ya  
  
It go microphone check, one, two, yola  
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar  
Two baby mama's, three kids, two Rovers  
That's too many problems, too late to think over  
  
The cars off the showroom, clothes off the mannequin  
Hoes off the centerfold, I be going ham at ten  
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling  
College girl goin' wild and Gotti be the camera man  
  
Bird talk feather man, Louis jacket, leatherman  
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant  
Man in the mirror if I can't get my shot again  
My bitch like a Coke bottle, yo' bitch like a Pepsi can  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror?  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror  
  
Mirror, mirror on the wall, bitch I was born to ball  
While y'all took the summer off, my money did a somersault  
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel  
Ain't no nigga touchin' my style it got a forcefield  
  
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo  
The view from my condo be makin' hoes say neato  
Game strong like the arm on Marino  
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos  
  
Fresh to death like I'm buried in a tuxedo  
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fuckin' ego  
I say it's yo' world, Cole World to be exact  
With a flow that's so thorough  
No sir, you can't reenact, nigga  
  
Hundred fifty on my chain, ballin' but it's not a game  
High that's why they call us planes  
All the bitches know my name  
I take 'em home fuck her, get high and never call again  
  
And my niggas all the same, now that's what you call a game  
Hundred thousand dollars and that's on champagne  
Bitches choose and they excuses my new car's to blame  
Wanna dump her nigga, fuck a nigga, with a lot of fame  
Don't want nothing from a nigga he all kinds of lame  
  
Try doin' what I'm doin' but it's out of range  
Niggas takin' shots, don't know how to aim  
Don't know 'bout you but I see a real nigga  
When I'm lookin' in the mirror with some diamonds in my ear  
Motherfucker  
  
I'm on fire, whole hood blazin'  
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin'  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror  
  
Look like a chandelier, look in the mirror  
Ice super clear, you lookin' in the mirror  
Who you heard see, when you look in the mirror?  
If you a real nigga you lookin' in the mirror

Feel like she loves me  
She loves me  
And then she loves me not  
She loves me not  
Feel like she loves me  
She loves me  
And then she loves me not  
She loves me not  
Then she loves me not  
  
[Verse:]  
Hey, I know that this aint nothing that you used to  
Out of the ordinary, unusual  
I know you had your whole life planed out  
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you  
I know you wonder why I had to choose you  
Then wanna take you for granted or abuse you  
So I'mma keep it honest  
I think it's a little ironic  
If I hit another chick it's gonna bruise you  
Shit, staring out the window of this plane  
Thinking if it crash, I'll never see your ass again  
Wouldn't that be a shame  
Cause look at all the shit we overcame  
Made it through the falme and never got cremated  
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded  
All them other couples we f-ck with, secretly hated  
Flash forward it's been year, we're the only ones that made it  
Sh-t remember I was straying from home  
And where I wanna be was my favourite song  
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones  
But I just can't leave you alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
She know me like a book, it's too easy to read my ass  
Unhappy stressed, yelling don't mislead my ass  
I mean I make it so easy don't please my ass  
The shoe was on the other foot and you would leave my ass  
It's true that, true that  
My song all on the radio  
Who Dat!  
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on  
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on  
All this time I've been with ya you aint used to do that  
I loved you ass way before I knew you could wrap  
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that  
Calling my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that  
We had a deal you aint keeping up your end of the shit  
In my mind I know she got the short end of the stick  
Trying justify it, man we finna be rich  
And some bad b-tch I barely know sending me flix  
  
[Chorus:]

Maine on fire, my empire be higher  
Than an octave on Mariah,  
You niggas should worship sire  
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire  
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer  
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars  
I was David promising the world that ima serve Goliath  
Then I swam with sharks,  
Made it to the land and part  
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires  
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo  
Get my head out the window  
20 k in my pocket as I'm feeling the wind blow  
And I ain't have a wallet since nintendo, comprendo  
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo  
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough  
Till I snap back like hov hat  
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that  
  
Maine on fire  
Top down bitch I ain't no liar  
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch  
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher  
Maine on fire  
Every week can see my name on flyers  
Henny by the shots many bottles pop  
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar  
  
We collect a hundred thou  
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now  
I was such a cunning child  
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you  
The one your mama glad you hung around  
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga  
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor nigga  
But it's just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest  
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is  
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas  
We just let the paper blind us  
While vaginas chase behind us  
Take notes make money don't make jokes  
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats  
Real shit but if the world really bout to end  
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen  
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen  
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again  
  
Maine on fire  
Top down bitch I ain't no liar  
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch  
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher  
Maine on fire  
Every week can see my name on flyers  
Henny by the shots many bottles pop  
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

This is a public service announcement  
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records  
"And so my fellow Americans  
Ask not what your country can do for you  
Ask what you can do for your country"  
  
Excuse me  
  
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars  
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors  
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg  
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg  
Don't trip nigga, they just words  
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs  
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse  
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church  
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo  
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo  
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit  
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick  
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail  
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel  
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga  
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments  
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit  
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit  
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge  
  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Miss America, petty thoughts  
Just to floss pay any and every cost  
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out  
Am I about dollars or about change?  
Am I about knowledge or about brains?  
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain  
  
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers  
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense  
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'  
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets  
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit  
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit  
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit  
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit  
Who the fuck was I?  
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side  
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at  
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back  
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack  
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat  
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft  
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag  
  
Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch  
Overcomin' the circumstances we hella rich  
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch  
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge  
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments  
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit  
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit  
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge  
  
They don't feel my pain  
They'll never feel my pain  
And they'll never play this shit on the radio

Verse 1  
Mo Money  
Mo Money Blow, Blow Money, Show Money  
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money  
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money  
So much money I don't know who stile from me  
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money  
Still broke compared to niggas with old money  
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money  
Billionaires with Petroleum and coal money  
Probably kill themselves if the had Cole money  
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money  
I'm wrapping up the album, fouth quater I'm so money  
I'm over sees looking for trees to grow money  
Peter Popper off robbing people for hope money  
Prostitutes collecting that let me stroke money  
Out up a couple dollars for the liquor store money  
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money  
Now the strippers give a nigga the throw for no money  
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money  
When she barely on the boat got stay afloat money  
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money  
Spend it before we get it and could never hold money  
No wallets, nah, we'd rather fold money  
Money control niggas, white man control money  
Laughing like yeah yeah my nigga get your money

Yeah, hey, wassup girl  
Hey, yeah, uh  
  
Uh, angel eyes, long hair  
I see you cryin', what's wrong there  
He did what? He fucked who?  
We know the story, what's new?  
See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told  
  
"Hey, you wanna be a man?  
Yeah I wanna be a man.  
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.  
I ain't gonna tell.  
Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay."  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same  
The old G's that beat the game  
Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
"You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?  
I don't think this is, working out for us.  
Why?  
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.  
What the fuck?!"

[Chorus:]  
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?  
If you want it, come and see me  
I aint got nothing but time  
One day you're gonna set me free  
But first you gotta let me shine  
Niggas aint high as I be  
See, look momma I'm flyin'  
  
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland  
I'll probably never land  
Neverland, Neverland, noo, I'll never never land  
  
[J Cole - Verse 1]  
Check my fortune cookie, it's that Cole World  
Could that mean it's meant to be?  
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur  
This life is f-cking with me mentally  
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me  
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies  
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me  
My bad girl sayin' f-ck all that, enter me  
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies  
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee  
Anything to take my mind off  
I logged on and made them muthaf-ckas sign off  
I got the on my dick they'll never climb off  
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)  
I don't know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans  
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 2]  
I'm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together  
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever  
I gotta make it to the top, it's either now or never  
These other niggas can't adapt because they not as clever  
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better  
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter  
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather  
And, so sick they can't fix this with medi-cine  
We at yo door and she gotta let us in  
It's what you want, I whet your appetite  
Cole hit the scene now I'm what everyone rapping like  
Shame you feel you have to bite  
Still aint nobody snapping right  
Pedal to the metal as I'm speeding through the traffic lights  
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already  
Still fight like I'm the underdog, I'm on already  
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, ya'll already already  
  
[Chorus:]

This for all my niggas in the city  
But this shit really for Queens though  
Really for Queens though!  
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes  
Gettin' money regimen  
Wit' my gettin' money machine, nah what I mean?  
  
New York times  
Come listen to these New York rhymes  
A southern nigga with a New York mind  
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings  
Getting to the money of sins by any means  
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out  
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter  
Up here, life is a bitch I blow a kiss at her daughter  
In a city where niggas will leave you shit outta order  
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news  
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead  
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once  
My nigga visibly stressed in a mess he's smoking his blunt  
What could I say, I can't relate to that  
All I do is pray for that  
This the city god told me, 'go and make it' at  
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that  
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that  
  
The New York Times  
The New York Times  
(Extra, extra, read all about it)  
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here  
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here  
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane  
Same places, different faces, on the train mane  
New York, New York  
  
Hop on the F train, took the express train  
Skip that local shit, my vocal sick  
That's how success came  
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game  
Wall street got black slave blood stains  
Which means, we built this city  
And never got scraps while the devil got fat  
In fact, reparation for niggas in desperation  
Fuck money, get my kid a real education  
Blood money spills, had a real revelation  
Southside make you realize there's still segregation  
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud  
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how  
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise  
Imagine the world, free from pain  
And we no longer scared at night  
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind  
We don't make it prime time till we dyin'

How I go from selling reefa and plates  
Till eating steaks with Cole and playing FIFA with Drake  
Should've been in the States, property of the Jakes  
Now I'm plotting on profits and properties on the lake  
Let me properly integrate you to it  
To show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it  
Them niggas talk a lot of shit but they ain't been through it  
I done been up in everything, cars you never seen  
City's you never heard of, from the streets where they murder  
Police observe us till they reach the verdict  
Kill 'em all, fucking kill 'em all  
If you can't send 'em till the pen, send 'em to the morgue  
Send 'em to the Lord, fuck it, send his broad  
Hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart, nigga  
Bitch nigga, take a pause

[Verse:]  
Armed and dangerous, call the law  
Stick to the script, no audible  
Country ass nigga with an Audemar  
Can't spell the shit but I order more  
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle  
Get good head on the Autobahn  
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore  
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God  
Five steps like Dru Hill  
Came home from the first tour, with  
Bad credit and a school bill  
Middle finger to the bursar  
Finally famous but  
Ain't too much really change with us  
Straight up weed, no angel dust  
Label us notorious, that was '97  
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'  
You ain't know my shit, drop bitch, 9-11  
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend  
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend  
Nigga you should too, if you knew  
What this game would do to you  
Look at all the bullshit I've been through  
Better me than you  
  
[Bridge:]  
I must confess, I copped the chains  
I hit the club, I made it rain  
I hit the road, I made a name  
I came home, I ain't the same  
I ain't the same  
I ain't the same  
  
[Hook:]  
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know  
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know  
  
[Verse 2:]  
These niggas know, booya nigga?  
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?  
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas  
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas  
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas  
But don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas  
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land  
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas  
Like what's the problem?  
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan  
My shit long, need a hair salon  
Get it cut, shut the fuck up  
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone  
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass  
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass  
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz  
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask  
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)  
What the fuck was I s'posed to?  
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that  
Keep hoes bi-coastal  
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free  
Dick the only thing that they get from me  
Sit vip, get a sip for free  
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally  
Picture me at the tip-top  
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop  
This B. I. G. Nigga, this Pac  
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot  
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch  
Hate to brag but backpackin', that's hip hop  
Write my life and make sure that the script hot  
And pray the kids watch, if not  
These niggas know  
If not, these niggas know  
  
[Bridge x2]  
  
[Hook:]

First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil  
For real, you the only father that I ever knew  
I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you  
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville  
For Phil, Listen even back when we was broke my team ill  
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville  
Talk to a nigga  
  
One time for my LA sisters  
One time for my LA hoes  
Lame niggas can't tell the difference  
One time for a nigga who knows  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
  
No role models and I'm here right now  
No role models to speak of  
Searchin' through my memory, my memory  
I couldn't find one  
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed  
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God  
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her "Hey, what's good?"  
"Sorry I'm never comin' home I'ma stay for good"  
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood  
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods  
Ain't got no shame bout it  
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch  
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"  
But then I thought back, back to a better me  
Before I was a B-list celebrity  
Before I started callin' bitches bitches so heavily  
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody  
You wasn't sweatin' me  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
  
I want a real love, dark skinned and Aunt Viv love  
That Jada and that Will love  
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love  
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love  
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows  
Out of touch with reality hoes  
Out in Hollywood bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes  
Fuck em' then we kick em' to the door  
Nigga you know how it go  
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap  
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back  
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt before she leave  
I'ma need my shirt back  
Nigga you know how it go  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
  
There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably in
Tennessee that says fool me once, shame on - shame on you.  
If you fool me we can't get fooled again  
  
Fool me one time shame on you  
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you  
Fool me three times, fuck the peace signs  
Load the chopper, let it rain on you  
[x2]  
  
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet  
My only regret was too young for Nia Long  
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows  
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along  
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu  
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home  
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone  
With the stale face cause they know it's they song  
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)  
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)  
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)  
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)  
  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved  
Don't save her  
She don't wanna be saved

[Intro:]  
(Oh oh oh oh oh)  
(La da da da da)  
  
[Hook:]  
I tried, you tried, we tried  
All of the times that we had together  
We should of known nothing last forever(X2)  
  
[Verse 1: J. Cole]  
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly  
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me  
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me  
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me  
Soon as this shit end, forget about it  
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it  
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it  
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it  
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'  
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?  
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass  
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama  
On my mama, we been through it all  
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall  
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst  
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 2: J. Cole]  
They say we won't last  
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask  
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell  
A good nigga gone bad  
Good chick a lil mad as fuck, she done had enough  
I be, out here tryna raise my status up  
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck  
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist  
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste  
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you  
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you  
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, you ain't about nothin'  
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you  
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start  
But deep down you know we grew apart  
Long before I broke your heart, if I lost your respect  
I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Verse 3: J. Cole]  
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been awhile  
Apologies, I ain't been around  
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now  
And times have changed  
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same?  
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it  
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it  
Now we can say that all good things come to an end  
But we know each other way too well to pretend  
We went from friends to somethin' much more  
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more  
Second chances, we gave enough to finally  
We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more  
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather  
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better  
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me  
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories  
  
[Hook:]

She knows, she knows  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
You know I got a girl back home  
You got a man what you want, what you want  
What these bitches want from a nigga  
On some DMX shit  
I know them other niggas love tricking  
On some BMX shit  
But not me  
Now I'm sure you done heard about me  
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli  
Good southern bad hoes try me, they try me  
This is Martin Luther King in the club  
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch  
In his ear sayin' she down for whatever  
In the back of his mind is Coretta  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I don't  
I'm passing up on bad hoes  
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want  
What she want from a nigga  
To put a ring on it  
Got a bitch on my dick right now  
And she just want to sing on it  
Got me up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire  
'Cause I told her I was sleeping  
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose  
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose  
  
She knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows, she knows  
And I know she knows, and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
My niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Rest in peace to Aaliyah  
Rest in peace to Left Eye  
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya  
Just as soon as I die  
  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Got me up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high, trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I, oh I-I-I  
I can't be what you want from me  
Well alright

It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada  
Gucci and Prada  
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar  
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me  
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me  
Down for me, my homie  
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave  
Know you was tired like the Michelin man  
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?  
Now they hate to see us last this long  
When they get my album, probably pass this on  
Thought they knew me, well  
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell  
The happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL  
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit  
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit  
Ride or die chick fighting insecurities  
Want ring and my last name for securities  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
I know my style ain't perfect  
I know my smile ain't perfect  
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true  
Funny though I'm perfect for you  
All the drama seem worth it for you  
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true  
Now what you crying for?  
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?  
She want that old thing back  
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that  
Love is war, end up on the floor  
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back  
I say those word hoping that,  
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you  
Like I fight temptations every night for you  
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly  
(And we fly too, and we, and we  
And we fly too)  
  
Feels as though our world's crashing down  
We can't forget to breathe through this now  
We live through the ups and the downs  
It'll get better  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out we're tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time, sparks will fly

[J. Cole]  
They say anythings possible,  
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles  
Chasing obscene profits so we ain't stopping for the red lights  
Look in my rear view all I see is n-ggas headlights  
Catch me if you can hoe  
They try and sack me and I scramble  
Look up in the sky you'll see exactly where I am bo  
Hey, don't you see me man?  
Making my wishes come true with no genie man  
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beanie Man  
I'm on these rich n-ggas ass no bikini man  
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man  
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man  
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope  
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost  
Silly head to approach, what's up young blood  
Aint it strange, a year ago today I was counting change  
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city  
Though I gotta thank God cause if you weren't with me  
Than I surely woulda died  
You can throw the fork in me  
This my New Years resolution, dawg  
No more Pork in me  
Uh, I aint no Muslim though  
Kuran butler I'm a wizard if he doesn't know  
It's young Simba, I'm ballin' til the buzzard blow  
You try and kick the shit I kick you gon stub your toe  
Boy that's just how tough I go  
See this is my life work  
This shit you callin classic, I be like that mic work  
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dike work  
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst  
  
Not tonight n-gga  
Not tonight n-gga  
Yeah, hey  
Hey, man, hey  
  
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely  
Never met a baby momma, momma who don't like me  
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me  
I hit her til she snooze, like the news n-gga nightly  
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me  
No she bitter with this n-gga  
Cause he aint quite me  
One things for certain baby, you are a wifey  
Two things for f-cking sure  
I am not the husband thoguh  
So run back to him while you still can  
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah that's a real man  
I was ashamed all along and I still am  
We let the lust interupt something real, damn  
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position  
I wouldn't say that you a hoe, just made a hoe decision  
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibitions  
We both know that's what you wanted girl  
I know you listening  
  
Hey  
Girl I know you listening  
Uh I know you listening  
Hey, yeah  
  
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit  
The fans online trying to find my shit  
And to then-ggas listening but wont buy my sh-t  
And catch me in the street wanna ride my d-ck  
Y'all n-ggas is the worst, see me like  
"J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD"  
N-gga please, an album ten dollars  
You act like it's ten g's  
This food for thought cost the same as 2 numbers three's  
So at ease with that broke shit  
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no sh-t  
You know I feel ya pain, that's why I slang this hope sh-t  
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh sh-t  
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes sh-t  
I give you that and a whole lot more sh-t  
Than got richer and still rapping like I'm poor sh-t  
You n-ggas thinnk you know sh-t, n-gga you don't know sh-t  
Hoe bitch!  
Yeah, Cole bitch!  
J Cole n-gga  
Hey

[J. Cole]  
Hey, to the college kids no scholarships  
Starting your semester  
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser  
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya  
Life is your professor, you know that b-tch is gon test ya  
I got some sh-t I'd like to get off my chest  
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress  
And can I spit out my stress?  
It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic  
He said Cole, "a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic"  
Nobody touching Nas n-gga it's more like Villematic  
These fayettnam tales be paying off well  
What story is my audio theatre gon tell  
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?  
I guess it's in God's hand's  
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn  
That's for your non-believers  
I'm the truth only time will teach ya  
And f-ck the haters probably never love they momma's neither  
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes with computers on hating on
the newest song  
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans  
Trying to do this sh-t better than the n-ggas we grew up on  
Name a f-cking song I aint threw up on  
Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!  
Pardon the stereotype  
But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman  
One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour  
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya  
For bullsh-ttin' and the n-gga Cole spittin' it real  
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville  
To Miami, where the same time last year  
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear  
Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before  
And Rnb b-tches want me, that was just dreams before  
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'  
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'  
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong  
Plus my d-ck is like a man with a mind of it's own  
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about sh-t  
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit  
Looking for chesse on some mouse sh-t  
Suck a n-gga, f-ck a n-gga, than go run they mouth quick  
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit  
You want change, this that "between the seats in your couch" sh-t  
The f-ck you thought, I lost it  
All that flame on my name would get exhausted  
Au contraire my n-gga they all ears  
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah  
It's finna be a long year, yeah  
  
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don't conceal that  
Don't conceal that  
This exactly what you thought  
Somebody bought the real back  
[End]

Visions of home, the streets that I roamed it's been a while  
Raised me like the father I aint never had, I'm still your child  
And though I've grown in ways that you never known  
I ventured into the world, I moved out all on my own  
I'm doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone  
See shit you wouldn't believe, I write 'em down in these poems  
And put 'em out for the world, I know you listening too  
Heard you saying shit about me, I hope the shit isn't true  
Man look at this shit I came from, this narrow point of view  
How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you?  
I ran through them spots with you and f-cked the same bitches too  
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too  
Came back for them niggas too, aint no trappin' nigga it's true  
Yet they play me on repeat cause I rap for them niggas too  
They see I started with nothing but passion and then I blew  
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view  
  
Visions of home, Visions of home  
Visions of home, Visions of home (Yeah)  
Visions of home, this is my zone  
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song  
  
This is for my cousin Ricky, damn niggas it's been too long  
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin' but to each his own  
Gotta feed yo'self, smoke a little weed just to ease yo'self  
Fuck the whole world I don't need your help  
You're the reason why momma had those rocks  
All my niggas never even had no pops  
'Memba that, you remember that?  
If you don't, double back  
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street  
But I'm still where the trouble at  
Where the trouble at?  
That's cause my flows there  
What it look like if I don't go there  
I'm dead wrong, it's been way too long (long)  
My folks there, what it look like if I don't go there?  
I'm dead wrong, it's been way too long  
  
Visions of home, visions of home  
Visions of home nigga, visions of home  
I'm coming home, coming home  
Yeah Cole World  
You know what it is...

I wanna see you work for me, work out for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, we got a good thing  
Don't know if I'mma see you again  
But is that a good thing?  
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am  
I know what's on your brain  
You're probably hopin' never would end  
Like is it the real thing  
Or is it just a one night stand well then  
  
Let me see you get high and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
High and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
She like them bar with the big old chains  
Ride around town in the big old Range  
I knew her when I rocked big old chains  
Now the little nigga doing big old things  
Would you look at that, I came back for her  
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it  
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her  
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard  
I told her, baby girl come here  
Know I run the town even when I aint from there  
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party I made  
What your nigga make in one year, thats unfair but  
So is life, take a chance roll a dice  
Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced  
Don't over think just hope it's right  
I'm only here for the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me see you get high and go low  
Now girl would you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
High and go low  
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor  
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?  
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me  
  
Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene  
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you mean  
They be starting shit, but it's your world  
On my Martin shit, you go girl  
She bad and you know it, some niggas save Hoes  
I'm not that heroic  
Could you be my escort  
Cause just like them two door Fords  
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more  
Cole World, real Cole World  
Them boys cool, me I'm on fire  
Know whats on my mind, tryna see whats on yours tonight  
Tonight, tonight  
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast  
Up late so you probably skip class  
Life is a test so before the night pass get right  
Get right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Cole World)  
  
Straight up, now tell me do you really wanna love me forever  
Oh, oh, oh  
Or is it just a hit and run  
  
(Well, hey)  
  
Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when we together  
Oh, oh, oh  
Come here girl, lets get it on  
  
(Work out for me, work out for me)  
  
Straight up now tell me do you really wanna love me forever?  
Oh, oh, oh  
Or is it just a hit and run  
  
Well, Straight up I tell ya I just really wanna cut when were together  
Oh, oh, oh  
Come here girl lets get it on  
  
(Work out for me, work out for me)
