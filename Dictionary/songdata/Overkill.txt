Once upon a time  
When you had us all in line  
Thought that we would never learn  
The word out on the street  
Was you never felt the heat  
Even when the fires burned  
Then the dogs of war  
Barking at your door  
Is this what it's all about?  
So we broke the deal  
It's how it made us feel  
Drummer started on the shout  
  
Heard a thousand drummers on a solitary light  
Heat of a thousand summers explode into the night  
They hid behind the curtains, their faces were concealed  
A voice above the ashes screamed  
I want to make a deal  
I'm back on my heels  
  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
All over but the shouting now  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
Careful what you wish for, you may get it now  
Hell raising, drums blazing  
All over but the shouting now  
  
The look upon your face  
When we blew it into space  
And let the pieces fall about  
Destruction on the ground  
The heart of freedom found  
In a voice could only shout  
The pain would go away  
The pride inside would stay  
The blood is dripping you're alive  
The ones that stood and fell  
Were all remembered well  
The cross of an animal 5  
  
Cold calculation got them to fall into line  
Annihilation, got them working the shine  
They scream and shout  
All over but the  
Beat generation in a room full of war  
Evacuation as the stones hit the door  
They want out, all over but the shout  
  
So, once upon a time  
When we lit the line  
Thought that we would never learn  
The word out on the street  
They melted in the heat  
Even when the fires burned  
Then the dogs of war  
Scratching at your door  
Is it what it's all about?  
So we broke the deal  
For everything you steal  
We start the drummer on the shout

I hear someone calling me.  
Where they call from, I can see no light.  
Walk through fire!  
To me now!  
And the fire I can't feel.  
  
Bare bones!  
I! have walked through hell.  
Now I'm back,  
Stripped to the bone!  
I! have been to hell,  
Now I'm here an' I'm taking all I need!  
Bare bones!  
  
Obstacles are in my way.  
Just beyond them lies what? I don't know.  
Walk through blind!  
Know I'm here!  
There is nothing I can't see.  
  
Bare bones!  
I! have been to hell.  
Now I'm back,  
Stripped to the bone!  
I! have been to hell,  
  
Now I'm back an' I'm taking all I need!  
Bare bones!  
  
Open my eyes to what I need to see.  
Am I you or am I becoming me?  
Life from day to day,  
Turn another page.  
Christened in the rain,  
That turns to rage.  
  
Washed of animosity.  
Naked truth falling black or white.  
You are turning!  
To the light!  
There is nothing I can't be.  
  
An' I'm back an' I'm taking all I want.  
Bare bones!

Here it come.  
I said here it comes.  
Here it come.  
  
I'm push n' pulln', back and forth and gain no ground.  
A knockin' down n' pound pound pound! Huh.  
a kickin' screamin', wac duct taped to make no sound.  
A sittin still to take the pow  
  
Going down hard with a bang bang bang shot!  
Bring it!  
  
Longer you live, you get what you give, what you're reaping  
First out alive, is the one to survive, you are creeping  
Cold hard fact gonna get ya in the back yeah!  
Cold hard fact gonna put it in ya back yeah!  
  
A spittin' blood and teeth and guts out on ya shoes.  
A kiss my ass n' born to loose. Huh.  
Like Mr. Blond, tap dancin' dali on P.D.  
All tied up in misery, pow  
  
Passing the buck as you run outta luck, you are weeping  
Crossing the line, as you run out of time, are you creeping?  
Cold hard fact gonna put it in ya back yeah!  
Cold hard fact gonna stick it in ya back yeah!  
Cold hard fact gonna put it in ya back yeah!  
Said yea jerk gonna put it in ya put it in ya!  
  
Cold hard fact gonna get ya in the back yeah!  
Cold hard fact gonna put it in ya back yeah!  
Cold hard fact gonna slip it in ya back yeah!  
Said yea jerk gonna put it in ya put it in ya!  
  
Going down hard with a bang bang bang shot!

Sleeping with a time bomb,  
Rumble in my dreams!  
Innocence been long gone!  
Fall apart at the seams.  
  
Looking through the windows, walking through the doors,  
I can't help this feeling, I been here before.  
Everything is different, everything the same,  
I know the rules. I played the game!  
  
Cry out! Tell me what its gonna be!  
Reach out! Is everything the same?  
Cry out! Tell me what you really see!  
Reach out!  
  
As a coma steals my name  
Coma. Coma!  
  
Wake to an explosion,  
Nothing! seemed so real!  
Innocence corroding!!!  
Alone is all I feel.  
  
Reaching out to no one, knowing no one's there,  
Afraid to be afraid of another nameless fear,  
I got all the reasons, don't need no more.  
Blinded by illusions, locked behind the door!  
  
An' a coma stole my name  
Coma! Coma!  
  
Sleeping now forever,  
Murdered in my dreams.  
Innocence was never. never, never,  
Goin' to extremes.  
  
Busting through the windows, kickin' down the doors,  
Standing up for me, never did before,  
Now I lay me down to sleep, and if I die before I wake!  
  
Cry out! Tell me what you really see!  
Reach out! Is everything the same?  
Cry out! Tell me what it's gonna be.  
Reach out! An' a coma stole my name  
Coma! Coma! Coma!  
  
I'm outta the dive an' comin' alive.

Think that I know you, but I just can't place the face  
Got something to show you, it can never be replaced  
Wherever we walk, wherever we fly  
Wherever we live, wherever we die  
Think that I know you, but I just can't say goodbye  
  
This is it  
Hey now, don't it make you feel better? Come and get it!  
This is it  
Here we go, we going to fly  
Come and get it!  
This is it  
Hey now, don't it make you feel better? Come and get it!  
This is it  
Here we go, we going high  
Come and get it!  
  
Remember the rising when the lightning filled the air  
No compromising in a strapped electric chair, you were there  
We never could walk, we always could fly  
We never could live, we always could die  
Think that I know you but I just can't talk, too high  
Think that I know you but I just talk too high  
Over your horse and ride  
  
Do you know a better way to make it all good inside?  
All the friends have died away, by a new law they abide  
And all Gods' children, there they go, judgement on their side  
Do you know a better way, to make it all good inside?  
And I cry does it make you feel better, sing it  
  
All Gods' children, there they go, taking the free ride

Too much in the truth they say  
Keep it 'till another day  
Let them have their little game  
Illusion helps to keep them sane  
  
Let them have their little toys  
Fast sports cars and motor noise  
Exciting in their plastic place  
Frozen food in a concrete maze  
  
You're gonna go insane  
I'm trying to save your brain  
  
I don't know what's happening  
My head's all torn inside  
People say I'm heavy  
They don't know what I hide  
  
Take a life, it's going cheap  
Kill someone, no one will weep  
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues  
We just want your soul to use  
  
You're gonna go insane  
I'm trying to save your brain  

Fingernails, that pierce your tender flesh  
And a silent scream of your new faith profess  
I am a piece of eternal satisfaction  
I am the serpent wrapped around your feet  
  
Deep inside your burning  
Virgin Ear  
Oh to stop the yearning, now  
Crystal Clear  
  
Blind and staked you to a belly crawl  
And set to take, embrace your final fall  
I am the guide to the new temptation, fallout  
I am a breath of polluted air you breath  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep inside your burning  
Virgin Ear  
Oh to stop the yearning, now  
Deep inside you're learning  
To face your fear  
Floating, moaning, turning  
Crystal Clear  
  
Innocence has fallen  
At the feet of the need  
Lust has taken over  
Watch it feed  
Blessed into temptation  
In the beholder's eye  
Offered on the altar  
On high  
Are you here for the calling  
Are you here to abide  
Have you come from the falling  
Deep inside  
  
[Chorus]

Took a little time, before we're done to love me  
Took a little more than I ever did before  
Took your bad intentions  
Took all your excite  
And if I didn't mention  
Took my inhuman rights  
It's a heavy-weight title bout  
The more I live the more I find out  
  
[Chorus]  
Damned, for if I love me  
Damned, for if I care  
Damned, for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this ain't fair  
Damned, for if I love me  
Damned, for if I care  
Damned, for all the make you feel betters  
As the damned scream this ain't fair  
  
Had a little time before I went and fucked me  
Had a little trouble, getting up off the floor  
Had you're I'm not like that  
Had a hand up in my face  
Head bobbing like a wet rat  
No love for the human race  
The more fuel, the farther I go  
The more I live the more I...  
No-no-no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Damned if I do and damned if I don't  
Damned if I will and damned if I won't  
Damned for your screamin' that this ain't fair  
God damn your screamin', I don't care  
  
Took a little time before you tried to fuck me  
Made a little spot for you right there, on the floor  
So fuck your good intentions  
Fuck your human rights  
Fuck your finger in my face  
This time I'm gonna bite  
  
[Chorus]

Oh to be the fire, I am just a man  
Oh to walk the wire, believing that I can  
And reach on down the you're throat  
To tear it out  
Find out what the beating's all about  
  
[Chorus]  
Justify my envy  
Jealousy to fail  
In perfect, deadly, harmony  
hold the devil by the tail  
Devil, by the tail  
  
Oh to slay the liar, he speaks for me, a man  
Oh to try, conspire, believing that I can  
And reach into your heart  
To pull it out  
Find out what the beating's all about  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run your devil up the pole  
Into my domain  
The forgotten drool, like rabid dogs  
By any other name  
They growl, they bark, they gnaw at me  
I still hear them wail  
Pray to hold what I hold  
A devil by the tail  
Devil, by the tail  
Run your devil, out your soul  
By another name  
Devil, by the tail  
Run your devil, take control  
Before we go insane  
Devil, devil  
  
Hey Mr. Lucifer, do you have my pay  
I'm done with working here as of today  
Hey Mr. Savior do you ever seem to fail  
And got what I got, a devil by the tail  
  
Devil by the tail, devil by the tail

Pray for the days of glory  
Long gone the master plan  
Gone is the pride of independence  
Sacrificed like a lamb  
  
Here is the same old story  
Here where the honor ran  
There was a price for the consolation  
Walking in hand in hand  
  
Thy kingdom come, he came to fear it  
He's on the Judas list  
Thy will be done and fondled spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
Give a new resolution  
Give what all I can  
Give me some more of what I can take  
Feed me from your garbage can  
  
Let me have the absolution  
Let me stand like a man  
Let me walk tall with the godforsaken  
Walking out hand in hand  
  
Thy kingdom come, he came to fear it  
He's on the Judas list  
Thy will be done and fondled spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
One more godforsaken  
Tend to make him pay  
A kiss from Judas and temptation  
Sends him on his way  
  
Passes on redemption  
Tend to make him right  
Another kiss of Judas lands  
Before he sees daylight into his night  
  
Hot  
  
One more godforsaken  
Tend to make him pray  
A kiss from Judas and temptation  
As I heard him pray  
  
Thy kingdom come, he came to fear it  
He's on the Jesus list  
Thy will be done and ruined spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done

Worlds apart, separation from my mind.  
Just close my eyes to bring me there.  
I fall apart, the pieces are so hard to find.  
A puzzle piece is torn in half.  
  
The absence, of color, surrounds a broken dream.  
Call my eyes to take me there  
One by one I watch, as the pieces disappear,  
My friends become the ones I hate.  
This house of cards it, won't withstand the wind.  
I shut my eyes to escape.  
  
All my whites have turned to black.  
Every time I close my eyes, dream in Columbian.  
All my bugs are comin' back.  
Crawlin' on my face, they speak in!  
Columbian.  
  
Worlds apart, a separation from my soul.  
Worlds apart, the separation is now whole.  
I watch the pieces fall apart.  
I try to make a brand new start.  
I'm fallin' in, I'm fallin' out,  
I'm fallin' up, I'm fallin' back,  
I'm fallin' down, an' fallin' round, an' askin' why?

Hold your feet to the fire  
Hold your face to the ground  
Hold on tight, you're a target baby  
Drop the hammer down  
I'm a long life, loving hate  
I'm a bomb that makes no sound  
Could you please, would you loosen these  
I'm about to fucking drown  
  
Lowdown and overloaded, keeping you alive  
I see that you've exploded  
On the other side  
Lowdown and lowdown, kicking it around  
I see that you've exploded  
Drop the hammer down  
  
In a mock execution  
In a house of gag and bound  
Not the best solution  
Drop the hammer down  
I'm a long life, hating love  
I'm under my dirt mound  
If you could stand where we stood  
We're not fucking around  
  
Let's hear it for the black and blue  
For the tortured soul, for the battered crew  
Three cheers for the black and blue  
Raise a glass to the beaten down  
To their dignity and bloodless frown  
Three cheers for the beaten down  
  
Drop dead dreams in a deep, dirt ditch  
Buried by a shovel hand  
Dead screams from the son of a bitch  
Coming out to beat the band  
Oh baby how I love your bite  
Turn my smile upside down  
Oh baby how I hate your light  
As you drop the hammer down

Stop cryin'.  
Ain't feeling sorry for you.  
Why don't you fade away?  
Got no time.  
No time for what I gotta do.  
And get a message through.  
Kiss my ass.  
Your bitchin's a bore.  
Don't want to hear it no, more.  
So stop cryin'.  
Ain't feelin' nothing for you.  
Don't like it there's the door.  
  
Sorry if I'm not as nice as you could be!  
Why don't you take the time to see?  
That the world! does not revolve around only you.  
And we got better things to do.  
  
You're starvin'.  
Just startin' to talk.  
I think you know it all  
I'm sick.  
I eat this shit everyday,  
Why don't we give you a call.  
Authoritative.  
And a reason to live.  
You answer questions for me!  
Opinionated.  
With a brain like a sieve,  
Why don't you let it be?  
  
Come back here, drink our beer,  
Bend my ear with no idea!  
Wrong or right,  
A true philosopher.  
Defining our performance.  
  
Why don't you get yourself a life?  
Just get the fuck out.  
  
We don't care, what they say,  
We'll be there tomorrow! like we're here today.  
And all the criticism in the world,  
Won't change a note we play!!!  
  
Mix it up, throw it down,  
We came to play, not to mess around.  
We don't care, what they say,  
We'll be there tomorrow like we're here today.  
Don't do it for the money.  
Do it for the thrill.  
True to life is what you get,  
We're, livin' for the kill.  
  
Drunken  
Wisdom

Just can't win for losing, stare 'em in the eye  
An ego made for bruising, a heart that you can't buy  
If patience is a virtue, let's set out to sin  
I'm all worked up in the desert heat, here I go again  
I never seem to smile, you'll find me in the dirt  
Your lovable reptile, yeah for what it's worth  
I'm poison to your happiness, poison to this song  
C'mon down, c'mon down to the ground so we can sing along  
  
Plug me in, yeah, now set me free  
I got a two fang grip that you should see  
All wrapped up down, 'round your leg  
Let me loose, I'm a powder keg  
I love you  
  
More  
Than you can take  
Make no mistake  
I'm an electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
A two fang break  
Electric rattlesnake  
All curled up, make no mistake  
Two fang deep, got skin to break  
Plug me in, got to shake and bake  
Electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
No mistake  
Electric rattlesnake  
  
I'm ya satisfaction, give ya skin a glow  
The number one attraction, apples packed to go  
C'mon down the garden, original sin  
Got a two fang bite in the overnight, here I go again  
All about just living, living this or that  
Shake it up and lay it out, the pigs are getting fat  
Bite me as I slither, rape me as I bake  
Plug me in baby, then turn me on  
I'm your electric rattlesnake  
  
Snake bite, color my imagination  
In a spiral dream, a hallucination  
It comes to me with no reservation  
I got the taste, do you mind?  
Snake bite, color my imagination  
Like a spiral dream of illumination  
It fills me up like a medication  
I got the taste, do you mind, here I go again

Watch the circle, dehumanize.  
Fuck the world, stay outside.  
You tread on me and you will find,  
That you flirt with death before your time.  
  
Face the music and the time has come!  
Into the circle!  
Electroviolence.  
  
Violence! Electroviolence.  
  
Keep your distance, subdivide.  
Do not enter, conservative type.  
Sweaty bodies, bodily harm.  
Abuse thy neighbour, that's the charm.  
  
Blood! shed on everyone.  
Don't mistake, violence for fun.  
Blood! guilty fashion fiend,  
What you here for, you don't fit in...!  
  
Take the shot, take the pain.  
Rebound! back again,  
Uncivilized reaction appeals to me.  
No restraints face reality.  
  
Never victim, always vice.  
Taking charge, desensitized.  
Do unto others, stay unbowed.  
You social misfit, you're one of us now.  
  
Violence! Hey! violence!  
Electroviolence!!!

Terminal, what disease  
Told me too late  
What's this cough and wheeze  
Fatal, you're shittin' me  
A second opinion  
Is what I need  
Laughin' in a windstorm  
Blowin' all the cornstalks down  
Cryin' in a funeral home  
Forward my mail, six feet underground  
  
Elimination  
  
Contagious, say why not  
Not just me  
Waitin' to rot  
Painful, yeah I know  
When I had to go  
I'm yankin' on my plug  
And I can't seem to get it loose  
Pullin' all the stops  
Your ideals change. when you got  
Nothing to loose.  
  
Elimination  
Eliminate the right  
Eliminate the wrong  
Eliminate the weak  
Eliminate the strong  
Eliminate your feelings  
Eliminate too late  
Eliminate the hope  
Eliminate, eliminate  
  
If I had just one more day  
I'd turn it all around  
I'd make a play of good, clean livin'  
And dig me out of the ground  
And if I had just one more day  
I'd say it to your face  
Pull the plug on everyone  
Eliminate this race.  
We want to cure  
And we want it now.  
Reissue hope  
We don't eare how  
You're makin' a mess  
Diseasin' a nation  
Runaway train to elimination  
  
Hopeless there's no doubt  
Set on a slow burn  
From the inside out  
Carefully say what for  
Last one out  
Closes the coffin door  
Spendin' all you saved  
And wishin' for a little more  
If I'm lookin' at the ceilin'  
Then I must be layin' on the floor.  
  
Terminal, what disease  
Told me too late  
What's this cough and wheeze  
Fatal... you're shittin' me  
A second opinion  
There's gotta be  
Laughin' at the epidemic  
Something is going around  
Crying at the epidemic  
Pullin' on nails, six feet underground.

Take a look.  
Take a good long look, and tell me what you see.  
Through time passing.  
  
Make a stand.  
In your way,  
Leaves way, too much for me.  
On the edge,  
Standing.  
  
I was there when lightning struck,  
I watched the idols fall.  
I could see it coming,  
Could read the writing on the wall!  
  
Time. Time after time.  
The end of the line.  
We stand and watch it fade away  
Sign of the time's the end of the line.  
  
It's your move.  
So play, it right.  
Sometimes you get just one chance.  
Superstitious.  
No!  
If I had the time I still wouldn't dance.  
  
I was there when lightning struck,  
And yes I kept my head.  
I could feel them coming,  
Could feel the living dead!!! Dead! Dead!!!  
  
Save your breath,  
Don't pray for me, pray for yourself.  
Through time, keeling.  
  
It's the end.  
It snuck up  
Quick and took you by surprise.  
The waiting's over.  
  
I was there when lightning struck,  
I watched the idols crawl.  
It was the second coming.  
It was written on the wall!

Revenge is sweet for thouse who wait  
Never early always late  
Waiting now to consummate  
A marriage made in hell  
Hand in hand, walk alone  
As good advice seems to drone  
Evil cuts right to the bone  
  
Has it come, awakens me  
Is it done and will it ever die  
Will it go. taking me  
Don't you know  
Evil never dies  
  
Keep me close to your heart  
Adversity will come apart  
And finish just before you start  
Never question why  
Today was then, remenber when  
Skipping numbers one through ten  
Permanence through the pen  
  
Read the rights a prophete's word  
I've learned to deal with the absurd  
And reach a darkened  
Pinnacle of light  
  
Money hungry, power thirsty  
Penny piching, fear inflicting  
Double crossing, back stabbing  
Promising eternity for a price  
Suckin', brain washing  
Mind raping, soul stealing  
Constant preaching, salvation reaching  
Lowest form of human, fucking life  
Evil never dies  
  
Laughter stands accusing me  
Emotion stands abusing me  
The battered and the bruising me  
Is there darkness when you die  
I heard a sound no one there  
I heard a shot no one cares  
Laughter turns into despair  
  
Evil hidden everywhere  
Evil has a chilling stare  
Null and void of any care  
Is where the answer lies  
It does no good to beg or cry  
It does no good to question why  
It does no good it never dies  
Evil never dies

On judgment day, the moon lights the way.  
And those with open eyes will see...  
Hail the avenger, midnight defender.  
The end will never be.  
  
You look to the light...  
Dawn of a new day.  
Hail the avenger...  
He who lights the way.  
  
Away with your fear, I've cried all my tears,  
Delivered from the night...  
Hail the avenger, laughing at danger.  
Shed blood, bring life.  
  
If you live by the sword...,  
You die by the sword.  
All hail! the avenger..,  
Accept our new lord.  
  
The defeated lay, lifeless in the pit.  
His face reflects the horror of his victems in tenfold.  
A death of deaths,  
All evil fear his name!  
  
Struck down, by a man!  
His severed limbs ooze oceans of our blood.  
... man stands, oh knee deep, within..!  
Paused to scream, this is not a sin,  
  
I have done your will, I've delivered.  
From this day forth, known as the avenger...  
  
Guarding the weak, and those who seek,  
Asylum from a world of wrong....!  
Hail! the avenger, midnight defender.  
Silent bold and strong.  
  
You echo our cry, so ends war.  
All hail! the avenger.  
Victory hour  
Ooo, Victory ours.  
  
Our vengeance recall, those starting to fall.  
Oh victory hour!!!

Talk is cheep,  
I can't afford the, price of wasted time...  
Who will reap the profit of the lie?  
  
Fantasy,  
Illusion fusion impressions of a high...  
Sacred is the being of the lie.  
  
Drawn is a picture of myself,  
It's all that I see, leaving!  
Gone are the cries I heard for help,  
The mirror spits,  
Reflections of a lie.  
  
Are you waiting for a chance?  
Won't happen standing in the rain.  
  
Damage done,  
The truth is drowning in a sea of hate...  
Wet, they wear the fiction like a badge over their hearts.  
  
Drawn is a picture of myself,  
It's all that I feel bleeding!  
Gone are the cries I made for help,  
The mirror spits,  
Reflections of a lie.  
  
Feed my head! I'm hungry for a lie.  
  
Be sure and teach your children well,  
To use it pure and slow.  
Be sure they teach their children,  
Be sure the children's children.  
  
Slight of hand, slight of word.  
Slight to believe, the absurd.  
Feed my head I'm hungry.  
I'm hungry for a lie.  
  
Drawn is a picture of myself,  
It's all that I see grieving!  
Gone are the cries I made for help,  
The mirror spits,  
Reflections of a lie.  
  
Feed my head of a lie!  
Feed my head reflections of a lie.  
Feed my head. Feed my

Eat through the mounds of steel,  
Sift through the metal.  
Belly full, another deal,  
Stopping would be fatal!  
Round 'n' round spins a forty-five,  
Is it vinyl or a bullet?  
One to kill one keeps alive,  
Get on your knees and suck it!  
  
Looking down the barrel, the feeling of new power  
Look up the weasel! Feel the reign of terror!  
  
Crawling scratching to stay alive  
He's lying on his belly.  
One finger needed to rip apart,  
The soul Belial carries.  
Point your finger, scream in vain,  
Not a soul is listening!  
Never fast, you'll feel the pain,  
Long cold barrel glistening!  
  
Down the dead end street, he strikes to kill the weed.  
I call the Devil, laughing as you bleed.  
  
Prepare for your new life.  
Satan waits, to, night!!!  
  
No one cried when it was over,  
Your life it had no meaning.  
Even friends of J.A.R.  
Quickly lost all feelings.  
You had warnings, you had time,  
Well that was all you gave it.  
Said one day you'd be mine,  
Your life you couldn't save it!!!  
  
Angels raining down, stories that they tell.  
J.J. played with fire! now he burns in Hell.  
  
Prepare for your new life.  
Satan waits to, night!  
  
Higher! Higher! Feel the fire!  
She burns at the stake like a witch!  
Kill her! Slash her, slit her throat!  
There's nothing I dispise more, than a bitch!!!  
Burn her tonight!  
Run, hide from the Demon's fate,  
To late, the fire is lit!!!  
  
Come in a sit for awhile  
Come in and feel the fire.  
Feel the heat, feel the fire,  
Fire of desire!!!  
Fall in! Fall in! Ahahahaha  
Feel the fire!!!

Wishful thinking, eyes are blinking,  
In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.  
  
Untruth spoke through blistered lip,  
Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,  
Won't go away.  
  
Born! to follow!  
To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.  
Now! to borrow!  
A match, ignite the gasoline,  
To burn away.  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream,  
In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.  
On a binge of self destruction,  
  
Children of the reconstruction,  
Suck the tit of discontent,  
Go away.  
  
Slam! slam down!  
Respond in kind malcontent,  
Don't go away.  
Burn! burn down!  
  
Temple of the conscience,  
Don't go away.  
  
I was soaked in gasoline,  
Playin' with a match.  
I was everything I seemed,  
They stood and watched.  
  
Ate from your table!  
Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!  
  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.  
Take away my dignity, take away my pain,  
Take just for taking, we are one in the same...  
  
Burn... Burn...  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.

I'm your destructive pride  
Your homegrown, goddamn genocide  
The standard behind which you hide  
I'm at your door, right by your side, so  
  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
  
I'm the hate, the jealousy  
I can magnify the agony  
The self-destructive qualities  
So won't you come and go with me, and  
  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
  
My lack of tolerance nice as you please  
My interference put them down at their knees  
  
I am your hopeless, despondent  
Your derelict hole  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
I am your illness, your ailment  
The hole in your soul  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
My lack of tolerance nice as you please  
My interference put them down at their knees  
  
I am your hopeless, despondent  
Your derelict hole  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
I am your illness, the ailment  
The hole in your soul  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go, high  
Go, higher  
Go

Ain't nobody listening, ain't nobody there  
Somebody is screaming this ain't fair  
30 pieces glistening, speak up if you dare  
That is what the book said if you care  
  
Sheep and God, the fourth, independence  
Waiting to be led  
Deep the pain, the sting of dependence  
This is what he said  
  
I'll take you all the way  
A lifetime spent in just one day  
I'll take you out the other side  
It's my hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
  
Think that something's missing or something's just not fair  
Somebody is hanging over there  
I was at my own christening, I wasn't quite aware  
I didn't have the choice to even dare  
  
I fell asleep at night independence  
Waiting for the word  
In nightmares and deceit of dependence  
This is what I heard  
  
I'll take you anyway  
Hopeless, faithless, it's okay  
I'll take you on the lifetime ride  
It's my hellish pride  
  
Fire  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
I got no pride  
  
I'll take you all the way  
I'll take you anyway  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun  
Like fire as the day is won  
You got to know that it's cold outside  
Why don't you come for a ride?  
I got a hellish pride  
  
Sweet Jesus in the midnight sun

All those dreams and broken glass.  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash.  
Never to be seen again.  
Now you're makin' a home in a garbage can!!!  
  
But here's a little story that I lived to tell.  
Hello from the gutter!  
Hello from our little hell!  
  
Wasted days, wasted nights.  
Hypnotized by the city lights!  
Another king, another queen.  
Livin' in the shadows so they can't be seen!  
Remember all the world lies at your feet.  
And the big apple's rotten,  
Rotten in the heat.  
  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello! Hello!  
  
Hello from the gutter!!!  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello! Hello!  
Hello from the gutter!!  
  
Gutter child, sweet sixteen.  
Broadway stars that have never been!!!  
All those dreams and broken glass,  
Swept down the sewer with the rest of the trash.  
  
Well here's a little story that we lived to tell.  
Hello from the gutter!  
Hello from our little hell!  
  
Hello from the gutter.  
Hello from the gutter. Hey!  
  
Welcome the the gutter!  
We've been expecting you!

[Originally performed by Black Sabbath]  
  
I'm looking through a hole in the sky  
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie  
I'm getting closer to the end of the line  
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine  
  
I'm living in a room without any view  
I'm living free because the rent's never due  
The synonyms of all the things that I've said  
Are just the riddles that are built in my head  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
  
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun  
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun  
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars  
I don't believe there's any future in cause  
  
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven  
Window in time, through it I fly  
Yeah  
  
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast  
I've seen the western world go down in the east  
The food of love became the greed of our time  
But now I'm living on the profits of pride

Critical moments pass,  
And doctrines of fools will last.  
I am just trying to cope,  
Into my horroscope.  
  
Through eyes and ears they bleed,  
Reciting their holy creed.  
Heeding but one request,  
The future, is put to, rest...  
  
Bless me in darkened days,  
Down to my knees I pray.  
I am just trying to cope,  
Within this horrorscope.  
In the wake of all frustration,  
I begin to loose control.  
  
Watched as the weapons fired,  
Bombs burst in the air...  
Burned in the fields of fire!  
  
Standing in the middle of nowhere.  
Watched as the weapons fired,  
Baptized in fields of fire!  
  
Well,  
The change in here, an' the future clear.  
I can feel it coming.  
So full of hate, its geting late!  
Yeah, I know its coming.  
When all the choice turned to just one voice,  
Yeah, the wind is turning.  
  
This is your horrorscope...  
  
Words laced with blasphemy,  
Drip with sincerity.  
Falling into the plan,  
Like sacrificial lambs.  
  
Hearing the words and said,  
Rings like nail, to the head.  
Now I can see the stars,  
I know we have gone too far.  
  
Baptized in fields of fire,  
Watched as the weapons fired.  
  
This is your horoscope

You point that little finger out  
You got four pointing back at you  
It goes everywhere you go  
Does everything you do  
  
He got roughed up on the inside  
Screaming that this ain't fair  
And in a blocked moment alone on the inside  
Thought that no one cared  
You want me, you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
So he puts in a call to his only friend  
He dials 1-800-FEAR  
Then he hid his face inside his hands  
You know he wasn't very clear  
Said I'm roughed up on the inside  
You know that this ain't fair  
And in a new york minute, he felt like a million  
Cause he knew somebody cared and said  
I have but a nation in me for everyone to see  
I am but a tribute to mediocrity  
I'm your mother, father, brother, son  
I'm a little bit of everyone  
Hide in the shadow cast by the sun  
In constant misery, I'm fear  
You want me,you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
Yes I know you've always loved me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I'm fear  
  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work, it's what I do  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work, and watch what I undo  
  
So he broken-up all his fingers  
While pulling out his hair  
And he broke into a million pieces  
No, nobody cared  
He was beat-up on the inside  
Fighting ' to survive  
Spent a long time dyin' no not for tryin'  
When you want to feel alive  
Seem like total chaos everywhere you turn  
  
When you're wiped out on the inside  
You can't catch your breath  
And in a black out moment  
Alone on the outside, beat him right to dead  
You want me,you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
Yes I know you've always loved me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I'm fear [Repeat x2]

Got so much trouble  
Hate this job  
Tried to get out  
Trapped like a dog  
No I don't like  
  
Pumpin' gas  
Do ya hate to wait  
Life's a game  
Play your rules  
Is the bottle half empty  
Or the bottle half full  
It does no good  
No good to shout  
But I scream I hate  
Say I'm hostile  
Gotta relax  
Better get a grip  
Here's the facts  
I hate bein' here.  
  
I hate people that make ya feel small  
I hate having my back against the wall  
I hate bein' talked down to  
I hate your rules  
I hate them all  
Hate bein' marked to take the fall  
Planet's not big enough for me and you  
  
Got trouble over me  
Surrounded by jerks  
Can't ya see  
Smile to my face  
Know ya lie  
Knife in my back another game  
Rules, rules, rules  
Not for me,  
You fuckin' fool.  
  
So open your mouth  
One more time  
And my foot is goin' down  
In one ear  
Out the other  
A waste of time  
Don't even bother  
I hate bein' here  
  
Think I know  
How ya got this far  
Think I know  
Got where we are  
Think I'll hate you  
Where you'll be dead  
I know it, I hate you  
Smile to my face  
Know to die  
Says the problems  
Ask your self way  
Hate the games  
Hate the rules  
You're gonna loose  
Say I'm hostile  
Gotta relax  
Better get a grip  
Here's the fact  
Not much more of you

Bad or a wet dream,  
Feelin' so in between,  
Gun in my pocket an' a target on my head.  
Right on the wrong road,  
He talks to me through dogs,  
Not sure who it is but I know it ain't God.  
  
Feel like they're watchin' me,  
Know that they're watchin' me,  
C'mon lets go got two tickets to the moon.  
Now what are you supposed to do?  
When they got their hooks in you?  
  
Do you believe me?  
I was there.  
And didja hear it!?  
Yeah  
  
Not my fault, wasn't even there.  
Rest of the world, all gone insane.  
Can ya hear the dogs barkin' can ya hear the dogs speak?  
Seen it on the TV, something gonna break.  
Now how am I supposed to breathe,  
When there is no air?  
And how am I supposed to be!?  
When those hooks are pullin' me  
Down.  
  
If you release me,  
Won't be there.  
If you leave me!!!  
I won't care.  
  
I hear black it has no mercy!  
Repeating in my head.  
  
In my head  
In my  
  
From the inside out, talk to me, in, tongues.  
The worst, of this, I understand,  
That the flies are breeding,  
The wounds are bleeding,  
There'll be no healing in my house.  
  
From the inside out.  
You know I'm not the same!  
  
Repeating in my head  
In my head.

Voluntary action, leading to the scar upon the face  
Planning the reaction, the color, the moment paint the place  
In blood, in fire, calling you back home to the demise  
In black, desire, calling you, witnessing the rise  
  
[Chorus]  
God damn this light  
Take it out  
Let me see what you to hide  
The parasite  
Has his way  
Until the day  
I rise  
  
In pure retribution, remorseful as the moment of his birth  
In reconciliation, he ponders a solution in the dirt  
In blood, in fire, a blessing of the few, immortalize  
In black, desire, a calling to the witness of the rise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Awaken, in time  
God, self, liberty  
Broken into  
Pride all over me  
Soaring, climbing  
Self, god liberty  
Broken by ym  
Drive to set it free  
Fire in my freedom  
Hatred in my heart  
Long live the kingdom  
As the king does fall apart  
  
Back off the ceremony  
Count all the flies  
Fight through the maggots  
To reachthe underly  
Pushing to infinty  
Laughs replaced by cries  
Push into liberty  
Sanctify the rise  
God damn your light  
It's in my eyes  
God dman the will to kill me  
God damn your pride  
  
[Chorus]

I ain't lookin' for a reason,  
I ain't searchin' for my soul...  
I'm findin' all the answers,  
It's the questions I don't know...  
Seen it from the outside!  
Outside lookin' in.  
What's it like to be inside?  
Will I ever stop payin' for my sins?  
Will I see the light of day?  
When will all these dues be paid?  
Send on down a sign to me,  
Or am I too blind too see?  
Ignorance! and innocence, go hand in hand.  
Ignorance! and innocence, am I guilty man?  
Yes I am.  
Takin' rides on a one way street to nowhere.  
I'm lookin' for a sign I understand.  
Passin' time to save my mind,  
Following that road that winds,  
In and out of my own towns of hell.  
Standin' up or layin' down,  
My head goes spinnin' round and round again.  
My head is spinning, head is spinning,  
Ignorance  

Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like politics, I don't like communists  
I don't like games and fun, I don't like anyone  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like Jesus freaks, I don't like circus geeks  
I don't like summer and spring, I don't like anything  
I don't like sex and drugs, I don't like waterbugs  
I don't care about poverty, all I care about is me  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
I don't like playing ping pong, I don't like the Viet Cong  
I don't like Burger King, I don't like anything  
And I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  
Well I'm against it, I'm against it  

Oh my God in blood soaked silhouette  
Oh my God on the end of a bayonet  
Oh my God put wings on the rhetoric  
Oh my God, I'm alright  
  
No pity, salvation or need  
No more on the way  
No pity, toleration or greed  
This is where I lay  
  
Yeah I'm alright  
And I need to know  
When I'm dead and gone  
Where do I go  
  
Jesus Christ in sun baked misery  
Jesus Christ in sun drenched agony  
Oh my God, why have you forsaken me  
Oh my God, now who's taking care of me  
  
No pity, salvation or need  
No more on the way  
No pity, toleration or greed  
This is where I lay  
  
Yeah I'm alright  
And I need to know  
When I'm dead and gone  
Where do I go  
  
Oh my God, in blood soaked silhouette  
Oh my God, I'm alright  
Oh my God, as Satan plays the minuet  
Oh my God, I'm alright  
  
No pity, salvation or need (I'm alright)  
No more on the way (I'm alright)  
No pity, toleration or greed (I'm alright)  
This is where I lay  
  
Yeah I'm alright  
And I need to know  
When I'm dead and gone  
Where do I go

From the islands to the cities, from the ports into the sea.  
We are strong, we will always be...  
Blazing through the wreckage, burning all we see...  
The life we lead, committed to be free...  
  
Our union is a fortress!  
Together we are bound.  
A common bound in freedom, and in sound!!!  
So raise your voices high!  
  
For miles around to hear.  
Let them know, we are drawing near...  
  
In union we stand,  
As they! blaze across the land!!!  
In union, we make a final stand...  
  
A peaceful co-existence, is droping out of sight.  
So band together, together we will fight.  
Blasting the resistance, marching to the top.  
They started this, we say when it stops.  
  
Strike fear within their hearts!  
Strike down those in your way.  
Let them know, that we live, today!!!  
They throw us into flames,  
  
Did not hear our cries.  
But now, from the ashes we arise...

Step on up to the counter boy  
Buy yourself a thrill  
Shake it out with the deepest breath  
As you kneel over your first kill  
God is your protector, he keep you safe and warm  
The funeral director got the contract when you were born  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain  
  
Listen close going to say it one  
You need to get you right  
Use the gifts you were given boy  
Keep the end in sight  
Walk it narrow, walk it clean  
Then to the sky and fly  
I'm the breath that will fill your lungs  
Until the day you die  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain  
  
Start living, start dying  
Start praying, start flying  
(x2)  
Pinning the face to the floor, slamming and locking the door  
  
Start living, start dying  
Start praying, start flying  
(x2)  
Holding the face to the ground  
Turning the world upside down  
  
Come on my way, we got the warmest fire  
Come on my way, I'll find your there  
Come on my way, we got the flying higher  
When on my way, I'll take your prayer  
  
We got our religion, we got everything to ease the pain  
We want retribution, we want everything to ease the shame  
No victory in vain

I'm a wartime killer, I'm a man.  
I'm a peacetime killer!  
Doin' the best I can.  
  
Bless yourself with a fiery hand,  
Spit on the place you stand.  
Don't make amends for what you do,  
Or move on your demands.  
Imagination running wild!  
We're all an only child...  
Product of our environment,  
  
Cut blown and styled.  
  
I'm a wartime killer.  
I'm a man.  
I'm a peacetime killer!  
  
Doin' the best, the best I can.  
  
I adapt to nothing, and nothing pleases me.  
I'm a loaded pistol!  
Just you wait and see.  
  
Infliction, I am here.  
Infection, where do we go from here?  
Inception, made it clear,  
As I move into the plan...  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
At birth I made a deal,  
Called into the killing fields I go.  
  
Doin' the best, that I can.  
  
Cut blown and sty-why-why-yled.  
  
I'm a wartime killer.  
Ya know what I am.  
I'm a peacetime killer!  
Doin' the best, best that I can.  
  
Ya I'm a man.  
Wartime killer.  
Ya man...

Spread it out over time and find out  
Your prone to let it go  
And it lives  
All about the undead devotion  
About to let it go  
You seem to live  
  
Drop me into the mouth of sorrow  
Wait to swallow me  
And it lives  
Pull me out of a dead tomorrow  
As I'm about to give  
I seem to live  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
It lives  
  
Into extinction fall the essence of life  
Spiritual eclipse turns the days into nights  
  
Whitout distinction got-got got to believe  
Threat of extinction put them down on their knees  
  
Cold desolation calling beckoning you  
Into exctinction fades the rest of what is good and true  
  
Tearing into the last remaining  
Shreds of sanity  
And it lives  
Pull me out of undead devotion  
As I'm about to give  
I want to live  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
It lives

It's just like you to talk when I'm not around.  
It's just like you to kick me when I'm down.  
Symptoms of your lunacy,  
Tryin' to be what you can't be!  
I don't want to end up just like you.  
  
I can't hear you,  
I can't see you,  
I won't hear you.  
  
It's just like you to think you're playin' god.  
It's just like me to know you're not.  
Weakening with every day,  
Turn down the sound and fade away,  
No I'll never end up just like you!!!  
  
I don't need you!  
I can read you,  
Never need you.  
You can't see me!  
You can't bleed me.  
Cold and empty,  
Just like you.  
  
There lies a fallen man...  
Fallen by his own hand!  
Once the way it used to be...  
Believed in you but now I'm free!  
I believed in you but now I'm free!  
Now I'm free!  
  
It's just like you  
I don't need you!  
I can read you,  
Never need you.  
You can't see me!  
You can't read me.  
I set me free!  
Just like you

They came to the land, to kill on command.  
They ride through the dark of the night.  
Metal warrior stands over victims whose hands  
Grab for their last chance of life.  
  
Bright shields! sharp swords!  
March forward for their Lord.  
Set the bow, rulers come  
Meet your maker.  
Battle cries! silent screams!  
Submerge the Devil in evil dreams  
Feel the blade, rulers come  
Meet your maker.  
  
I live for the kill, I do it at will  
Let the weak ride back to the lair.  
Now they will kneel to leather and steel  
Gasp for the last breath of air.  
  
Blood runs! heads roll!  
Enemy fear, take the soul  
Set the bow, rulers come  
Meet your maker.  
Lash out! strike first!  
Blood of the dead quench my thirst  
Feel the pain, rulers come  
Meet your maker.  
  
A gilded warrior wonders why...  
His fear becomes new life on high...  
Looking down... the dead won't tell.  
Why his soul existence lives on in Hell.  
Long live the spirit...!  
In a life that knows no end...  
Many pass before him...  
Many in the wind.

A sense of peace was falling on the universal night  
And it gave me a pause to reason why I live  
To never cease the calling of the consequential right  
And it gave me cause and reason why they give  
The first thing I remember was the shadow 'cross my heart  
And they matched the beauty hidden in their soul  
  
The next was 'cross the universe, as it came apart  
And the sum of the parts became whole  
  
Stalking and hunting, profession in blood  
Working the night to a throne  
Chalking an outline, experience must  
Invisible, never alone  
  
I can take you anywhere  
Take all that you give  
I can free you from despair  
Killing just to live  
  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
Killing for a living, killing just to live  
  
I looked across the answers, though questions didn't exist  
And found that I was never alone  
We cut away the cancer and continued to resist  
But the outcome of the night remained unknown  
The next thing I remember were the years across my face  
And they matched only the beauty of scars  
The next was 'cross the universe into time and space  
And to know together, we'd have to go too far  
  
Bleeding a nation, casualty time  
Breaking the back of the core  
Promised salvation, a casual crime  
Feeding and fucking the whore  
Make my living on borrowed time  
I make the clock stand still  
Keep my hands 'round what is mine  
Living just to kill  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
  
C'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your best  
C'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to rest  
I can give you reasons, 2-5 to the bone  
They can give you all you ever wanted  
When you're far away from home  
C'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your best  
C'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to rest  
  
So as the plot will thicken and time is not a friend  
The blessing comes but one in a life  
Across the crowded universe that hastens to an end  
Through memories of one time in a night  
And what will I remember through the by and by  
To have and hold and turn about the chill  
That this was not the pause to die  
But to live to kill

Seems they got a runaround, a runaround where they stand  
All over, yeah, all over you  
Think they got an underground, an underground where they plan  
Right under, yeah, right under you  
Think you get the left hand  
Backhand slap, then you're going to do your living on the downside  
  
God can't hear when I call  
And God can't know, just when I fall  
God can't see where I stand  
So God can't be my left hand man  
All I have is hatred when the fire fills my eye  
Right under, yeah, right under me  
And all I have is fate when the numbers fill the sky  
Right over, yeah, right over me  
Think I'll use the left hand  
  
Am I spent, laid-out got no more to see  
With a locked down, tight clamp all over me  
No love, just like before, am I one more, no more  
Have I crashed, crashed and burned  
Have I cashed in, not to return  
Have I taken, taken my last ride  
Do you feel what I feel inside  
Over, over and done  
Well I found something that I can't outrun  
Watching, waiting, open the door  
Am I one more, no more

Here-here, got the lock-down cover me  
Fear-fear, got the in to let it out  
So near, feel its breath all over me  
Everything is inside, nothing going out  
I hear you, I see you, I put you out  
I hate you, I love you, I burn you down  
Got the need, right here to let it out  
Got the need, light the match and let it burn  
[CH]  
Listen here to the fire, as it burns up your back  
Take your heart, gonna let it burn listen here to the fire  
You're sure lookin' tired with a knife in your back  
Through your heart, man that's gotta burn, listen here to the fire  
Unclear where to start and where to end  
I know what the need is all about  
So near I can feel it eating me  
Everything upside, upside down  
I smell you, I taste you, what you're about  
I loath you, I adore you to the ground  
Got the need right here to let it out  
Got the need, light the match and let it burn  
[CH]  
[BR]  
I don't seek the answers to the questions that I learn  
I don't start the fires I lay back and watch them burn  
I see ashes floating transformed the way they used to be  
I see ashes floating down they come to cover me

Here come Mr. 'I ain't like that', Mr. 'You can count on me'.  
Here come evolution, walkin' with stupidity.  
  
Waste a' time, waste a' my time.  
Give it up, lay it down, play the bottom line.  
Waste a' time, waste a' prime time.  
Hey! Let me shut that for you.  
  
There go no-one get over me, Mr. 'Not behind your back',  
Muthafucka got a larger than life, full a' shit, short a' fact.  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world... tonight,  
All over the world, you can hear the sound.  
Know what I mean?  
  
Sit down, and shut up.  
Sit the fuck down, and shut the fuck up.  
  
Stoop muthafucka gettin' under my skin.  
Runnin' away with that mouth again,  
Ah ah ah got nothin' better to do,  
S.M.F. let me shut that for you!  
  
Waste a' time, waste a' my time.  
Give it up, lay it down, play the bottom line.  
Waste a' time, waste a' prime time.  
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

It took three damn days for the mission man  
Heard he's comin' straight from hell  
With a fast track bleedein' and siren screamin  
If you don't listen you could never tell  
  
Three days dead and risin'  
Where you goin' now.I widh you well  
Three days dead and risin'  
With a half head full a ' dreams I could never sell  
  
Let us prey  
Three days gone for the misson man  
Three days gone and risin'  
Three days gone hear the mission man say  
  
Time to get down to business  
Let us prey  
He walked in like the duke he was the mission man  
He had death leakin' from his eyes  
  
Machine gun bigger with his linger of the trigger  
Said it took me three days to rise  
Three days dead and risin'  
I think these here are yours. I couldn't tell  
  
Three days dead and risin'  
Then he handed on back the dreams that he couldn't sell  
Lord I got a bleeder it a taste track feeder  
And it nailed me down tight for the rest a' my life  
  
It's a double damn shot a ' what I need when I want it  
And it's givin' me redemption through the darkest og night  
Lord I lost the lightenin' it was so damn frightenin'  
And it pulled me up close like I was losin my life  
  
Was a double damn shot, knocked me down, yeah I got it  
And it givin' me some light through the rest a' my life

Nailed to the cross by just words,  
Crucifixion complete.  
Close enough to the fire...  
To feel temptation's heat.  
It's gone away to taste the ground,  
Replaced by the incessant sound of fear.  
  
There's a ring in my ears,  
I'm bleeding from my heart.  
Far away from love...  
The execution starts.  
Made us what we are today,  
A lonely pile of disarray.  
  
We are the children of a new regime  
We are the children of a new machine.  
  
Mass production, thought controlled.  
No I never knew my heart.  
No. Never knew the love...  
That made them fall apart.  
It's gone away to taste the ground,  
Replaced by the incessant sound we hear.  
  
We are the children  
Ya, the children  
What of the children?  
We are the children of the new machine.  
What of the children?  
We are the children of the new machine.  
The new machine.

Seen you in the mirror when the story began  
And I fell in love with you, I love your mortal sins  
Your love is straight away but I love your company  
I only ever leave you when you got no money  
  
I got no emotions for anybody else  
Better understand I'm in love with myself  
Myself, my beautiful self  
  
No feelings, no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
  
Hello and goodbye and a runaround Sue  
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue  
I kick you in the head, you got nothing to say  
Get out of the way 'cos I gotta getaway  
  
You never realize, I take the piss out of you  
You come up and see me  
And I'll beat you black and blue  
Okay, I'll send you away  
  
No feelings, no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
Except for myself, my beautiful self, yeah  
  
Ain't no moonlight after midnight  
I see you stupid people out looking for delight  
Well, I'm so happy, I'm feeling so fine  
Watching all the rubbish, you wasting my time  
  
Look around your house, you got nothing to steal  
Kick you in the brain, tell you get down to kneel and pray  
You pray to your God  
  
No feelings, no feelings  
Ain't no feelings for anybody else  
No feelings, no feelings  
No feelings for anybody else  
  
Except for myself, your daddy's gone away  
Back another day  
[Incomprehensible]

You know when I think of you  
And I feel to let it out  
For what we did pursue  
And all we were about  
And when I think of Who  
Flooding me with light  
Don't think you need to hear this  
Yeah, you did it right  
  
[Chorus]  
It's over, but yeah, we have taken the light  
It's over, by winning for losing the fight  
Over, it's over, it's over  
It's gone into flight  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
I found meaning  
In the words that you would speak  
And I found strength  
Inside the fact that we were weak  
And when I picture you  
Covered in our rags  
If this man shall fall  
Who will take the flag  
  
Hard rubber and a wind-blown face  
Got a full-blown eight-eight  
To get us home  
No trouble got an extra ace  
A stand-up, throw-up  
Never let me be alone  
Over, it's over, it's over  
You've taken my lights  
Over, it's over, it's over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
  
To have known you  
Still helps to get me through  
And to thank you now  
Is all that I could do  
And when I motor on  
On into the night  
I know that you are there  
I know you are my lights  
  
Over, it's over, it's over  
You've taken my lights  
Over, it's over, it's over  
Right here by my side  
As I ride  
There's no light  
As I ride

Old enough to know better  
Too young to core  
Bent on self destruction  
Goin' nowhere  
If I had a reason  
I could make it work for me  
If I had an answer  
  
I wouldn't be so hard to see  
I'm feelin' just the same  
I'm feelin' just no pain  
I'm not goin' down the drain  
  
Make my own decisions  
Just go away  
Take the consequences  
Just not today  
Got enough reasons  
Still not workin' for me  
Got enough answers  
Still so hard to see  
Somethin' is confusin' me  
Somethin' is abusin' me  
Somethin' is refusin' me. life  
  
Let me live.I want to give  
I've been through hell and back  
So many times before  
Take me there  
I don't care where  
And show me why  
There's nothin' to die for too.  
  
Old enough to know better  
Too dead to change  
Went in with a full deck  
Goin' out deranged  
  
Thought I had a reason  
Tried, it didn't work for me  
I had all the answers  
I was too blind to see  
Mirror man in my eye  
Mirror man make you cry  
Mirror man make you die.

Strangled in this knot of sin,  
He returns, again begins.  
Again to bend, and tear the will.  
A witness to this Overkill!!!  
  
Awaken! Awaken in me,  
Through my eyes! through my eyes you will see,  
What is real, what is to be.  
All the madness, madness in me...  
  
You taste the blood that I long for,  
Regain my strength and complete my chore...!  
  
Like a serpent!, poised to strike.  
Like the moon... that, fills the night.  
You, the question, answer they cried.  
You've always been destined to ride.  
  
Passion rests in an empty will,  
The nightmare continues.  
  
Into the night!  
A rider goes then disappears,  
Out! of the light.  
He reappears again.  
  
Beware!  
One eye does follow you.  
To kill again!  
And again!!!  
  
Slow and sure, a beating heart.  
Is sure to have, the killing starts  
The beating stops, fin de la vie.  
Overkill rides again!!!  
  
A killer like no man,  
A faster death, by one's own hand.  
Safety comes, when the wind is still.  
This the legend, Overkill!

Leave... don't try.  
They die to get inside.  
A falling out, between you and your pride.  
No... don't go.  
  
There's something you should know.  
This blinding light, can tear apart your soul.  
Shattered dreams.  
Are not all that they seem.  
  
The light can change from white to blue to green.  
Left to right.  
There's power in the night.  
And the power surge,  
Driven by the light!  
  
Power! building up,  
Power! all around you,  
Power! you feel it.  
Power! a power surge!  
  
Stay... away.  
There's something I must say.  
This light reduces all that's in it's way.  
In... the dark.  
  
Ignited by a spark.  
A fire burns, a fire makes its mark!  
See the flash.  
A mountain turns to ash.  
  
Recollection, echoes of the past.  
Right to left,  
Power's what you get.  
And the power surge,  
Isn't over yet!  
  
Power! building up,  
Power! it's coming back,  
Power! feel it.  
Power! power surge!  
  
Coming out of the sun.  
There are battles to be won.  
Colors change from blue to red.  
Forgotten heroes, piles of dead.  
  
A mass of steel, down in flame.  
Power surge remains the same.  
Commandeer turns to dust,  
The mass of steel begins to rust...  
  
Power! building up,  
Power! coming back,  
Power! in the air!.  
Power! a power surge!

Wishing never got us what we needed  
So we waited for our salvation to arrive  
Then it took everything that we loved  
And it let us alive  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
Solitary movement meant for two  
Can you hear the loneliness in silent cries  
If you take everything that I love  
Leave me to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
If you take everything that I love  
And you leave here,  
Leave me alive  
If you take everything thet I love  
And I'm standing here  
Waiting to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go

Feel the power, rushing forward, it gets into your veins.  
Almighty power, building higher, you'll never be the same!  
I'm wanting more, I'm getting more of the feelings you can't tame.  
I'm the master, you're the bastards, are you glad you came!?  
  
The sign of life, your blood is red  
Come with us and raise the dead!  
  
Electric fusion, no illusion, terror in the night!  
Screaming thunder, white face murder, we complete the fright.  
The earth is shaking, ground is breaking, we complete the rite.  
The time has come for you to run, now take off in the night  
  
See the stone above his head  
Rise three days the prophet said  
The sign of life, your blood is red  
Come with us and raise the, dead!  
  
Behind the headstone he is watching you  
Watching every move  
Behind the headstone see the body move  
Come to get fresh blood!!  
  
Are you glad you came?  
Raise the! Raise the! Raise the!  
Dead!!!

I have got a secret, hidden behind my eyes.  
A violation tragedy! of violence hate and lies.  
Locked deep within a chamber, dark reccesses of my mind...  
A tribute to insanity! through hours days and time.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
Recite the testimonial, truth and nothing more.  
Accusations nominal! fall rotten to the core.  
So take a look, read a book, reach a new plateau...!  
But stain the soul a life you took,  
you know not what I know.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
Misguided youth the bitter truth  
Nothing left to chance...  
Fallen angel seeking adventure, new romance.  
How dare you touch you take the soul  
Of one so pure so... white..!  
The violation tragedy  
Took all she had that... night!!!  
  
Rotten! to the core  
  
I have got a secret hidden behind my eyes.  
A violation tragedy! of violence hate and lies.  
Recite the testimonial, truth and nothing more.  
Accusations nominal! fall rotten to the core.  
  
Rotten! to the core  
To the core!  
  
Rot rot, rot rot, rot  
Rot rot, rot rot, rotten! rotten! rot!  
To the core!!!

Damned at birth, the child king born.  
The prophets warned beware the second son.  
Born to lead! And then raised in peace and harmony  
My fellow man and I live as one.  
  
Together forever!  
Forever in the kingdom of the son!  
  
Watched in fear, another day the final year!  
The light that fills our sky begins to die.  
Haunted dreams.I sleep in terror wake in screams!  
The scent of burning flesh fills sacred skies.  
  
Skies filled with slaughter.  
And slaughter from the order in my mind!  
  
History unfolds as the prophets had fortold  
And lightning strikes, the fire fills my eyes.  
Hell hath claimed another soul now  
Watch the spirit die.  
  
Evil minds now rule my destiny!!!  
A Sinner by my side won't set me free.  
Thoughts of pain and power fill my veins.  
All fear my name!!!  
You were warned, of the child born  
Beware!  
  
Feel the fire! Expect no mercy!  
Olympus burns! Father forgive me!!!  
Know my wrath brother before me  
Beware

I watch the smoke drift, from my cigarette.  
I hear the roaches cross the floor.  
Slam dance around me, in my chair I sit.  
The grey's leakin' through the door.  
There's a shade of grey! I've never seen before  
  
My gaze fixed on, the space beneath the door.  
My life flash. before my eyes  
All this sweat grew from one solitary drop  
Grey's movin' cross the floor.  
  
We walk alone, no one beside us!  
It's never simple as black or white.  
We should have known, no one would find us!  
That we would all wind up in  
Shades of grey  
  
"It seems like every time I get a chance, is quite naked.  
And as I turn around, as I turn around, and  
Inside there's no doubt its gonna happen again"  
  
Nobody listenin', so I talk to myself.  
Sometimes I pay me no, mind  
I lost this argument, so very long ago  
The right words were so hard to find  
I can't breathe in the grey!  
An' I can't find the key to the door

Last time you saw me,  
I was walking, out the door.  
Got a nasty habit,  
Comin', back for more.  
Ain't just a threat no!  
It's a promise, well kept.  
So when all is said and done,  
I came to shred  
  
Shred! Simply stated,  
Shred! In a word.  
Shred! Simply stated,  
Shred!  
  
Dirty little rumor, circulating round  
Spreadin' like the plague. in every little town.  
Capturing the spirit! and goin' to the head.  
Comin' from a blindspot,  
Comin' out to shred! shred!  
  
You know me  
  
Go!  
Next time you see me!  
I'll be walking, through that door.  
And all those nasty habits,  
Risin' up once more.  
Here comes the promise,  
In actions not said.  
So make no bones about it  
I'm back to shred!  
  
You or me.  
Shred! Simply.  
Shred! Shred!  
Shred! In a word  
Shred! Shred! Shred!  
Shred!!! Shred!

Bless me with that special pain,  
That makes a man feel right as rain.  
My soul-a-fire, feelin' so alive in your own way.  
  
If you need a reason,  
To get some healin'.  
If your spirit's bleedin'  
Then get some healin'!!!  
  
I need a new religion!!!  
  
Laughin' like a true believer,  
Laughin' hard the true deceiver.  
Without a worry in this world no friend of time.  
  
Do we get higher?  
Ha ha ha higher  
Are we all higher?!  
In a spiritual void.  
  
One for neglecting me,  
And two on the way to three.  
No I never felt so low I never, felt so low as in this void!  
  
Bless us all with what we need!  
Self indulgent constant greed.  
What's mine is mine is mine you get your own leave me alone.  
  
Spiritual void.

Levelled, hammered, gone today  
God will have me his own way  
Smokin' hun is what I see  
Do you know am I free  
  
Face it, kill it  
Beat it to the ground  
Turn it, burn it  
Gone without a sound  
Struck down  
  
Locked and tortured by the dream  
Fight the demon to be clean  
Wanton wounds are why I bleed  
Do you know, can I see  
  
[Chorus]  
Face it, kill it  
Beat them where they stand  
Turn it, burn it  
Fire through your hand  
Release them into nothing  
Give them upside down  
Cut the ties that bind you tight  
Commend them to the ground  
Release them into nothing  
You stand, struck down  
  
Hear me screaming up to heaven  
Watch me fall to hell  
Hear me, hear us  
We are the gone  
The horde rejected  
See me, see us  
We are the ones  
The ones protected  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ashes-ashes, dust to dust  
God will have me if he must  
Demon crawl all over me  
Did you know, I'm not me  
  
[Chorus]

Cool muthafucka in a deep blue sea,  
I said I loose my mind.  
Cool muthafucka in through what I see,  
I said that I don't mind.  
  
He said walk on through, we been waitin' for you,  
There's a place set at the table  
Welcome, home is where the heart is,  
And since ya been gone my heart's been broke in two.  
  
Your return among the strangest see,  
Your life's gone through some changes,  
Don't recognize you  
Don't don't don't don't don't recognize  
  
Down home to the cool cool water  
Down home to the cleansing water  
  
Cool muthafucka said I know your name,  
But do ya know your god?  
Cool muthafucka said I had your pain,  
Ya, then I blew my wad.  
  
My god made love and my god made pain,  
I feel at home among the insane,  
I see sunshine in the pourin' rain,  
Welcome home oh yes I recognize you  
  
See ya been rearranged to suit,  
And you know we'll never change,  
What they put ya through  
What they put, what they put, what they put 'ya  
  
Move it to the right now.  
  
Jesus cleanse me, can you hear him?  
Jesus cleanse me now

I am the head, you are the heart  
I am the dead, you are the start  
I am the wind, you are the rain  
  
Will you beg for mercy, will you kneel and pray  
What will make the nightmares go away (judgement day)  
Will you stop pretending, everything's ok  
As you drag your bones, another perfect day  
  
Go  
I am the dead, you are the heart  
I am the dead, you are the start  
I am the wind, you are the rain  
I've always sinned, you feel the pain  
  
Will you take my sorrow  
Will you call my name  
Will you be tomorrow  
Know the pain  
  
I'm your shadow, curtain call, I keep the hounds at bay  
The air you breath is what I choose today  
Right behind you, catch your fall, stumble left of light  
No pax Romana, now, forever night

An all out panic, thrashing  
Splitting you in half  
Mistook the sobbing for a laugh  
Travel close concealed  
I'll leave the dorr ajar  
So who has taken you this far  
You've been here before  
  
Call if you need  
I'm right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and you'll bleed  
As the demon appear  
It's time to stand, deliver  
And if you know me  
  
[Chorus]  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot (golden gun)  
I am you're voice in the sliver  
(I am, I am, I am the one)  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot (golden gun)  
(I am, I am, I am the one)  
  
Now when you get inside  
Be careful what you say  
Don't be mistaken for the prey  
Low to the ground is best  
Attend to the bizarre  
So who has taken you this far  
I've seen you before  
  
Call if you need  
I'm right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and you'll bleed  
As the demon appear  
It's time to stand, deliver  
  
[Chorus]

Listen up now  
Got a fistful of reason  
And a faceful of fear  
That I wear with a frown  
As the killer does bow  
Time will allow  
As I pass through the season  
And it all comes clear that  
The killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me, where I got to go  
Show me, what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
[Chorus]  
The sound you hear  
Crystal clear  
Is the sound of fear  
The sound of dying, dying  
  
Right to a fault  
Methodic perfection  
There's a road to the left  
That I walk to see  
Does the killer know me  
Come into the vault  
With a daily rejection  
And on though the tears  
That the killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me, where I got to go  
Show me, what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just for killing  
Just got to move me  
Just in time  
Because, someone better kill me  
Dumb and willing  
Just enough to lose me  
Killer comes calling  
On a misty night in Jersey  
Will you let him in  
Will you be his friend  
Will you take him to the place  
Where you want it to end  
Killer comes killin'  
On a misty night in Jersey  
Hear the sound of dying  
  
Listen up now  
Got a fistful of reason  
And a faceful of fear  
That I wear with a frown  
As the killer does bow  
Time will allow  
As I pass through the season  
And it all comes clear that  
The killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me, where I got to go  
Show me, what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
[Chorus]

Come and get it, hit it like a lightning strike  
Come and get it, wear it like an iron spike  
They ain't got your number and no, nobody's right  
Come and get it like you mean it, it'll be alright  
  
No more talking, no end result  
Subterranean Resistance Cult  
  
Now you got it, hold it, like it means your life  
Never going to let it go, grip it to the oh so tight  
And no one gives forgiveness, when nothing's going right  
Now you got it, shine it up yeah and take a bite  
  
No more talking 'bout where you've been  
Welcome home with a cup of sin  
No more talking to end result  
Subterranean Resistance Cult  
  
C'mon give me lower c'mon give me deep  
C'mon take me underground up here the talk is cheap  
Gone underground, sink it deep  
Sink it deep  
Gone underground, sink it deep  
Sink it deep  
C'mon give me lower, c'mon give me deep  
C'mon take me underground up here the talk is cheap

"Aw, you up against it now mother fuckers!  
You think you're big time?! You gonna fucking die! Big time!  
You ready?! Here come the pain! "- Al Pachino 'Carlito's Way'  
  
Waiting for my heart to stop, I hear it beating in the dark,  
It keeps me up here, where I lay.  
A constant source of agrivation for an overactive imagination,  
Keeps me awake, here where I lay.  
I.... Will wait.  
I will I will wait!  
  
Sizing up a brand new rope, to use it now would be a joke,  
To hang me up here, where I wait.  
Turning on the light that blinds me, to make it easier to find me,  
And light me up here, where I wait.  
I.... Will wait!  
I will I will wait!  
  
(Not the smell of mercy on me!) Erase the pain of what I know,  
Not the smell of mercy on me!  
(Not the smell of mercy on me!)I'm reaching down into a new high in lows! Not
the smell of mercy on me!  
  
Hey hey hey hey,  
What's been doin' where ya comin' from?  
Hey hey hey,  
Where you been hiding? Been missing more than some.  
Took a ride when I should'a walked,  
Got there way to fast.  
Should'a listened 'stead of talked,  
First become the last.  
  
Waiting for my heart to stop, I hear it beating in the dark,  
It keeps me up here, where I wait.  
But I... Will wait.  
I will I will wait!  
  
(4 again)  
Not the smell of mercy on me! (new high in lows!)  
Not the smell of mercy on me! (8x)

Out on this road takes its toll  
And you pay for everything you do  
Under lights, made me blind  
This place is the same as last night  
Out of control takes its toll  
But you learn to live with your dreams  
Speaking your mind to those you find  
Listening to what you have to say  
I wouldn't change the way  
I wouldn't stop the decay  
  
Promised the world, as your world  
Changed before your eyes  
And the days became the weeks  
And the weeks the years  
And no one remembers that very first day  
Or how it slipped away  
Forever I wait, pulling in, pulling out  
As the motors whine  
To remind me I'm home  
And I'm here to stay  
As we decay  
Another day  
Decay away  
  
I'm goin' home, I don't know where  
I'm goin' home, not far from here  
  
Out on this road, paint this toll  
Make me whole, set the stage  
Fill it with anger, fill it with rage  
No I don't know what's today  
I know it falls in the years of decay  
Self, sacrifice, every night  
And together we paid a price in blood  
That spilled out through the years  
And another day passes away  
Look to the black, drawn farther back  
Look to each day, see the decay  
Times I've had, good and bad  
Win or lose, this is what I choose

The hands of the wicked  
They lie and they wait for you  
Servants remember  
The torture you put us through  
Living in fear  
Thoughts that never knew.  
Your day has come and  
Time has caught up with you!!!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you  
  
You wish forever  
The life you have will last  
You can not deceive us  
Remember your evil past.  
We're! gonna get you  
Destined for the other side  
Nowhere to run.  
No place to hide!!!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you  
Your life is through  
  
There's, no tomorrow, beginning or end  
No choice of life, it lies in the hands  
Their minds are made, in the end  
No tomorrow, cause you are dead!!!  
  
Then caught alive, your soul set us on fire  
You scream for mercy, the flames and they burn you higher  
Wished with hope not the truth that you would find  
But its hard to live when life is so blind!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you

Nothing but lying and killing and dying in this dream  
Anything better than what we better believe  
No mention of freedom no glory hallelu  
No mention you freedom I'm coming home for you  
Life was but of a simple dream of doing what was right  
Broken into pieces as day turns into night  
Life was but a simple dream now all I see is red  
Broken into fragments by the thunderhead  
  
Send the word ahead don't want to be alone  
Time to wake the dead I'm coming home  
Send this word ahead now I'm cast in stone  
Feel the thunderhead I'm coming home  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming  
  
Everyone crying and burning and frying in my dream  
Everyone needs just a little bit more to believe  
Intention no bleeding thinking what I have to do  
Intention more bleeding I'm coming home for you  
Life was just a simple dream of doing what was right  
Broken into pieces when day turned into night  
Life was but a simple dream now all I see is red  
Broken into fragments feel the thunderhead

Violent indecision, surge of mass religion  
Let me out of prison  
I'm just killing time  
Every time I turn around  
I start to hear familiar sound  
Counting down as time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill  
  
Time to kill  
  
All the mental anguish  
Speaks a common language  
I have yet to lavish a chance to walk away  
Every time I turn around  
I start to hear a familiar sound  
Counting down as time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill  
  
Unknowing, unseeing  
Revelations unfold before your eyes  
Relenting, repenting.  
No time to think or compromise  
Time falling, time calling  
Into a void and seal the past  
You're waiting, annihilating,  
Making it real, making it last  
Worn out compromises  
Must be out of rises  
See through all the lies  
We don't walk away  
Every time we turn around  
Start to hear that familiar sound  
New beginnings time stands still  
Yes I think it's time to kill.

Gimme, gimme, gimme some candy baby  
I got the crave I got to fill  
Lemme, lemme, lemme some money, maybe  
I'm gonna buy everything you sell  
Take it on down, take what you want, yeah  
Pay me later, gotta place to be  
Move it on in, take it on over  
What's that face, you know me  
  
Here but now it's gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
[Chorus]  
Unholy fill the moment out  
Of your mind  
The damn has spilled the secret out  
Deaf dumb and blind  
  
want to-want to give ya what you're looking for  
Make it all better like I did before, right  
When you find, when you find you gotta choice  
And the screams you hear are your own voice  
Turn it on up, turn it into stone  
Love me later, gotta, gotta go  
Move it on in, take it on home  
Wipe that face, you don't know  
  
Here but now it's gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Live your life  
Live it through me  
Leave your mind  
Where it should be  
Is the truth  
So hard to find  
Is the truth  
Out of your mind  
  
Here but now it's gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
[Chorus]

Prepare for battle, wait for the time to arrive.  
Unleashing the fury, a gift to me and my kind.  
Suffer little damage, only the strong will survive!!!  
The gift we are given will carry us through the fight.  
  
These are the days of thunder and rage,  
We cry our battle hail...  
The time has come! We take the stage!  
Unleash! The beast within...  
  
Attack!!!  
  
Unleash the weak, lay down by my side.  
To my own memories, a warrior end is mine.  
Accepting the challenge, destroy those who stand in our way!  
Reaction to late, haha! Now you'll pay!  
  
Unleash the beast.  
  
? The gates of hell have opened for you.  
? Forever? The kingdom of?  
Ashes to ashes? The enemies that hide in the night.  
The time has come for you to run, long live the beast tonight.  
  
Divide and conquer, the roar of the crowd fills the air.  
Raise high your hands, a claim to the battle we share.  
Ememy soldiers, they run, try to hide from my sight!  
? The weapons to carry us through the fight.  
To carry us through the fight.

Dope, black suicide  
Eyes that look right through me  
Dead white feeling fine  
The eyes are in a hurry  
Into the ensuing flood  
Look into never be  
Swimming 'round in a pool of blood  
A pool she bleeds for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Time to realize the force inside me  
Seems to paralyze and go away  
Broken and burnin'  
And running the lie  
Breakin' and burnin' me  
Until I die  
  
Stone cold occupied  
Thoughts that I thought I knew  
When only you seem right  
I seem to walk right through you  
Face down in the comfort of  
What you've given me  
I have resolved myself  
To what will never be  
Walking next to me  
The stark reality  
Of what will never be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I had my way  
I'd tear it down  
Start anew, up from the ground  
And dare I say  
I want you near me  
To live inside this world so cold  
Another day  
Another kill me  
Another shot to be so bold  
  
Dope black suicide  
And eyes that like right through you  
Dead white feeling fine  
I could never hurt you  
  
[Chorus]

Zero conversation, words upon a page.  
No communication, no respect.  
Zero but a world of words, a war a simple rage.  
Not worth the time to look in or dissect.  
He said  
  
Wait!!! I'm not ready.  
I wasn't really treated fair  
Wait!!! Not in a hurry,  
I want the time I wasted back when I thought no one cared.  
  
Positively negative, zero minus one.  
He believes, he believes in what he say.  
A lifetime in a moment passes, zero minus one.  
Borrowed time, borrow one more day.  
  
Just enough to keep you down,  
Up to zero!  
Just enough to keep you down.  
  
Just enough to keep you down,  
I'm up to zero!  
Just enough to keep you down.  
  
Wasted, wanted, needed, feel,  
When all is said and done.  
Christened, baptized, spitting on the Son.  
Stop it here, one more deal,  
A moment now to beg or steal.  
A scrap of meat or one last meal?  
Stop it here, stop it here, and  
  
Keep you down

Set in overdrive, makin' money on the side.  
Lookin' for some dirty action.  
Leave 'em on the floor,  
Leave 'em wantin' more.  
Use it for the prime reaction.  
  
Workin' like a dog,  
Tired cold, and bored.  
Stimulate me to satisfaction.  
Alcohol and sluts,  
Pull me from my rut,  
Second only to the attraction.  
  
You! got a lot to learn.  
Your head's up your ass!  
You! got a lot to learn.  
You got no class.  
  
No class.  
  
Take me to the top, never never stop.  
So pretty what's your name, where ya from.  
I see you like the band,  
Don't leave me with my hand,  
Stick around I'll throw you a bone.  
  
No class.  
  
Crack another beer, sit on over here.  
What I need I can't do alone.  
Think that I'm in love, sittin' in your glove,  
What's your name, here I come out, I'm done.  
  
Why don't you use your head.

Who tends the fire  
Who keeps the torches lit  
Who fills your eyes with smoke  
So you can't see  
I need the fire  
I need the torches lit  
To see through all the smoke covering me  
  
I have seen the fires burning  
Burning through the night  
I have watched the tides a turning  
And they go from dark to light  
  
What is this meaning  
What does this writing mean  
Where do I go  
What do I do for now  
Prophecies are foolish  
They never last  
They never speak the truth  
So why are they calling me now.  
  
I don't know cause I cannot see  
All I'm sure is gotta be  
I'm not sure that I'm even me  
But I know that I gotta be  
Yes I know that you're gonna die.  
Birth, life, death, is the reason why  
Save those fears that you're gonna cry.  
Cause I know that you're gonna die  
Yes I know I cannot see  
And I'm sure that I gotta be  
All these voices are killin' me  
But they say that I got  
Say that I got  
Say that I gotta be me.  
  
Who tends the fire  
Who keeps the torches lit  
Who fill your eyes with smoke  
So you can't see  
I need the fire  
I need the torches lit to see

Aggravation, fuelin' me,  
Money powered, hypocrisy.  
I have no feelings, you're much the same.  
We have no feelings, we feel no pain!  
  
I am numb to all I see,  
This the way it has to be,  
Gone is hope, gone is need,  
I know! stone don't bleed.  
  
What's it worth? if I die.  
What's the reason? they all cry.  
I have no feelings, too much the same,  
Not my problem, I feel no blame.  
  
We are blind and we are cold,  
We're afraid of growing old.  
We are numb to all we see,  
Nothing sacred.  
  
Backs turned to madness,  
Backs to misery and I put the,  
Brush to the canvas!  
An' paint a world!  
Paint my world of:  
  
Hurt!  
World of hurt. Of hurt.  
  
We are blind and we are cold,  
Still afraid of growing old.  
We are numb to all we see,  
Nothing sacred.  
  
Hurt!!!  
Paints my world of hurt.  
Paints my world, in my world of!  
In my world of hurt!!!

Ain't no job too big or small,  
Just one sweep of the wreckin' ball.  
Put 'em up, we'll knock 'em down,  
Or knock 'em up, then leave town.  
Demolition of the mind.  
Desolation, left behind.  
Light the fuse, dynamite.  
Light the sky! in the night!  
  
We will walk!  
All over you!  
'Cause we are!  
The wreckin'! Wreckin' crew!  
We are the wreckin' crew.  
  
Wreckin' crew!  
We are the wreckin' crew.  
  
Destruction is a way life.  
Destruction, mayhem, havoc, strife.  
Crack a smile, here the sound.  
Watch 'em crumble to the ground.  
Innocence ain't no excuse,  
Slip your neck inside the noose.  
Pay in blood I demand,  
The wreckin' crew is outta hand.  
  
We'll wreck your neck!  
Wreckin' crew!  
Get wrecked!  
  
Turn to ashes, turn to dust.  
We're the ones that you can trust.  
Evil smile, wicked grin,  
Tear it down, begin to sin.  
Think that you will end it all,  
There's no one left to ball or call.  
When there ain't nothin' left to do,  
Call upon, the wreckin' crew!  
  
We'll wreck your neck!  
Wreckin' crew!  
Yer wreck!  
Ah! Wreckin' crew!  
Wreck! Wreck!
