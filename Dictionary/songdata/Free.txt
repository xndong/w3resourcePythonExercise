Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be wild  
Right from the sky we are born crazy  
Right from the sky we are born to be alive  
  
Day by day same of story  
Same of life starts to get boring  
Always working, always strained  
Gotta be quick cause I can't be late  
Always moving in one direction  
Searching for this thing .............  
Can't get lost, gotta be on the track  
When you move ahead you can never look back  
Then time is come when you gotta break free  
To make the choice to be wild, to be happy  
How fun. And don't let your mind go flat  
That's .............. and that's what is said  
Grab it, taste it, hold it, make it  
Don't think about the chance, just take it  
Life is short, no time to be lazy  
Get on your feet, it's time to get crazy  
  
Don't walk that, we walk like this  
Break the rules, I know you won't miss  
Just be crazy, just be wild  
Just be free like an innocent child  
Show the world, you don't give a damn  
Don't let society ruin your plans  
Don't be afraid to say what you feel  
Take a little break, forget that it's real  
Let the masses go their own way  
You go your way, I'll go my way  
Let your mind control your movement  
Who cares that there's no room for improvement  
Jump, shout, dance, scream  
Activate you act in your dreams  
Remember this when it all seems hazy  
Get on your feet, it's time to get crazy

Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station, oh yeah  
You can tell me why you're feeling down  
  
Is it you mother, though she tends to shout a bit  
But she's got her problems too  
And I don't doubt it  
Baby your father  
I know he's always drinking  
Most of the time  
He don't even know what he's doing  
  
Now baby  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
Gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling down  
  
I can't imagine  
Why you're feeling so alone  
It's just a week since I saw ya  
Baby why are you crying so?  
  
All you got to do is  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling,  
Catch a train to my place  
Call me when you get into town  
I'm gonna meet you at the station  
You can tell me why you're feeling,  
  
Ah baby why you're feeling down  
Down, down, down, down  
Why don't you come around  
Why don't you catch a train  
The midnight train's all right  

Child you're talking of freedom  
Painted on your garden wall  
It's not there at all  
Child you're talking of wisdom  
  
You say wisdom is a golden rule  
You ain't no fool  
But you don't know who it is  
Who calls you name  
  
In the light of the golden moon  
You don't know who it is who brought you here  
And chained up your heart  
So soon  
  
Child you're life is a fairytale  
And it's not the same  
And the clouds  
You're hiding behind  
  
In your misty mind have disappeared  
Like a sailor far from the shores of your dreams  
And far from the love of your home  
Sailor lost on your own misty seas  
  
And the chains on your heart, baby  
Might be my love  
Might be my love  
It's so confusing  
  
And you feel that you're loosing yourself  
But, there over the mountain  
You thought you'd never have to climb  
There's a road  
  
Reaching and stretching  
To the corner of your mind  
Like a river casts aside the dust  
And grows and grows as it flows  
  
The feeling deep inside of you  
Must break like a dam  
  
So set you free  
So set you free  
So set you free.

It makes me sad to think of you  
Because I understand the things you do  
There is no one else can take your place  
In my life alone I hide my face  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
There was a time, it's in the past  
I thought our love was born to last  
But now you say you are torn in two  
That's what my love has done for you  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
It makes me sad to think of you  
Because I understand the things you do  
There is no one else can take your place  
In my life alone I hide my face  

I was on my way to a needle factory  
Up and coming prospects was a waiting there for me  
I was selling my wares three bucks a share  
Three bucks a share  
Three bucks a share  
  
I was walking down, down a rocky road and found  
A noisy rising sun and a quietly burning moon  
They were standing in line, standing in time  
Standing in time waiting for a fantastic time  
Standing in line  
  
Like a stallion chasing fear itself  
Watching God sit upon his shelf  
We were restless, we were restless  
We were restless  
But we had to keep on going we were restless  
  
I was looking high but I was feeling low  
Sun said "Man don't sweat" the moon kept still and glowed  
The truth is in the eyes of common mortal men  
And you can believe it's all in the grief of Satan  
It's all in the grief of Satan  
  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
And you can feel.

Oh...yes..  
Some say love is  
some say what is love  
some say is love  
really all around  
  
Some say life is  
some say what is life  
some say is life  
really all around me  
  
but I say easy  
easy on my soul  
but I say easy  
easy on my soul  
  
Some say love is  
some say what is love  
some say is love  
really all around  
  
I want to tell you my story  
I want to tell you I'm sorry  
  
easy on my soul...  
easy on my soul  
easy on my soul. 1

Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Baby but look at the tears in my eye  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Mama but look at the way you made me cry  
Every way that's nice  
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice  
  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break  
A poor mans heart break  
  
Baby you turn me on  
But as quick as a flash your love is gone  
Baby I'm gonna leave you now  
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break  
A poor man's heart break  
And my heart is breakin' too  
  
(ahh yeah)  
  
(alright)  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye baby  
But look at the tears you made me cry  
Every way that's nice  
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
  
Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Baby you've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break  
Heart break  
  
Baby and my heart is breakin'  
Ohh my heart is breakin'  
Ohh listen

ODEN  
  
Yes I've had my fun  
If I don't get well no more  
Yes I've had my fun, baby  
If I don't get well no more  
You see I have this pain in me  
An I'm goin down slow  
Won't somebody write my mother  
Tell her the shape I'm in  
Please write my mother  
Tell her to pray for me  
Tell her to forgive my sin  
Tell her don't send no doctor  
Yes a doctor can do me no good  
Yes no doctor mama  
Doctor can do me no good  
But you see through all of my trials  
I never did all the things I could  
On the next train south  
Baby you can look for my...  
On the next train south  
Mama, you can look for...  
Yes now if you see my baby baby  
Yes you know I'm dead and gone

Goodbye  
I hope we meet again  
Goodbye  
Is this how it's got to end  
But we've come to the end of our road together  
Made a stand that's gonna last forever  
Brother tell me what you're gonna do  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Will you take the fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother  
You're out on your own  
  
Goodbye

Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Will you take the fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother, now that you're out on your own  
  
We learned a lot from each other  
That's how we came to be brothers  
Brother won't you tell me what your problem is  
Oh and  
Don't waste your time on hate  
Can be used in better ways  
Remember the time and better days  
  
Goodbye  
I hope we meet again  
But the good times  
Will always remain  
But we've come to the end  
Of our road together  
We made a stand that's gonna last forever  
Brother tell me what you're gonna do

Will you take the low road  
Oh you're out on your own  
  
Now will you take the high road  
Or will you take the low road  
The fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother you're out on your own  
Out on your own  
Out on your own  
Out on your own  

Sleep now my little baby  
Safe inside your mama  
You have no name  
But soon you will  
And soon the sun will shine  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
  
Slowly comes the day  
You will see, hear, touch and feel  
Slowly comes the day  
You will know  
What kind of world this is  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
  
Slowly comes the day  
You will see, hear and touch and feel  
Slowly comes the day  
You will know  
The kind of world this is  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
  
Guardian of the Universe  
Son of son  
Shine a light of peace and love  
On this little one  
On this little one  
Oh, oh, oh

Well my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I said my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I'll tell you why  
  
I'm breaking my own heart  
Tryin' to love a faker  
  
Like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
Just like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
  
I'm burning my own eyes out  
Tryin' to reach the door  
  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
  
I'm wasting my whole life  
Tryin' to make a new start  
  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start.

I met her, just a barroom queen in Memphis  
She tried to make me upstairs for a ride  
She had to carry me right across her shoulder  
'Cause I just can't seem to drink her off of my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
I met her either say in New York City  
I had to put up a one heck of a fight  
The lady said she'd covered me with roses  
She broke my nose and then she broke my mind  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl  
  
She's a honky tonk woman  
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme  
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl

If you are tryin' to screw me baby  
Take my advice  
Opportunity baby, never knocks twice  
If you are tryin' to fool me baby  
Don't play around  
'cause when I get to you baby  
I won't make no sound  
'cause I'll be creepin'  
I'll be creepin' baby  
  
I'll hold you in my arms  
Like nobody else  
And when I know we're apart  
I won't take no less.  
  
Take all you things and move far away  
Take all your furs and rings baby  
But don't you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you won't get far  
Don't make no difference wherever you are  
Yeah 'cause I'll be creepin' baby  
And I'll be creeping 'round your door  
  
I'll hold you in my arms, like nobody else  
And when I know we are apart, I won't take no less  
  
I'll hold you in my arms, like nobody else  
And when I know we are apart, I won't take no less  
  
Take all you things and move far away  
Take all your diamond rings now baby  
But don't you sing hurray  
You can change your address  
But you won't get far  
Don't make no difference baby wherever you are  
Yeah 'cause I'll be creepin' 'round your door

I was born by the river, just like this river,  
I've been moving ever since  
Ain't got no body to call my own you know  
I've been moving since the day I was born  
Life is a game just made for fun, I don't need no body  
No, I don't love no one  
Yes, I'm a mover baby  
Now get out of my way will ya?  
Don't try to stop me now  
  
Following the footpath one fine day,  
When I asked a wise man which was the way,  
He said "follow you heart and look for yourself,  
And come back and tell me what you have learned".  
Yes, I'm a mover.  
  
Went back and told him I'd found me a wife,  
Eleven children and a real good life,  
Told him I'd left this happy home,  
Cause I need to return to the long winding road  
Yes, I'm a mover.

I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Well in my mind  
It's easy  
To lose sight of the truth  
But in my heart  
I can't deny  
My feeling inside  
  
'Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Man in the sky  
You say you are flying  
To lose sight of the world  
You want to stay high  
Then don't deny  
Your feeling inside  
  
'Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Yeah!  
Whoo!  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh!  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Whooo  
Has gotta come your way.

And by the way before you go  
I'd like to say  
I love you so  
If it's goodbye maybe for good  
I will not cry  
Maybe I should  
And I  
I love you so  
Oh how this year has slipped away  
We shed no tears  
So why today  
And all this time has made me feel  
Love is no crime  
And love is real  
And I  
Ooh! and I love you so  
And I ooh I love you so  
Remember me when you're far away  
I'll remember you  
No matter where I stay  
And by the way before you go  
I like to say

And all this time has made me feel  
Love is no crime and love is real  
Maybe I should  
And I

Over there is my magic ship  
Would you care to go on a trip  
We'll be sailing on and on  
To a land where few have gone  
Beyond the skies in my mind  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Rolling out to those who can see  
  
Let's away to a distant night  
Let's away on a magic flight  
We'll be sailing on and on  
To a land where few have gone  
Beyond the skies in my mind  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet Bells ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Calling out to those who can hear  
  
Oh who can see  
Because were sailing  
  
Sweet bells ring and ring and ring you harmonies  
Rolling out like the waves on the sea  
Sweet Bells ring and ring and ring and ring your harmonies  
Rolling out to those who can hear  
  
Oh can you see  
Inside  
Don't be afraid,  
Step aboard  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
All right here we go.

Sitting in a graveyard  
Waiting for the dawn  
Leaning on my tombstone  
Till the night is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh how the moon  
Hangs in black sky  
Wish I could find out  
The reason why  
I sit here alone  
And cry  
  
My woman was so lovely  
Together we were one  
No sunshine in my weary eyes  
Now that she has gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Palm trees whisper to me  
From your spreading height  
Tell me all the lonely stories  
Of the world at night  
  
[Chorus]

She talks to me of wisdom  
We walk beside the sun  
Rainy night and rainy day  
Might as well keep away  
I've got trouble on the run  
Weariness  
Weariness has left my friend  
My head goes round  
And round again  
On my way and I might be late  
I don't worry  
Every thing can wait  
  
She talks to me of feelin'  
Feelin' good  
And feelin' better  
Once upon a time I thought  
I could love around and not get caught  
But I'd never met her  
Weariness, waeriness has left my friend  
Head goes round  
And round again  
I'm on my way  
And I might be late  
I don't worry every thing can wait  
  
Do you mean  
When you say you'll be mine  
I want you to be mine  
All mine  
Weariness  
Weariness has left my friend  
My head goes round  
And round again  
On my way and I might be late  
I don't worry  
Every thing can wait  
Every thing can wait

Do you remember  
Every morning  
We would dress  
And we'd be still yawning,  
In the street  
Where people meet  
We would wander around  
In the northern heat.  
  
All these days are gone  
My Baby, now I'm all alone  
I wish I had you near me  
Baby, I wish I had you here  
  
In the summer  
Days were lazy  
And sometimes the heat  
Would drive us all crazy  
Singing songs all night long  
Till the light through' the window  
Said another day had come  
  
All these days are gone  
Baby, now I'm all alone  
I wish I had you near me  
I wish I had you here.  
  
Baby, do you remember  
Every morning  
We would dress  
And we'd be still yawning,  
In the street  
Where people meet  
We would wander around  
In the northern heat.  
  
Baby, oh these days are gone  
And I'm all alone  
I still remember  
The good old days we spent together  
Baby I can't forget  
You know me  
I can't forget  
The good old days we spent together.

[Verse:]:  
Young woman confused  
Young woman abused  
You must understand  
It's never too late to, lose who you are  
And choose who you are supposed to be  
Supposed to become  
You've been in and out  
Up and down, back and forth  
Backwards around  
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father  
Just God and you should make a choice  
What you ought to do  
What matters most  
Who you are to you  
Opinions of the old and young  
Shouldn't matter to you  
Take advice think it over twice  
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night  
It's decent, but recently  
Things have shown us  
We have done the wrong things often  
Never suicide, that's the easy route  
There's always another way out  
Think about it (think about it)  
  
Chorus (2x)  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just don't let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let you soul fall in love  
  
You can fly  
  
Verse 2:  
Now see if you went through life with your eyes closed  
You never would'a known there was a high road  
  
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them  
Instead of bein' mad at yourself  
You're only number one in your life  
And you will decide if it goes right  
Every time you digress  
Defeat your progress  
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest  
The controversy yo can get personal  
They don't understand till the role reversal  
Seekin' fame, play their games  
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain  
Push comes to shove  
Do you push or shove?  
When the choice is yours  
Do you leave or you love?  
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside  
When will you decide to survive  
  
Chorus (2x)  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just don't let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let your soul fall in love  
  
You can fly  
Fly  
Fly  
Fly  
Fly  
  
(4 x)  
You can give up  
Or you can get up  
Just don't let what you need pass by  
Spread your wings to the sky  
Let you soul fall in love  
  
You can fly

Paul rodgers  
  
It's like a soft caressing sea  
Or making love in harmony  
Or the centre of a starry galaxy  
It's like the richness that's inside  
The one I'm trying to describe  
Or the living water stretching far and wide  
Searching for a shadow in the morning sun  
Playing with your woman when there's work to be done  
People, won't you listen when I tell the truth  
I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah  
It's like a sound that rests my soul  
Or like a part that's now a whole  
Or as something that is burning bright as gold  
I want her near me everyday  
Then I want to hear her say  
There is somthing here between us as we lay  
Searching for a shadow in the morning sun  
Playing with your woman when there's work to be done  
People, won't you listen when I tell the truth  
I give her all my sugar, she's got such a sweet tooth yeah yeah

So we started in the cornfield  
And I know we did not slack  
We got everything in order  
But we forgot to bring the bucket back  
The foreman he went crazy  
And ran around the field  
Said we must be lazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this highroad  
It was a far away from here.  
  
The farmer had a daughter  
And she worked at the wishing well  
Put one leg in the water  
'Til she found the mission bell  
The old man went crazy  
And ran to get his gun  
We had a bad time explaining  
We were just having drunken fun  
Just having drunken fun.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this high road, Oh!  
It was a long way from here  
So we walked along this road  
Just tellin' stories as we go  
We just walk along.  
  
Well the farmer had a daughter  
And she did not speak a word  
We used to kiss her in the orchard  
Till one morning we were overheard  
The old man he went crazy  
Running around the field  
Said we must be crazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed

Well the train I ride  
Is leaving the station  
And the train I ride  
To my destination  
  
I was walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I was walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
Well I got no need  
For no company  
Got my blues guitar  
That's all I need  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
Think I've come to  
The end of my song  
If you feel you want to  
Why don't you sing along  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride.

She was a wild Indian woman and she drove me wild  
She was a wild Indian woman till she had my child  
  
You don't need your horses baby, you got me to ride  
You don't need your feathers, I'll keep you warm inside  
She's got dark brown eyes and long long black hair  
She's got a peaceful side but I just don't know where  
  
She used to sleep on the prairie with the stars above  
She used to hunt in the woods till I caught her love  
  
You don't need your horses baby, you got me to ride  
You don't need your feathers, I'll keep you warm inside  
She's got dark brown eyes and long long black hair  
She's got a peaceful side but I just don't know where

Take off your hat, kick off your shoes  
I know you ain't goin' anywhere  
Run 'round the town singin' your blues  
I know you ain't goin' anywhere.  
  
You've always been a good friend of mine,  
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.  
  
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself  
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?  
Put up a fight you believe to be right  
And someday the sun will shine through.  
  
You've always got something to hide  
Something you just can't tell  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.  
  
And I know what you're wishing for  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
Love in a peaceful world  
  
You've always been a good friend of mine,  
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"  
And the only time that you're satisfied  
Is with your feet in the wishing well.

Carry me away  
I know your angel eye can see through me  
Carry me away  
Far away from the love you give so generously  
So generously  
  
Woman, oh oh  
Listen  
  
I got a burning heart  
I need to tell you that it's you I love  
I got a burning heart  
I need to tell you that I'll never get enough  
Never, never, never, never get enough, ooh babe  
  
Woman, oh oh  
  
Yeah, marry me today  
I'll give you all I own except my car  
Marry me today, baby  
I'll give you everything but my guitar  
But my guitar and my car  
  
Woman, oh oh  
Listen  
  
Let me hold your tongue  
For I know you'll understand the way I feel  
Baby, I know you'll understand  
That all I wanna do is take your hand  
  
I don't mean to do you no harm, baby  
I just wanna be your man  
Oh, I just wanna be your man, baby  
Lord, I wanna be, I wanna be  
Hey, woman, I'll be your man  
Woman, I'll be your man, yeah
