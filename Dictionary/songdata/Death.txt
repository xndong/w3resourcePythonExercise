I would describe it as a invisible darkness  
Casting a shadow, a blinding black  
Guarded by hope, my soul is kept safe from  
The bloody claws.  
  
Look beyond, what vision lets me see  
Time after time, unneeded misery  
Holding tight to my dreams  
I own no price for you  
I grip them tight and hope for sight.  
  
Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity  
Confusion gone, it's in your hands  
Your turn to ask why.  
  
Life is like a mystery  
With many clues, but with few anwers  
To tell us what it is that we can do to look  
For messages that keep us from the truth

Creating a life only to destroy  
Saved from a life of the unemployed  
Where crime is the only way to survive  
Which is the best to be dead or alive?  
Maybe a chance but maybe not  
Born to be thrown in the trash to rot  
To exist in this world may be a mistake  
The one who is with child, it's their choice to make  
  
Death and life taken so easily  
Right or wrong, whose choice will it be?  
  
Abortion, when it is needed  
Execution, for those who deserve it  
The giving and taking of life will always be  
Altering the future  
  
Look into the future to prepare us for our fate  
Controlling our existence with every life we take  
  
Life for a life should remain the rule  
The innocent victim that is what's cruel  
Look to the past is what we should do  
When justice was done and justice was true  
Using our laws to help their escape  
An easy way out is what they create  
Claiming insane is the way to freedom  
People are stupid enough to believe them  
  
Death and life taken so easily  
Right or wrong, whose choice will it be?  
  
Abortion, when it is needed  
Execution, for those who deserve it  
The giving and taking of life will always be

Under command a new-born child  
Submerged in blood, the dead they smile  
Growing possessed, burning inside  
A bloody feast for us tonight  
  
The way of death  
Is growing hear just take my hand  
Skies grow black  
Unholy corpses upon their land  
  
The dead they gather around  
Praising the child they found  
Possessed, the child shall kill  
The future is now revealed  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn they'll learn  
  
Gather around, watch and see  
A new creation of misery  
Taking the place of the elderly dead  
Forbidden ways now in his head  
  
The way of death  
Is growing hear just take my hand  
Skies grow black  
Unholy corpses upon their land  
  
The dead they gather around  
Praising the child they found  
Possessed, the child shall kill  
The future is now revealed  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn they'll learn  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn they'll learn

Look down at the body  
You may see no trace of wounds  
But in the eye  
The eye of the beholder  
One cannot assume.  
  
Not a drop of blood is drawn  
But you know how it bleeds  
Beware of the sharp edged weapon  
Called human being  
  
It is a shield of passion  
And strong will  
From this I am the victor  
Instead of the kill  
  
I will not feed your hunger, instead  
I bite the pain  
Looking not back, but forward  
I bite down hard  
Try to cover up the trail of deceit  
And daggers spawned from your soul  
  
Acid, the tears of remorse  
Flow in vain, too late for regrets  
Save it  
For the next ill fated game.

Brought to this world to wither again  
Naive about the ways of life is what they say  
Millions live millions die, more are yet to come  
Living skeletons  
Where they come from  
  
Born dead into this world  
To starve and rot in agony  
Born dead into this world  
It's their choice, why can't you see  
  
Life of misery, soon a corpse you be  
As bones show through, nothing you can do  
  
Relief does not exist  
When you are born to die  
  
Disease spreads fast across their dying world  
Many cemeteries they will have to build  
As process goes on for many years to come  
A human waste land created when they are done  
  
Born dead into this world  
To starve and rot in agony  
Born dead into this world  
It's their choice, why can't you see

Freedom is just a breath away  
Will you live to see the day  
As the heat intensifies  
You start to choke, your insides fry  
  
Seizure now sets in  
Torture will begin  
Twisted bodies lie  
Waiting now to die  
  
Choke on it  
As your tongue goes down  
Choke on it  
Death is all around  
  
Screaming fills your frenzied mind  
No way out no more time  
Example made from those to see  
Your freedom turned to misery  
  
World is all around  
Of what they have found  
Lesson to be learn  
You will not return  
  
Choke on it  
As your tongue goes down  
Choke on it  
Death is all around

Built from blind faith  
Passed down from self-induced fantasy  
Turn a page to justify  
Conjuring power - it opens wide  
On seventh day,  
is that how it's done?  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
cross-turned dagger  
  
[Chorus]  
Inside crystal mountain  
Evil takes its form  
Inside crystal mountain  
Commandments are reborn  
  
All the traps are set to confine  
All who get in the way of the divine  
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite  
A slave to the curse forever confined  
  
Shatter the myth  
Don't cut yourself  
On your words against  
dreams made of steel  
Stronger any faith  
That inflicts pain and fear,  
is that how it's done?  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
cross-turned dagger  
  
[Chorus]

In your dreams  
The pain is so real  
Before the dead  
You'll have to kneel  
Hear your future screams  
See your epitaph  
As you scream  
The dead they laugh  
  
Pain, growing stronger  
Life, exists no longer  
Welcome, to a world of pain  
Death and despair  
  
Denial of life (Vile denial)  
Denial of life  
Denial of life  
  
Created by your mind  
To overtake your life  
Sacrificial suicide  
End it with a knife  
Much too late  
To change your mind  
A bloody corpse  
Is left behind  
  
Pain, growing stronger  
Life, exists no longer  
Welcome, to a world of pain  
Death and despair  
  
Denial of life (Vile denial)  
Denial of life  
Denial of life

Time is a thing we must accept  
The unexpected I sometimes fear.  
Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens,  
Things fall into place  
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through  
to find the other half that is true  
Destiny is what we all seek  
Destiny was waiting for you and me  
  
I believe behind confusion awaits the truth for us  
Past the obstacles we face  
I value our life and trust  
Years of questioning why things happen the way they do in life  
Wishing that I could turn back time,  
So we could join our souls  
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through  
to find the other half that is true  
Destiny is what we all seek  
Destiny was waiting for you and me

Ashes and promises share a bond  
Through the winds of change  
Words are blown away  
When visions that should be  
Are tattooed in your mind  
The power to let go  
Is sometimes hard to find  
  
The answer cannot be found  
In the writing of others  
Or the words of a trained mind  
In a precious world of memories  
We find ourselves confined  
  
Claws so razor sharp  
Ripping at the spirit  
  
Promises a potential to hurt  
Is anything real?  
When forever is to be until  
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...  
No escaping from those haunting  
Empty words...  
  
Do you ever feel it?  
A craving that is so strong  
To by thought rewind in order to find  
  
Expectations that shined through the doubt  
That soon would turn into the price  
Of what a word will be worth  
When tomorrow comes  
To be and we are left  
Standing on our own-  
And seeing what is real...  
  
The answer cannot be found  
In the writing of others  
Or the words of a trained mind  
In a precious world of memories  
We find ourselves confined  
  
Claws so razor sharp  
Ripping at the spirit  
  
[Repeat chorus]

Where is the person that could have been  
Who, what took over, when did the end begin  
Should we not prepare for the uncertain  
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny  
See things that are not there  
Intruding voices  
What went wrong to their picture perfect life  
They once knew - Flattening of emotions  
  
[Solos: Schuldiner, Masvidal]  
  
A mind shared by an uninvited stranger  
Which comes and goes as choose to appear  
Should we not prepare for the uncertain  
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny  
See things that are not there  
Intruding voices  
What went wrong to their picture perfect life  
They once knew - Flattening of emotions

Deep in your mind there is another side  
A morbid truth one cannot hide  
Unimaginable gore was your past time high  
To hear people scream, to watch them die  
  
Return back to the burial site  
Face your dreams upon this night  
Severed limbs not far away  
Spirit past you now obey  
  
Images of the forgotten past  
Your first life revealed at last  
Now you'll find to your surprise  
All the corpses you left behind  
  
A place you feel you've been to before  
Where life would turn right into gore  
You dig deep down through the years of decay  
The truth is revealed, you found your way  
  
Return back to the burial site  
Face your dreams upon this night  
Severed limbs not far away  
Spirit past you now obey  
  
Images of the forgotten past  
Your first life revealed at last  
Now you'll find to your surprise  
All the corpses you left behind

It's a scheme  
There's a fiend  
Why is my head spinning round in my dreams?  
It's a time and a place  
Why are all these lights popping up in my face?  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
There's a sign on the wall  
There's a witch with a big crystal ball  
There's an eye  
There's a heart that's pumpin faster as we run through the park  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Everyone looks very strange today  
All of their faces seem to be washed away  
  
Everyones talking I can't hear a thing  
I'm on the moon why is the sky so green?  
  
I think I'm walking up the stairs  
While I'm sitting right down in my chair  
I feel so light but I'm not  
Everything's turning cold but it's hot.  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out

Extending a life with total resistance  
To fatal disease, future methods of science  
  
Replacing what is real by using technology  
Population control, selecting those who will breed  
A specific type of form chosen for the unborn  
A mind without emotion  
Progressive anatomy  
  
Genetic reconstruction  
Evolution in production  
  
Producing a race of human machines  
A new age of existence the world will see  
  
Replacing what is real by using technology  
Population control, selecting those who will breed  
A specific type of form chosen for the unborn  
A mind without emotion  
Progressive anatomy  
  
Genetic reconstruction  
Evolution in production

People of the earth beware,  
It is here in human form  
An atrocity laced with greed.  
Filled with evil intentions.  
Ready to attack  
  
Look to the air for stories to choose,  
Who will be your next victim  
Profitting on visions of others,  
dark emotions run through its veins  
Its motives are false its mind is insane  
A distant planet with no signs of life  
To become a home for this alien breed.  
Scientists of the world unite,  
your services are more than needed  
This creature in human form is out of control  
  
Looks can be deceiving, see beyond the shell  
Flesh and eyes mean nothing.  
The truth, time it will tell  
Before you think you fool the world.  
What comes around goes around.  
Shown for what you are, a waste of life

So quick to judge, so easily we forget,  
What it's like to be dissected  
Where feelings are tossed aside  
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go unparalyzed  
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption  
That live their lives only to criticize  
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create individual thought  
Patterns  
  
Prisoners of mental deception be free within singular judgment  
Twisting words to control the masses  
To cover up one's self insecurities  
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go unparalyzed  
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption  
That live their lives only to criticize  
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create individual thought

What do you want from me,  
what is it you expect  
I have spoken my mind from deep inside my soul  
Behind the eyes is a place on one will be able to touch  
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced  
You want what is not yours, Jealousy  
You want what you cannot have, Jealousy  
Spiteful harsh words, it comes as no real surprise.  
Tell me what you are.  
  
I cannot understand how you seem to exist  
On what people create for you, good must turn bad.  
Behind the eyes is a place on one will be able to touch  
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced  
You want what is not yours, Jealousy  
You want what you cannot have, Jealousy

To the world around he was the perfect person  
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing  
A human bomb just waiting to explode  
This secret rage can't be controlled  
  
Slaughtered the dreams of others  
On left to recover  
Self-inflicted wounds  
Life he has comsumed  
  
Planning a killing spree  
Victim of a conspiracy?  
  
Getting bored with his current life  
Rearranging with a knife  
  
Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow  
His life was spared for this he does not know  
Screams filled the air there was no way to help  
The ones he mourns he killed himself  
  
Slaughtered the dreams of others  
On left to recover  
Self-inflicted wounds  
Life he has comsumed  
  
Planning a killing spree  
Victim of a conspiracy?

A condeming fear strikes down  
Things they cannot understand  
An excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within  
Lies  
Laying your guilt and pain  
On people that had no part in the molding of a life  
That creates its destruction  
Lies  
Right before your very eyes  
A reflection of the mistakes  
To the end you will deny  
Your part in the demise of a life  
Lack of comprehension  
Thriving on your cliche  
Compelled by self-resentment  
  
[Solo: Schuldiner]  
  
Reaching into the minds of those that created  
The depression in which they  
In which they drowned their flesh and blood  
Lies  
So easy to blame the  
Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt  
To justify the ending of life  
Lies  
Right before your very eyes  
A reflection of the mistakes  
To the end you will deny  
Your part in the demise of a life  
Lack of comprehension  
Thriving on your cliche  
Compelled by self-resentment

Put your life into their hands  
Die for someone else  
Now you're in the real world  
Where pain and death are felt  
  
The first blood shed does not seem real  
Reality is what you feel  
Dropping to your knees you pray  
God won't make this go away  
  
You will not return alive - Left to die  
Suffering until the end - Left to die  
  
Time stands still as you pass away  
No more tomorrow this is your last day  
On this fucking earth  
  
Bodies fall onto the ground  
Blood flies through the air  
Shredded victims lie in pain  
Death is never fair  
  
Legs blown off, all hope is lost  
A human life is what it cost  
Others follow close behind  
A real adventure they will find  
  
You will not return alive  
Left to die  
Suffering until the end  
Left to die

Bodies deformed way beyond belief  
Cast out from their concerned society  
Flesh contorting day after day  
Freak of the dark world is what the people say  
  
Their lives decay before their eyes  
There is no hope of cure  
Among their own kind they live  
A life that's so obscure  
First an arm and then a leg  
Deterioration grows  
Rotting while they breathe - Death comes slow  
  
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death  
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest  
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change  
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take  
  
Tuberculoid the most severe  
Decay of the nerves comes fast  
Sense of feeling soon to be gone  
Life will never last  
  
No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away  
Damage is done you feel no more pain  
Bones decay deterioration grows  
Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows  
  
Their lives decay before their eyes  
There is no hope of cure  
Among their own kind they live  
A life that's so obscure  
First an arm and then a leg  
Deterioration grows  
Rotting while they breathe - Death comes slow  
  
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death  
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest  
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to changel  
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take

Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction  
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation  
Breaking the mould human appearance  
Contorting bodies with chemical interference  
  
The guilty one, innocent she now cries  
A life of hell, better off to die  
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain  
Being born addicted to cocaine  
  
Living monstrosity  
A freak for life they'll always be  
Never knowing love or hate  
Only pain the drug create  
  
Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch  
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die  
  
The beginning of the end begins at birth  
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh  
An example we should make out of theses creators of misfortune  
A serious crime that should not be forgiven  
  
The guilty one, innocent she now cries  
A life of hell, better off to die  
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain  
Being born addicted to cocaine

Those who are a waste of life  
Use up air that others could breathe  
Human leaches all around  
Looking superion is what they believe  
  
Fake is the word you represent  
Your existence on earth I resent  
At the cost of others you get by  
Each word that you speak is a lie  
  
Low life  
That's all you'll ever be  
Lies in effect  
That's what you like to see  
  
Hiding behind material values  
That help cover up your weakness  
Never to change, always to look  
For an easy way out of life  
  
A pathetic excuse for a human being  
  
Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought  
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not  
  
Fake is the word you represent  
Your existence on earthj I resent  
At the cost of others you get by  
Each word that you speak is a lie  
  
Low life  
That's all you'll ever be  
Lies in effect  
That's what you like to see

You see your vision and no one else's  
Your every word filled with sarcasm  
Crucify people with invisible knowledge  
Verbal destruction with each compulsion  
We will see where you go  
The future for you is nowhere  
Every minute a cliche of your kind  
Too much to say from a person with no respect  
Your accusations you will regret  
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison  
Take away the power, a shallow person you will find.  
  
What would you do without your pathetic narrow-minded approach to life,  
that reflects your lack of abilities  
Your opinions are self-destructive  
Despair is your gain, delight is corruption  
Destined to fall prey to your stories,  
creating problems for your consumption  
We will see where you go  
The future for you is nowhere  
Every minute a cliche of your kind  
Too much to say from a person with no respect  
Your accusations you will regret  
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison  
Take away the power, a shallow person you will find.

From above and around,  
observations are collected  
Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms  
That may bring hope from beyond  
Beneath the giver of life, our sun  
An examination of another kind is done  
  
A view from those who stood high  
And breathing the sky  
An opinion from below and from above  
  
Some were decided, some were not  
A few looked away, but none forgot  
  
Misanthrope  
Hater of all mankind  
There is some hope  
For those who own their mind  
They came, they saw and acknowledged  
Some good, some bad  
Opinion: Dangerous  
  
Stay where you are, don't get consumed  
By what they created from sheer neglect  
In denial of years and years of  
shattered souls  
That were lost to the power of  
Fragile, frightful minds  
  
A view from those who stood high  
And breathing the sky  
An opinion from below and from above  
  
Some were decided, some were not  
A few looked away, but none forgot  
  
Misanthrope  
Hater of all mankind  
There is some hope  
For those who own their mind  
They came, they saw and acknowledged  
Some good, some bad  
Opinion: Dangerous

Massacred, hacked to death, my revenge  
Slicing deep, into your flesh, the pain intense  
Dreams of hate, misery, fill my mind  
Puke in your face in disgust, it's time to die  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
  
Staring your severed head in the face  
I celebrate a faggot's death, human disgrace  
Hanging your mangled corpse for display  
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation

You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain

Trapped in a lost world of brutality  
So weak are the ones that must rely on shock  
To push this so called force that inspires their call  
To be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch  
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch  
Say what you want, I know the truth when it comes to your kind  
  
In time we'll see who lasts  
In time you will disappear  
Who are you to question my sincerity  
For now you are high on yourself  
Drowning in your dreams of misguided hope  
To be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch  
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch

Your existence is a script,  
Life for you is a perfomance,  
Play out the leading role.  
Directing and premeditating every move  
That creates the act of manipulation  
Mastering the art of deception.  
That increases your sick addiction  
It's an overactive imagination  
That enslaves your empty shell  
  
Existing in dimensions of addictive obsession  
  
Your script will run short of ideas  
The story will soon end itself  
People to trust come short in number.  
Like a plague your lies spread  
Fast across the world  
Mastering the art of deception  
That increases your sick addition  
It's an overactive imagination  
That enslaves your empty shell

The journey begins with curiosity  
And evolves into soul-felt questions  
On the stones that we walk  
And choose to make our path  
Sometimes never knowing  
Other times knowing too much  
  
Filtering out the bad that holds us back  
Take hold of what is true to your hunger  
A hunger that will not go away  
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain  
  
Won't you join me on the perennial quest  
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light  
Search for answers on the perennial quest  
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test  
  
No time for mental crutches  
The maker has moved on  
I will take it raw and be on my way  
  
Those that stood beside me  
I'm glad you understand  
Behind these written words  
I share the simple plan  
To hang on to the way that we feel  
  
From rivers of sorrow  
To oceans deep with hope  
I have travelled them  
Now, there is no turning back  
The limit, the sky  
I ask my questions Why? What today?  
When tomorrow?  
  
Filtering out the bad that holds us back  
Take hold of what is true to your hunger  
A hunger that will not go away  
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain  
Won't you join me on the perennial quest  
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light  
Search for answers on the perennial quest  
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test

Your life is aimless and insane there's something wrong inside your brain  
And day by day it's still the same there ain't no drug to kill your pain  
Every hour you sink more in the mire you deplore  
There's no excuse to justify the wasting pain that blinds you eyes  
  
You're the sick among the pure and you're looking for the cure  
You're too stupid to realize your life is just a compromise  
You're so filled with the disease and you're bowed on your knees  
No one care of what you say that's the price you gotta pay  
  
So find a way out Tell me a lie  
Do anything that could loosen your strain  
Another chance Another drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain  
  
An endless day of lite routine tied to the wheel of its machine  
With a bar-code on your skin you can't forget all that you've been  
Self-deception is your dope 'cause you know there is no hope  
Fight against conformity lose your own identity  
  
You go back to the cage draw a new line  
Live your mistakes over and over again  
Anothe chance Anoter drug Another pill to relieve this damn pain  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain  
  
How deep is your sorrow? How deep is your pain?  
  
Your pain  
No one will assuage your pain  
And all your efforts are vain

Go against the ways and experience pain  
Leading a life which one might call insane  
Bathe in the blood of the one you killed  
Slaughter to survive, your needs are fulfilled  
  
Using horrid waste  
Some of them will taste  
Removing deadly disease  
With such primitive ease  
  
Cannibals practicing the art of butchery  
Emotions don't exist, pain you can't resist  
  
Primitive ways  
  
Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones  
While having an outer body experience  
Celebrate the kill of the day  
Then walk among the guts of the fallen prey  
  
Using horrid waste  
Some of them will taste  
Removing deadly disease  
With such primitive ease  
  
Cannibals practicing the art of butchery  
Emotions don't exist, pain you can't resist

With chainsaw in hand  
Your death I demand  
Slicing through your fat  
My awaited gore attack  
  
Manipulating lies  
Is your way of life  
Riding on cheap glory  
Your life is getting gory  
  
Watch you bleed to death  
Gasping for last breath  
Choking on your blood  
I shit onto your guts  
  
Sacrificial cunt  
I despise  
Sacrificial cunt  
No more lies  
  
Slabs of fat  
Lay on the ground  
Ram an axe  
Into your mound  
  
Time to pay the gruesome price  
A stupid cunt we sacrifice  
  
Watch you bleed to death  
Gasping for last breath  
Choking on your blood  
I shit onto your guts  
  
Sacrificial cunt  
I despise  
Sacrificial cunt  
No more lies  
  
Sacrificial cunt  
I despise  
Sacrificial cunt  
No more lies

What pain will it take  
To satisfy your sick appetite  
Go in for the kill  
Always in sight-prey  
The time always right-feast  
Feed on the pain-taste  
Sorrow made flesh-sweet  
Live how you want  
Just don't feed on me  
If you doubt what I say  
I will make you believe  
Shallow are words from those who starve  
For a dream not their own to slash and scar  
  
Big words, small mind  
Behind the pain you will find  
A scavenger of human sorrow  
Scavenger  
Abstract theory the weapon of choice  
Used by scavenger of human sorrow  
Scavenger  
  
So you have traveled far across the sea  
To spread your written brand of misery

There is a mask  
That covers up one's true intentions  
Once removed, things become very clear  
Analyze behavior patterns to see beneath  
  
The person that is presented to you  
Vulnerable through trust  
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles  
Presented by people with a secret face  
  
What's on the outside  
Is not always all that is real  
Live by caution, what I feel  
When things are reversed  
  
People are shown for what they are  
The truth is revealed  
Banish the false  
Pacifying moments with an acquired disguise to obtain  
  
The things they want  
By the anguish of someone else  
Materialistic motives are fulfilled  
Cherish the true  
  
Vulnerable through trust  
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles  
Presented by people with a secret face

Born into darkness  
Where sounds portay the images that are out  
Out of reach from my sight  
Which has been denied  
Hands change into my eyes  
Body senses intensified  
Sight so close yet far away  
  
In dreams my thoughts take their form  
To give memories identity  
Through dreams I obtain  
The ability to connect sight with sound  
  
[Solo: Schuldiner]  
  
Close your eyes and imagine to be without  
What we take for granted every time we open eyes  
A permanent shadow to never step away  
Feel the dark in the cold  
Feel the warmth of the light  
Which has been denied  
Hands change into my eyes  
Body senses intensified  
Sight so close yet far away  
In dreams my thoughts take their form  
To give memories identify  
Through dreams I obtain  
The ability to connect sight with sound

Always blocking the doors to your mind  
Escaping the reality that surrounds you  
Using faith as an excuse to kill  
A sick way of life is now revealed  
  
All the prayers in the world can't help you now  
A killer a take of life is what you are  
  
Preach the good word  
Speak no more, perpare to burn  
A justified torture?  
From this may others learn  
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake  
No changing your mind, your life you should pay  
  
Practice what you preach  
Your loved one is now deceased  
Knowledge is at our hands  
Never to understand  
  
Spiritual healing  
  
Blinded by the twisted ways you live  
Kill for religion, will the Lord forgive?  
Idiocy has stricken you mind  
A real-life hell you will find

Controlling their lives  
Deciding when and how they will die  
A victim of someone else's choice  
The ones who suffer have no voice  
Manipulating destiny  
When it comes to living, no one seems to care  
But when it comes to wanting out  
Those with power, will be there  
Prolong the pain  
How long will it last?  
Suicide machine  
A request to die with dignity  
Is that too much to ask?  
Suicide machine  
How easy it is to deny the pain  
Of someone else's suffering  
  
Robbed of natural abilities  
In death they now seek tranquility  
In a confused state of mind  
Extending agony, they must be blind  
Manipulating destiny  
  
When it comes to living, no one seems to care  
But when it comes to wanting out  
Those with power, will be there  
Prolong the pain  
How long will it last?  
Suicide machine  
A request to die with dignity  
Is that too much to ask?  
Suicide machine

I don't mean to dwell  
But I can't help myself  
When I feel the vibe  
And taste a memory  
Of a time in life  
When years seemed to stand still  
  
I close my eyes  
And sink within myself  
Relive the gift of precious memories  
In need of a fix called innocence  
  
When did it begin?  
The change to come was undetectable  
The open wounds expose the importance of  
Our innocence  
A high that can never be bought or sold  
  
Symbolic acts, so vivid  
Yet at the same time  
Were invisible  
  
Savor what you feel and what you see  
Things that may not seem important now  
But may be tomorrow  
  
Do you remember when  
Things seemed so eternal?  
Heroes were so real...  
Their magic frozen in time  
The only way to learn  
Is be aware and hold on tight  
  
I close my eyes  
And sink within myself  
Relive the gift of precious memories  
In need of a fix called innocence  
  
When did it begin?  
The change to come was undetectable  
The open wounds expose the importance of  
Our innocence  
A high that can never be bought or sold  
  
Symbolic acts, so vivid  
Yet at the same time  
Were invisible

Do you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear  
There is a line you must draw between your dream world and reality  
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe  
Lies feed your judgement of others  
Behold how the blind lead each other  
The philosopher  
You know so much about nothing at all  
  
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall  
Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released  
Your mind is not your own,  
What sounds more mentally stimulating is how you make your choice  
So you preach about how I'm supposed to be, yet you don't you know your own  
Sexuality  
Lies feed your judgement of others  
Behold how the blind lead each other  
The philosopher  
You know so much about nothing at all

Throughout our time a thought  
Escapes us to enforce a word, no  
Holding on to pain it may seem to some  
  
The easy way to say o.k., twist your  
Knife a little deeper  
Words to sharp actions dark  
Hide the blade of the deceiver.  
  
Enforce the words no more, be free  
Alone you might just find serenity.  
  
To accept another day we choose  
To give away another piece of life  
To forgive is to suffer  
  
Once or twice is kind  
Three or four is blind  
It is not the end yet a way to begin  
The power of words both good and bad.

Labeled a creation of evil  
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance  
Sharing both please and pain  
Two minds, two hearts, one soul  
Separating mentally  
An illusion of privacy  
Together they absorb each others lives  
As One they will live and they will die  
A living hell has begun  
  
Displayed as a nightmare  
Criticized through words and eyes  
As they stare  
To the normal it seems grotesque  
Connected by a bond of flesh  
Two minds, two hearts, one soul  
Separating mentally  
An illusion of privacy  
Together they absorb each others lives  
As One they will live and they will die  
A living hell has begun

Out to find the truth  
Behind the myth of  
Man eating man  
Finding bodies tied  
Up to a stake  
You cannot understand  
Filled with ignorance  
You watch them eat your friends  
Ask for evidence  
A hook right through your tits  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
  
Trying to escape  
They torture you by  
Cutting off your cock  
When you're dead  
They'll feast upon your flesh  
Your brains they'll  
Eat and chop  
  
Pray if you want  
Pathetic rancid cunt  
Face reality  
Death your final pleasure  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces  
Torn to pieces

I want to watch you drown in your lies.  
The end of your masquerade, a matter of time  
Interwining lies, domination, control  
Feed his twisted nature  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice, fate's patience is growning short.  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy  
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner  
These four words my friend, I promise you will not forget  
  
I am one of many that see through your lies  
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge.  
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create, and cannot have.  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice, fate's patience is growning short.  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy

Mysterious object of flight on a voyage  
To correct what they have done, what we are doing  
Perhaps submerged, living in the inner most  
Recesses of the planet - no choice but  
To adapt to an underground world  
Limiting our passages of thought  
Are they the examples of regression  
A life form's abusive progression  
In a realm so vast, we sit among the Vacant Planets  
  
So many worlds yet to be seen that once have shared  
The same effects that come from greed, mass production  
Perhaps submerged, living in the inner most  
Recesses of the planet - no choice but  
To adapt to an underground world  
Limiting our passages of thought  
Are they the examples of regression  
A life form's abusive progression

Transforming your mind from the inside out  
Overcoming fear that made you doubt  
Observing what is stored in the subconscious  
Trusting what you feel with your gut responses  
  
See past the dark and use your energy  
Learn from these images  
Thoughts that we call dreams  
  
This power lies within the mind  
Gain wisdom through abilities  
Change what's to come in future time  
Avoiding pain and misery  
  
Look through the fake from what is real  
Making decisions by what you feel  
Live for the future and not the past  
The weak of mind will never last  
  
Perceiving visions that reoccur  
Analise your dreams to gain  
A better perspective of your life  
In control of your destiny with mind and soul  
  
See past the dark and use your energy  
Learn from these images  
Thoughts that we call dreams  
  
This power lies within the mind  
Gain wisdom through abilities  
Change what's to come in future time  
Avoiding pain and misery

Guilty until proven innocent  
We condemn your soul and fate  
Never mind the possibilities  
Too busy for logic or to calculate  
  
Take part in a diminishing breed  
Where complex turns to simplicity  
When pain is acknowledged  
Frivolous calculations will be abolished  
  
Without judgement what would we do?  
We would be forced to look  
At ourselves emerged in lost time  
Assuming what may be without judgement  
Perception would increase a million times  
  
Distracted by imagination  
That experiments with ease if you could  
Taste it, it might be addictive  
Where life will crush those who defy  
  
Take part in a diminishing breed  
Where complex turns to simplicity  
When pain is acknowledged  
Frivolous calculations will be abolished  
  
Without judgement what would we do?  
We would be forced to look  
At ourselves emerged in lost time  
Assuming what may be without judgement  
Perception would increase a million times

In the dark of night  
Abusing a portion of light  
While others are sleeping  
And some are escaping  
A serpent spews out fantasy-  
Unjustified blasphemy  
That cannot be condoned  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done  
  
[Chorus]  
There will be zero tolerance  
For the creator of hallowed intentions  
There will be zero tolerance  
Fate is your deciding God  
  
Karma comes crashing down  
Leaving a very deep scar  
Exposing a door to the  
Source of a verbal whore  
Machines supply the altar  
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done

And I finally see the light again  
The light of my return  
After too much time in darkness  
I've had enough of being underground.  
By now it's all over  
Forgotten from memory  
And from the heart of the living.  
My sepulchre has become decrepit  
Decaying as my mortal remains  
They are corroded by time  
By vice and by worms.  
So many years now have passed  
From the last time  
That someone cried  
Or even prayed for me.  
Oooh zombie, what do you want from us?  
Oooh zombie, why have you come back to life?  
Men don't care about their dead  
Don't know that they come back  
Come back to kill them.  
Don't believe that it's all over  
At the moment of burial  
There is something more important  
That pushes us to come back.  
The living cry the dead but the dead kill the living  
That is the greatest day for me  
The day of resurrection.  
I don't know who I was  
I don't remember my ancient name  
But now I feel a new reason  
I have no fear to kill.  
Oooh zombie, what do you want from us?  
Oooh zombie, is this real life?

Revengeful corpse out to kill  
Smell the stench, your guts will spill  
Vomit for a mind, maggots for a cock  
With his axe the corpse will chop  
  
Stare into his eyes  
Now in his spell  
Kiss the rotting flesh  
Now you're in hell  
  
Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore  
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more  
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead  
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head  
  
Zombie ritual  
Zombie ritual  
  
Ceremony now complete  
Chosen one is now deceased  
Fucking, raping zombie whores  
Killing, feasting no remorse  
  
Stare into his eyes  
Now in his spell  
Kiss the rotting flesh  
Now you're in hell  
  
Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore  
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more  
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead  
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head  
  
Zombie ritual  
Zombie ritual  
  
Zombie ritual
