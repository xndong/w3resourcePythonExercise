Hold hands with the person to your right  
Hold hands and try to look sincere-o  
Tell them, though you don't know their name  
That you still can feel their pain  
Yeah you still can feel their pain  
We'll sing "Jerusalem" now boys  
As we build a land fit for zeros  
It's all that I can do to stop  
Fake tears from welling up  
Fake tears from welling up  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
Don't smoke, don't smack  
Don't eat red meat  
This is a tolerant land fit for zeros  
And if you're lost just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all. Mediocrity is all"  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
The past is all forgotten now  
This is a young, modern land  
Fit for zeros  
And if we fight, it's only when  
We're guaranteed to win  
And should you, just stray  
Just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all.  
Mediocrity is all"

Yesterday arrived too quickly  
Caught me right off guard  
My defense moved in too slowly  
Missed it by a yard  
I'd just settled down  
With a bottle of gin  
So I moved on to whiskey  
And it hit me again  
Memories were raining punches  
Down on my head  
Knocked me into the past so quickly  
They almost raised the dead  
So I drank some more booze  
And it helped me to sleep  
Where I dreamed of my youth  
And the secrets I keep  
  
Oh history is a friend of mine  
She comes over to my place  
And we have a good time  
But the memories  
She sometimes brings with her  
Get out of line  
They're out of line  
  
Show me things I don't want to see  
(Wanna see, want to see, wanna see)  
Remind me of who I thought I was gonna be  
(Ganna be, gonna be, gonna be)  
Take me places I used to go  
(Used to go, used to go)  
A long long time ago  
  
When I woke I remembered nothing  
Suppose that's just as well  
And although my head was aching  
I could hear a bell  
So I put on some clothes  
And I reached my front door  
When I pulled it wide open  
She joined me once more  
  
Oh history is a friend of mine  
She comes over to my place  
And we have a good time  
But the memories  
She sometimes brings with her  
Get out of line  
They're out of line  
  
Show me things I don't want to see  
(Wanna see, want to see, want to see)  
Remind me of who I thought I was gonna be  
(Ganna be, gonna be, gonna be)  
Take me places I used to go  
(Used to go, used to go)  
A long long time ago  
A long long time ago

I could tell the meaning of a word like serene  
I got some 'O' Grades when I was sixteen  
I can tell the difference between margarine and butter  
I can say "Saskatchewan" without starting to stutter  
  
But I can't understand why we let someone else rule our land  
We're Cap in Hand  
  
I could get a broken jaw from being in a fight  
I know its evening when day turns to night  
I can understand why Stranraer lie so lowly  
They could save a lot of points by signing Hibs Goalie  
  
But I can't understand why we let someone else rule our land  
We're Cap in Hand  
  
We fight, when they ask us  
We boast, then we cower  
We beg  
For a piece of  
What's already ours  
  
Once I thought I could make God a bribe  
So I said I was in his lost tribe  
Getting handouts can be so frustrating  
"Get in line son, there's five million waiting"  
  
I can't understand why you let someone else rule your land  
You're Cap In Hand.

Come on nature, I don't want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature, I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Come on nature, let me show the way that I've been feeling all along  
Come on nature, just because I don't feel weak don't mean I feel so strong  
  
I've been known to ask a few more favours than I should of you  
And in time I'm sure I'll still want things that you could never do  
If she wasn't mine, if I was stepping out of line,  
But she's mine and I'm in line and she's the best I've ever seen  
  
Come on nature, let me show the way that I've been feeling all along  
Dark brown hair, green eyes and white skin  
You perfect every color that she's in  
  
Come on nature, I don't want to read a book or talk about the world  
Come on nature, I just want to spend some time being boy to the girl  
Her and me, I could be complete if you could let it be  
My desire, is to stretch myself inside her body's fire  
  
If I stumbled in then I could say that I had been to the chamber  
Where your greatest work of art was on display.

Warmongers, kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That you're trying to sell  
Gun wavers, shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
What's wrong with that kind of vision?  
What's wrong with that kind of world?  
If I suffered less from indecision  
I'd stand on that platform myself  
Chickenhawks, there's a cell  
Down in hell, where you may fight aswell  
If I may paraphrase John Lennon  
Why fill this world with more pain and fear?  
To every budding Mark Chapman  
I offer these words most sincere  
Warmongers, kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That you're trying to sell  
Gun wavers, shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
Do it yourself

Your life is full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it, don't give it to me  
You trapped me in this corner  
You're breathing it over me  
Next stop's the Royal Infirmary  
  
The room's started spinning  
I'm finding it hard to breath  
I think I'll have to leave, I need some air  
That little black cloud  
That follows you everywhere's  
Floating my way and it's raining despair  
  
Now I'm not immune to misery myself  
But it's just a bore in somebody else  
If you weren't allowed to talk of yourself  
You would have nothing to say  
  
Your life if full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it, don't give it to me  
  
Your life is full of misery  
Well take something for it  
Or try to ignore it, don't give it to me  
You trapped me in this corner  
You're breathing it over me  
Next stop's the Royal Infirmary  
  
Now I'm not immune

You're a grown woman  
Good at what you do  
I'm happy as hell  
When I'm alone whit you  
As you stroke my body  
And soothe my brow  
With everything  
That the law will allow  
I pray "Don't turn out like your mother"  
  
(repeat)  
  
I'm a grown man  
Over 21  
I've got an ugly face  
But I have a lot of fun  
So if spill a glass  
Or break a dish  
I hear your voice  
And I make this wish  
Please "Don't turn out like your mother"  
  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out like your mother  
I couldn't stand it  
And I'll be damned if  
I'm gonna live with another  
  
So many woman  
Give you so much  
Civilized ways  
And a gentle touch  
A different perspective  
That's as bright as a button  
But then you wake up one morning  
And it all counts for nothing  
Cos she's turned into her mother  
  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out like your mother  
I couldn't stand it  
And I'll be damned if  
I'm gonna live with another  
  
It's not the way she looks  
It's not the food she cooks  
Her kind of indignation  
Don't cause me trepidation  
But to live with a woman like this  
Would take a masochist  
Or someone who could get and could stay permanently pissed  
  
(repeat)  
  
You're a grown woman  
Good at what you do  
I'm happy as hell  
When I'm alone with you  
As you stroke my body  
And soothe my brow  
With everything  
That the law will allow  
  
I'm a grown man  
Over 21  
I've got an ugly face  
But I have a lot of fun  
So if spill a glass  
Or break a dish  
Don't get on to me  
Like some haranguing witch  
  
Don't turn out like your mother  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out  
Don't turn out like your mother  
I couldn't stand it  
And I'll be damned if  
I'm gonna live with another  
  
It's not her looks  
Or the way she cooks  
That wakes me up in a cold sweat  
It's just the knowledge  
That if it happened  
I couldn't drink enough to forget  
  
Don't turn out (etc)  
Don't end up (etc)

Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
  
I demand recompense  
For sitting on the fence  
Throughout my adult life  
You've got to put my parents in jail  
For raising me in Fife  
It doesn't matter what I do  
You have to say it's alright  
And I need you to send somebody around  
To tuck me in at night  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the USA  
  
Well it's not my fault  
That I'm positive  
I just stuck a needle in my arm  
And nobody told me  
That sixty a day  
Would do me any harm  
My liver's shriveling like a leaf  
But it's not the whiskey that do's it  
Call me irresponsible  
And I'm really going to lose it  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the USA  
  
Wear a ribbon for this  
Hug a stranger for that  
Light a candle to the dead  
And soon you'll forget  
That you ever had  
A brain inside our head  
We value everythin' the same  
We turn it into farce  
So we don't know a crisis  
'Till it kicks us up the are  
Because  
  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A  
Everybody's a victim  
Seems we're going that way  
Everybody's a victim  
We're becoming like the U-S-A

I've got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've got to follow the money

Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've gotta the follow money  
Gotta earn my pay

Gotta find the cash  
Cause it won't find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
  
When I left school I was bummin' around  
I'd smoke and drink and let my mind wander  
I'd roll out of bed about twelve o'clock  
I can't do that any longer  
  
I've gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Now I need to toil 'cause it's good for my soul  
I feel clean when I'm working  
You drop all the mystical Celtic bull  
Cause that stuff's just jerking  
  
I'm not saying that I work like my dad  
I know I don't work like my mum  
But I'm made of the same stuff  
And I'm six feet tall  
Gimme the tools I'll get the job done  
  
Gotta follow the money

I'm working now

You need to harness pain  
To raise yourself up again  
You need to harness pain  
And tell the truth about love  
  
You need to break your heart  
Before you can really start  
You need to break your heart  
And tell the truth about love  
  
Then you need to set a goal  
That you can't reach  
Then you have to attack  
Defenses you can't breach  
  
Then you need to lose  
And lose and lose again  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain  
  
You need to take your doubts  
And spread them all about  
You need to face your doubts  
To tell the truth about love  
  
You know the cliches wrong  
Hatred is just as strong  
You know it's just as strong  
Just as strong as love  
  
So you need to take your hate  
And doubt and fear  
Distill them through your word  
'Til they run clear  
  
'Til they run right through your heart  
Like Highland rain  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain  
  
Do you want to be the best  
Or be well known?  
Do you want to repeat lines  
Or write your own?  
  
Do you want to follow paths  
Or blaze a trail?  
When you try to succeed  
You mostly fail  
  
And you're gonna lose  
And lose and lose again  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain

She's everything  
A married man  
Should look for in a girl  
She's married too  
But not to you  
And that's part of the thrill  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
She's old enough  
To know of love  
And know that this is not  
But young enough  
To not be willing  
To settle for what she's got  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight  
  
And if you get caught  
You're going to hell  
But it's heaven right now  
  
She's the one who makes you feel alright  
Her alibi's your alibi, it's watertight

Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
  
I respect your point of view  
You've got your thoughts  
I've got mine too  
But you'll be out of here  
If I don't hear the words I want to hear  
  
Your way  
No way  
You do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
  
I've watched you  
Backsliding  
Then there's trouble  
You, your always hiding  
  
Now if I was in your shoes  
I might look at me and think  
"There's a fool"  
But I'm not in your shoes  
And I don't have to play  
By your set of rules no no  
  
Your way  
Let me tell you that there's no way  
No way you do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
Hit it again  
  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
I'm stating, not negotiating  
You want more  
There's the door

When I wake up yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you  
When I go out yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you  
If I get drunk yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you  
And if I have yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you  
  
But I would walk 500 miles  
And I would walk 500 more  
Just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles  
  
To fall down at your door  
When I'm working yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you  
And when the money comes in for the work I'll do  
  
I'll pass almost every penny on to you  
When I come home yeah I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you  
And if I grow old well I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you  
  
When I'm lonely yes I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you  
When I'm dreaming yes I know I'm gonna dream  
Dream about the time when I'm with you

In recognition of a hundred million album sales  
In recognition of your popularity  
You take your gaudy prize  
From people you said you despise  
You wear your self-respect upon your bended knee  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
In recognition of your service to the working class  
In recognition of your party loyalty  
You get an ermine robe  
And you declare when you are probed  
You only took it so the missus would be pleased  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their names  
  
Oh vanity  
It gets them one by one  
Cat, religion, monarchy  
But only in tale, fairly frail  
  
In recognition of your bravery up on the stage  
In recognition of your bankability  
You get to wait in lines  
With soldiers crippled by land mines  
And you think it's the Yanks that don't get irony  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
In spite of all your claims  
It looks like you're just the same  
As every other clown who likes to put the crown  
Before or after their name  
  
Their name  
Their name  
Their name

Saw a man who was fifty-one  
He bad married daughters and a single son  
And he's lost his job as this years begun  
And it broke my heart  
  
Saw his wife who was fifty-two  
She said she was sure they could make it through  
That her single wage would just have to do  
And it broke my heart  
  
Talked about it with the family now  
What began in sadness ended up a row  
All the guys with the clever mouths  
They were saying we should move south  
Saw the son who's been gone two weeks  
And he's down already with a job to seek  
And he's in Kings Cross and there's no-one speaking  
And it broke my heart.

East Coast trains run slow  
And Edinburgh seems cold  
For eighteen year old's freedom  
But Leith feels like New York  
All the cars and talk  
Moving down the walk all day  
So I'm lying in this hotel  
Hearing sirens and drunken fights  
But I paid cash to the angels  
Guarding me tonight  
So I'm lying in this hotel  
Hearing sirens and drunken fights  
And I paid cash to the angel  
Guarding me tonight  
Dundee's on my own  
Cry when I come home  
Have to carry on somehow  
Leith could be New York  
All the cars and talk  
Moving down the walk all day  

When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Well broke off from my work the other day  
Spent the evening thinking about all the blood that flowed away  
Across the ocean to the second chance  
I wonder how it go on when it reached the promised land  
When you go will send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
I've looked at the ocean tried hard to imagine  
The way you felt the day you sailed from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia  
We should have held you, we should have told you  
But you know our sense of timing we always wait too long  
When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
Lochaber no more, Sutherland no more  
Lewis no more, Skye no more  
I wonder my blood will you ever return  
To help us kick the life back to a dying mutual friend?  
Do we not love her I think we all tell you about  
Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts?  
When you go will you send back a letter from America?  
Take a look up the rail track from Miami to Canada  
Bathgate no more, Linwood no more

When I was a younger man  
When I was a silly boy  
I didn't need a thing, I  
Was strong as anything, I  
Viewed solitude as a joy  
  
But since I met you I'm distraught  
You wandered in and now I'm caught  
I never thought I would see  
Someone so truly good  
Some one who's so everything I'm not  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
But what if, what if, what if what  
If it's not perfect then it's not  
But every care I'll take  
Nothing I won't forsake  
To dwell beside what you've got  
  
Every time I think about you  
I think I can't live with you  
I'll tell you something  
I am nothing without you  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
(Hey!)  
  
I want to spend my life with you  
Don't want to live all alone  
I can't conceive of the years left in me  
Without you in our home  
  
Without you in our home

I heard the rain  
As it skipped and rolled down the pane  
Sleep was almost here  
But I stirred from not having you near  
We were apart  
For the first time since you'd claimed my heart  
I said your name  
And I knew we would burn like a flame  
Now twenty years have gone  
And I know how much I've done you wrong  
I caused you pain  
And I know that things can't be the same  
But my love has a name  
And it's yours and it burns like a flame  

You were built to last a lifetime  
Just not the life that you live.  
You don't have to make it worse  
'Cause the world isn't perfect  
And you don't need to give a toss  
But you'd make it better if you did.  
You did, you did, you did.  
  
You were made to be loving,  
Not a source of bitterness and hate.  
And when you turn them on yourself  
You make one more useless martyr.  
Make the best of here and now  
Heaven or hell can wait,  
They'll wait, they'll wait, let them wait.  
  
When you lose your appetite for self-destruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy.  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle,  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
  
Oh, you were made to be happy,  
Not mired in sorrow and regret.  
Misery comes around enough  
You don't need to invite him.  
And when he leaves you should grab  
All the joy you can get.  
You can get, you can get, you can get.  
  
When you lose your appetite for self-destruction  
You can stop viewing life as tragedy.  
Give it a few more years and look from this angle  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Where it looks more and more and more like comedy.  
Like comedy.  
Like comedy.  
Like comedy.

A-one, two, three, four...  
  
A cynical mind won't help you through the night.  
And it can't hold you up when you're too tired to fight.  
Where you didn't have the strength to look after yourself.  
You find all that you need for somebody else.  
  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains, yes it can.  
Love can move mountains.  
  
That impossible task you're thinking of  
Is one you can complete when you're driven by love.  
And the strength that you find won't go slipping away.  
Once it enters your soul it's reborn every day.  
  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains, yes it can.  
  
So if you're lucky enough to live  
To see love come your way,  
Be thankful every day that it stays.  
Wo, that it stays.  
  
A cynical mind won't help you through the night.  
And it can't hold you up when you're too tired to fight.  
  
But love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains, yes it can.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains, yes it can.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains.  
Love can move mountains.

When the inspiration  
Is above my station  
Thoughts are iqeienchoiy  
And I let them pass  
I tend to view this nation  
Through the condensation  
  
On a dirty glass  
When the singer solemn  
Was a honnie laddie  
When she brushed his hair  
With a watered comb  
Then he could have wandered  
And he could have shown ye  
Seven hit is like home  
If misty eyes can witness  
Love and affection  
  
Why does the heart still resist  
What the hell is wrong with you?  
I've got eyes of misty blue  
All the things I want to do  
Are all I ever wanted to  
  
As the ladik grew  
And he looked around him  
At the thugs and rapists  
In their stolen suits  
Louder beat the rhythm  
  
Of his bloody heart  
Telling him to shoot  
Thoughtless competition  
Like a home-made prison  
Made him fix his vision  
On a certain fate  
What's the use in winning  
All the worlds creation  
If you won't create.

Just when every ray of hope was gone  
I should have known that you would come along  
I can't believe I ever doubted you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Another lonely night, a nameless town  
If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around  
'Cause I know I can always count on you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Lovers leave and friends will let you down  
But you're the only sure thing that I've found  
No matter what I do I'll never lose  
My old friend the blues  
  
Just let me hide my weary heart in you  
My old friend the blues

Lately, I've been forgetting  
To keep your memory Every day  
It's so long  
Since last time I saw you  
And sometimes the present  
Gets in the way  
But now and then  
You just walk right in  
Ask me how it's been  
Since you've been still  
And if I cry  
You just smile and sigh  
I never said goodbye  
I never will  
Lately things have been so good  
I with that you could  
Be here to see  
The beauty of all your grandchildren  
By your children  
Your legacy  
But now and then  
You just walk right in  
Ask me how it's been  
Since you've been still  
And if I cry  
You just smile and sigh  
I never said goodbye  
I never will  
Lately, I've been forgetting  
To keep your memory Every day

I'd never been lucky with girls I confess  
Don't know who to blame for my lack of success  
'Cause even with ones up the back of a bus  
There was always the risk of a slap in the puss  
  
But Jean, oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you  
  
The first time I met you it did cross my mind  
The next time I saw you there wasn't the time  
The third time I saw you I thought that I would  
The fourth time I met you I knew that I would  
  
But Jean, you let me get lucky with you  
  
I love her  
  
I want you forever, I want you for good  
So I'm gonna treat you the way that I should  
For your soul and body, my hearts gonna pound  
Even after the day that I'm laid in the ground  
  
'Cause Jean you let me get lucky with you  
  
Love her I love her.

Spent the morning - unaware  
Spent the daytime - didn't care  
Spent the evening - drawing breath  
Spent the nightime - fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Saw a picture I didn't know  
Of a football game played 50 years ago  
You see the jersey's being worn so proud  
But look behind them, look up at the crowd  
A sea of heads pointing right up to the sky  
Some of them are still with us and some of them have died  
I think the one's who've left are still with us aswell  
Cause I can hear them when the voices start to swell  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
Well I hear you, I don't see you  
Yes I hear you but I don't see you  
But it won't be long till I'm gone  
And then I'll know if my ears or eyes are wrong  
Spent the morning - unaware  
Spend the daytime - didn't care  
Spent the evening - drawing breath  
Spent the nightime - fearing death  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything  
One more down some more to go  
Then I'll know or I won't know  
If all the songs I hear you sing  
Are everything or anything

I think I had one too many  
I know I had one too many  
I think I had one too many is all  
  
I'm trying hard  
But I can't remember  
How I got home  
Don't recall any streets I roamed  
Can't remember at all  
  
I think I had one too many  
It must have been the one too many  
I think I had one too many is all  
To my disgrace  
All I recall is my daddy's face  
And how I wished  
That I could see home again  
  
I think I had

This is the story of our first teacher  
Shetland made her jumpers  
And the devil made her features  
Threw up her bands when my mum said our names  
Embroidered all her stories with slanderous claims  
It's over and done with  
  
This is the story of losing my virginity  
I held my breath and the bed held a trinity  
People I'm making no claims to a mystery  
But sometimes it seems like  
My sex life's all history  
I'm not saying these events didn't  
Touch our lives in any way  
But, ah, they didn't make the impression  
That some people say  
  
This is the story of watching a man dying  
The subjects unpopular  
But I don't feel like lying  
When I think of it now I acted like a sinner  
I just washed my bands  
Then I went for my dinner.

Correct me if you think that I'm mistaken  
I wouldn't want to overstate my case  
But while I'm the one bringing home the bacon  
I've got a right to be heard around this place  
  
You seem to think that life dealt you a bad deal  
On the day we both pronounced the words "I do"  
You yell at me for hours about what bugs you  
Well that's a waste of time 'cause I can do that too  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that  
  
I'm trying my best to be your husband  
And a father to our little baby girl  
And I'd rather rely on my own judgment  
Than the vagaries and fashions of this world  
  
If you wanted a doctor or a lawyer  
You should have married one of them instead of me  
Or some other guy who would ignore you  
When he'd make a point and you would disagree  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when doing that  
  
And now I'll make my confessing  
I love to row as much as you  
But while it might be fun, in the long run  
It's not going to change a thing we do  
  
Again I make my confession  
I love to row as much a you  
But while it might be fun, in the long run  
It's not going to change a thing we do  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that  
  
Shout shout don't leave a doubt  
Smash up the place or throw things about  
You won't change a thing by doing that  
Rant rave pull out your hair  
Turn on the tears, I still won't care  
You don't move me an inch when you do that

You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
Feel the sun and all the joy it brings  
To the simple things we are.  
Water rushing from a spring  
Is the simple thing we are.  
  
But any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our striving and our courage and our thunder.  
  
You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
  
At any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our skiving and our cowardice and our lying and our blunders.  
  
You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
  
Simple things we are.

Mary loves the grouse  
Hides the bottles 'round the house  
She watches chat shows and the soaps  
Brokenhearted but she copes  
Michael's out of work  
Feels he's sinking in the murk  
He's unshaven and a mess  
Finds it hard some days to dress  
Stevie smashed the delf  
'Cause he can't express himself  
He's consumed by rage  
Like his father at his age  
Rita's little child  
Has a lovely little smile  
But this means nothing to her father  
Because he's never even seen her  
And we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Joey's off the gear  
He's been clean for half a year  
He gets bored out of his mind  
But he's trying to toe the line  
Maggie's in a chair  
'Twas joyriding put her there  
She puts the kettle on the boil  
And she's always got a smile  
And we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to fight another day  
Yeah, we sing, sing all our cares away  
And we live to love another day  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
We grow strong from it all  
We grow strong or we fall  
And we sing all our cares away  

It could be tomorrow, or it could be today  
When the sky takes the soul  
The earth takes the clay  
I sometimes wonder why I pray  
When my spirit drives away  
  
With a faith and a bit of luck  
And a half-tonne bomb in the back of a truck  
Feel the towel it's wet with sorrow  
From the tears we'll shed tomorrow  
  
Don't bring flowers, take a chance  
On some graves you should dance  
It its tomorrow, or if its today  
I don't say it will be, I just say it may  
  
When I'm on my knees  
To the gates I'll stumble  
And plead my case  
In a style that's humble.

Let me give praise to your sparkling eyes  
And your coloured hair.  
Let me spend ages on poetic phrases  
To show I care.  
Let me go grazing on dappled green pastures  
Where you're the mare.  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Let me donate something to a kid's charity  
Of your choice.  
For you I would willingly be a worse traitor  
Than William Joyce.  
If I could sing I would sing you a song  
In Sam Cooke's voice.  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Are you happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Are you really happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Tell me where it hurts.  
It hurts there and there and there.  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Are you happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Are you really happy now?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Tell me where it hurts.  
It hurts there and there and there.  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air.  
  
Madam Onassis took Ari's old glasses  
And put them on.  
She said "I see ships" and she started to quip  
About old Boston.  
I climbed over her just to climb upon you,  
What did I do wrong?  
Let me rephrase that  
I think there's a better line there,  
Spinning around in the air.

My heart was broken, my heart was broken  
Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow  
My heart was broken, my heart was broken  
  
You saw it,  
You claimed it  
You touched it,  
You saved it  
  
My tears are drying, my tears are drying  
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you  
My tears are drying, my tears are drying  
  
Your beauty and kindness  
Made tears clear my blindness  
While I'm worth my room on this earth  
I will be with you  
  
While the Chief, puts Sunshine On Leith  
I'll thank him for his work  
And your birth and my birth.

Sweet little girls  
Cut a swathe through this world  
Using skills that they get  
From their mothers  
Sweet little girls  
Might like ribbons and curls  
But they most like to torture their brothers  
  
And sweet little girls  
Love their friends  
'Till it hurts  
Or until they can find them another  
  
Watch their lips, they make a circle like  
"Coo coo coo coo"  
But the words their saying softly are  
Cruel cruel cruel  
  
Sweet little girls  
Cut a swathe through this world  
Using skills that they get  
From their mothers  
  
Watch their lips, they make a circle like  
"Coo coo coo coo"  
But the words their saying softly are  
Cruel cruel cruel  
  
Yeah sweet little girls  
Cut a swathe through this world  
Using skills that they get  
From their mothers  
Using skills that they get from their mothers  
Using skills that they get from their  
Aah ah

Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Diamonds of water, and salt from your body  
Coming down to meet my kisses  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Staining your skin and my skin and beginning  
The stories that you can't begin  
  
The way I feel could be despised  
But its a vision that I prize  
Teardrops  
Teardrops  
  
I'm not trying to make you feel pain  
Or joy to make the tears flow  
But when they roll unashamed  
They move me so  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Let me, let me brush them with my fingers  
Comfort you and say its alright  
  
It's so strong this way I feel  
Sometimes I want to beg or steal  
Teardrops  
Teardrops.

Streetlight  
Yellow in the room  
Lifting out our futures from the gloom  
Same song  
In the street below  
Football song that everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
That's when he told her  
That he loved her  
And he'd love her all his life  
And he'd love her all his life  
  
Bright lights  
Five years down the lane  
Point to where  
The just born babies cry  
He knows now  
They are joined for good  
Life could never break them  
Nothing could  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Thirty years pass  
Like a sonic boom  
Sunlight floods  
Into a different room  
They both know they're saying  
Goodbye too soon  
But there's no more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's when he told her  
That he meant it  
When he said he loved her  
And he'd love her all his life

Since I started being impressed  
By the things that move me  
All the treasures that I missed  
Came back to stand around me  
And as I curse the wasted time  
  
I lift my head to say  
Thank you god you gave the strength  
That helped me walk away  
All the fear and anger  
Still stays within my heart  
And I can't recall the last time  
I imagined they'd depart  
  
But this is what I'm going to do  
When they force me to doubt  
I'll ask for what I know remains  
  
To help me sing them out  
As rays of sun shine through the clouds  
To heat the soaking ground  
So when we come to sing the shouts  
  
We'll burn the theaters down  
Let every disbelieving sneer  
That looked me in the back  
Turn, come towards us,  
And feel the first attack.

I'm not going to talk about doubts and confusion  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
I'd never been to Ayrshire  
I hitched down one saturday  
Sixty miles to Kilmarnock  
To see Hibernian play  
The day was bright and sunny  
But the game I won't relay  
And there was no Kilmarnock Bunnet  
To make me want to stay  
  
But I'm not going to talk about it  
On a night when I can see with my eyes shut  
When I started walking at Wishaw  
My eyes obscured my vision  
After five miles on my way  
I began to learn to listen  
  
I walked through the country  
I walked through the town  
I held my head up  
And I didn't look down  
The question doesn't matter  
The answer's always "aye"  
The best view of all  
Is where the land meets the sky.

You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out don't you  
You just hold your hand out don't you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
'Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
(Well it might)  
Well it might in your world  
  
(But it doesn't)  
But it doesn't in mine  
(I've been stumbling)  
I've been stumbling in the dark for years  
And the light just made me blind  
  
You say it lights every pathway  
Shows me how to live life  
For the rest of my days  
For the rest of my days  
  
(But I can't)  
But I can't put my faith in  
(Your words)  
Your words and demands  
  
(I believe)  
I believe in God alright  
It's folk like you I just can't stand  
  
You don't have to try and scare me  
To reinforce my faith sir  
'cause I know that one day  
I'll stand before my maker  
  
(And it I'm found)  
And if I'm found wanting  
(When my case)  
When my case is heard  
  
(It'll be)  
It'll be by the author  
Not some interpreter of his words  
  
You make it sound easy  
You say just hold your hand out don't you  
You just hold your hand out don't you  
That hope never leaves you  
  
'Cause a light shines on that helps you to steer  
Makes everything clear  
(Well it might)  
Well it might in your world  
  
(But it doesn't)  
But it doesn't in mine  
(I've been stumbling)  
I've been stumbling in the dark for years  
  
And the light just made me blind  
Yeah the light just made me blind

The threat, they say  
Comes from countries ending in  
Where the family name is Khan  
And they all read the Koran  
  
The answer, they say  
Is to bomb them all to dust  
Then in fifty years they just  
Might be able to see things our way  
  
We're not barbarians  
Like we were way back when  
We've learned from history  
So we're going round again  
  
I miss the days  
When the threat to our position  
Didn't come from some religion  
But from godless communism  
  
We're not barbarians  
Like we were way back when  
We've learned from history  
So we get to go round, get to go round  
Get to go round, get to go round again  
  
Tell your sons  
Not to bother with football  
Get a backpack on and crawl  
We're in this for the long haul  
  
Tell your sons  
Not to bother with football  
Get a backpack on and crawl  
We're in this for the long haul

The life that I've been living  
From the day I first drew breath  
Has been my way of forgetting  
I'm on the journey to my death  
  
You make my soul rise up  
You make my eyes to see  
When I place my faith in you  
And I lose my belief in me  
  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
  
I don't believe in beads or crystals  
Instant karma or mother earth  
I don't believe that what I think  
Makes any difference to what I'm worth  
  
I don't believe in reincarnation  
I'm not coming back as a flower  
I don't bow my head to kings or priests  
'Cause I believe in your higher power  
  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
The less I believe in me  
The more I believe in thee  
  
Oh you've given me a plan  
That I don't understand  
'Cause I've wandered over half the world  
But I've remained an ignorant man  
  
One thing That I know  
Is when the final bell tolls  
Human love won't be enough  
Good deeds can't save my soul  
  
Well I'm not afraid of dying  
But I am afraid of you  
Because you hear me when I'm lying  
And you see the things I do  
  
So the hands go round the clock  
As the light goes from the room  
And I can't help thinking to myself  
I'm going to find out much to soon  
  
Oh you've given me a plan  
That I don't understand  
'Cause I've wandered over half the world  
But I've remained a ignorant man  
  
One thing that I know  
Is when the final bell tolls  
Human love won't be enough  
Good deeds can't save my soul  
I believe etc. etc...

Don't get me wrong  
Don't mind you shouting  
Just think your style excludes  
The part that really matters  
  
Just grow tired  
Of empty minds mouthing  
English language courses  
While they struggle with the a be see of heart  
  
And I confess  
That all I've learnt  
Has been learnt a million times  
By every empty heart  
  
That ever felt a song come home  
But I'd he happy  
When next I ask the time  
11 I find I've wasted none of mine  
listening while you wasted all of yours.

The thought of you  
Precious and clear  
Drives all the rest  
From out of here.  
The thought of you  
Just won't wait.  
It rises up,  
It elevates.  
  
The thought of you  
Heals me again  
Of all the poison  
That lies within.  
The thought of you  
Reaches inside,  
Takes it away,  
Conquers my pride.  
  
Just the thought of you  
And time and space and death  
Just don't exist.  
Just the thought of you  
And I know  
I need nothing more than this.  
  
The thought of you  
Makes me complete.  
Wraps all the bandages  
'Round my feet.  
The thought of you  
Still cracks me up.  
Laughs in my face.  
Fills up my cup.  
  
The thought of you  
Sustains me still  
And evermore,  
Oh, It always will.  
Oh, it always will.

Thought that I'd be happy  
Gonna be so happy living life alone  
And never sharing anything  
  
Thought that I was finished,  
Thought that I was complete  
Thought that I was whole  
Instead of being half of something  
  
Thought that I was growing, growing older  
Wiser, understanding why  
This world hold nothing for my spirit  
Thought that I was destined,  
  
Destined to be nothing,  
Destined to be nothing in this world  
And then I met you.  
  
I met you  
  
Thought that God had failed me  
Thought my prayers were useless  
Thought that he would never give  
The chance for me to praise him  
  
Thought the book was written  
Thought the game had ended  
Thought the song was sung  
And I could never sing another  
  
Thought my faith was misplaced  
Thought my back was broken  
  
Broken by a weight that I  
Was never fit to carry  
Thought I knew this city,  
Thought I knew all about it  
And then one night I went to Morningside  
And you were waiting  
Then I met you.

There's your coat upon my back.  
There's the irony I lacked.  
There's the vapor from your mouth.  
There's the rain spreading from the south.  
  
There's the castle on the hill.  
There's my final act of will.  
There's a bus stop in Tollcross.  
There's no memory I've lost.  
Memories never lost.  
  
There's you lying on the quilt.  
There's your west of Scotland lilt,  
Singing me your guilt.  
  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
There's your voice on the phone.  
  
There's the snow in January.  
There's the beauty that you see.  
There's you walking down the street,  
Children running 'round your feet.  
There's you and there's me.

There's a touch upon my lips  
Left by memory's fingertips  
I still hear her voice  
When there's no sound  
  
There's a touch upon my skin  
Left when she went back to him  
All the rest has gone  
She's not around  
  
When I saw her first  
It was lust my friend  
Thought it would burn  
Then it would end  
But I lost my old philosophy  
Now I believed in love  
Well the months went by and my love grew strong  
Thought she felt the same but I was wrong  
She held my old philosophy  
Now I'm destroyed by love  
  
There's a touch  
  
Well I still believed that I would win  
'cause I was a better man than him  
She held the new philosophy  
Now she believed in love  
But the love she felt was not for me  
Said she would have to set me free  
Now I know there's no philosophy  
That can't be destroyed by love  
  
There's a touch

These arms of mine  
They are lonely  
Lonely and feeling blue  
  
These arms of mine  
They are yearning  
Yearning from wanting you  
And if you  
  
Would let them hold you  
How grateful I will be  
  
These arms of mine  
The are burning  
Burning from wanting you  
These arms of mine  
  
The are wanting  
Wanting to hold you  
  
And if you  
Just let them hold you  
How grateful I will be  
How grateful I will be  
  
Come on come on baby  
Just be my woman  
Just be my lover  
I need someone  
  
Somebody to hold me tight  
And I need  
Your warm, warm loving arms  
Around me tonight  
  
Just let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
Let my arms hold you  
Just let them hold you  
  
Please let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
Come on let me hold you  
Just let me hold you  
  
Please let me hold you  
Just let me hold you

Three more days and then I'll see  
The people who depend on me.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Not long now until I step inside  
The place where we all reside.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
And life's rolled on and on  
The whole time I've been gone.  
  
I walk around today feeling right.  
I dreamt about each one of them last night.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
And life's rolled on and on  
The whole time I've been gone.  
  
When I close my eyes I can see  
The faces of my family.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Everything that I hold dear  
Lies five thousand miles from here.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Home.

I've been so sad  
Since you said my accent was bad  
He's worn a frown  
This Caledonia clown  
I'm just going to have to learn to hesitate  
To make sure my words  
  
On your Saxen ears don't grate  
But I wouldn't know a single word to say  
If I flattened all the vowels  
And threw the 'are' away  
  
You say that if I want to get ahead  
The language I use should he left for dead  
It doesn't please your ears  
  
And though you tell it like a leg pull  
I think your still full of John Bull  
You just refuse to bear  
  
Some days I stand  
On your green and pleasant land  
Now dare I show face  
When my diction is such a disgrace  
  
Oh what can I do  
To be understood by you  
Perhaps for some money  
I could talk like a bee dripping honey.

Yes I know you're right  
I see it in your fierce eyes  
But me I've never thought straight  
Since the day I had the first doubt  
  
Yes I know you're right  
And I'll back you to a point pal  
But I'll never be constrained  
By another man's ideas now  
  
I spent too long on this road  
Looking for the answers  
But Poverty and Failure  
Aren't what I'm after  
  
I painted "Fight" on factories  
But they closed the factory down pal  
I want to find out where the Heart's gone  
Find out where the nerves gone  
  
What do you do  
When democracy fails you  
What do you do  
When the rest can't see its true?  
  
Pat votes the Scots way  
Just like her mother  
But South always takes all  
Just like her brother  
  
The next time she might vote  
So might the others  
But times running out pal  
Cause they're giving up in numbers  
  
What do you do  
When Democracy's all through  
What do you do  
When minority means you?

Now I've got a question baby  
What makes you cry?  
'Cause I haven't seen any water  
In the corners of your eyes  
  
For a day, or a week  
Or a month, or a year  
Haven't seen much of you  
Since you left me my dear  
  
Can't you see that I'm hurting  
How I'm falling apart  
Don't you care about my drinking  
Or my poor lonely heart  
  
I thought you liked football  
You didn't mind those videos  
And my dog didn't mean  
To ruin your clothes (he can't help it)  
  
Now you won't take my phone calls  
You sent my letters back  
You're paying for a lawyer  
To stab me in the back  
  
Then I saw you on the street  
You looked happy, that's a fact  
I'm impressed - it's a hell of an act  
  
Angel - admit it, admit it  
Darlin' - admit it, admit it  
Your love for me didn't die  
It's just sleepin'  
  
Now I hope you can hear me  
Wherever you are  
In a cheap hotel room  
Or the back seat of a car  
  
I make up those situations  
I don't know if they're true  
But I'll tell you, for now, they'll do  
  
Angel - admit it, admit it  
Darlin' - admit it, admit it  
Your love for me didn't die  
It's just sleepin'  
And it wakes every night  
To your weeping'  
  
Now I've got a question baby  
What makes you cry?

Whatever you've got, I want some too.  
Whatever you're drinking, I'll drink with you.  
You're saying "azure", I'm feeling blue.  
That's no lie.  
  
Whatever was done unto your hair,  
Vidal Sassoon was standing there.  
He fought the facists, keep him in your prayers.  
That's no lie.  
  
Whatever the time,  
Whatever the place,  
Whatever the rhyme,  
Whatever the reason.  
I'm giving offence  
And with your defense  
I think we could have  
A very good season.  
  
Whatever the rights, I want the wrongs.  
Whatever the food, let's hear the gong.  
We've spoken the truth for so long,  
We need lies.  
  
Whatever the time,  
Whatever the place,

Whatever the reason.  
I'm giving offense

Whatever the rights, I want the wrongs.  
Whatever the food, let's hear the gong.  
We've spoken the truth for so long,  
We need lies.  
  
Whatever you've got.  
Whatever you've got.  
Whatever you've got.  
Whatever you've got. (Whatever you've got.)  
Whatever you've got.  
Whatever you've got.  
Whatever you've got.

So you're back on top again  
Proving everybody wrong  
But I recall the days  
You didn't feel so strong  
When love struck you down  
You thought that you were bound to die  
From all the pain inside  
When love struck you down  
  
When they were handing out the brains  
You were at the head of the queue  
But once she got inside your heart  
They were no use to you  
When love struck you down  
No one else was fooled  
Fear and madness ruled  
When love struck you down  
  
You weren't there  
When she was everywhere  
Her face, her name  
But no matter what you said  
She never felt the same  
  
When love struck you down  
Oh how hard you prayed  
But God didn't come to your aid  
When love struck you down  
  
When love struck you down  
You felt like you were bound to die  
From all the pain inside  
When love struck you down  
  
When love struck you down  
No one else was fooled  
Fear and madness ruled  
When love struck you down

When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Seeing things like your heart with wings  
Then you hear violin strings playing  
Feel all the things that you feel you should  
You would lie, you would kill, you would die  
At least that's what you're saying  
The worst thing is that you really would  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Six thousand million people in the world  
And you say there's just one  
The only one, and you must be together  
And if they love you the pain is so sweet  
And it just gets better and better  
And if they don't  
You want them more than ever  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind

A hundred years ago  
I thought happiness was ice cream and football.  
But time went by so fast  
Till I couldn't see their attractions at all.  
I looked around for other pleasures.  
The old man had shown the way then.  
Just in time I found women and wine.  
  
I marvelled at the way that they united men  
For the working and middle and upper classes.  
You didn't need any brains  
Just a taste for booze and a eye for lassies.  
I'm not basking in reflected glory  
But open any book and I think you'll find that  
The greatest men of all time  
Loved women and wine  
Or men and wine.  
  
Ah, they'll be the death of you  
If something else doesn't get you first.  
  
Well I'm older now  
And have to take my pleasures in moderation.  
Least that's what it says here in this guide to  
Declining years in declining nations.  
But just 'cause I've slowed up a bit  
Doesn't mean I can't cheer from the touchline.  
I hope sons of mine  
Spend lots of time  
On women and wine,  
Women and wine.

From birth to five, you're learning  
From five to ten, you're playing  
By the time you're fifteen  
You're never wrong  
But then you turn around  
And it's all gone, your childhood  
  
Now daddy knows what he's saying  
You're in my arms and I'm praying  
That I'll be given the strength and time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood  
  
Every morning  
Your crying ends my sleep  
I kid on I'm angry  
But it's not a feeling I can keep  
There's no light outside  
I don't care 'cause I know it's true  
That in our house  
The sun shines out of you  
You've got your mother's looks  
Your're a beautiful little girl  
You'll break boys hearts  
All over this world  
Then one day you'll walk out the door  
And I know you'll break mine  
You'll break mine  
  
From birth to five, you're learning  
From five to ten, you're playing  
By the time you're fifteen you're never wrong  
But then you turn around and it's all gone  
Your childhood  
  
So you're trying to talk  
Any day now you'll walk  
You'll be running around  
Make me act like a clown  
'cause I live and I breathe  
For my little girl  
Our little girl  
The most important thing is this whole wide world  
Now daddy know what he's saying  
Your in my arms and I'm praying  
That I'll be given the strength an time  
To make yours just as happy as mine  
Your childhood
