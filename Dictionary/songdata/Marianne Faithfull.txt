Someone who isn't like you and to waste it all.  
Someone to be around,  
Someone to have me hold when the deal goes down.  
Didn't I say it would happen this way in the end?  
Didn't I say it would happen this way in the end?  
  
A perfect stranger is what it seems,  
A perfect stranger, a crazy dream,  
A crazy dream.  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to do for now,  
Someone who isn't like you but knows why and how.  
Someone to walk away,  
Someone who knows the time to leave or to stay.  
Isn't it sad, baby, we never have it that way?  
Isn't it sad, baby, we never have it that way?  
  
A perfect stranger is what he seems,  
A perfect stranger, a crazy dream,  
A crazy dream.  
  
Find myself a perfect stranger to take me there  
Someone who isn't like you but know why and where  
Soemone who's not afraid  
Someone who's blind to all the promises made.  
  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it this way Perfect stranger  
How does it feel, baby, we shouldn't leave it...

Some fools don't know what's right from wrong  
But somehow those folks belong  
Me, I try for all I'm worth  
But I still remain a stranger on this earth  
  
Some people gloom, other folk cry  
Me, I have to struggle to keep alive  
Ever since the day of my birth  
I've been a stranger, stranger on this earth  
  
I try to be what all folks should  
Forgetting the bad and doing good  
But no matter how I try  
My troubles always multiply  
  
Now I've been doing the best I can  
Ever since life began  
Some day when I prove my worth  
I won't be a stranger on earth  
  
Now I've been living the best I can  
Ever since my life began  
The day's gonna come when I prove my worth  
And I won't be no stranger  
No, I won't be a stranger  
On this earth  

Take a hard look around you, babe,  
There ain't nobody got it made  
So you can live in your head  
Or you can live in your heart  
But if you don't live at all  
Then why the hell did you start ?  
Thrill's a thrill  
I said a thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
A thrill's a thrill.  
Now the young boys are all hanging out in the bars,  
Old men they don't have to cruise all night in cars.  
And those young girls love the smell of flowers,  
Old women love to play with them for hours.  
Gays are straight -  
And straights are weird  
The bi's just call  
Everybody 'dear'.  
You know a thrill's a thrill  
I said a thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
Down to get up -  
Yeah, up to get down.  
Oh, I will try anything  
If it makes my head go round.  
Leather whips  
And fingertips  
I know a boy who is growing, growing.  
A thrill's a thrill  
A thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
Take a hard look around you, baby,  
Ain't nobody got it made.  
You can live in your head,  
You can live in your heart  
And if you don't live at all  
Then why the hell did you start ?  
A thrill's a thrill  
A thrill's a thrill  
Even in paradise  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
I said a thrill's a thrill.  
A thrill's ...

Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar  
Oh, don't ask why, oh, don't ask why!  
For we must find the next whiskey bar

I tell you  
I tell you  
I tell you we must die!

We now must say good-bye  
We've lost our good old momma  
And must have dollars, oh you know why!  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama  
We now must say good-bye  
We've lost our good old momma  
And must have dollars, oh you know why!

You've been right and I've been wrong,  
I've been weak and you've been strong.  
You've been good and I've been bad,  
Think I've had enough of that.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause all I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might.  
All I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might.  
  
I loved the days, you loved the night,  
I loved to love, you loved to fight.  
I drive to you, you're far away,  
It gets harder every day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wish you could be a friend of mine,  
Wish you could learn to play with time.  
You say I dream my life away  
If I do, well that's OK.  
  
[Chorus: x3]

It took a long time coming  
That big over the shoulder statement  
But when it came, it flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair [Repeat: x3]  
  
Remember to write often  
In case you have something to tell me,  
But please don't mention the unexpected guest  
Staring into empty eyes [Repeat: x3]  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back, come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain.  
  
Then you left us  
To see if you could find it  
And when you came back, it flowed easy as poison  
It flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair [Repeat: x3]  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back, come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain [Repeat: x2]  
  
Happiness that feels like pain. [Repeats]

I once used to think in my innocent youth,  
(And I once was as innocent as you),  
That someone some day might come my way,  
And then I should know what's best to do.  
And if he'd got money, and seemed a nice chap,  
And his workday shirts were white as snow,  
And if he knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
I'd have to tell him, "No!"  
That's where you must keep your head screwed on and insist on  
Going slow.  
Sure the moon will shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat is on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things can go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, "No!"  
The first one that came was a man of Kent,  
And all that a man ought to be.  
The second one owned three ships down at Wopping,  
And the third was crazy about me.  
And as they'd got money, and all seemed nice chaps,  
And their workday shirts were white as snow,  
And as they knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
Each time I told them, "No!"  
That's when I used to get my head screwed on and I chose to take  
It slow.  
Sure the moon could shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat was on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things could go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, "No!"  
But then one day, and the day was blue,  
Came a man who didn't ask at all.  
And he went and hung his hat on the nail of my little attic,  
And what happened, I can't recall.  
And as he'd got no money and was not a nice chap,  
And his Sunday shirts were not like snow,  
And as he'd no idea of treating a girl with due respect,  
I could not tell him, "No!"  
That's the day my head was not screwed on, and to hell with going  
Slow!  
Oh, the moon could shine so clear and bright,  
Oh, the boat kept drifting downstream that night,  
That was how it simply had to go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
In the end you'll have to let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you know it might start,  
And there's no time for saying, "No!"

Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close, try and understand  
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed.  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hand  
Take my hand, come under cover,  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now.  
Because the night was made for lovers,  
Because the night was made for love.  
Because the night was made for lovers,  
Because the night was made for us.  
Have I doubt when I'm alone ?  
Love is a ring, the telephone.  
Love is an angel disguised as lust  
Here in our bed till the morning comes.  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command.  
Take my hand, come under cover,  
They can't touch me now,  
Can touch me now,  
Can touch me now.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to love.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to us.  
My love would leave  
No doubt a vicious circle turns and burns.  
Without you, oh I could not live  
Forgive the only person.  
I believe, yes I believe in freedom,  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to love.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,  
Because the night belongs to us.  
Because tonight there are true lovers,  
Can we believe in the night we trust.  
Because tonight there are true lovers,  
Because tonight belongs to us.

Before the poison, I wasn't down  
If you'd been there, if you'd been around  
I couldn't hear, couldn't hear a sound  
I was floating above the ground  
  
Before the poison, I had lost my fear  
Maybe too happy to even care  
Safe in my dream, couldn't see the fog  
Comin' on, coming from nowhere, my name to call  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end, what's left for you, my friend?  
  
Before the poison, I'd laugh out loud  
I'd see your face in any crowd  
But speak softly without fear  
Hold on to me, hold me near  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end, what's left for you, my friend?  
  
What's left for you, my friend?  
What's left for you, my friend?  
What's left for you?

Watch out now, take care,  
Beware of falling swingers  
Dropping all around you  
The pain that often mingles  
In your fingertips.  
Beware of darkness.  
Watch out now, take care,  
Beware the thoughts that linger  
Winding up inside your head  
The hopelessness around you  
In the dead of night.  
Beware of sadness.  
It can hit you  
It can hurt you  
Make you sore  
And what is more,  
That is not what  
You are here for.  
Watch out now, take care,  
Beware of soft shoe shufflers  
Dancing down the sidewalks  
As each unconscious sufferer  
Wanders aimlessly,  
Beware of maya.  
Watch out now, take care,  
Beware of greedy leaders.  
They'll take you where you should not go,  
While weeping atlas cedars,  
They just want to grow, grow and grow.  
Beware of darkness.  

Woke up this morning, feeling blue  
Seen a good looking girl, can I make love with you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I went back home, put on my tie  
Gonna get that girl that money will buy  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
She looked at me, begin to smile  
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait  
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I'll tell you something, tell you the facts  
You don't want to give my money back  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do

How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times can a cannon ball fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
  
[Chorus]  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
How many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head,  
And pretend that he just doesn't see?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How many times can a man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
  
[Chorus]

Charming, someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Something to charm  
Danger, someone to harm  
Falling into the mire  
Climbing, higher and higher  
  
Someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Ivory tower  
Longing for something now  
Waiting, hour after hour  
Give me some of your power  
  
Citadel, a prison of sorts  
Only the rich make the laws  
Using repression and force  
Whore of Babylon, City of Quartz  
  
Someone to fear  
Hidden and very much here  
Hatred summoned so near  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

When cockleshells turn silver bells  
Then will my love return to me  
Then will my love return to me  
Then will my love return to me  
Love return to me  
Love return to me  
Love return  
Love return  
Love return to me.  
In pastures green  
I shall be seen  
With my true love right by my side  
With my true love right by my side  
With my true love right by my side  
Love right by my side  
Love right by my side  
Love right by  
Love right by  
Love right by my side.  
When I return then you shall learn  
That I shall be my true love's bride  
That I shall be my true love's bride  
That I shall be my true love's bride  
Be my true love's bride  
Be my true love's bride  
Be my true love's  
Be my true love's  
Be my true love's bride.  
When love gets old it grows cold  
And then true love will fade away  
And then true love will fade away  
And then true love will fade away  
True love fades away  
True love fades away  
True love fades  
True love fades  
True love fades away.  

The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
And I've grown weary waiting for love to say  
"Come my way, come my way."  
  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy dance since time begun  
But o how weary and how long the day will he say  
"Come my way."  
  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
"Love come her way," come my way.

The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
But I've grown weary waiting for love to say,  
"Come my way, come my way."  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy bounce since time begun  
But O how weary and how long the day  
Will he say, "Come my way."  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy,  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
"Love come her way," come my way.  
  

Little months little smokes  
And oblivion in a wool dress  
In a door opens tenderly  
Near a wall where the wind is born  
Near the jolly garden  
Where saints and angels  
Are afraid of the seasons  
The alleys have no names  
They are the hours or the years  
I stroll leisurely  
Dressed in a cement overcoat  
And a hat of black straw  
I don't remember  
If it's nice out  
I walk smoking  
And I smoke walking  
Easily  
Every once in a while I tell myself  
It's time to stop  
And I continue walking  
I tell myself  
I have to get some air  
I have to look at the clouds  
And breathe in a lung full  
I have to see the flies fly  
And take a little exercise  
I shouldn't smoke so much  
I tell myself also  
Calculate  
I tell myself again  
I have a headache  
My life is a drop of water on my eyelid  
And I'm no longer twenty  
Continue  
The songs are songs  
And the days days  
I no longer have one shred of respect for myself  
But I see no hoodlums  
Who smoke the same cigarettes as me  
And who are just as stupid as me  
I'm pretty content  
Without really knowing why  
It doesn't suffice to speak of the sun  
The stars  
The sea and rivers  
Blood eyes hands  
It is necessary quite often  
To speak of other things  
We know that there are very beautiful countries  
With very handsome men  
With no less charming women,  
But all that isn't really sufficient  
But dizzying void  
Which rings and bays  
Makes the head bow  
We look and we see  
Again many other things  
Which are always the same  
Innumerable  
Identical  
And over there simply  
Someone goes by  
Simple as hello  
And everything starts all over once again  
I read in the stars the good will of my friends  
In a river I love one hand  
I listen the flowers sing  
There are the goodbyes of birds  
A cry falls like a fruit  
My God my God  
I will be accordingly always the same  
My head in my hands  
And my hands in my head

I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand,  
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight.  
It's taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for forty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
He came from Miami to start out again.  
To leave him was easy, I did it all the time.  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,  
If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for thirty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
I was an actress, a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy.  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris,  
I'm only talkin' 'cause you looked like you needed a friend.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for twenty-five dollars I'm half-way  
To Miami.

Corrina, Corrina, gal where you been so long?  
Corrina, Corrina, gal where you been so long?  
I've been worryin' about you, baby, baby, please come home  
  
I got a bird that whistles, I got a bird that sings  
I got a bird that whistles, I got a bird that sings  
But I ain't a-got Corrina, life don't mean a thing  
  
Corrina, Corrina, gal you're on my mind  
Corrina, Corrina, gal you're on my mind  
I was in love thinkin' of you, I just can't keep from cryin'

Now is the glimmering spinning beginning  
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes  
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows  
Of night, here with you in my arms.  
  
This is the moment that pauses to hold us  
As you and I move in a background of wonder,  
Surrounded by countless enclosures  
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.  
  
Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower  
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,  
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings  
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,  
You see how I need you, come down.  
  
And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,  
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,  
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us  
And nestled against us  
  
You're here  
And warm.  
  
And mine till the time  
When the dawn will awake you,  
The morning will shake you,  
The highway will take you.  
  
But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets  
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights  
We count on the night to hold everything even,  
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,  
And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.  
  
But now as the gardens of softening night time  
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,  
You and I come together  
And walk through the dreams of the stars.  
  
So here while the song of the deepening evening  
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,  
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow  
And know where we've been.

Hated by all and everywhere he goes  
Blazing contempt for human life and lies  
Murder as art and what he knows he knows  
From life and fear in other people's eyes  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She walks the boulevard without a care  
Knowing too much but having come so far  
Pretending life is just a game you play for nothing  
Loving no one and no where  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She looks as if expecting a surprise  
Maybe an encounter that will change her life  
Not knowing hot from cold or good for bad  
If life is just a joke or if it makes her sad  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling.  
It's you, it's you, it's you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
Yes, I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
But when you come, and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead, as dead I well may be  
You'll come and find rhe place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.  
  
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me  
And all my breath shall be warm and sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I will sleep in peace until you come for me.

Desperanto spoken here,  
Today I hear it everywhere,  
It is the language of Despair  
It's in your nails and It's in your hair  
It's in your mouth instead of air  
It's in your house  
It's in your heart  
It's in your mind  
It's everywhere  
  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's in your blood  
It's in your prayer  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
It's in your mouth instead of air  
It's in your breath  
It's in your blood  
It's in your heart  
It's in your blood  
It's in your heart  
It's everywhere  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
I know baby you don't care  
To speak in Desperanto here  
And I know you'd never dare  
To speak the language of despair  
C'mon baby get over here  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
  
It's in your hair  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
C'mon baby get over here  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's everywhere  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
The Desperanto they are broken here  
Broken darlin' by Despair  
The rain it speaks  
The wind the air  
  
Today I hear it everywhere  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your breath  
It's in your tears  
  
This has been going on for years  
It's in your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your blood  
It's everywhere  
  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your mouth  
In your blood  
It's everywhere  
It's in your mouth  
  
In your mouth, and  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now

In the wintertime  
Keep your feet warm,  
Keep your clothes on  
And don't forget me.  
Keep the memory,  
But keep your powder dry, too.  
  
In the summer  
By the pool side  
While the fireflies  
Are all around me,  
I'll miss you when I'm lonely,  
I'll miss the alimony, too.  
  
Don't forget me, please don't forget me,  
Make it easy on me just for a little while.  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.  
  
When we're older  
And full of cancer  
It doesn't matter now,  
Come on, get happy,  
'Cause nothing lasts forever,  
And I will always love you.  
  
Don't forget me, please don't forget me,  
Make it easy on me just for a little while.  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.  
  
You know I'll think about you,  
Let me know you think about me, too.

When you're alone  
And life is making you lonely  
You can always go  
Down town  
  
When you've got worries  
All the noise and the hurry  
Seems to hurt, I know  
Down town  
  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose?  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when you're  
Down town  
No finer place for sure  
Down town  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around  
And let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows  
Down town  
  
Maybe you know  
Some little places to go  
To where they never close  
Down town  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bossa-nova  
You'll be dancing with them, too, before the night is over  
Happy again  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Where all the lights are bright  
Down town  
Waiting for you tonight  
Down town  
You're gonna be all right now  
  
And you may find  
Somebody kind  
To help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you  
And needs a gentle hand  
To guide him along  
  
So maybe I'll see you there  
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when you're  
Down town  
Don't wait a minute more  
Down town  
Everything's waiting for you

Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Light is slanting sideways  
Sun is getting through.  
Gonna take a taxi  
Gotta get to you!  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the rooms.  
Isn't it a pity  
Time goes by so soon ...  
Time goes by so soon.  
If I can find the secret in the green  
I'll let you know.  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go ... go  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the rooms.  
Isn't it a pity  
Time goes by so soon ...  
Time goes by so soon.  
If I can find the secret in the green  
I'll let you know.  
And if you seek a treasure made of silver  
You can go ... go.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  
Easy in the city,  
Easy in the mind.  

I know that woman in the mirror  
Not quite yours and not quite mine  
Who she is can't say for sure  
Could be from another tide  
She's the Queen of Sheba, my father's mother  
Her face is low flying Africa  
She says to me she is not me  
So tell me, tell me who is she?  
Tell me, tell me who is she?  
  
You'd think she owns the streets of Dublin  
They say she's king of Torquay island  
She trades in piracy and sinning  
She knows where you go at night  
And when you think you've finally reached her  
She laughs and says, "Babe, it's all right."  
  
I know that woman in the mirror  
That creature has my thoughts as eyes  
He saw her once and then forgot her  
She remembers all his lies  
He spoke in secrets and in German  
Kissed in tongues and slept in sighs  
She says to me she's not my father  
So tell me, tell me who is she?  
Tell me, tell me who is she?  
  
You'd think she owns the streets of Dublin

Anna I  
  
Now we're coming back to you, in Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is a-shining ever.  
Seven years we've been away in the big towns  
Where you go to make money,  
And now our fortune's made,  
And now you're there,  
Little house in old Louisiana.  
We're coming back to you,  
To our little house beside the Mississippi in Louisiana  
Right, Anna ?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.

I know you're out there having a good time.  
Spaced out chicks, love potions and good wine.  
Don't make me laugh, you're not in there alone,  
There's other people's voices in the room.  
  
Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,  
No eye communication, always happens this way.  
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?  
No eye communication always happens that way.  
  
I know I shouldn't let it happen,  
There's no excuse, I felt so alone.  
You know how it is, our lure was meant to trap them,  
And then they find some poison of their own.  
  
Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,  
No eye communication, always happens this way.  
How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?  
No eye communication always happens

Did he take you out dancing, holding you tight,  
Did he show you steps one, two, and three ?  
Did he leave you at your doorway, whispering good-night ?  
I wish I'd been there to see how he did it,  
I wish I'd been there to see.  
  
When you went on vacation to Paris and Rome,  
Did he show you how sweet life can be ?  
Did he make his reservation, exercised his rights ?  
I wish I'd been there to see how he did it,  
I wish I'd been there to see.  
  
What became of the night on a six cylinder charger  
With money to burn and a castle for two ?  
Now poor Cinderella will always remember  
The fairy tale hero that almost came true.  
  
Did he tell you he'd love you as long as he'll live  
But however he'd never be free,  
'Cause he loves his wife and children waiting there at home.  
I wish I'd been there to see how he did it,  
I wish I'd been there to see.  
  
What became of the night on a six cylinder charger  
With money to burn and a castle for two ?  
Now poor Cinderella will always remember  
The fairy tale hero that almost came true.  
  
What became of the night on a six cylinder charger  
With money to burn and a castle for two ?  
Now poor Cinderella will always remember

[Chorus]  
Falling from grace, falling from grace.  
Lord, you have a pretty face.  
Take it away and pack it in a suitcase.  
Then forget about falling from grace.  
  
Don't look at me like that, I never said a word.  
Don't ask me where I've been, I'll pretend I never heard.  
Don't put it in the paper, please, don't!  
I never said I will, I never said I won't.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's looking bad, I know, I'm an outlaw.  
Don't pity me, I never felt like this before.  
Please tell me you believe me, please say  
I'll get along without you, anyway.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feeling hunted, I'm lying low.  
Don't tell me who it is, I never said so.  
Put yourself in my place, please try.  
I never told the truth, I never told a lie.  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
[Repeats]  
Falling from grace.  
Falling from grace, falling from grace.

I'm much too sentimental,  
My heart is never free.  
Perhaps it's accidental  
That love should come to me.  
  
Some little thing within me  
Protects me for a while  
Till someone comes to win me  
With only a smile.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Love's always been my game,  
Play it, how I may.  
I was made that way  
Can't help it.  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Sonst gar nichts.  
Ha!

The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
The sisters dancing  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to call me  
Think I'll stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Flaming September  
What can you give me that is true?  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave to you?  
  
The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
My youth lies bruised and broken  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to tell me  
I'll live on here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Flaming September  
What can you show me that is true?  
My heart remembers  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave  
To you?  
  
Flaming September  
Flaming September

It comes as no surprise  
Your face filled with lies  
Hovers all around me in this room  
Clouds hung with my dismay  
A hot bed where we lay  
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb  
If time becomes a judge  
If my body holds a grudge  
It's just because I needed sanctuary  
Your skin under my nails  
My curiosity that failed  
To save myself for something that I need  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  
We do things 'cause we must  
The law of love and lust  
Comes together just like oil on flame  
I looked into your eyes  
You saw me naked for a while  
How d'you like it in my little nest?  
Who was really using who?  
In here the scent of you  
Stains the sheets with memory and lust  
When I get back on the street  
Tell everybody that I meet  
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  

There's something happening here,  
What it is ain't exactly clear.  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware.  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Battle lines being drawn,  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.  
Some people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
What a field day for the heat,  
There's a thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly saying, "Hooray for our kind!"  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Paranoia strikes deep,  
Into your life it will creep.  
It starts when you're always afraid,  
Get out of line, the men come and take you away.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down.

What is it children that falls from the sky?  
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye ya.  
Mannah from Heaven from most high,  
Food from the Father, tayi, taye ya.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the grief.  
  
Peace to your brother, give and take heed,  
Tayi, taya, it left two feet.  
One foot extended, snake to the ground,  
Wave of the Earth, one turn around.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again,shake out the grief, babe.  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway,  
Fruit of thy bird, tayi, taya.  
Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.  
  
Here we are, Father, here, Holy Ghost,  
Bread of your bread, host of your host.  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,  
Word of your word, cry of your cry.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again.  
We shall live again, we shall live.  
  
What is it, Father, in your eye,  
What is this grave sign, eyes to cry.  
Blood of my baby, well, just what I need.  
What is it, hide me, way off to speed.  
  
Who is it, Father, holy that night?  
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?  
What is it, Father, isn't it pain?  
What is it, Father, that shapes from your main?  
  
What is it, Father, supposed to be brave?  
A lot of questions, the right to live  
What is it, baby, I can't do.  
Your mama loves you, I'm dying, too.  
  
I won't forget you, never lie  
I'll always love you till I die

Sunday is Gloomy,  
My hours are slumberless,  
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless  
Little white flowers will never awaken you  
  
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you  
Angels have no thought of ever returning you  
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Sunday is gloomy  
With shadows I spend it all  
My heart and I have decided to end it all  
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,  
I know, let them not weep,  
Let them know that I'm glad to go  
  
Death is no dream,  
For in death I'm caressing you  
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
I wake and I find you  
Asleep in the deep of  
My heart  
Dear  
  
Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you  
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you  
Gloomy Sunday

Family  
  
We've gotten word from Philadelphia  
Anna's doing well, she's making lots of money.  
Her contract has been signed to do a solo turn,  
It forbids her ever eating when or what she likes to eat,  
She likes to eat, she likes to eat.  
  
Those are hard terms for little Anna,  
Who has always been very greedy.  
Oh if she does not break her contract!  
There's no market for hippos in Philadelphia!  
  
Every single day they weigh her,  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
They have principles to stand by:  
It's a hundred-and-eighteen that were signed for -  
Only for the weight agreed we pay!  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
More than that would mean disaster!  
  
But our Anna is not all that stupid  
And she knows a contract is a contract  
So she'll reason: After all  
You still can eat like little Anna  
In Louisiana - Crabmeat! Porkchops!  
Sweet-corn! Chicken!  
And those golden biscuits spread with honey!  
  
Think of our house in Louisiana!  
Look - it's growing! More and more it needs you!  
Therefore curb your craving! Gluttons will be punished!  
Curb your craving, Anna! Gluttons never go to Heaven!

Go away from my world,  
Let me dream alone.  
And you see it never worked from the start,  
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me dream alone.  
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,  
And I'll pretend you're never there.  
Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly  
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me walk all alone.  
All alone in my room,  
All alone and so sad.  
I can dream of how I wanted us to be  
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.  
Go away from my world.  

(bert's blues)  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time.  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been singing in the evening,  
Flying through the night.  
But I hurt my good guy,  
I hope he makes out right,  
Flying through the night.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
Been drinking down the rain.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
It makes me wonder when  
I'll see him again.  
You know time could bring a change, man,  
It ain't for me to say.  
You'll soon be out of range, man,  
This could only be the way  
It's meant to be.  
Fairy castle stark and black in the moonlight,  
The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.  
Seagulls fly across my mind forever.  
Sadly goes the wind on it's way to hades.  
Would I, should I, could I be a stranger ?  
I shall walk right by and sigh good-bye.  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to blow my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been looking, you know I've been looking,  
You better believe I've been looking.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
I've been drinking down the rain.  
I've been thinking of the sunshine,  
I've been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
Blow my mind  
As well as my time,  
Blow my mind ...  

Great expectations I have to find  
I want to tell you what it was like  
My recollection is not too clear  
So much hope and so much fear  
  
Long conversations into the night  
Not like that, oh no, not so black and white  
The great temptation's to try and please you  
Play with you thought and mind, and tease you  
If I could tell my story in a song  
I'd have to make it fast, yes, it's very long  
Many shades of gray between the right and wrong  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on this way  
Feel the fire burn away  
  
So turn the lights down low, come over here  
Stay with me, don't go, you'll see my characters appear  
The storyteller's magic doesn't lie  
He'll make you laugh to make you cry  
Real for me is real for you  
What I say is almost true  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on its way  
Feel the fire burn and play  
  
The story's ended, now you're on your own  
Let's say a little prayer, go home

Green are your eyes  
In the morning when you rise.  
Don't you be afraid, my love,  
To lie by me,  
Your father will not know.  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Love, don't cry  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Yes love, don't you cry,  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love.  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day.  

Alas my love you do me wrong  
To cast me off discourteously  
For i have loved you so long  
Delighting in your company.  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy,  
Greensleeves was my delight.  
Greensleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady Greensleeves ?  
  
Alas my love that you should own  
A heart of wanton vanity  
So i must laddie think alone  
Upon your insincerity.  
  
Greensleeves

I have a love and it's all that I have  
Right or wrong, what else can I do ?  
I love him, I'm his,  
And every thing he is  
I am, too.  
  
I have a love and he's all that I need,  
Right or wrong, and he needs me, too.  
I love him, we're one.  
There's nothing to be done.  
Not a thing I can do  
  
But hold him,  
Hold him forever.  
Be with him now  
Tomorrow and all of my life.  
  
When love comes so strong  
There is no right or wrong.  
Your love is your own.

I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And what was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And what was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas day in the morning?  
  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady,  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day, on Christmas day,  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
On Christmas day in the morning.  
  
La da la la la la la la...

If I never get to love you  
It won't be that I didn't try  
I'll be trying to possess you  
'Till the day I die  
  
If I never get to love you  
It won't be that I ran away  
For as long as you will have me  
Close to you, I'll stay  
  
What I wouldn't give to hold you tight  
Never, never let you out of sight  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
  
If I never get to love you  
It won't be that I didn't care  
There is nothing that I want more  
Or I need more  
  
And my heart would surely break in two  
If I never get to love you  
What I wouldn't give to hold you tight  
Never, never let you out of sight  
  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
If I never get to love you  
It won't be that I didn't care  
  
There is nothing that I want more  
Or I need more  
And my heart could surely break in two  
If I never get to love you

Close your eyes, close the door  
You don't have to worry anymore  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Shut the light, shut the shade  
You don't have to be afraid  
I'll be your baby tonight  
That mockingbird's going to sing away  
We're gonna forget it  
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight  
That mockingbird's going to sing away  
We're gonna forget it  
That big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight  

Of all the love I have won or have lost  
There is one love I should never have crossed.  
He was a boy in a million, my friend,  
I should have known he would win in the end.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a loser  
And I lost someone who's near to me.  
I'm a loser  
And I'm not what I appear to be.  
  
Although I laugh and I act like a clown,  
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.  
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,  
Is it for him or myself that I cry ?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What have I done to deserve such a fate ?  
I realize I have left it too late  
And so it's true pride comes before a fall,  
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a loser.

Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine  
There's somethin' special on my mind  
Last night I met a new guy in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah,  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
He's the kind of guy who's not too shy  
And I can tell he's my kind of guy.  
He danced close to me like I hoped he would, whoa yeah,  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
We only danced for a minute or two,  
He stuck to me the whole night through.  
Last night we fell in love,  
He's everything I'm dreamin' of.  
  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
We only danced for a minute or two,  
He stuck to me the whole night through.  
Last night we fell in love,  
He's everything I'm dreamin' of...  
  
He walked me home and I held his hand  
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand  
So I asked to see him again and he said I could.  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.  
  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good,  
Something good, whoa yeah, something good  
Something good, whoa yeah, something good

I'm not Lisa,  
My name is Julie.  
Lisa left you  
Years ago.  
  
My eyes are not blue,  
But mine won't leave you  
Till the sunlight  
Has touched your face.  
  
She was your morning light,  
Her smile told of no night.  
Your love for her grew  
With each rising sun.  
  
And then one winter day  
His hand laid her away,  
She left you here  
Drowning in your tears,  
Here, where you've stayed for years,  
Crying,

I'm on fire  
When I was young  
Just for you  
And my heart was pure  
Such desire  
I only wanted love  
Just for you  
I had allure  
Still on fire  
High heels ideals  
Just for you  
And not much fear  
My desire  
It's easy  
Still for you  
To make love appear.  
  
And then something sent me  
For what they had meant to do  
Whatever happened to you?  
  
I'm on fire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
  
And love did come  
But in such disguise -  
That I could  
Hardly recognise!  
  
I'm on fire  
So with trust in fate  
Just for you.  
And love of life  
Such desire  
Take my chance  
Just for you.  
Roll the dice.  
  
And whatever sent me  
I'll still be here for you.  
Whatever happens, it's true.  
  
And I'm standing still  
Try to show the way  
Try to change the stage.  
  
I only had to find the key  
Surely love would come to me  
You'd look into my glittering eyes  
And everything will be all right.  
  
And so time passed.  
I began to change.  
I found that I  
Could love again.  
  
I'm on fire  
At first it feels  
Just for you.  
A little strange -  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire

(hampstead incident)  
Standing by the everyman, digging the rigging on my sail  
Rain to the sound of harpsichords, to the spell of fairy tale.  
The heath was hung in magic mist, enchanted dripping glades,  
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades  
In the night time.  
Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.  
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know.  
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go  
In the night time.  
Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.  
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know  
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go  
In the night time.  
In the night time.  
In the night time.  
In the night time ...  

Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?  
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?  
Laying on the living-room floor on those indian tapestry cushions you made  
Thinking of calling our first born jasmine or jade.  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,  
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think
about what it might be,  
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,  
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.  
You wouldn't listen, you thought you knew better, you just to had to speak to
that man.  
Please believe me, I'll visit whenever I can.  
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a
day,  
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,  
"please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone."  
  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,  
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think
about what it might be,  
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,  
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.  
Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?  
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?  
Now in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a day  
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,  
"please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone."  

There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best.  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I heard the wind  
Calling from over the sea  
Saying, "Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
  
This land I go to when I'm tired  
And need to see and walk in green.  
The people who can laugh and drink  
And see things others have not seen.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is another side to this pure land,  
A side of blood and guilt and pain  
A side of enemy and friend  
And sorrow at the hearth side stain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"  
"Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?"

There's been a lot of talk around  
That you've been seen with a certain party  
And now I'm so afraid I'm losing you  
Oh, baby don't tell me you don't want my love  
I couldn't give it to just anybody  
Baby won't you say it isn't true  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me  
  
What will there be left for me  
It's such a cruel world to be alone in  
I always needed you to look out for me  
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss your lovin' arms  
They're the only arms I feel at home in  
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me

Don't they know we're so afraid,  
Isolation.  
We're afraid to be alone  
Everbody's got to have a home  
Isolation.  
  
Just a boy and a little girl  
Trying to change the whole wide world,  
Isolation.  
The world is just a little town  
Everybody trying to put us down,  
Isolation.  
  
I don't expect you to understand  
After you caused so much pain  
But then again you're not to blame  
You're just a human, a victim of the insane.  
  
We're afraid of everyone  
Afraid of the sun,  
Isolation.  
The sun will never disappear  
But the world may not have many years,  
Isolation

As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
That old song about the wild, wild side of life.  
As I listen to the words you are saying,  
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you say in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,  
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.  
From the start most every heart that's been broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  

I was on the first ship to Peru,  
Charted all the courses like all sailors do,  
First to cross the Mason-Dixon line,  
Overseein' wetbacks for good California wine.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
I was there when Jan and Liford sang,  
First to feel the cold Alaskan white man,  
First to take a trip on lsd,  
First to vote for Roosevelt back in '33.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
Yes I've seen it, yes I've seen it,  
And deep inside you're brave,  
You know I mean it, yes I mean it.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
The frumious Bandersnatch! "  
He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
Long time the manxome foe he sought -  
He rested 'neath the Tumtum tree,  
And stood awhile in thought.  
And while in uffish thought he stood,  
The Jabberwock, with eyes aflame  
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,  
And burbled as it came!  
One, two! One, two! And through and through  
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  
He left it dead, and with it's head  
He went galumphing back.  
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?  
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!  
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! "  
He chortled in his joy.  
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe.

Lost his own, taken down  
All his songs  
Till his all alone  
And all our love was harmed  
'cept for you  
I'm only young, favorite son  
Say you tried, take it back  
To where you belong  
And all the things you say  
  
Still untrue  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
Do what you want to do!  
I was digging up, sorting out,  
Only to built a song alone  
Till you came along  
But all my love was there  
Just all for you  
And in the darkest time  
We crossed the line  
Made a song  
Cause all the talk was wrong  
And all you ever won  
  
Can still be true  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely stone  
Now all my love is out  
It's just for you  
It's not a love song  
It's the last song for you

How come you don't realise the shape you're in  
Sweatin' over lies to justify the naked sin within  
A spineless irritation from some time before  
When more than life was cursin' through my veins.  
  
You made me and you slayed me and you tortured me  
Laughing as you lay upon our bed of bloody love - and left me.  
Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
Across the street they're eating now and holding hands,  
An image of a priest with bibles lain across his hands for me.  
Don't think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
In the house, my mother's house, the clocks have all stood still,  
An empty picture frame upon a dirty window sill.  
In the yard, my father's yard, a tombstone breaks in two,  
Shattered by a lying snake like you.

My father promised me roses  
My mother promised me thorns  
My father taught me to use my mind  
My mother taught me scorn  
He touches me lightly with his hand  
It feels like being born [Repeat: x3]  
  
My father promised me green trees  
My mother promised me stars  
I hardly seen the love I have  
It all goes by so fast  
He kisses me gently with his lips  
It's near what once was far [Repeat: x3]  
  
My father promised me roses  
My mother promised me thorns  
My father taught me to use my mind  
My mother taught me scorn  
He touches me lightly with his hand  
It feels like being born [Repeat: x3]

I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Well, I've travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
Travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the beggar,  
Well, I've travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the  
Beggar,  
Travelled with the rich, I've travelled with the beggar,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
One of these days I'm gonna stop all my travelling,  
I'm travelling on.  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  

Ten years ago on a cold dark night,  
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light.  
There were few at the scene but they all did agree  
That the man who ran looked a lot like me.  
  
[Chorus]  
She walks these hills in a long black veil.  
She visits my grave where the night winds wail.  
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees,  
Nobody knows but me.  
  
The judge said, "Son what is your alibi ?  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die."  
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,  
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The scaffold is high and eternity nears  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear.  
But sometimes at night where the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries all o'er my bones.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody knows but me.

You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
But you've been losing  
  
You know there's clearer ways of thinking  
And there's quicker ways of dying  
But I'm a sucker for your drinking  
And now, I'm losing  
  
I don't know who you think you're cheating  
Or with whom you have been sleeping  
But all the shit that you've been eating  
Says you're losing  
  
When I let my hate pervert me  
And there's no more tears for crying  
I'll just kill you if you hurt me  
I'll kill you  
  
You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
Fighting hard and losing  
  
Fighting hard, and losing  
Fighting hard, fighting hard, losing

Is it a crisis ?  
Is it a crime ?  
Or is it a fantasy ?  
Does it take time ?  
Will it cost money ?  
Will it mean love ?  
Sure isn't easy  
To get in the mood  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
See you at the parties  
You're never the same  
Do you make money ?  
What is your name ?  
Where can I find you ?  
Out in the night  
Who are your friends ?  
Are they dark or light ?  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
Tell me the dreams you never told anyone  
Gimme a break.  
Are you really a virgin who's never loved anyone else ?  
Or just a fake ?  
Me I don't know what to think anymore  
Don't know where to start  
To sit here with you and talk about nothing  
Is breaking my heart.  
  
Ask me a question ?  
Gimme a smoke  
What are you drinking ?  
Is it a joke  
Well ain't it worth it ?  
Or am I depraved ?  
You hold your head high  
With one foot in the grave.  
  
Aha  
Aha.  
Aha  
Aha.  

It's getting dark outside  
Daytime is done.  
The lights along the river come up  
One by one.  
Let's make love again  
We got time.  
I am yours  
You are mine.  
It's getting dark outside  
I have to go.  
Don't want my husband  
Or my friends to know.  
Zip up my dress  
  
I can't find my shoes.  
Don't fall in love with me  
Too much to lose.  
The kids are home by now  
Have to think fast.  
I really think this afternoon  
Must be the last.  
Don't say anything,  
Don't turn on the light.  
Thanks for loving me,  
Call you tonight.

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
I wish I were a maid again.  
But a maid again I can never be  
Until apples grow on an ivy tree.  
For love it is pleasin' and love is teasin'  
And love is a treasure when first it's new.  
But as love grows older, then love grows colder  
And it fades away like the morning dew.  
There is a little house into town  
And there my love, he sits him down.  
He takes a strange girl on his knee  
And he tells her things that he wants to be.  
For love and water make younger older  
And love and whiskey make her old and grey.  
And what cannot be cured, love, must be endured, love,  
And now I am bound for America.  
La la la la la la ...  
La la la la la la ...  
As life grows older sure love grows older  
And it fades away like the morning dew.

I met him at a party just a couple of years ago,  
He was rather over-hearty and ridiculous  
But as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.  
I'd basked in his attraction  
For a couple of hours or so.  
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,  
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,  
But like a silly fool I fell  
  
Mad about the boy,  
I know it's stupid  
To be mad about the boy.  
I'm so ashamed of it  
But must admit  
The sleepless nights  
I've had about the boy.  
  
On the silver screen  
He melts my foolish heart  
In every single scene.  
Although I'm quite aware  
That here and there  
Are traces of that cared about the boy.  
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,  
I really shouldn't care.  
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl  
In the flurry of her first affair.  
Will it ever cloy  
This odd diversity of misery and joy  
I'm feeling quite insane  
And young again  
And all because  
I'm mad about the boy.  
  
It seems a little silly  
For a girl of my age and weight  
To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.  
It ought to take her a good deal more  
To take a bad girl down.  
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate  
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love  
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown  
To weep about a painted clown.  
  
Mad about the boy,  
It's pretty funny  
But I'm mad about the boy.  
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel  
There's maybe something sad about the boy.  
  
Walking down the street  
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.  
I can't believe it's true,  
But when I'm blue, in some strange way  
I'm glad about the boy.  
  
I'm hardly sentimental,  
Love isn't so sublime.  
I have to pay my rental  
And I can't afford to waste much time.  
If I could employ a little magic  
That would finally destroy  
This dream that pains me and it shames me  
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy.

Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be.  
Oh Monday morning,  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me.  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine, yeah.  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time.  
  
Monday, Monday,  
Can't trust the day.  
Monday, Monday,  
Don't go away.  
  
Oh, Monday, Monday,  
Don't go away.  
Oh, Monday, Monday

When will the morning come?  
I wait in darkness so long.  
Will the sun ever rise again?  
  
Hours flowing over me  
I wait in vain for some change.  
Will light ever pierce this pain?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
How will the morning be?  
I watched the dawn in my dreams  
And imagined the day for years.  
Shall I feel warmth again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
Tell me please,  
  
How will it come  
This release,  
A crack in the door.  
  
Shall I feel warm again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Oh, tell me please, how will she come  
Surrounding me, the opening door?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east...

I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill,  
Sorrow and pain for me  
Coming over the hill.  
I'm very sad Lost love for me  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who breaks every heart that he can.  
I know him well  
For I have been hurt by this man.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who promises that he'll be true  
And I look back once again,  
Well, what else could I do ?  
I'm very sad  
But he is true  
And we will love again.  
I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill.  
I see him and he says  
That he'll stay  
And he will.  
I'm sad no more,  
He comforts me  
And we will love again.  

Mud Slime Slim and the blue horizon,  
Oh, Mud Slime and depending on you.  
I don't know but I've been told  
There's a time from time to time  
I can't eat, I can't sleep  
But I just like to move my feet  
'Cause there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music  
To change your lady's mind  
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind.  
Mud Slime, I'm depending on you,  
Mr. Mud Slime Slim on the blue horizon.  
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,  
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.  
I wanted cash in my hand  
Pick upon a piece of land  
Build myself a cabin back in the woods.  
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts changing for the good.  
Now the reason I'm smiling  
Is over on an island  
On a hillside in the woods where I belong.  
I wanna thank Jimmy Jimmy John and Mick and Robbie  
Of Nojets Construction to send me down homestead on a farm.  
Oh, Mud Slime, I'm depending on you.  
Mr. Mud Slim on the blue horizon.  
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,  
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.

You are my child and how you've grown  
But there are things that you must learn  
That every man must stand alone  
And family you must disown  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
  
Don't cry my child, you must know  
That every man I've ever loved  
Has been a child and fatherless  
Trust in yourself, it's all that you can trust  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
  
Go home, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way  
Go try, find your own way  
Go on, find your own way

Hey child, you're no child of mine

A North country maid up to London has strayed  
Although with her nature it did not agree.  
So she wept and she sighed and bitterly she cried,  
"Oh, I wish once again in the North I could be."  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country.  
While sadly I roam I regret my dear home,  
Where the lads and young lasses are making the hay.  
Where the birds sweetly sing, and the merry bells do ring  
And the maidens and meadows are pleasant and gay.  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country.  
No doubt if I please, I could marry with ease,  
Where maidens are fair, many lovers will come.  
But he that I wed must be North country bred  
And carry me back to my own country.  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow so green in the North country.  

"oh, look around you,  
Tell me what do you see ?  
Do you see the yellow morning  
And the green land so free ? "  
"oh no, I see no morning  
But lands of dark and grey  
And they tell me the green land  
Has long gone away,  
Has long gone away."  
"once more look around you,  
Tell me what do you see ?  
Do you see the clear wave laughter  
And the deep blue sea ? "  
"oh no, there is no sorrow  
Where the laughing tree stood  
And they tell me the blue sea  
Has long turned to blood,  
Has long turned to blood."  
"no more look around you,  
Say no more what you see.  
But give me your cold hand  
And lay beside me.  
And there, oh my darling,  
You will never worry  
And we, like the others,  
Will forget in our sleep,  
Will forget in our sleep."  

Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none.  
He's gone and leave me, he's gone and leave me  
He's gone and leave me to sorrow and mourn.  
Last night in deep slumber I dreamed I did see  
Last night in deep slumber I dreamed I did see  
My own true love came smiling to me  
My own true love came smiling to me.  
And when I awakened I found it not so  
And when I awakened I found it not so.  
My heart like some fountain with tears overflow  
My heart like some fountain with tears overflow.  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none  
Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none.  
He's gone and leave me, he's gone and leave me  
He's gone and leave me to sorrow and mourn.  

Our love is gone and you're left alone  
What can you do when love's lost sight of you?  
  
Ooh, la, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la, la  
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play  
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay  
I'm crying ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
  
Sorry, let me come home and love you  
Though it's hard, though it's hard to do  
What can I do?  
  
Mistakes, I know I've made a few  
But I'm only human, you've made mistakes too  
I'm crying ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby I love you  
Ooh baby, baby, baby, baby I need you  
Ooh baby, baby, baby tell me what do I do?  
Ooh baby, baby, baby let me make it up to you  
  
Baby, baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Baby, baby I can't hold on much longer  
Baby, baby the heart keeps getting stronger  
Stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
  
Ooh stronger, my heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
Ooh stronger, the heart keeps getting stronger  
Ooh stronger, I can't hold on much longer  
  
I'm just about at the end of my rope  
But I can't stop trying, I can't give up hope  
'Cause I feel I'll be here, someday I'll hold you near  
Whisper I still love you until that day is here, until that day is  
  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby  
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, ooh

Past the cafe shutters down,  
No one stirs in the town.  
  
The morning after the rain  
The barges move on the Seine.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
Dawn is breaking, birds start to sing,  
Sun is rising, warms everything.  
  
The echo of footsteps on a cobbled street,  
Dim alleyways where the shadows meet.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
The places where we used to visit,  
The chapel where we went to wed.  
  
Paris bells on the breeze  
Often stir memories.  
  
We both knew the morning rain  
We both wandered down the Seine.  
  
Now you're gone away from me  
You're just a memory  
Like the bells ring on the breeze,  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.

Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky  
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by  
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I  
When we're alone  
  
From all of society, we'll stay aloof  
And live in propriety there on the roof  
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth  
When we're alone  
  
We'll see life's mad pattern  
As we view old Manhattan  
Then we can thank our lucky stars  
That we're living as we are  
  
In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive  
To keep love and romance forever alive  
In view of the Hudson just over the drive  
When we're alone  
  
We can thank our lucky stars  
That we're living as we are  
  
In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive  
To keep love and romance forever alive  
In view of the Hudson just over the drive  
When we're alone

You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors  
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking  
Maybe once you tip me and it makes you feel swell  
In this crummy southern town in this crummy old hotel  
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.  
No, you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you wonder who could that have been?  
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'  
And you say, "What's she got to grin?" I'll tell you  
There's a ship, The Black Freighter  
With a skull on its masthead will be coming in  
You gentlemen can say, "Hey gal, finish them floors!  
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you? Earn your keep here!?  
You toss me your tips and look out to the ships  
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds  
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight  
Nobody is going to sleep here honey  
Nobody, nobody!  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you say, "Who's that kicking up a row?"  
And you see me kinda starin' out the window  
And you say, "What's she got to stare at now?"  
I'll tell you  
There's a ship, The Black Freighter turns around in the harbor  
Shootin' guns from her bow  
Now, you gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face  
'Cause every building in town is a flat one  
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground  
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound  
And you yell, "Why do they spare that one?"  
Yes, that's what you say, "Why do they spare that one?"  
All the night through, through the noise and to do  
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?  
And you see me stepping out in the morning  
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair  
And the ship, The Black Freighter runs a flag up its masthead  
And a cheer rings the air  
By noontime the dock is a swarmin' with men  
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter  
They're movin' in the shadows where no one can see  
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' 'em to me  
Askin' me, "Kill them now, or later?"  
Askin' me, "Kill them now, or later?"  
Noon by the clock and so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death, I'll say, "Right now, right now!"  
Then they'll pile up the bodies  
And I'll say, "That'll learn ya!"  
And the ship, The Black Freighter disappears out to sea  
And on it is me  

Plaisir d'amour  
Ne dure qu'un moment  
Chagrin d'amour  
Dure toute la vie  
  
Your eyes kissed mine  
I saw the love in them shine  
But you gave me heaven right then  
When your eyes kissed mine  
  
Plaisir d'amour  
Ne dure qu'un moment  
Chagrin d'amour  
Dure toute la vie  
  
My love loves me  
And all the wonders I see  
But the rainbow  
Shines in my window  
My love loves me  
  
Plaisir d'amour  
Ne dure qu'un moment  
Chagrin d'amour  
Dure toute la vie

Yes I was, yes I was, yes I was.  
I got married in Portland town

Yes I did, yes I did, yes I did.  
I had children, one, two, three

Yes I was, yes I was, yes I was.  

If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that its all true  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone like you makes it hard to live  
Without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give  
Never thinking of myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried  
Still I look to find reason to believe

Havin' bad times, now I'm paying dues,  
Got shoes and money, good friends, too.  
I always play to win, and always seem to lose,  
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues.  
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues.  
  
And I know what's going on,  
And I know that the way is too long.  
And I know just exactly what's on your mind,  
You'll be back and I'll lose you forever.  
  
But I'm wondering why, girl, should I ask your name  
All the people standing by, are they in my game ?  
Love is just a story, a story without words,  
Words are even never seen and never even heard.  
  
And I know what's going on,  
And I know that the way is too long.  
And I know just exactly what's on your mind,  
You'll be back and I'll lose you forever.  
  
Havin' bad times, now I'm paying dues

Move along staying close to the wall  
Looking over your shoulder just in time.  
Avoid the light, close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine.  
And put your hand in mine.  
  
Are we in danger, or is it that  
You think we might be ?  
But I think I'd like to get out of here,  
This place it frightens me,  
This place it frightens me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Running for our lives,  
At least we're pretending we are.  
Running for our lives,  
We never get very far. [Repeat: x3]  
  
Stop pretending  
This is a child's adventure,  
The only way I can take it  
Is playing the game.  
  
Be quiet, there's a gate ahead.  
Do you think we can make it ?  
Will it be different, or just the same ?  
How long can we keep escaping [Repeat: x3]  
Into another prison ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Move along staying close to the wall,  
Looking over your shoulder just in time.  
Avoid the light, close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine  
And put your hand in mine.

We never get very far. [Repeat: x3]  
We never get

She hangs her head and cries on my shirt  
She must be hurt very badly.  
Tell me what's making you sad, Li ?  
Open your door, don't hide in the dark.  
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me,  
'Cause you know that's how it must be.  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
Her eyes like windows trickle in rain  
Upon the pain getting deeper  
Though my love wants to relieve her.  
She walks alone from wall to wall,  
Lost in her hall she can't hear me,  
Though I know she likes to be near me.  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  
  
She sits in her corner by the door.  
There must be more I can tell her  
If she really wants me to help her.  
I'll do what I can to show her the way  
And maybe one day I will free her  
Though I know no-one can see her.  
Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Took a sailor's loving  
For a nursery game.  
  
Well, the heart she gave me  
Wasn't made of stone.  
No, the heart she gave me  
Wasn't made of stone.  
It was sweet and hollow  
Like a honeycomb.  
  
Think I'll wait till sunset,  
See the ensign down.  
Think I'll wait till sunset,  
See the ensign down.  
Then I'll take the tideway  
To my burial ground.  
  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
Sally, free and easy,  
That should be her name.  
When my body's landed.  
Hope she dies of shame.

You saw the wise man salomon,  
You know what 'came of him.  
To him the world seemed clear as day,  
He cursed the sad hour that he saw the sign,  
He knew that everything was dust.  
How great and wise was salomon!  
Watch out the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay  
Such wisdom's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise such clarity.  
You saw divine cleopatra,  
You know what 'came of her.  
Two emperors died to serve her lust,  
She whored herself to death, yes she did,  
And withered into lovely dust.  
How beautiful great babylon.  
Watch out, the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay,  
Such beauty's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise such luxury.  
Behold the man, the bold macheath,  
The end's in sight, I fear.  
If he had kept his pretty head  
And just robbed the rich, but oh no, instead  
All's come to nought and turned to dust.  
How sad the heart when it has won.  
Watch out the world is spinning fast,  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay.  
Such whoring's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise sweet chastity.  
I'd like to introduce my friend, my musical director and accompanist, mr. paul
trueblood. please, come on!  

Have you been to Scarborough fair  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
Remember me to one that lives there  
For once she once was a true lover of mine.  
  
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
One with no seams, of fine needlework  
And then she'll be a true lover of mine.  
  
Tell her to dry it 'pon yonder thorn  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
That never bore fruit since Adam was born  
And then she'll be a true lover of mine.  
  
Ah, can you find me an acre of land  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
Between the salt sea and the sea sand  
Or never be a true lover of mine.  
  
And can you plough it with a sheep's horn  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
And sow it all over with one peppercorn  
Or never be a true lover of mine.  
  
And when you have done and finished your work  
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.  
Then come to me for your cambric shirt  
And then you'll be a true lover of mine.

(Marianne Faithfull, Joe Maverty)  
  
Free souls don't live in suburbia (suburbia)  
I was stranded, stranded, I must have been blind  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
We were victims of the present time  
Juvenile delinquents, fallen angels  
Played the part without relief  
Broken hearts like leaves on the street  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
Take what we wanted, don't seem much  
Time for time to sit and watch  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
Free souls don't live in suburbia (suburbia)  
I was stranded, stranded, I must have been blind  
  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment...

What does a woman need from a man ?  
Notches on her belt ?  
But any way to understand  
What isn't known but only felt  
  
Well it's a strange world we're living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well it's a strange world, not giving in  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Why take it lying down ?  
Who told you life was fair ?  
Just leave yourself in the lost and found  
It doesn't matter where  
  
But it's a strange world and it's alright  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well it's a strange world but not tonight  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Who do you pretend to be doing it for  
Doing it for ?  
  
What does a woman need from a man ?  
Notches on her belt ?  
But any way to understand  
What isn't known but only felt  
  
Well it's a strange world we're living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
No change there, not giving in  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
Who are we doing it for ?  
  
Oh sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Oh sexual terrorist

She lives alone with no one  
Who can see she's unhappy.  
She knows what she lost,  
Still she is waiting for more.  
  
She could be living in hell  
And not know someone loves her.  
What can she do,  
What is she waiting for?  
  
The day turns to night  
He just can't find the right words to tell her  
Twisting and turning and looking for  
Something to say.  
  
If you would let me hold you  
I wouldn't walk away  
That's what he wants,  
That's what he wants to say.  
  
What can she lose,  
What is she waiting for?  
  
He knows when she cries  
And he saw through the lies that she told him.  
She's dreaming and planning  
Of how she could ask him to stay.  
  
If you would let me love you,  
I wouldn't be the same.  
Please can we try,  
Please can we try again?

My young love said to me, "My brothers won't mind  
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind"  
Then she turned her head to me and this she did say  
"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day"  
  
She turned away from me and she moved through the fair  
And I watched her so swiftly move here and move there  
Then she turned away homeward with one star awake  
Like a swan in the evening moves over the lake  
  
Last night, I did dream that my dead love come in  
So softly she entered that her feet made no din  
And she turned her head to me and this she did say  
"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day"

In the end will it matter that you've gone?  
In the end will I go on minding that you've gone?  
Will the night always seem so long?  
Is it really darkest before dawn?  
Will I see whiskey as a Mother in the end?  
In the end will I smash my brains with drinking?  
Till I fall down on the floor  
Will I hiccup and jabber  
Saying things I never meant?  
Will I kiss and cry and wake to find  
A sordid stranger by my bed?  
Will the world shake its sensible head  
And say the words that have to be said?  
She's got a problem  
Every problem has solution in the end  
And solutions must be final  
For help gets so unhelpful near the end  
When I take my last ride  
Down the big dipper slide  
Will I care, will it matter  
If the world should say?  
She had a problem  
She had a problem  
She had a problem  
In the end will it matter that you've gone?  
In the end will I go on minding that you've gone?  
Will the night always seem so long?  
Is it really darkest before dawn?  
Will I see whiskey as a Mother in the end?

The warden who led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom  
I stood up to say, goodbye like all the rest  
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell  
Let my guitar playing friend do my request  
  
Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear  
Make my old memories come alive  
Oh please, take me away and turn back the years  
Sing me back home before I die  
  
I remember Sunday morning, a choir from off the streets  
They came in to sing a few old gospel songs  
And I heard him tell the singers, there's a song my mama sang  
Won't you sing it once before I move along?  
  
Oh, won't you sing me back home? There's a songs I used to hear  
Make my old memories come alive  
Please, take me away and turn back the years  
Sing me back home before I die  
  
Oh, won't you sing me back home before I die?

It is safe to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
And to seek life under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is best to find in sleep  
The missing pieces that you lost  
Best that you refuse to weep  
Ash to ash, dust to dust.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
Strange to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is safe to walk with me  
Where you can read the sky and stars,  
Safe to walk upon the sea  
In my sleep we can go far.  
  
It is safe to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
And to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one goes,  
Strange to seek life under stones.  
In my sleep no one knows.

The family tree was chainsawed Wednesday week  
So now I have to mingle with the meek  
Hey mister, you have finally met your match  
Now everybody wants to kiss my snatch  
  
To go where God knows who has gone before  
I am a muse, not a mistress, not a whore  
Oh, suburban shits who want some class  
All queue up to kiss my ass  
  
And I was only trying to please  
I never got any royalties oh no, not me  
I'm still sliding through life on charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
If Marianne was born a man she'd show you all  
A way to piss your life against the wall  
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs  
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?  
  
Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?  
I had to know how far was going too far  
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand  
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me  
  
Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?  
She's just captivated by my charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
Sliding  
Sliding  
Never  
  
I wonder why the schools don't teach anything useful nowadays  
Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal  
I never asked to be on in the first place  
  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm

Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm.  
Treading the waves,  
Come in from harm.  
How could you regret your other words  
Hoping for thrills oh free as a bird  
  
Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
There's a knock at the door,  
I get up oh let you in.  
Travelled and stained,  
Soaked to the skin.  
Welcome my darling, you got here at last  
Come and sit by the fire oh forget what's past.  
  
So sad, so sad,  
So sad, so sad.  
  
Strum me hard, strum me fast,  
Fears sure built into every wall.  
Looking hard through the glass,  
Fears sure built in with every waltz.  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm.  
Looking back, looking forward,  
Flying up, flying down oh  
What have you found?  
  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad  
What have you found?  
So sad, so sad

It's been a long time since you went away  
I stop to think of you most every day  
With all my heart I'm hoping you're okay  
Guess who loves you? Somebody loves you  
I couldn't reach you by the US mail  
You didn't leave a very easy trail  
I tried to telephone to no one bail  
Guess who loves you ? Somebody loves you, I do  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you  
Mind over matter is the game I play  
I'll never each you any other way  
So I send this one thought to you every day  
Guess who loves you? Somebody loves you, I do  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you, I do

Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na, oh, oh  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Someone loves you, somebody loves you  

Where I walk  
And life is warm  
Sun and breath  
Hopefully here  
All our hearts are blessed.  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried,  
Here I tried  
To be the best.  
So hot it's white and real to me  
I'd stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.  
Texas real  
A woman sworn to man  
Here I tried,  
Here I tried  
To be the best.  
So hot it's fine and real, real me  
I'd stay awake all night  
Asking your silent sympathy.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly and you.  
I know something new,  
Southern butterfly with you.  

On the firefly platform of sunny goodge street  
A violent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machine  
Involved in an eating scene  
Smashing into neon streets in their stillness  
Smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess  
Listening to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
In dull house rooms with coloured lights swinging  
Strange music boxes sadly tinkling  
Drink in the sun shining all around you.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
The magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet,  
You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.  
I tell you his name is love, love, love.  
"my, my", they sigh.  
"my, my", so high.  
"my, my" they sigh.  
Hmm, hmm.  
Hmm, hmm.  
Hmm, hmm.  

I had just turned sixteen that season  
When you came up from Burma to stay.  
And you told me I ought to travel with you,  
You were sure it would be OK.  
When I asked how you earned your living,  
I can still hear what you said to me:  
You had some kind of job on the railway  
And had nothing to do with the sea.  
  
You said a lot, Johnny,  
All one big lie, Johnny.  
You cheated me blind, Johnny,  
From the minute we met.  
I hate you so, Johnny,  
When you stand there grinning, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny,  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
My God and I still love you so.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny,  
And I still love you so.  
  
At the start, every day was Sunday,  
Till we went on our way one fine night.  
And before two more weeks were over,  
You thought nothing I did was right.  
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab,  
From the source of the river to the sea.  
When I look at my face in the mirror,  
There's an old woman staring back at me.  
  
You didn't want love, Johnny,  
You wanted cash, Johnny.  
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,  
And that was that.  
You wanted it all, Johnny,  
I gave you more, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny.  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny.  
My God and I still love you so.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny.  
And I still love you so.  
  
I would never have thought of asking  
How you'd got that peculiar name,  
But from one end of the coast to the other  
You were known everywhere we came.  
And one day I

Sweetheart,  
I'm changing my role in life.  
I'm not rearranging the main things in my life.  
I ain't sacrificing what I hold as true.  
I ain't sacrificing, sweetheart, even for you.  
  
Sweetheart, I'm changing my mode of life.  
I'm not rearranging the main things in my life.  
I'm not giving up, now, in mixed company.  
I'll be holding on, now, looking to find my identity.  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now.  
It doesn't matter to you anyhow.  
  
Sweetheart.  
Sweetheart.  
  
My freedom means too much to give up now,  
And did it matter so much anyhow.  
  
Sweetheart,

And did it matter so much anyhow.

I've noticed how few emotions stand the test of time.  
Feelings come, feelings go, and the days are fine.  
  
Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness [Repeats]  
  
It's funny how romance fails us, giving way to love.  
You look around, feel your freedom you're a slave to love.  
  
Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness spirit moves me  
Tenderness try to show me  
Tenderness come on show me  
Tenderness feelings grow and change.  
  
I've noticed how few emotions stand the test of time.

Night is dark, night is cold,  
Passion lies down to die.  
Tenderness really moves me  
Tenderness try to show me  
Tenderness come on show me  
Tenderness feelings grow and change.  
  
Don't think that because I don't know what's happening  
That I ain't achin'  
I never thought you would be showin'  
Just what you been takin'.  
It's not as simple as that  
Don't think I don't know just when my heart's breakin'?  
  
I ain't chosen I ain't chosen  
I ain't chosen chosen chosen chosen chosen.

Going home in a trailer filled with canada dry,  
Looking forward to being with you.  
Got in to the broadway and what do I find ?  
Some lady's been sleeping there, too.  
I was dreamin' of our meetin' all down the m1  
'cause I hadn't seen you for so long.  
Then out of the blue, something came down and warned me  
And I sat there and wrote down this song.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day all my dreams turned to ashes  
And I lost my blues and I smiled.  
Well, I walked in the door and I heard you two laughing,  
Just like I'd hoped that we'd do.  
So I went up the stairs, left your keys on the table,  
And I wrote on the mirror, 'we're through!'.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day that I had, honey.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
And I've got the blues out just bad.  
Going home on a train, going back to my mother,  
Feeling better already, keep telling myself:  
'don't you cry, you'll forget him and find a new lover,  
So let's sit back and drink to his health.'  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day that I felt my heart breaking,  
Ain't it funny, after all I've survived.  
Ain't it funny, after all I've survived.  

That's right baby,  
It seems to me you've won.  
Slip tight, baby,  
You had a lot of fun.  
  
You tried to make a fool of me  
And I'm the fool who just couldn't see.  
  
That's right baby,  
Laugh until you cry.  
Good night baby,  
But may I ask you why?  
  
I gave you everything I had  
Babe, that couldn't be so bad?  
  
I wonder why there's no tear in your eye.  
I wonder why there's love left for me.  
  
That's right baby  
Get it while you can.  
Look right baby  
You'll see with another man.  
  
While you're waiting all alone  
You'll try to call but I won't be home.
