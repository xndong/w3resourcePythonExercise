There's a road that I remember leading to a special place  
Where the door was always open to a smiling face  
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me  
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name  
  
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window  
  
Maybe it's just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring  
Almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve  
  
And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night  
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart  
  
Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go  
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know  
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are  
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

I've seen him plow a field of corn all day  
That's reality  
His overalls are black with dirt  
But his face is still full of dignity  
He talks about the waether  
And he can tell you when it's gonna rain  
Told me 'bout the flood of Twenty-Nine  
That washed the crops away  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
Grandpa told me 'bout the things he'd seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpa's memories  
  
At times he mentions Grandma  
Turn his head and wipe away a tear  
Sometimes we'd take her picture down  
And sit and pretend that she's still here  
Three girls and two boys he raised on love  
And simple honesty  
And when they fin'lly have to carry him away  
They'll take a lot of me  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
Grandpa told me 'bout the things he'd seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpa's memories  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
My Grandpa told me 'bout the things he'd seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpa's memories

American pride something you feel inside  
Something you can't describe American pride  
Dad said, "Son I'm proud you won  
But the game is more than any toy"  
Mama said, "Now Son say sir and say ma'am  
And be proud you're southern born"  
You play when you're hurt and you work when you're tired  
'Cause that was Grandpa's way  
And the biscuits are better at Granny's house  
And the gravy taste great all day  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
Something you can't describe, something you cannot hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
When a baby is born we all celebrate  
With tears of joy in family eyes  
'Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride  
Yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways  
And we don't all look alike  
But if the cause is right we stand up and fight  
To protect our American pride  
Sing it, sing it, sing it  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
It's something you can't describe, it's something you can't hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
With American pride, it's American pride

I was walkin'home from school  
On a cold winter day,  
Took a short cut through the woods  
And I lost my way.  
It was gettin' late, and I was scared and alone.  
Then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home.  
Mama couldn't see him,  
But he was standing there,  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayer.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us,  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hours  
To show us how to live  
To teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times  
And had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone  
To come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger  
To lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend  
Just to say I understand  
Now ain't it kind of funny  
At the dark end of the road  
Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They wear so many faces,  
Show up in the strangest places  
And grace us with their mercies in our time of need.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To guide us with a light of love

Lord it's the same old tune fiddle and guitar  
Where do we take it from here  
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars  
It's been the same way for years  
We made the change  
  
Somebody told us when we came to Nashville  
Boys you really got it made  
Old Hank made it here we're all sure that you will  
But I don't think Hank done it this a'way  
I don't think Hank done it this a'way, nah  
  
Been years on the road working one night stands  
Speeding my young life away  
Yeah tell me one more time just so I'll understand  
Are you sure Hank done it this a'way  
Did Ol' Hank really do it this a'way?  
  
Yeah I've seen the world with a four piece band  
Looking sidways at me  
Singing our songs want to hear us now and then  
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way  
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way, yeah  
  
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way  
  
Yeah I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way

You're still the lady of my dreams  
You're still my high school beauty queen  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I have never loved you so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
You're still my actress on the screen  
Still the leading lady in my scenes  
  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I've still never loved someone so much  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
  
You're still the one I'm with when I'm alone  
And you're still the lover calling on my phone  
To me it's still magic when we touch  
And I will never love someone so much  
  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now  
As right now

Everybody get on your feet you make me nervous when you're in your seat  
Take off your shoes and pat your feet we're doin' a dance that can't be beat  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'  
Went to a party the other night long tall Sally was out of sight  
Threw 'way her wig and her high sneakers too she's doing a dance without any
shoes  
She's barefootin' she's barefootin' she's barefootin' she's barefootin'  
Hey little girl with your red dress on bet you can barefoot all night long  
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away come back and get 'em another day  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'

Little John Henry he said to Sue if I barefoot would you barefoot too

Barefootin' we're barefootin' don't have no shoes on we're barefootin'  
We're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin' we're barefootin'  
  

They married back in '32  
They were young and love was new  
And every day the feeling grew  
Between the two of them  
When work grew scarce and times got bad  
The hope would chase away the sad  
And hope was sometimes all they had  
Between the two of them  
The 40's came and the 50's went  
And the mortgage replaced the rent  
They made the most of each day spent  
Between the two of them  
Their children all turned out just fine  
So he retired in '69  
And left with oh so little time  
Between the two of them  
Today I brave the graveyard rain  
And placed a rose between their names  
Now that's the most that ever came  
Between the two of them  
And though I miss them oh so much  
His crooked smile her gentle touch  
And the pleasure of just growing up  
Between the two of them

In a cloud of dust cross Texas, south of San Antone  
The lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses on  
Racin' toward the Rio running out of time  
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.  
  
Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge  
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge  
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime  
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline  
  
In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run  
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done  
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife  
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.  
  
The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark  
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark  
And so goes the legend that out there in the night  
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.  
  
They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back.  
  
They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back

Clear creeks and cool mountain mornin's.  
Honest work out in the fields.  
Cornbread in my momma's kitchen.  
Daddy saying grace before the meal.  
Family ties run deep in this land.  
And I'm never very far from what I am.  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born country and that's what I'll always be.  
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free.  
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood.  
I was born country and this country's what I love.  
  
Moonlight and you here beside me.  
Crickets serenadin' in the yard.  
What more could two people ask for.  
Laying here in love beneath the stars.  
Now this is where I want to raise my kids.  
Just the way my mom and daddy did.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I was born country

Atlanta was on fire and so was she the night he left her.  
Left her there to bear her pain alone, hoping soon to return.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
The roaring of th guns filled the emptiness inside her where once she felt  
the pounding of her heart.  
When he held her in his arms, tenderness they learned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair the couldn't control.  
While the world was falling down around them, they were not concerned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
Winter brought the snow and a rider down from Franklin with news of how the  
war had taken toll and he would not return.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair they couldn't control.  
While her world crumbled all around her, she was not concerned.  
Burn, Georgia, burn.  
While strolling through her mind she stumbled on an old, familiar feeling of  
how he touched her many years ago and how he made her yearn.  
Burn, Georgia, burn

The walls of my mind are closin' in.  
Can't get away.  
Your mem'ry won't end.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.  
Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
I never stop hearin' the music after the song is through.  
I still see your eyes, your warm, gentle smile.  
It was all worthwhile, each moment we knew.  
[Chorus]

Long hair was not in style the first time I heard Haggard on the radio, but I
could feel the changes comin' on.  
The Beatles crossed the ocean, an overnight explosion on the T.V.  
My brother had to go to Vietnam.  
  
Ford unveiled the Mustang.  
Things were good in Detroit for the people there.  
And I could feel changes comin' on.  
From Atlanta Doctor King told the world he had a dream.  
People followed him.  
And Daddy said my hair was getting long.  
  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
People started singin' different songs, searchin' for the place where they
belong.  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
  
Well, I'm still hooked on Haggard.  
But the Beatles can't come back like we hoped they would.  
In Memphis, Tennessee, The King is gone.  
As I put my kids to bed, I wonder what lies ahead for them to see, 'cause I
can feel the changes comin' on.  
  
I could feel changes comin' on.  
People stilll are singin' different songs.  
They're searchin' for the place where they belong.  
I can feel changes comin' on.  
  
I can feel changes comin' on. I can feel changes comin' on.

This town ain't big, this town ain't small  
It's a little of both they say  
Our ball club may be minor league but at least it's triple A  
We sit below the Marlboro man, above the right field wall  
We do the wave all by ourself  
Hang off, a blind man could've made that call  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher what's his name  
Well we can't even spell it  
We don't worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
  
The game was close, we'll call it a win  
Go off to toast the boys again  
That local band is back in town  
They got a kinda minor league sound  
They're not that bad, they're not that good  
But all in all it's understood  
We wanna dance, they wanna play  
We wouldn't have it any other way  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher what's his name  
Well we can't even spell it  
We don't worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
Cheap seats  
  
Now the majors called up oh what's his name  
And one more buildin' rises come  
And suddenly we're all grown up  
And this old town not quite so small  
But I'll always miss the middle size town  
In the middle of the middle-west  
With no name pitchers and local bands  
And mustard and relish and all the rest  
  
We like beer flat as can be  
We like our dogs with mustard and relish  
We got a great pitcher what's his name  
Well we can't even spell it  
We don't worry about the penant much  
We just like to see the boys hit it deep  
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats  
Cheap seats

A glowin' fire and fallin' snow, they spark a memory  
Stockings hangin', mistletoe, presents beneath a tree  
A happy boy wakin' up to toys, lookin' so surprised  
And wondering how Santa knew just when I closed my eyes  
Chorus:  
It's a Homecoming Christmas, goin' back to where it all began  
Homecoming Christmas, I wanna be there once again  
Memories do sweet and strong and I've been done too long  
It's Christmas time and I'm comin' home  
I can see the Christmas tree and feel the warm fireplace  
Handmade decorations, homemade pies and cakes  
Family all together with so much love to share  
A special time and I can't wait, can't wait to be there  
Chorus  

Woke up this morning, not feeling too well  
The man in my mirror looking mighty pale  
On this old CB calling for emergency  
But all of a sudden, it?s dawning on me  
  
I don't need no doctor  
To tell me what's wrong  
I've known my problem  
I've been gone too long, way too long  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling, love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama, missing you  
  
That old evening sun, it's going down on my right  
Baby, I'm southbound coming home tonight  
I'm in the mountain, mama, headed up the hill  
The closer I get to you the better I feel  
  
that's just one gift, mama  
She don't get my mind  
One once of your love honey  
And I?ll be feeling fine, so fine  
  
Homesick fever running through my vein  
Lonely feeling, love hungry pain  
You can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Got this homesick fever mama, missing you  
  
Homesick fever, lonely feelin'  
  
Yes, you can say your daddy coming down with the blues  
Homesick fever mama, missing you

How do you fall in love  
When do you say I do  
When is the perfect time  
To spend the rest of your life  
  
Seasons may come and go  
And sometimes it rains and snows  
And there will be highs and lows  
So only you will know  
  
You never know just where it will find you  
'Cause it can come on you so fast  
Seems like it takes forever  
When you want it so bad  
But don't ever take it for granted  
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds  
It takes sun and water  
So give it what it needs  
  
And that's how you fall in love  
That's when you say I do  
That's when you know it's time  
To spend the rest of your life  
  
Now seasons may come and go  
And sometimes it rains and snows  
There will be highs and lows  
So only you will know  
There will be highs and lows  
So only you will know

  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
I got a mother, sister and a brother  
Who have been this, this way before  
But I'm determined to go and see them  
Over on that other shore  
  
Sing it  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
Play it  
Play that one more time  
  
I'm going down to thet river of Jordan  
Just to bathe my wearisome soul  
And if I could touch the hem of His garment  
Then I know he'll take me home  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
Yeah  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
And I got a home in that yonder city, good Lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
Good Lord, not made my hand  
  
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger  
  

When we're in a crowd, I'm sure you've noticed how  
I love to look at you (you, you, you)  
No, I can't deny, I get hypnotized  
When I look at you (look at you, look at you)  
Oh, it's the kind of thing, that I can't explain  
No matter how I try  
It's no mystery, the whole world can see  
How I feel inside (feel inside)  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
When we're all alone, oh it's just as strong  
When I look at you  
Maybe even more, behind these doors  
As I'm loving you (loving you)  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
Baby you never will be lonely, as long as I'm alive  
You'll always be my one and only, for the rest of my life  
Ooooh, ooooh  
  
(Oh, oh baby)  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
These feelings I know  
Can't help but show  
And I can't hide my heart  
  
I can't hide my heart  
It's been that way right from the start  
I can't hide my heart (and I can't hide my heart)  
It's been that way right from the start  
I can't hide my heart  
I can't hide my heart

My heart fell to the floor  
The night you broke the news  
Said you couldn't feel it anymore  
Those words that rolled off your tongue  
Tore my world in two  
As you turned and walked on out the door  
I've been trying to get over you  
And get on with my life  
But the more I do without you  
The more I realize  
  
I can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before  
I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Well girl I hope you never feel  
The way I feel tonight  
It's a hopeless kind of pain  
Well I'm not even comin' close  
To gettin' over you  
Feels like it's never gonna end  
So why do I keep hangin' on  
And wastin' my time  
Wish I could let you go  
But this old heart of mine  
  
Can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before  
I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Girl, I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore

My love is like an automobile  
Out of control, ramming down a hill  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
My love is like a runaway train  
Running over anything in my way  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
Once I get started making love to you  
That's the only thing that I want to do  
Oh, oh, I can't stop  
  
My love is like a house on fire  
You keep me burning with your sweet desire  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop, yeah  
  
I'm gonna love all over and then  
I'm gonna love you all over again  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
Once I get started making love to you  
That's the only thing that I want to do  
Oh, oh, I can't stop  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
I'm gonna love you all over again  
I'm gonna love you all over and then  
I can't stop, no, I can't stop  
  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you

You've got me achin' more than I should  
My heart is breakin', oh don't it feel good  
'Cause I know for certain, we're magic in love  
You've got me hurtin, 'cause I can't get enough  
  
I just couldn't say no even though I should  
Even if I did, wonder if you could  
I just couldn't say no when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best  
  
The way you tease me makes me want you more  
You purr like a kitten but I hear you roar  
Your body language is talkin' to me  
Right here in the darkness, it's so plain to see  
  
I just couldn't say no even though I should  
Even if I did, wonder if you could  
I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best, I just couldn't say no  
  
I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes  
I just can't say no, I've tried my best  
I just couldn't say no, I've tried my best  
  
I just couldn't say no

I saw the time  
When every baby that was born  
Was wanted and had a place to stay warm  
And when the farmers could exist  
To feed the hungry in our midst  
I saw the time  
  
When the poor could still have pride  
And hard work paid off in time  
I saw the time  
When the homeless had a home  
And the old could carry on  
I saw the time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When special kids got a chance  
And handicapped could advance  
I saw the time  
When we walked the streets without risk  
And families still prayed and hugged and kissed  
  
I saw the time  
When nature was so clean  
We could eat from the field and streams  
I saw the time  
And when the bombs would not explode  
And all the people got to vote  
I saw the time, I saw that time  
  
Oh, I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When we went to the moon  
And disaster struck too soon  
I saw that time  
When little Samantha Smith was so brave  
And made that grin and call  
  
And when the Bears' Vincent Woody  
Paced the sidelines and coached football  
When John, George and Martin walked around  
(I saw the time)  
When John, Paul, George and Ringo  
Brought the sound  
  
When everybody held hands  
And the children smiled, mama's and daddy?s smiled  
Grandma?s and Grandpa?s smiled, and God smiled  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, whoa, I saw the time

She told me I should straighten up my ways or she'd be walkin' out  
I guess I was just too blind to see or maybe just too proud  
So I never thought twice when she loaded up her things and drove away  
'Cause I knew she'd be back someday, I knew she'd be back  
  
Took off my work clothes and left them right there on the floor  
'Cause I knew she'd pick 'em up  
When she got home like a hundred times before  
And just to make it easier for her, I left the light on on the porch  
'Cause I knew she'd be back someday, I knew she'd be back  
  
I guess I showed her how much she had to lose  
Showed her who was really who  
I know she's hurtin' now  
Looks like I showed her  
  
I must have seen the movie of the month a dozen times or more  
I watched my favorite team play ball but I never heard a score  
'Cause the whole time I was listening  
For the moment when she'd walk through the door  
'Cause I knew she'd be back someday, I know she'll be back  
  
I guess I showed her how much she had to lose  
Showed her who was really who  
I know she's hurtin' now  
Looks like I showed her  
  
If I could I show her how much she had to lose  
I'd show her I've been hurtin' too  
If I could hold her now  
I'd really show her

Is that what time it is  
I'm sorry if I woke you with this call  
But all this wine is in my head  
And I'm so lonely from it all  
Don't hang up  
Baby hear what I gotta say  
We started out such a beautiful story  
We just can't end this way  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I don't care about the time or who's wrong or who's right  
Just say it's OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
I'll try to unsay all the things I've said  
Please say its OK and I'll be on my way  
  
Is that what time it is  
I'm sorry if I'm keeping you from your sleep  
But all these feelings are running through me  
You know I never knew they ran so deep  
What's that you're sayin'  
That just before I phoned  
You were gettin' ready to give me call  
'Cause you were feelin' so alone  
  
I want to come over I want to love you tonight  
I don't care about the time or who's wrong or who's right  
Just say it's OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over could you get outta bed  
I'll try to unsay all the things I've said  
Please say its OK and I'll be on my way  
I want to come over  
I comin' over  
I want to come over  
Just let me come over tonight  

I hope you know what I'm thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you don't mind me saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
Was it just my imagination  
Or a "come on" look from you  
Did your eyes ask me to question  
Or did I misinterpret you?  
I don't know the man at your table  
But I wish you tell him goodbye  
And the looks in your eyes keep saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
I hope you know what I'm thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you don't mind me saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
As he turned you around the dance floor  
Our eyes continue to meet  
As he folds his arms around you  
You heart gets closer to me  
Both of us may be strangers  
But looks are hard to disguise  
And the looks in your eyes keep saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
I hope you know what I'm thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you don't mind me saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
I hope you know what I'm thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you don't mind me saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  
I hope you know what I'm thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you don't mind me saying  
'I wanna be with you tonight'  

He raced that engine down the track  
'Round the tree on Christmas day  
I was so amazed Dad could play with trains  
I saw a sparkle in his eye  
Then I heard him say  
I was young once too, I was young once too  
  
He washed that Buick faithfully  
Lord, he kept her clean  
I thought that machine  
Meant more to him than me  
On the day I turned sixteen  
He threw me the keys  
Said I was young once too, I was young once too  
  
He was such a young man then  
I'm older than that now  
I hope I measure up to him  
When the circle comes around  
  
I caught him in the attic  
Cross legged on the floor  
With some old photographs  
He pointed and he laughed  
He said that's me in that picture  
I said, "No son, that's your dad"  
I was young once too, I was young once too  
I was young once too, I was young once too  

How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream  
When memory recalls them now and then  
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
If I could hear her tender voice as then  
So happy I would be  
Would mean so much to me  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
  
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely  
And always walked the shining gospel way  
So trusting still his love  
I seek that home above  
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day  
  
Within the old home place her patient smiling face  
Was always spreading comfort hope and cheer  
And when she used to sing to her eternal king  
It was the songs the angels loved to hear  
  
Her work on earth is done the life crown has been won  
And she will be at rest with Him above  
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me  
To that eternal home of peace and love  
  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
If I could hear her tender voice as then  
So happy I would be  
Would mean so much to me  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
  
If I could hear my mother pray again  
  
Pray again

I come to the garden alone  
While the dew is still on the roses  
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear  
The Son of God discloses  
  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me  
And He tells me, I am His own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there  
None other has ever known  
  
He speaks and the sound of His voice  
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing  
And the melody that He gave to me  
Within my heart is ringing  
  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me  
And He tells me, I am His own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there  
None other has ever known  
  
I'd stay in the garden with Him  
Though the night around me be falling  
But He bids me go through the voice of woe  
His voice to me is calling  
  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me  
And He tells me, I am His own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there  
None other has ever known  
  
And the joy we share as we tarry there  
None other has ever known

Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby, come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Oh I still recall our first time together  
Oh we kissed and we touched, we couldn't get enough of each other  
And when we said goodnight beneath that old porch light  
It left us wanting more  
But I'm wondering now if time has somehow  
Changed what we felt before  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Am I still the one that you daydream of?  
When we turn out the light, is there fire in the night  
When we make love?  
Don't want to take you for granted so baby I'm askin'  
Only because I care  
I just want to know  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Is the magic still there, is the magic still there?  

He rattles his glass, she jumps up fast  
And pours him a glass of tea  
Deep in her heart she believes  
That's the way it should be  
And I've seen my dad get fighting mad  
Over one little four letter word  
He'll tell you fast, you don't talk like that  
Around her  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
Though he's down in his back, he still jumps out of that sack  
Every morning at 5:00 a.m.  
But having her home with the kids  
Has been worth it to him  
And she takes pride in being his wife  
And making their house a home  
Sometimes she wishes the world would just  
Leave them alone  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
If the good lord's willing  
There will come a day  
When our children will say  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
And even in this modern age, it works  

Well I've spent more money than I've made  
And I've grown more whiskers than I've shaved  
I've worked harder getting out of work  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
I've spilled more whiskey than I've drank  
I drove up more gas than was in my tank  
I've lost a lot more than my shirt  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when you're broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what its worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Well I walk a lot more than I ride  
And I show a lot more than I hide  
I'm sometimes more trouble than I'm worth  
But I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Oh I hurt a little now and then  
But when you're broke you learn to bend  
The bottom line for what it's worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt  
  
Yea the bottom line for what it's worth  
I've loved a lot more than I've hurt

Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
The Bible tells me so  
  
Jesus loves me this I know  
For the Bible tells me so  
Little ones to Him belong  
They are weak but He is strong  
  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
The Bible tells me so  
  
Jesus loves me still today  
Walking with me on my way  
Wanting as a friend to give  
Light and love to all who live  
  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
The Bible tells me so  
  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
(Yes, Jesus loves me)  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
(Yes, Jesus loves me)  
  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
(Yes, Jesus loves me)  
Yes, Jesus loves me  
Yes, Jesus loves me

Out here is the country there's magic in the air.  
It's the middle of December there's excitement eveywhere  
  
Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned  
The gift is just what's in your heart and not what's in your hand  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's the one we need to thanks  
Who's the party for  
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy  
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy  
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joseph and Mary's boy  
  
There were times we didn't think we'd make it through the year  
The bankers tried to take our farms but somehow we're still here  
  
I don't know how the crops survived the drought and then the rain  
It must have been a miracle how else could you explain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Christ Child born in Bethlehem  
He was Joseph and Mary's boy

Words and Music by Jeff Cook and Richard Scott  
I am so happy with you in my arms.  
Honey, don't you ever leave.  
Lay back and love me and tellme you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.  
  
Your hair is so soft and your eyes are so brown.  
Your body's warm here next to me.  
You be my woman and I'll be your man, and your love is all I'll ever need.  
  
It took so long for me to find you.  
I've been lonely for so long. Lonely.  
You came into me life to love me.  
Now my loneliness is gone.  
  
You can't improve on perfection.  
And you are perfect for me.  
Cast your love in my direction,  
and I know that you will see.  
  
I am so happy with you in my arms.  
Honey, don't you ever leave.  
Lay back and love and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.  
  
Lay back and love me and tell me you're mine.  
Keep on dreamin' with me.

What's goin' on with the sun and the moon  
'Cause one's goin' down to early, one's comin' up to soon  
The hands on my old clock tell me once again that I'm fallin' behind  
There's too much to do and not enough time  
  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
  
There's no such thing for me as a nine to five  
It takes more sweat than that just to get us by  
It's like I'm chasin' my own tail  
'Cause Monday mornin' starts another stressed out week  
  
The world is breathing down my neck I can feel the heat  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
By the time we make ends meet  
There's not much left for you and me  
And no job security  
  
It sure makes it tough  
Keepin' up  
Keepin' up  
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck  
  
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up  
I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
Keepin' up  
  
I can't stop  
Keepin' up like it or not  
Keepin' up I'm movin' as fast as I can  
Keepin' up in a circle that never ends  
  
Keepin' up  
I can't stop  
Keepin' up like it or not  
Keepin' up

You say hello, I say goodbye  
You go your way and I go mine  
There's not much time for you and I these days  
We work too hard, we're gone too much  
And we're too tired to even touch  
So just how long can we go on this way  
  
Oh, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Let's take some time, let's get away  
Let's pack our bags and leave today  
Girl, anyplace would be okay right now  
Just leave your pager here at home  
And I won't carry my cell phone  
We need to find some time alone somehow  
  
Yeah, life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
We can't keep up this pace we're on right now  
We burn the candle at both ends  
The circle turns, we start again  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
We're spinnin' our wheels  
Forgetting how love feels  
Let's slow down before it's too late  
  
Cause life's too short to love this fast  
If we don't slow down our hearts won't last  
Let's make our future better than our past  
Life's too short to love this fast  
  
Love this fast  
Life's too short

There's a full moon risin'  
Comin' up behind them cypress trees  
Betty Jo ain't wearin' nothin' 'round her body  
But a cool night breeze  
Her daddy warned me  
Boy, don't come 'round here no more  
But here I am knockin'  
On sweet Betty's door  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast it's spell on me  
(Yeah)  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things  
We slipped off to a place  
In the swamp where nobody goes  
Down by the water  
Where the snakes and the alligator's play  
Nobody follows  
'Cause there's evil in there  
Uh, I ain't scared of nothin'  
When I'm holdin' Betty tight  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast it's spell on me  
(Yeah)  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things  
I can't stay away  
'Cause I love the thrill  
If the gator's don't get me  
Her daddy will  
Louisiana moon  
Done cast it's spell on me  
(Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)  
Louisiana moon  
Makes a man do crazy things

Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Waitin' in the front yard, sittin' on a log  
A single shot rifle and a one-eyed dog  
Yonder come our kin-folk in the moonlight  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
My brother Bill and my other brother Jack  
Barrel full of beer and a possum in a sack  
Fifteen kids in the front porch light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
When the kin-folk leave and the kids get fed  
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed  
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen 'till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night (x3)

When the last drop of rain has fallen  
When the final note has drifted away  
When the earth ceases to turn  
And the last fire has burned  
  
When the wind stops its ceaseless blowing  
When the last wave has come into shore  
When the sun has called it a day  
And the stars have all floated away  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
When we have grown old together  
And the hourglass runs out of sand  
Darlin' you will kiss me and then  
Forever starts all over again  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
My soul is one with yours, baby  
Just to hold you drives me crazy  
In your eyes I see... you feel the same  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love remains  
  
Love remains like an endless flame  
Through the brightest joys and the darkest pain  
In the end  
  
My heart will still be yours, baby  
My dreams will still be yours, darlin'  
You and I will find nothing has changed  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love (remains)  
  
My soul is one with yours, baby  
Just to hold you drives me crazy  
In your eyes I see... you feel the same  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
Love, love, still remains  
Oh, love, love, love  
Love, love, love  
Oh, love, love, love

Well, here it comes again  
That old feelin' so strong  
You came into my life  
I won your love for a song  
And when I see you in my mind baby  
Think of the words you will say  
And in a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
Girl you take me away  
In a mist of desire  
And our love's not an ember baby  
It's a raging fire  
I need to be with you  
What else can I say  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
I feel the love when we touch  
I can see it in your face  
I get lost in the shadows of your warm embrace  
And you rush into my arms  
My emotions run wild  
And we're off to a love world  
In a mist of desire  
  
Girl you take me away  
In a mist of desire  
And our love's not an ember baby  
It's a raging fire  
I need to be with you  
What else can I say  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away

Flattop guitar  
Down around the campfire  
You can smell that hickory burnin'  
Catfish fryin'  
Onions got us cryin'  
Hushpuppies they're a turnin'  
Friends and kin comin' down the hill  
  
Trippin' in the ole starlight  
Cookin' and kickin' do a little pickin'  
Party tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on down to the moonlight longe  
Where the ceilin' is so blue  
Where there ain't no door and our dance floor  
Is covered with mountain dew  
Where there ain't no walls and the waterfall  
Is the only sound around  
Yeah we're havin' us a party down in the holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge  
  
Me and my lady  
Rode in on sadie  
A fourteen hand chestnut mare  
A midnight hoot owl  
He's screechin' so loud  
Kind of puts a chill in the summer air  
The bushes are wigglin', somebody's gigglin'  
Buck couldn't wait to get a kiss  
Jimmy's got the four wheel hooked to the wagon  
A hay ride you don't want to miss  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
Won't you... (repeat chorus again)

Yeah we're havin' us a party everybody holler  
We call it the moonlight lounge

You see that mountain over there,  
yea, one of these days  
I'm going to climb that mountain.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Drift away like Tom Sawyer.  
Ride a raft with old Huck Finn.  
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle.  
Lay streaming again.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Swim across the river.  
Just to prove that I'm a man.  
Spend the day be'in lazy.  
Just be'in natures friend.  
Climb a long tall hickery.  
Bending over skin'n cats.  
Playing baseball with shired rocks.  
Using sawmill slats for bats.  
  
Play some back home come on music  
That comes from the heart.  
Play somethin with lots of feeling.  
'Cause that's where music has to start.  
  
Oh play me some mountain music.  
Like Grandma and Grandpa used to play.  
Then I'll float on down the river to the Cajun hideaway.  
  
Hey hey  
  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play me mountain music.  
Oh play.

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got so much honey the bees envy me  
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Ooh  
  
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame  
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl (my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)  
  
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
With my girl  
  
I've even got the month of May  
With my girl

My nights belong to the sandman  
'Cause I sure like a dream  
My morning's belong to the wild-woods  
'Cause I like to hear the birds sing  
My soul belongs to heaven  
My feet belong to my shoes  
Oh but baby my love belongs to you  
My thoughts belong on tomorrow  
'Cause today is all but gone  
My memories belong on yesterday  
'Cause I like to recall  
My wishes belong upon a star  
'Cause I believe they come true  
But baby my love belongs to you  
My love belongs to you  
You and only you  
These words are my heart talking  
Believe me girl they're true  
Oh my wishes belong upon a star  
'Cause I believe they come true  
Oh but my baby my love belongs to you  
But baby my love belongs to you

Drift off and dream in your paper-doll world.  
Play with the presents from the boys and the girls.  
You big day is over. The cake is all gone.  
We sang you to sleep with the birthday song.  
  
[Chorus]  
No. you'll never be one again.  
The two's are tumbling on in.  
Daddy's little girl is growing up in the world.  
You'll never be one again.  
  
The toy piano is quiet in the hall as Kermie the frog sits watching it all.  
And soon your legs will and make the tricycle go and take you away from us
all.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodnight, Baby. Goodnight, Daddy.

Baby, let's make a date for a night on the town  
How does the turn of the century sound  
I guarantee that we'll have a good time  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
Now I know it sounds a bit premature  
But I'm askin' you now 'cause I want to be sure  
Do you have anything else in mind  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
We'll drink pink champagne from a plastic cup  
Dance all night 'til the sun comes up  
We'll say it's been a pretty good century  
Except for that weekend in '93  
  
Then we'll go home to our warn winter bed  
And tuck in the kids with a kiss on the head  
And sing one more chorus of Auld Lang Syne  
New Year's Eve 1999  
  
I'll be your sweetheart if you'll be mine  
New Year's Eve 1999, New Year's Eve 1999

I've been lucky, got to travel this great land  
From the mountains of Montana to the Sarasota sands  
Oh, what a life living my dreams  
I can say these eyes have seen so many things  
The moon over Miami, sunset in Frisco bay  
It's all been so beautiful but still I have to say  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing comes close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close, oh no  
Baby, I've been there nothing comes close  
  
I could search forever and never stop  
Walk every valley and climb each mountain top  
Sell every ocean to the end of my days  
But when it was over, I'd still believe I'd say  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing come close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing come close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close  
  
Oh, no, baby, I've been there and nothing comes close  
Nothing comes close

O little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie  
Above they deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth the everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight  
  
O holy child of Bethlehem descend to us, we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in be born in us today  
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel  
  
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above  
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love  
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on Earth

Why do you ask of course I'm alright  
I guess I wasn't thinking I'd run into you tonight  
Do I seem surprised, I guess you caught me off guard  
Yes I'm really doing fine, no it hasn't been that hard  
  
How 'bout you, getting on with your life  
There's so much to tell you, that I won't even try  
My, its good to see you, how long has it been  
I must admit I think about you every now and then  
  
Like when I open my eyes, when I lay down at night  
Every moment ever since the day you said goodbye  
But you'll never know 'cause I keep it inside  
How am I doing without you, of course I'm alright  
  
Well to tell you the truth, I guess I have felt better  
God just look at you, wow  
You make it look so easy, I can see it on yout face  
Everything we used to be is gone without a trace  
  
If you want to know, right now I'm sinking fast  
Girl you always could see right behind this mask  
But I won't give it away, gonna keep it inside  
How am I doing without you, of course I'm alright  
  
If you don't want to know the truth, of course I'm alright

'Round 'Ole' Baugh Road it's a great place kids to grow  
Some grow up and move away  
Most of us decide to stay  
'Round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
Hard working mom and dad  
Gve us things that they never had  
I our corner of the world  
Romance is slow for the boys and girls  
'Round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
The neighborhood still looks the same  
Just new kids with the same old names  
My Baugh Road's in a southern state  
Your's may be anywhere, you. S. A.  
Look 'round 'Ole' Baugh Road  
  
I see the kids on 'Ole' Baugh Road  
I see the glory of the future glow  
Look to the Heavens and give a shout  
Like my daddy did when he started out  
  
'Round, 'round, 'round the 'Ole' Baugh Road  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
  
The 'Ole' Baugh Road  
'Round, 'round, 'round  
'Round, 'round, 'round

I saw you staring at each other  
I saw your eyes be-gin to glow  
And I could tell you once were lover's  
You ain't hiding nothing I don't know  
  
There's an old flame, burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown,and make-up can't disguise  
That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer  
Than any spark I might have,started in your eyes  
  
You said it ended when he left you  
You say your love for him is gone  
But those old memories still up set you  
For I might be a memory before to long  
  
There's an old flame burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise  
That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer  
Than any spark I might have,started in your eyes  
  
There's an old flame burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown,and make-up can't disguise

I had my rent-a-car flyin' down a two-lane road  
Late for my plane again  
Had to stop for some gas at this country store  
That's when I saw the old man  
He was kicked back workin' on a big RC  
Watchin' Gomer Pyle on his little TV  
Took him awhile to even notice me  
Sittin' there I thought to myself  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man)I guess you got one up on me  
Well he finally strolled over with a big 'ol smile  
Said "How ya doin, son?"  
I said "Give me five dollars worth as fast as you can...  
'cause I'm really in a run."  
He said "What's your hurry on a day like this?  
If you move too fast, there's a lot you'll miss  
If you want to see what the good life is  
Just get out and visit awhile."  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man)I guess you got one up on me  
Don't remember just what it was the old man said to me  
But I forgot about catchin' the plane and opened up the big RC  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man) you got one up on me  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man you got one up on me

When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup  
Over hills and meadows we'd stray  
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun  
We grew up together that way  
  
I remember the time at the old mill pond  
When I would've drowned beyond doubt  
But old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came  
He jumped in and helped pull me out  
  
As, the years passed and rolled, at last he grew old  
And his eyesight was fast growing dim.  
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said  
I can't do no more for him, Jim?  
  
I went to his side and sat on the ground  
And laid his old head on my knee  
Well, he was the best friend that I ever had  
I cried so I scarcely could see  
  
Old Sheppie he knew, he was going to go  
For he reached out and licked at my hand  
He looked up at me, just as much as to say  
We're parting but you understand  
  
Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go  
And no more with old Shep will I roam  
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sure  
Old Shep has a wonderful home

Some folks looks through a telescope  
And dream of flying high above the stars  
They say it won't be long  
'Til we can haul on a ship to Mars  
  
I'm just a simple man  
There's a lot that I don't know  
But as long as you're here with me  
I just assume stay home  
  
On this side of the moon  
Things are going my way  
Your love keeps shining through  
Even when it rains  
  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
I'm happy standing in these shoes  
With you here in my life  
The world is looking bright  
On this side of the moon  
  
Sometimes on a clear night  
We pulled out a chair in the yard  
And I'm always amazed  
At the good lord can make so many stars  
  
But I know I'd feel out of place  
Longing through the milky ways  
All you expect a astronaut  
I'd think I'd rather stay  
  
On this side of the moon  
Things are going my way  
Your love keeps shining through  
Even when it rains  
  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
I'm happy standing in these shoes  
With you here in my life  
The world is looking bright  
On this side of the moon

  
A man and wife had prayed for years for children  
Were losing faith and close to giving up  
Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby  
Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
A small coal mining town in West Virginia  
Prayed as they kept vigil day and night  
Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken  
But also thankful one made it out alive  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting  
For the Savior they were told would come  
Then on that winter night there in a manger  
God blessed the world with his one and only son  
  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart  
  
It takes one honest prayer coming from your heart  
  

Well it's concrete and asphalt drivin' into work every day  
This livin' can't be healthy but the Lord knows I got bills to pay  
And there's others here just like me, they got families to feed  
  
[Chorus]  
One more time arouund, time around, on the job is where I'll be found  
One more time arouund, time around, earn my pay and hear that whistle sound  
  
Well thunder and lighting, it don't matter, nothin' stops the clock  
The radios are blastin', mine is playin' country, some play rock  
The rhythm and blues of the workplace, we take pride in everything we make  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Five o'clock is comin', we're all racin' down the same track  
Life is a circle, sometimes we meet ourselves comin' back, well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One more time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around, time around  
Time around

(Spoken)  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
'Cause he done all he could  
  
(Sang)  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddy's strictest rule  
  
(Sang)  
So every morning 'fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said, "Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,  
  
(Sang)  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I she'd a tear  
My daddy's voice kept a-tinging in my ears  
Sayin, "Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...  
  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...

Well northern Georgia highway 41  
Beside the carpet mills and the gas stations  
There was a music store slash radio shack  
With the sound of dreamers jammin' in the back  
Well we rocked all night and we rolled all day  
We never bought nothing but we sure did play  
The music was loud and the girls were pretty  
There was always a magic down at Pete's Music City  
Well we had electric guitars just a gathering dust  
And a chrome mike stand with just a little bit of rust  
And a couple of amps with the volume on ten  
And when the last bell ringed that's when the music began  
And we rocked all night...  
[ guitar ]  
Well the years have been long and they ain't been kind  
They say all that's left is the old faded sign  
But the music's still ringing loud in my heart  
Down at Pete's Music City where I got my start  
Well we rocked all night...  
  

There's a teardrop falling slowly from my eyes tonight  
As I think of your two arms that used to hold me so very tight  
But you're gone now and girl I'm alone and blue  
With just these pictures and memories of you  
Pictures and memories of a love warm and true  
Pictures of love we shared and the memories of you  
But your pictures can't heal my chest of this hurt deep inside  
Pictures and memories I feel like crying tonight  
I may be crazy but you know sometimes I can almost feel your touch  
Those who say I should be over you well I guess they just never loved as much  
I'd put your pictures where I couldn't see them but I'd still see them in my
mind  
Just like your memories, they're right here with me all the time  
Pictures and memories of a love warm and true  
Pictures of love we shared and the memories of you  
But your pictures can't heal my chest of this hurt deep inside  
Pictures and memories I feel like crying tonight  
Pictures and memories I feel like dying tonight

He came in and sits down at the end of the bar  
His old rawhide shirt full of dust  
He asked for a glass and he ordered rye whiskey  
He talked to himself and he cussed  
  
He left Sacramento early that mornin'  
With a sackful of mail for St. Joe  
Had to outrun some outlaws outside Carson City  
By ridin' where they wouldn't go  
  
He said to me, "Mister, this long ridin's hell  
But I guess it's got to be done  
Otherwise how would you get all your mail  
If the pony express couldn't run?"  
  
I said, "I hear you, mister and you do your job well  
But I hear it won't be for long  
They'll be sendin' the mail by the wire and the rail  
And your pony and you will be gone"  
  
He came in and sits down at the end of the bar  
His coveralls covered with dust  
He said, "Jesse James had just held up his train"  
He talked to himself and he cussed  
  
He pulled out of St. Joe early that morning  
With the mail and the union payroll  
Had to stop for a rock slide outside Jackson City  
And Jesse made off with the gold  
  
He said to me, "Mister, this railroading's hell  
But I guess it's got to be done  
Otherwise how would you get all you mail  
If that old iron horse couldn't run?"  
  
I said, "I hear you mister and you do your job well  
But I hear it won't be for long  
They'll be sending the mail without you or the rail  
'Cause they say man will fly before long"  
  
He came in and sits down at the end of the bar  
His face looked all haggard and gray  
He ordered a drink and said, "Make it a double  
Boys it's sure been a long day"  
  
He pulled out of Denver early that mornin'  
He said, "You'll never guess where I've been  
A hijacker needed a lift down to Cuba  
So your mail will be late getting in"  
  
I said, "I hear you mister and you do your job well  
But you know it ain't been that long  
They were doing it best with the pony express  
Before you and your friends came along"

I remember campin' all night  
Down by the river's edge  
Skinny dippin' in the bright moonlight  
Divin' off a ledge  
Skippin' rocks across the water  
Fishin' on an old trout line  
Giggin' frogs 'til the early mornin'  
Smokin' dried crossvine  
  
Take me back down where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
  
Floatin' down the river on a patched up inner tube  
Eatin' dinner on the ground  
Made of fresh caught catfish stew  
Lay wake at night  
When I hear a wildcat scream  
Tellin' tales by campfire light  
About the girls in our dreams  
  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls

Seems like everywhere I look  
There's another version of the same old book  
And someone telling me it's new  
Every song on my radio sounds like one I heard a long time ago  
Different windows, same old view  
Yeah  
Uh-huh  
  
All the clothes in the magazines I could swear I've already seen  
In my closet years ago  
Hairstyles and super-malls, you've seen one well you've seen them all  
Tell me something I don't know  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
A friend of mine finds Mr. Right every other Friday night  
At a smoky singles bar  
And she can't seem to understand why life don't go like she plans  
She goes on wishing on a star  
Yeah  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
But in a world that's mostly imitation  
It's hard to recognize the real  
It takes a brave heart to resist temptation  
To take the easy way and reinvent the wheel  
(Yeah)  
  
Reinvent the wheel  
Reinvent the wheel

Before he ever made the headlines  
Or won the Winston cup  
He survived his share of crashes  
But he never did give up  
The tracks in Carolina  
Where all the Petty's ran  
What kept the motor's running  
Way back then were you the fans  
He won seven at Daytona  
It was STP and forty-three  
King Richard is a legend  
And he's a hero to me  
When he wins he waves his hand  
To the folks up in the stand  
He is dedicated  
To all the nascar fans  
Well I wish this year could last forever  
But the race must go on  
He'll hang up his helmet  
But he never will be gone  
I know he'll drive forever  
In the heart of every fan  
And he will be remembered  
As the best that's ever been

Orange Blossom Special  
The Wabash Cannonball  
The Chattanooga Choo-Choo  
This hobo's seen 'em all  
I've watched the Sante Fe  
Lay her smoke against the sky  
And listen to old number three rollin'  
Through the night  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains  
Sleepin' in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Southern Pacific  
The Overland Express  
And up ahead the coal cars of West  
Virginia's best  
And Oklahoma's Frisco  
The biggest one of all  
I've listened to the Silver Steed's  
Lonesome midnight call  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Anywhere I'm going I ride trains  
Sleepin' in a boxcar when it rains  
Ride the train, ride the train  
Ride the train  
Trains  

Subways runnin' under the city  
Condos reachin' to the sky  
Each of this own, but I feel at home  
Standing on this mountain high  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Talk on the cell phone, checkin' her e-mail  
The fax is a way of life  
She's shoppin' at home with QVC on  
And surfin' on-line  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Oh what a way of life  
Turn off the tv  
Shut down the pc  
And click off the world tonight  
  
And right where I am  
Is where I want to be  
It's all I want  
It's all I need  
Forever in your arms  
It's alright with me  
'Cause right where I am's where I want to be  
  
Yeah  
Right where I am  
Where I want to be  
  
Subways runnin' under the city  
Satellite feed out in the country  
Each to his own I feel at home  
Standin' on this mountain high  
Right where I am  
Right where I am, where I want to be  
Where I want to be

Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
While I draw this fleeting breath  
When my eyes shall close in death  
When I saw two worlds unknown  
And see beyond Thy golden throne  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let me hide myself in Thee  

Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple of tries to stop  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing  
"let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Well, rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday  
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing  
"let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Yeah, rockin' around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday  
Everyone feeling merrily in the new old-fashioned way

[Chorus]  
Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till you get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (roll on)  
  
It's Monday morning, he's kissin' momma goodbye  
He's up and gone with the sun  
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler  
And he's off on a midwest run  
As three sad faces gather round momma  
They ask her when daddy's comin' home  
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler  
And they sure miss him when he's gone (yeah they do)  
Ah, but he calls them everynight and he tells them that he lovesthem  
And he taught them this song to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone  
It rings but it's not his voice  
Seems the highway patrol has found a jacknifed rig  
In a snow bank in Illinois  
But the driver was missin' and the search had been abandoned  
  
For the weather had everything strong  
And they had checked all the houses and local motels  
When they had somemore news they'd call  
And she told them when they found him to tell him that she loved him  
And she hung up the phone singin'  
  
Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till ya get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on  
  
Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long  
Thinkin' nothing but the words just comin'  
With the ringin' of the telephone  
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening  
When momma asked him to bring daddy home  
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end  
Askin' her if she had been singin' the song, singin'  
  
Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till ya get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eighteen-wheeler  
Eighteen-wheeler  
Eighteen-wheeler  
Eighteen-wheeler  
  
Roll on  
Roll on

I thought that you could fly, i thought that you had wings  
I guess that i believed you'd never say goodbye  
But my world stopped turnin' 'round, the stars turned upside down  
It knocked me to the ground on my knees  
  
[Chorus]  
Now there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me  
There's a sad lookin' sky as far as i can see  
I always believed and i thought the stars could see  
But there's a sad lookin' moon shinin' down on me  
  
I shared with you my dreams, i gave you everything  
I opened up my heart and i gave you my ring  
Well i spent days and nights just thinkin' about the time  
When you would be mine all my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a sad lookin' moon  
A sad lookin' moon  
There's a sad lookin' moon  
Shinin' down on me

You always come around this time of year with your big ole bag that's full of
christmas cheer  
And when it starts to snow the little boys and girls all know soon they'll
hear the sound of your reindeer  
  
Now sometimes grownups grow up to believe that you don't really come on  
Christmas eve  
But I don't think that's true 'cause I know I see you in sparking little eyes  
Around the tree  
  
Oh santa claus, I still believe in you  
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true  
Oh santa claus, the kids are tucked in tight  
And it's time to play ole santa clause tonight  
  
Well I don't see how anybody could ever doubt that there's really a santa  
Clause.  
Not if they've ever seen a little girl with her arms wrapped around her baby  
Doll, so tight both of 'em waking up mama and daddy way before daylight  
And grandma and grandpa are looking young and full of life, just knowin' that  
Their grandkids are gonna be alright  
And mama and daddy, they'll be waitin' up to answer ole santa's call.  
"cause tonight they ain't worried about the bills- lord they're just lovin'  
It all  
  
Oh santa claus, I still believe in you  
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true  
Oh santa claus, the kids are tucked in tight  
And i'll be waiting up for you tonight  
Ho-ho-ho

Julianna, be mine tonight  
The time has come girl and the feelings right  
Love forever, not fade away  
A reborn love of yesterday.  
  
I can't believe it, this love I've found  
The fever's rising I can't cool it down  
And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just won't end.  
  
Ooo, yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
I've got a burning love, Girl, and you feel the same  
See the embers, feel the flame.  
  
I can't believe in this love I've found  
The fever's rising, I can't cool it down  
And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again  
Sharing a love that just won't end.  
  
Ooo, yeah all right  
Be my woman love me tonight  
I've got a burning love, Girl, and you feel the same  
See the embers, feel the flame  
See the embers, feel the flame.

She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She don't love carelessly that's what I've always heard  
'Can't use the usual lines she measures every word  
No empty promises proof is what it takes to win her heart  
The truth and nothing less, simple things that set her far apart  
Save your diamonds and your furs she's not your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, no she's not  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, oh no  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
No midnight alibis, no foolish games for her  
And if you cross the line you'll get what you deserve  
But when you see her smile nothing seems to matter anymore  
And in a little while you'll feel like you've never felt before  
Like no other in the world, she's not your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, no she's not  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary, oh no  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
Save your diamonds and your furs, she ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
She ain't your ordinary  
She ain't your ordinary girl  
  

She and I live in our own little world  
Don't worry about the world outside  
  
She and I agree  
She and I lead a perfectly normal life  
Ah but just because we aren't often seen socially  
People think we've got something to hide.  
But all our friends know we're just a little old fashioned  
She and I  
  
Oh ain't that great  
Aint it fine  
To have a love someone that others can't find  
Aint it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us  
She and I  
So wonderful  
She and I  
  
She and I share with every body else  
The same wants, needs and desires  
She and I save  
She and I pay on everything we acquire  
  
Ah but just because we aren't often seen separately  
People think we live one life.  
  
Its hard for them to see how anyone could be as close as  
She and I  

She's still got those pretty eyes like she did in school  
The first time that she looked at me, my heart went ka-boom  
Today I saw that look again on sale in summer square  
She looked so good in what she wore somehow it don't seem fair  
She's got that look in her eyes just like she's always had  
She's got that smile on her lips that always drives me mad  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when she's got that look in her eyes  
Just today she looked at me and I felt like a kid  
Even thought I'm grown up now the puzzle seems to fit  
I may never have her but I'll still love her still  
Oh I may never hold her in my mind I always will  
She's got that look in her eyes just like she's always had  
She's got that smile on her lips that always drives me mad  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when she's got that look in her eyes  
When she looks at me the way I feel comes as no surprise  
I love that look when she's got that look in her eyes  

Out on highway 1, I saw a camper van parked out on the shoulder  
Thinkin' they had broken down, I pulled over  
There was a little old lady and her old man kickin' back relaxin'  
They said "sit down and help us celebrate our golden anniversary"  
They had foldin' chairs, they were holdin' hands starin' at the fields  
I said "man this ain't no movie, this is real"  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
They said "stay awhile", I said "I thought I might and ask some burnin'
questions"  
Like how'd you make love last so long, they started laughing  
He said "to keep our love from danger, I treat her like a stranger"  
Courteous, considerate and kind  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
So I went home and I said "baby, baby listen"  
There's something missin' in our lives  
She said "I know, I been tryin' to tell you"  
We need more communication, an exotic vacation  
Big screen TV, redwood jacuzzi  
Dinners out, concerts and movies  
New kitchen, big addition, a pool, jewelry  
Sauna, fish pond and a five acre lawn  
I said "get in the camper"  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Love should be as simple as that

I remember, walking through flowers  
In a garden of a mem'ry, I'm thinkin' of  
I remember, being in heaven  
Some other place, some other time, some other love  
I remember, walking on silver sand  
With a mid summer moon shining above  
And I remember, the taste of her sweet lips  
Some other place, some other time, some other love  
I remember holding her close to me  
And I can picture the nights we shared alone  
When I'm dreaming, it all seems so real to me  
Then I wake up and find it's all done  
Tomorrow, I may be holding another girl  
But tonight she's not the one I'm thinkin' of  
Could it be, my life would just be a mem'ry  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love  
Of some other place, some other time, some other love  

There were times I stood my ground  
When I knew you were right  
Turned around and walked away  
When I should've held you tight  
But you never closed the door  
You just turned out the light  
Gave me time to think it over  
A chance to make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes out of touch  
But never out of love  
Sometimes giving in  
But never giving up  
We've been worlds apart  
Yet always close enough  
Yeah we've been out of touch  
But never out of love  
  
No matter how we try  
There still may come a time  
When our minds are far apart  
But I know you and me  
Will always find a way  
To be together in our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah we've been out of touch  
But never out of love

[Chorus]  
Song, song of the south  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth  
Gone, gone with the wind  
There ain't nobody looking back again  
  
Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch  
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich  
Daddy was a veteran, a southern democrat  
They oughta get a rich man to vote like that  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well somebody told us Wall Street fell  
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell  
Cotton was short and the weeds were tall  
But Mr. Roosevelt's a gonna save us all  
  
Well momma got sick and daddy got down  
The county got the farm and they moved to town  
Pappa got a job with the TVA  
He bought a washing machine and then a Chevrolet  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Play it  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Song, song of the south  
  
Gone, gone with the wind  
  
Song, song of the south.  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth.  
Song, song of the south.  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth.  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Well I'm blue-collar branded, and stuck in a mill  
Hard work is a way of life for me  
  
Well I'm too young to live like I'm over the hill  
And too old to be wild and free  
My heart is onward bound I'm rolling with the feeling and I can't slow down  
I need a guiding light shining down to lead me through the night  
  
Oh southern star, how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Oh, hey my DJ friend, would you play me one more song  
And let my mind just go and drift away  
  
Now we all have a dream and a place where we belong  
Somewhere we can go and escape  
My heart is onward bound I'm rolling with the feeling and I can't slow down  
I need a guiding light shining down to lead me through the night  
  
Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Oh, southern star, how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home

We're standing like kids on a mineway  
Two hearts like tumbling dice  
We've lost control of the way we feel  
  
Old heartaches driving us crazy  
Is it really different this time  
We've come too far not to take a chance  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Or is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Round and round our dreams are rollin?  
Will they land on lover goodbye  
My heart?s on you head over heels  
  
All I know is when I told you  
Love is worth any chance we take  
Baby let's left the chips fall were they make  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Maybe this is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Love is worth any chance we take  
Baby let's spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Or maybe this is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Keep on spinning the wheel baby  
Round and round we go  
Spin in the wheel  
Spin the wheel  
  
Round and round we go  
And spin the wheel  
Spin the wheel

He just can't wait to graduate  
He's marking time and counting days  
He'll toss that cap and watch that tassel fly  
So he can start living  
Yeah, finally start living  
'Cause he's got big plans  
And he'll have time on his hands  
To start living  
  
Before he knows ten years are gone  
A dead-end job, a mortgage loan  
He wonders where the chances passed him by  
To really start living  
Yeah he wants to start living  
And soon he's sure  
He can finally afford  
To start living  
  
He'll read more books  
He'll make more love  
He'll talk more to the man above  
He'll watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
He'll learn to cook, he'll play some ball  
He'll write that book, he'll make that call  
He'll take the time  
Some other time  
Someday he'll do it all  
  
Well sittin' in the barber chair  
He sees the silver in his hair  
Those golden years are comin' right behind  
And then he'll start living  
He'll really start living  
Yeah he feels tired  
Ah, but soon he'll retire  
And start living  
  
He'll read more books  
He'll make more love  
He'll talk more to the man above  
He'll watch the sunset in the west  
And visit Mexico  
He'll learn to cook, he'll play some ball  
He'll write that book, he'll make that call  
He'll take the time  
Some other time  
Someday he'll do it all  
  
Well the doctor says, I've got bad news  
Afraid there's nothing we can do  
And all at once the tears are in his eys  
He'll never start living  
Never really start living  
Yeah he had big plans  
But there's no time on his hands  
To start living  
  
When he sees the pearly gates  
He'll really start living

If I could design forever  
I'd put you and me together each night  
Together each night  
The best I can do is promise  
I'll love you true and honest and right  
I'll love you right  
  
[Chorus:]  
Starting tonight and from now on  
I will be yours and yours alone  
Dependable and strong  
A rock by your side  
I'll be beside you through the stom  
You'll have a fire to keep you warm  
Not just for now but from now on  
Starting tonight  
  
If a man ever loved a woman  
Then surely this is the moment for me  
The moment for me  
I've never known a feeling  
So deep so real as being with you  
As being with you  
  
[Repeat chorus]

Through the years  
We've had our ups and downs  
Ain't been a block  
We haven't been around  
  
We've been one step up  
And two steps back  
But our love's gotten  
Right back on track  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin' on a midnight run  
We're rollin' right along  
Still goin' strong  
  
In tryin' times  
When push came down to shove  
We'd pull together  
And show what we're made of  
  
With a lot of love  
And a little faith  
We moved every mountain  
In our way  
  
We're still goin' strong  
With a fire that's hotter  
Than the desert sun  
We're still turnin' on  
Still goin' strong  
  
It's still as good  
As it's ever been  
Our love's just gettin'  
It's second wind  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Two hearts poundin'  
Like a rock and roll drum  
Lovin' all night long  
Still goin' strong  
  
We're still goin' strong  
Like a freight train  
Burnin' on a midnight run  
We're rollin' right along  
Still goin' strong  
  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong  
Still goin' strong  
Goin' strong

Well this ain't no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined, throttle opened wide  
Gentlemen, start the engines  
  
You got an all new diagnostic tuned  
Polished, shined, lookin' like new  
This car will blow your mind  
And your door right off  
  
Rotated tires, balanced, aligned  
Highest octane money can buy  
She looks like she's flyin'  
When she's sittin' at a stop  
Your grocery gettin' garbage  
Is nothing next to mine  
  
This ain't no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined, throttle opened wide  
Gonna kill a lot of bugs, pass a lot of poles  
Burn a little rubber down a blacktop road  
Better be able to bury that needle, your pink slip's on the line  
This ain't no Sunday drive, no, they ain't  
  
On your mark, set and ready, fly  
Be waitin' at the finish  
Hand your keys to my baby  
And don't ask for a ride  
This ain't no Sunday drive, no it ain't son  
  
Well this ain't no Sunday drive  
Got the tach red lined, throttle opened wide  
Gonna kill a lot of bugs, pass a lot of poles  
Burn a little rubber down a blacktop road  
Better be able to bury that needle, your pink slip's on the line  
This ain't no Sunday drive, this ain't no Sunday drive  
  
Overdrive, overdrive, overdrive, overdrive  
This ain't no Sunday drive

Many years ago in days of childhood  
I used to play till evening shadows come  
And then winding down that old familiar pathway  
I heard my mother call at set of sun  
"Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
The shadow's lengthen fast  
Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
We're going home at last"  
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood  
Are woven around suppertime  
When Mama used to call out from the back steps  
To the old home place, "Come on home, son, it's suppertime"  
Oh, how I'd love to hear those words once more  
But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth  
That's even more thrilling  
And that's when the call comes from the portals of glory  
To come on home, it's suppertime  
"Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
The shadow's lengthen fast  
Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
We're going home at last, we're going home at last"  
When all God's children shall gather 'round the table  
With the Lord Himself at the greatest suppertime of them all  

If we could leave this big ole city  
And head for the cabin we love  
Back deep in the woods - baby we would  
If we could jump some big ole jet plane  
And go to the islands where the weather  
Is always good - baby we would  
But we can't do this and we can't do that  
But baby we can stay right were we're at - and  
  
Take a little trip  
Take a little trip  
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight  
Take a little time  
Leave it all behind  
Take a little trip, me and you out of sight  
Pull down the shades  
Turn out the lights  
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight  
  
We can go downtown to a night club  
Dance to the rhythm of the music  
On that ole hardwood - baby we could  
Or we can call up Rita and Bobby  
See what they're doin' tonight  
Maybe play some rook - yea baby we could  
We can do this or we can do that  
Or baby we can stay right where we're at - and  
  
Take a little trip  
Take a little trip  
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight  
Take a little time  
Leave it all behind  
Take a little trip, me and you out of sight  
Pull down the shades  
Turn out the lights  
Take a little trip up to heaven tonight  

Fly away with me tonight  
Take me on a one-way flight in your lovin' arms  
And everything's gonna be alright  
You're the one who took my hand  
When no one else could understand  
You're the one who moves me  
Like nobody else can  
  
In your eyes I see the light  
It's your emotions glowing bright  
So keep the fires burning  
And let it warm me through the night  
You can be a part of me  
'Cause you're what love was meant to be  
You and me baby we'll set the flame inside free  
  
Take me down to where I want to be  
Turn around, the man who lives inside of me  
Take me down and lose me all night long  
Hold me close and make me strong  
Take me down, take me down tonight  
You don't have to stay forever  
Let's just put our hearts together  
And share another night in ecstasy  
We know that it's feelin' better  
Every time we come together  
Maybe love was meant for you and me

Come on weather man give us a forecast snoowy white  
Can't you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight  
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'  
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter  
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Chirstmas for me  
Where the love circles arounf us like th gifts around our tree  
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
  
Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see  
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel TOwn's for me  
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there  
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve  
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting, still I think I'm gonna keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only CHristmas for me  
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree  
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday, it's th only place to be  
A tender Tennessee Christmas, is the only Christmas for me  
  
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
A tender Tennessee CHristmas is the only Christmas for me

I've made some decisions  
Never not the best  
Against my better judgment  
I must confess  
  
I went astray so many ways  
So my dreams fall apart  
And came a day, I'm glad to say  
I followed my heart  
  
That feeling, the one I'm feeling now  
Oh, that feeling, that turned me all around  
That feeling, oh, what love can do  
That feeling, that never let's me down  
  
Oh, that feeling, that always come around  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you  
  
Looking in the mirror  
Reflecting on the past  
Memories or misery  
That's all fading fast  
  
These eyes over my shoulder  
Oh, they made me realize  
I've made the right decision  
The day I recognized  
  
That feeling, the one I'm feeling now  
Oh, that feeling, that turned me all around  
That feeling, oh, what love can do  
That feeling, that never let's me down  
  
Oh, that feeling, that always come around  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you  
  
I never need another  
It's gonna last my whole life through  
That feeling, I'm feeling for you

I satnd here lookin' up at the starts tonight, how can one man have so much in  
Life  
As I look around me, what a picture it paints, I'm much more than lucky, I  
Oughta give my thanks  
There's food on the table, a log on the fire, and in my woman's eyes there's  
Love and desire  
  
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love  
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so I lift my eyes up  
To the sky  
I want to give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings  
  
Sometimes I fall asleep at the end of the day and I forget to thank you, I'm  
Ashamed to say  
But as I lay m down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep  
I know you can hear me here on earth, thank you for giving me more than I  
Deserve

So, I lift my eyes up to the sky, 'cause I want to give my, my, my, my, my  
Thanks for the blessings  
The blessings, oh, the blessings

I see the lights of the city tonight and I see a star shinin' so bright  
A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes, it's you, it's me everyone knows  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like th day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
I hear the sound of church bell ring, and I see kids and grown-ups sing  
A real live nativity scene, it's you, it's me, we all know what it means  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
An it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern star to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time  
  
Yes, it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern start to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time  
  
Since the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down

The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
The things that you say to me  
The look on your face  
Brings out the man in me  
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
Could I be dreamin'  
Is this really real  
'Cause there's something magic  
The way that I feel in your arms tonight  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
  
Keep fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, keep fallin', mm, fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, I'm
fallin'  
Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')  
Yes, I'm fallin' (Yes, I'm fallin' Yes, I'm fallin')  
Yes, we're fallin' (Yes, we're fallin' Yes, we're fallin')  
  
The closer you get, the further I fall  
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall

I'll be over the edge now in no time at all  
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall  
The closer you get, the further I fall

The End Of The Lyin'  
Alabama  
Album: Roll On  
You took me for a fool  
Then you took me for a ride  
You really had me going  
Till I looked into your lies  
I let you keep me hangin' on  
But honey here's where I get off  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line  
Don't tell me a story  
I don't care where you've been  
Girl I'm out for glory  
And I won't be back again  
I let you keep me hangin' on  
But honey here's where I get off  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end  
It's the end of the lyin'  
And I can't stand no more denyin'  
It's all over but the cryin'  
Honey it's the end of the line...  
  

Before we ever made the headlines  
Or toured the concert halls  
We survived our share of bar rooms  
Stared at many motel walls  
  
The years in Carolina  
And all the one night stands  
What kept the fires a burnin'  
Back then, was you the fans  
  
We two stepped out to Texas  
Round and round the dance hall floors  
Played the fair in Minnesota  
I wish we could've played one more  
  
We hope you remember  
We're just the boys in the band  
And what keeps the fires a burnin'  
Is always, you the fans  
  
I wish this night could last forever  
Ah, but the show must go on  
And we'll take home the memories  
And we'll leave you with our songs  
  
It's been good to see ya'll  
Can we come back again? And again, and again  
What keeps the fires a burnin'  
In us, is you the fans  
  
As long as you remember  
The boys in the band  
We'll keep the fires a burnin'  
For all of you, our fans

I was taught to believe and never to doubt  
the man up above knows what he's talkin' about.  
So, when I heard that voice, so loud and clear,  
speak to my heart, I knew that she must be near.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life and treat her right.  
  
I never was the one to listen very well.  
I walked my own way and felt what I felt,  
further out of touch with the master plan,  
but she was like a flight to the Promised Land.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right.  
  
He placed an angel in the palm of my hands.  
And for once in my life, I obeyed His commands.  
I'll take her and love her forever, take care of her for life.  
Ooh, never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right.  
Ooh, just treat her right.  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever,  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.  
The Maker said take her and treat her right, treat her right.  
For life.  

Ribbons and paper cover the floor, it's been a great Christmas with presents  
Galore  
Everyone's happy and I'm happy, too  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
Frost on the window, snow on the ground, holiday spirit, holiday sounds  
Everyone's thankful and I'm thankful, too  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
It all started underneath that mistletoe when we were waiting up just to help  
Ole Santa Claus  
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh  
Bells and ole Santa almost caught us  
  
We didn't take no pictures, but I still remember one very special  
Twenty-fourth day of December  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
  
It all started underneath that mistletoe while we were waiting up to help ole  
Santa clause  
We were making merry in ways we'd never thought of when we heard those sleigh  
Bells and ole Santa almost caught us  
  
If we don't do this next year, honey, I'm sure gonna miss it  
Why don't we make it a new yuletide tradition  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you  
Oh, what a night, oh, what a night, night before Christmas I had with you

  
Oh, John Dillon James was my good time country buddy  
Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away  
He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land  
Retired on his 68th birthday  
Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator  
Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods  
Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole  
But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide  
His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didn't understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  
Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning  
I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show  
Daddy came down about noon, and said  
Son, I've got some news  
Lord's rested old Dillon's soul  
Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon  
Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings  
That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood  
That refrain sung by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)  
I paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
Yeah, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light  
  
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming  
  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight  
  
Over the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming  
  
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air  
  
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there  
  
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave  
  
Over the land of the free and the home of the brave

You've got your secrets, girl I've got mine  
We're fallin' apart one glance at a time  
Night after night, actin' like strangers  
Out of emotion, nothing to say  
I brush your shoulder but you turn away  
Nobody tries, nobody's changin'  
Who'll be the first to say it's really the end  
Who's gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts can't take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
One night of passion won't stop the pain  
Back to the same old feelin' again  
Time after time, is it worth savin'  
Who'll be the first to say it's really the end  
Who's gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts can't take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye

Running scared  
Wonderin' what I'm doing so far from home  
Pretending not to care  
That I was so alone  
Then my eyes met hers  
And without one word  
I could tell what was gonna happen  
I could feel it in my bones  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Ah there's a fire in the night  
  
Well she told me  
She didn't often do this kind of thing  
She said please hold me  
Hold me tight so I don't have to think  
Oh her gentle touch  
Really moved me so much  
The flames of love swept over us  
Like a burning light  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Mm there's a fire in the night  
(Fire in the night)  
  
By the dark of the moon  
There's a fire in the night  
She took me to her room  
Ah you know it felt so right  
It keeps growing higher  
The flame of desire  
By the dark of the moon  
Oh there's a fire in the night  
  
There's a fire in the night  
We started a fire  
Oh  
  
There's a fire in the night  
Oh I'm on fire

As I lay by your side and hold you tonight  
I want you to understand this love that that I feel  
Is so right and so real I realize how lucky I am  
And to you ever wonder if my love is true  
There is something that I want to make clear with you  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way  
  
It means so much to me whenever I see that 'wanting me' look in your eyes  
I don't know how I could do without holding you close every night  
I've waited so long just to have you to hold  
Now that I've got you, I'll never let go  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I 'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way  
  
I never knew what to do, what I was missin'  
Now you say forever, I find my heart is listenin', yes, I'm listenin'  
  
There's no way I could make it without you  
There's no way that I 'd even try  
If I had to survive without you in my life  
I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way

Sittin' alone at a table for two, when she walked in  
I was down on my second love,  
Swore I'd never do that again  
She sat down beside me and tried to explain  
That two bad loves don't spoil the whole darn game  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that you're free  
This love's on me  
  
I thought my life was at the end of its rope  
Without true love, there could be no hope  
Then she asked if I would stay for the night  
She said, everything's gonna be all right  
The sun came up the very next day  
I knew what she meant when I heard her say  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that you're free  
This love's on me  
  
She sat down beside me and tried to explain  
That two bad loves don't spoil the whole darn game  
  
The first love lies  
The second lover hurts you deep inside  
Now that you're free  
This love's on me  
  
This love's on me  
I'm gonna love away your misery  
Soon you will see  
This love's on me  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
This love's on me  
I'm gonna love away your misery  
Now that you see  
This love's on me

The city's full of manger scenes  
And stores lit up in red and green.  
But down the road just out of town  
There's more magic to be found.  
The countryside is all a-glow  
With holly trees and mistletoe.  
And in them woods there lives a bear  
Known to all as Thistlehair. (not Thistlehear)  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
He comes around this time of year  
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer.  
The kids all love this shiny coat  
And the smell of honey on his nose.  
He tells them all about that star  
And everything that it stands for.  
The birthday we all celebrate  
Is still our favorite holiday  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
Wherever you find old Thistlebear  
There'll be music in the air.  
He dances 'round the Christmas tree  
Every single New Year's eve.  
Then he and all his furry friends  
GatherA 'Round the fire again  
Singin' 'Bout those Angels' wings  
Gifts of love that Christmas brings.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear (My song has all of this at end?)  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere...
