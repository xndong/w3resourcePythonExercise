Life, mama says  
Is bloodletting go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow  
Bloodletting go  
  
Society dictates  
By rules and regulations  
But when things are so tired  
You see things in the wrong light  
Soon there will be no light  
If the sun don't shine  
  
Life, mama says  
Is bloodletting go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow  
Bloodletting go  
  
If by chance we both forget  
The passage of space and time between  
Pick up the pieces cold and wet  
And drive them before the light to clean  
Good times, bad times  
Pain will come and pain will go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun don't shine  
  
And if by chance we both forget  
The passage of space and time between  
Pick up the pieces cold and wet  
And drive them before the light to clean  
Good times, bad times  
Pain will come and pain will go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun don't shine and the grass don't grow  
Bloodletting go

Break it down again.  
So those are my dreams  
and these are my eyes.  
Stand tall like a man.  
Headstrong like a horse.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of secrets.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
See for yourself, you have been sitting on a time bomb.  
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else,  
could show you something new about you and your inner song.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Break it down again.  
So those are my schemes  
and these are my plans.  
Hot tips for the boys.  
Fresh news from the force.  
When it's all mixed up,  
better break it down.  
Oo, oo. Oo, oo.  
In the world of silence.  
In the world of sound.  
Oo, oo.  
  
"No sleep for the dreaming" say the architects fo life.  
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice?  
They make no mention of the beauty of decay.  
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella, save it for a rainy day.  
  
And all the love, and all the love in the world  
won't stop the rain from falling,  
waste sleeping underground.  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down,  
Break it down again.  
  
Horsing around.  
Pray to the power.  
Play to the crowd  
with your big hit sound.  
And they won't simmer,  
won't simmer,  
won't simmer down.  
Play to the crowd.  
Play to the crowd.  
  
It's in the way you're always hiding from the light.  
Last off to heaven just like moses on a motorbike.  
No revolution maybe someone else somewhere else.  
Could show you something new to help with the ups and downs.  
  
Break it down again.  
I want to break it down.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
Break it down again.  
  
No more sleepy dreaming.  
No more building up.  
It is time to dissolve.  
Break it down again.  
No more sleepy dreaming.

Fill the sky with love  
Fill the sky with love  
  
I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep  
Wishful and ashen, slightly bedraggled  
Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon  
Roaming the forest, lupine and rabid  
  
Whoa is she wild?  
Does she see my inner child?  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
If only I was half my age and she was older  
We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island  
I though it's gravity that drags down my balloon  
She stays in orbit way after midnight  
  
Woah slip and slide  
Does she go all dewey-eyed?  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
She'll dress down for us  
She'll break new ground for us  
Watching me cracking up  
  
She'll hang round fellas  
With all the groundswellers  
Driving me like a truck  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
But then she knows it's like a curse  
To find our chosen roles reversed  
To unify my universe  
To call me mellow  
  
Fill the sky with love [Repeat: x3]

The coldest shoulder cast in metal  
Frozen to the bone  
To rely on hook, line and sinker  
What a sinker  
Sinking like a stone  
You'd be better off alone  
She saw me on the television underneath the sun  
Thought that I was warm like mother, lover, brother  
Brother, she was wrong  
Me, I don't long to belong  
Cold, been excommunicated ?cause I'm cold  
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold  
Bring to me my big old sweater  
Nothing more will make me better  
I met her on Monday and my heart did nothing new  
Seems she thought of me as some mystic, fatalistic, mystical guru  
Me, I haven't got a clue  
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth  
You can see the world like a Buddha, bread and Buddha  
Bigger than you hurt  
Don't you know that love is work  
Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold  
And Capricorn is rising yes I'm cold  
Listened to my old Nockles  
Hoped that it would warm the cockles  
You can't fight the fear you can't, this is the road you're on  
You don't belong to me you don't belong to any one  
Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare  
Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs  
When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead  
In the flood with my blood I can hold you  
Cold, been excommunicated ?cause I'm cold  
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold  
Bring to me my big old sweater  
Nothing more will make me better  
Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold  
There'll be no compromising, cold, cool, cold  
Stone cold  
Stone cold  
Cold  
Cold  
Cold  

Shame  
Dog shame  
I know what's wrong  
Man's too old and wise  
Bring in the dog  
Turn on  
Down the mountain rescue  
Slip and slide when sunny  
Small cat better move along  
Or this bitch could do harm, baby  
Straight as an arrow  
I'm walking the dog  
  
Three is a crowd  
Two is a dog and me playing  
(What's he saying)  
Free as a cloud  
No one ever really knew you  
Make clear your illusion no, no, no, no  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ you're coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
  
Word, speech, blurred, bleached  
Tell Mr Godot I'm walking the dog  
Walking the dog  
  
Some dreams you dream you alone  
You thank Christ you're coming home  
Better better give the dog a bone  
Go go go go chew chew chew chew  
Some dreams you dream alone  
Go get a life and ease the pain  
Dog's a best friend's dog  
Dog's a best friend's dog

This a religion  
No, this a drag  
That man over there is smoking sweet cigarettes  
Hey look at that fag !  
  
I had a dream  
I saw you swim  
Sink to your grave  
Down to Davy Jone's locker  
Under the waves  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths"  
  
Take me to your leader  
Take me for a ride  
The shutters were never open  
The day I used to hide  
All of the things  
I never knew  
I should have said  
When you looked like Frida Kahlo  
Curled up in bed  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths "  
Don't drink the water, baby  
Don't drink the water, baby  
  
So much emotion, these eyes a strange kind of blue  
Deep as the ocean, they named a sea after you  
Don't say " Thank God for simple truths "  
  
Don't drink the water, baby [Repeat: x4]

This race is already run  
Get off your horse, get on this train  
" Welcome to the real world "  
I said " Welcome to the real world "  
Are we rushing like the wind?  
Naked out and naked in  
" Welcome to the free world "  
I said " Welcome to the me world "  
Are we rushing like the wind?  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Did you lose your faith in God, no?  
Does your conscience always get you down?  
Fall to pieces, rough and tumble  
Does your conscience always get you down?  
These days it's all the mind  
It's Elemental  
Don't say your up when your down  
It's Elemental  
Put your lovin' arms around  
This your new year's resolution  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Nothing doing resolution  
Put your lovin' arms around  
Take another leap in the dark  
With a humble heart  
Do yourself some good  
What did you become?  
Patience, be sure  
Baby, baby  
These days it's all the mind  
It's Elemental  
Don't say your up when your down  
It's Elemental  

Tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
Wake up your time is nearly over  
No more the supernova  
No action guaranteed  
  
Wake up you've had an operation  
Ideals above your station  
Too much reality  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Wake up you're on your own agenda  
Give up the great pretender  
With baby eyes of green  
  
Wake up you're holding on to nothing  
You know you're only bluffing  
As dead as autumn leaves  
  
Think about the wasted time spending  
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending  
Everybody loves a happy ending  
  
Don't you just love a happy ending?  
Oh yeah well so do I  
And all your love will shine on everyone  
  
The darkness of the day  
A curse in every way  
You try to see the light  
But you don't know why  
Don't know why  
  
They tell you on the phone  
To give your God a bone  
And grow a set of wings like a butterfly  
  
The guardian at the gate  
Reminds you that you're late  
You try to take your time  
But you tow the line  
Tow the line  
  
To children of the world  
And daddy's little girl  
The grass is always green on the other side  
So stay and breathe new life  
  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up  
  
Wake up, wake up  
Everything is moving faster than you think  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Your pen is running out of ink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Fill up your bath and kitchen sink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
They're really kicking up a stink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You never found the missing link  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You should be happy in the pink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
You're in demand but out of sync  
(Wake up, wake up)  
A nod is as good as a wink  
(Wake up, wake up)  
Once more my dear friends to the brink  
  
All your love will shine on everyone

Welcome to your life, there's no turning back,  
Even while we sleep,  
We will find you acting on your best behavior  
Turn your back on mother nature  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
It's my own desire, it's my own remorse.  
Help me to decide.  
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
There's a room where the light won't find you  
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down  
When they do, I'll be right behind you  
So glad we've almost made it  
So sad they had to fade it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
I can't stand this indecision, married with a lack of vision  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it  
One headline, why believe it?  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
All for freedom and for pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world

Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Some of us are free  
Some are bound  
Some will swim  
Some will drown  
Some of us are saints  
Some are clowns  
Just like me they're falling down  
  
Well I lied to the nation  
While my reputation ran dry  
From my lungs to my liver  
I clung to the river bank's side  
Yeah well I'm back in the water  
Doing what I ought to  
Trying to lead an ordinary life  
  
Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Some of us are green  
Some are brown  
Some are lost  
Some are found  
Sight unseen baby  
Sound on sound  
Pray for me I'm falling down  
  
I was lost in the jungle  
Crossed over enemy lines  
Well I got me a red nose  
By sleeping under hedgerows at night  
Yeah well I tried levitation  
Flying in formation  
Heaven knows the weight of this crime  
  
Is this  
Is this world spinning round  
Has this ship run aground  
What's that shape  
What's that sound  
That's just me falling down  
  
Falling down  
Falling down

After the wash  
Before the fire  
I will decay  
Melt in your arms  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
A for a heart  
B for a brain  
Insects and grass  
Are all that remain  
When the light from above  
Burns a hole straight through our love  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more  
All our love and all our of pain  
Will be but a tune  
The Sun and the Moon  
The wind and the rain  
Hand in hand we'll do and die  
Listening to the band that made us cry  
We'll have nothing to lose  
We'll have nothing to gain  
Just to stay this real life situation  
For one last refrain  
As the day hits the night  
We will sit by candlelight  
We will laugh  
We will sing  
When the saints go marching in  
And we will carry war no more  

You always said you were the compassionate one  
But now you're laughing at the sun  
With all your high class friends you think you've got it made  
The only thing you made was that tanned look on your face  
With all your cigarettes and fancy cars  
You ain't a clue who or what you are  
You're dreaming your life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water  
We used to sit and talk about primal scream  
To exorcise our past was our adolescent dream  
But now it's sink or swim since your memory fails  
Now in Neptune's kitchen you will be food for killer whales  
And on the crucifix his mother made  
Hangs one more martyr to the hit parade  
You're dreaming you're life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water  
You're dreaming you're life away  
Fish out of water  
Go swim in the tide today  
Fish out of water  

Have a friend, calls me up  
Says hello, then hangs up  
He must have read my mind  
These are the days of a different paradigm  
Maybe once, even twice  
He said "God does not play dice"  
Yet if he's everywhere  
He's in casinos with aces to spare  
  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
  
Ours is not to reason why  
As we fall from way up high  
Into the water  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Even now, God's mistake  
Sets us up for one more heartbreak  
God you look mighty fine  
Dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime  
  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Never was so much at stake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake

Here on the stage  
The time has come  
With the strains of "Be my angels!?, of rock in two four  
Time may keep alive that old swang song  
That we've been playing forever  
Till the time maybe right to say goodbye  
My voice is aching, I'm tongue tired  
And the sounds we are making are so uninspired  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long  
Get some honesty  
Take the best of me and then the rest let go  
In every situation with it's tireless rage  
Step outside your cage and let the real fool show  
I should have stayed round to break the ice  
I thought about it once or twice  
But nothing ever changes unless there's some pain  
And our...  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long  

I wanted to be with you alone  
And talk about the weather  
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face  
Won't escape my attention  
You keep your distance with a system of touch  
And gentle persuasion.  
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much.  
Oh you're just wasting my time  
You're just wasting time.  
  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
I never find out till I'm head over heels  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart  
Don't don't throw it away  
  
I made a fire and watching it burn  
I thought of your future  
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last  
No no no have you no ambition  
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air  
And dreaming I'm a doctor  
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand  
Oh I feel so  
  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
I never find out till I'm head over heels  
Something happens and I'm head over heels  
Ah don't take my heart don't break my heart  
Don't don't throw it away  
  
And this is my four leaf clover  
I'm on the line one open mind  
This is my four leaf clover

I believe that when the hurting and the pain has gone  
We will be strong, Oh yes we will be strong  
And I believe that if I'm crying while I write these words  
Is it absurd? Or am I being real  
I believe that if you knew just what these tears were for  
They would just pour like every drop of rain  
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe  
I believe that if you thought for a moment, took your time  
You would not resign yourself to your fate  
And I believe that if it's written in the stars, that's fine  
I can't deny that I'm a Virgo too  
I believe that if your bristling while you hear this song  
I could be wrong or have I hit a nerve?  
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe  
I believe that maybe somewhere in the darkness  
In the nighttime, In the storm  
In the casino  
Casino Spanish eyes  
I believe, no I can't believe that every time you hear a new born scream  
You just can't see the shaping of a life  
The shaping of a life  

Don't cry for me my baby  
Don't say a word  
Everyone knows you're a dangerous bird  
  
Fly like a golden eagle  
Sleek like the snow  
Ticking your time bomb where ever you go  
  
You're sinking a line without a trace  
With elegant crimes against the state  
  
Killing with kindness yeah  
Making the most of the mess oh yeah  
You're mother and childless yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Bye cruel politician  
Now you've been caught  
Came from behind  
It's a dangerous spot  
  
Green are the seeds of envy  
Watch how they grow  
Everyone knows there's a fire down below  
  
You're sinking a line without a trace  
With elegant crimes against the state  
  
Killing with kindness yeah  
Making the most of the mess oh yeah  
You're mother and childless yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Killing with kindness  
Raising the ghost from the flesh oh yeah  
Don't blind them with science yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Turn your back  
And you might understand  
Become your destiny  
And you'll be a lucky man  
Don't let anything stand in your way

Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind  
  
Go get a volunteer  
We'll pay him well my dear  
He will see inside your mind  
Because he is that kind  
  
It's a southern kind of heat  
The shadows crack and start to creep  
Conversation drag its feet  
I wish we'd both been more discret  
Like light that it caught between night and day  
You're stuck between me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind  
  
Well they love you when you're weak  
Bet they hate you to see this winning streak  
It's that thing we call control  
There's a deep frustration  
Black thoughts  
That are stuck between someone's ears  
Like me and my big idea  
  
So many strings to your bow  
Why not let one go  
  
In a way this dream is over  
Blown away our four leaf clover  
  
There's no reason why  
There's just me and my  
  
Me and my big ideas  
Won't wash away your tears  
No one else seems to mind  
That I'm not that kind

There's only need  
I love your need  
So much I'm losing me  
I cannot see the reason for the Pain  
With hungry joy  
I'll be your toy  
Just hoping you will play  
Without hope my body starts to fail  
  
Memories fade but the scars still linger  
Goodbye my friend  
Will I ever love again  
Memories fade but the scars still linger  
  
I cannot grow  
I cannot move  
I cannot fell my age  
The vice like grip of tension holds me fast  
Engulfed by you  
What can I do  
When History's my cage  
Look foward to a future in the past  
  
The more I talk  
The more I say  
The less you seem to hear  
I'm speechless in a most peculiar way  
Your mind is weak  
Your need is great  
And nothing is too dear  
For you to use to take the Pain away  
Memories Fade  
No don't pretend you can justify the end  
Memories fade but the scars still linger

My features form with a change in the weather  
Weekend  
We can work it out  
My features form with a change in the weather  
Weekend  
We can work it out  
When the wind blows  
When the mothers talk  
When the wind blows  
When the wind blows  
When the mothers talk  
When the wind blows  
We can work it out  
It's not that you're not good enough  
It's just that we can make you better  
Given that you pay the price  
We can keep you young and tender  
Following in the footsteps of a funeral pyre  
You were paid not listen now your house is on fire  
Wake me up when things get started  
When everything starts to happen  
My features form with a change in the weather  
Some of us horrified  
Others never talk about it  
But when the weather starts to burn  
Then you'll know that you're in trouble  
Following in the footsteps of a soldier girl  
It is time to put your clothes on and to face the world  
Don't you feel your luck is changing  
When everything starts to happen  
Put your head right next to my heart  
The beat of the drum is the fear of the dark  
My features form with a change in the weather  

Time will swallow  
Your precious time  
Like magic create the future  
What makes man so fickle?  
Who put the daggers in those eyes?  
Was it to learn  
Through dark days of struggle?  
Was it to burn  
To burst all our bubbles?  
Thunder and rain  
Well the cynical flame will it heat, stick and blister?  
Thunder and rain  
Evangelistic brother  
Should be banging a tambourine  
Go wash your hands and fingers  
Till your mind is clean  
Was it your fate  
To sleep like a normal?  
Time and decay  
No man is immortal  
Thunder and rain  
Boredom and pain lit the cynical flame  
Will it heat stick and blister?  
Thunder and rain  
Still try to resist the pessimist  
The pessimist no no  
And these things I find  
In the back of my mind  
Where time lasts forever  
I get all mixed  
Think I'm all mankind  
Listen Mr Pessimister  
With your Catholic taste  
Oh listen Mr Pessimister Pessimister  
We do not relate  
Listen Mr Pessimister, Pessimister, Pessimister  
Mr Pessimister  

My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
I used to call it  
Are you still precious  
Love for your mother  
Wine on the carpet  
All in the breaks of dawn  
You'll find the widest while you came  
That let the dress...'  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
Love me like a child, no one tells me why.  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
  
Whoah, thank you for the help but  
Well, the high road is the low road!  
Tell me what do you think this is  
Who know better all of a talk  
...  
... or the crow  
Will you hold me, will you shake me  
Will you think you're all alone'  
Well you don't look for your health in the color of your skin'  
I open up let the darkness come in'  
  
My life, my life in the suicide ranks  
My life, my!, .. ooh!  
  
... the suffering!

Baby your deal is surreal just like lightning, streakin' on  
Heaven still is a state of mind, where did we go wrong?  
What happen to those old convictions  
Went up in smoke  
Baby, while your back breaks slowly  
By the skin of your teeth  
You'll be under their thumb  
Moving from this state of friction  
We all got stars in our eyes  
But you know by now your one restriction  
Is at the edge of the sky  
Keep shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
'Cause baby we're alive  
New star  
Shadows are still when the will  
Has no strength left to carry on  
You're flat on you back with your heart attack  
Where the hell have you gone?  
The pressure and pain, all the fire and ice  
When you're playing a game, with the rats and the mice  
While your back breaks slowly  
By the skin of your teeth  
You'll be under their thumb  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
'Cause baby we're alive  
New star  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
'Cause baby we're alive  
New star  
Dreaming so clever in all kinds of weather  
Where did you mention that you buried your treasure  
After the pleasure of givin' is gone  
You'll be as one under the same sun  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
Shining like a new star  
New star  
Shining like a new star  
Baby we better start  
'Cause baby we're alive  
New star  
'Cause baby we're alive  

Goodbye desperado  
If they hadn't sucked out all the poison  
From your veins you'd be dead by now  
Too late frida kahlo  
You could have the power of the phoenix  
And the flame if you knew just how  
  
Come the hour  
Come the mantra  
Repeat in defeat with the pots and the pans  
Walk away  
Walk on water  
They're young then they're old then they don't give a damn  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Sleepless situation  
Shaken by the clatter of the clinking  
On the bars of your private jail  
Twisted ultimatum  
Searching for a lifeline or a band aid  
For your sins in the morning mail  
  
Tow the line  
Floating islands  
They're here and they're now but they're oceans away  
Tie them down  
Baby lions  
You'll bleed and you'll plead and you'll beg them to stay  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Don't be afraid now  
Your cover is blown  
Don't shed a tear now  
Your babies are grown

Last years rivals share their blood  
Sailor sworn to secrecy  
Ride the waves and stem the flood  
The tides of endless enmity  
Power now is all the rage  
Sons and daughters of the gun  
Hungry babies come of age  
Phasers switched and set to stun  
Power now, power how, power wow!  
Here's power  
If you're seeking power . . .  
Doctor held you tight and torn  
Boy he was a lucky man  
Out of you the future born  
Slight of foot and sight of hand  
Douse the candle, dim the light  
Focus not on fire or flame  
Don't believe that might is right  
Your soul can turn you just the same  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power  
If you take my breath away  
The whole damn thing will turn and return  
Redefined, rearranged, rearranged  
And till my dying the day  
I guess I'll have to burn just to learn  
This the time, this the place  
To show a human face  
Dressed to kill we guessed you might  
Friend or foe or family  
We'll sacrifice the Virgin white  
Her death will be the life of me  
Power now is all the rage  
Don't excuse it use it well  
Keep the lion in his cage  
Free from hunger, free from hell  
Power now, power how, power wow !  
If you're seeking power - here's power!  

Time seems a crazy thing  
Now that your heart can sing  
Like a child  
I know the stars tonight  
Carry a guiding light  
Still so proud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
  
Driving through driving rain  
Just me and johnny jane  
We're okay  
We're just pullin' a cloud  
  
There's a story in the lines of your face  
Never now but not afraid  
With the magic of your smile  
You make me humble  
  
Baby be wise  
Stay by my side  
Still so proud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud  
Pushin' or pullin' a cloud

It's always the quiet ones  
Who are stranger than fiction  
They hide under tables like a child  
  
What kind of chemistry is it?  
Leaden or golden?  
Nobody sees them driving us wild  
  
It's your life  
Don't just collide with the waves  
  
Oh look into her eyes  
You'll see such silent calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Wake up your majesty there are  
Thieves in the temple  
Picking the sunspots out of the sun  
  
Looking for symmetry in man  
Another dead Beetle  
Down through the path we see how they run  
  
It's your life  
Don't just collide with the ways  
  
Oh look into her eyes  
You'll see such silent calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Oh so many reasons why  
You hear the silence calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Oh salvation shine a light on a different world  
And carry out thoughts on golden rays

Did you know your father was an island  
Did you know your mother was the sea  
Can we ever hope to seek asylum  
From the bounds of fate and family

Last train to Norwich  
Summer days that blind your face will soon be dead and gone  
Better get it on  
Tuned to a day the babe against the world  
You took the best seat rather risk it when the chips were down  
Better make it long.  
Schrodinger's cat is dead to the world.  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark.  
You criticize the play and isolate the box.  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart.  
Just as the breeze with speed and build, you sat upon the fence,  
Clucking like a chicken making perfect sense.  
  
Pass that gun, hand me that knife,  
Man's little monster has been brought back to life.  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark.  
You criticize the flow and isolate the box.  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart.  
I always knew you were.  
  
Last train to Norwich  
Schrodinger's cat is dead to the world.  
Last train to Norwich

You look different every time  
You come from the foam - crested brine  
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight  
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale  
Am I yours? are you mine to play with?  
  
Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific  
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night  
You're quite alright  
But I can't understand the different you  
In the morning  
When it's time to play at being human for a while  
We smile, we smile, we smile  
  
You'll be different in the spring, I know  
You're a seasonal beast  
Like the Starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide  
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon  
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own  
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own  
My very own  
We're not alone

This is a garden  
This is a steeple  
I hear the crowd  
Before I ever  
See the people  
Yours for the asking  
And for the taking  
There is a power  
In the vacuum  
We are making  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
And when we're crossed  
We can say that we're lost  
In the middle of nowhere  
Think you'll like it a lot  
And if we're wrong  
And we end up alone  
We'll light a candle  
For their innocent bones  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
And when we're crossed  
We can say that we're lost  
In the middle of nowhere  
Think you'll like it a lot  
And if we're wrong  
And we end up alone  
We'll light a candle  
For their innocent bones  
  
You and I have a secret world  
And we can keep it unfurled  
And pay no attention  
To the cradle or the grave  
  
And when we're crossed  
We can say that we're lost  
In the middle of nowhere  
Think you'll like it a lot  
And if we're wrong  
And we end up alone  
We'll light a candle  
For their innocent bones

It seems we caused a forest fire  
With just a flicker of a flame  
And now I set alight to everything  
Now all I do is cause you pain  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
I used to think the time would come  
When man would rise above the beast  
I gave up thinking that way long ago  
In conversation with a priest  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child  
  
We could have heal this blindness  
With some human kindness  
I know secrets kill you  
But my love can fill you  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
  
It would be so fine  
If you could be mine  
  
I won't keep secrets alive  
I'll send them all out to space  
Without the will to survive  
They won't be going no place  
  
Oh my angel  
Woman child

[Chorus: x2]  
Shout, shout, let it all out  
These are the things I can do without  
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on  
  
In violent times  
You shouldn't have to sell your soul  
In black and white  
They really really ought to know  
Those one track minds  
That took you for a working boy  
Kiss them goodbye  
You shouldn't have to jump for joy  
You shouldn't have to shout for joy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They gave you life  
And in return you gave them hell  
As cold as ice  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
I hope we live to tell the tale  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
And when you've taken down your guard  
If I could change your mind  
I'd really love to break your heart  
I'd really love to break your heart  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Bathe in another man's grave  
In time we'll follow  
Save all your thoughts for these days  
Don't steal, just borrow  
Well, a high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
Pain, I can understand pain  
Sometimes you just swallow  
Say we can make it okay  
Don't steal, just borrow  
Well, the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
Well, the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire, high wire, high wire  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow?  
High wire, high wire, high wire  

Daylight saved  
Daylight saved  
To spite the dark  
In spite of the darkness  
There I'll crave  
There I'll crave  
To get to the heart  
In spite of the darkness  
  
Great wide stretches of canvas  
Signed by a godless name  
Strange bright colors of madness  
Only a fool would frame  
Sketches of pain  
Sketches of pain  
Sketches of pain  
  
Some cry shame  
Some cry shame  
We tore them apart  
We failed to imagine  
God might claim  
God might claim  
The works of art  
We failed to imagine  
  
Great wide stretches of canvas  
Signed by a godless name  
Strange bright colors of madness  
Only a fool would frame  
Sketches of pain [Repeat: x6]

What's the matter with your life  
Did someone come and shoot your with wife  
Just as you planned  
Will you live or will you die  
Are you that butterfly  
That never lands  
Set aside these vacant rules  
Break them now and don't get fooled again  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face  
  
When you look into these eyes  
Do you see civilized  
Or son of Sam  
Will you love or do you hate  
Why do you hesitate yeah  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face  
  
Time is an arrow  
You are the bow  
Shoot it now to seal your own fate  
Get a life, get a love, get a new big idea  
  
What's the matter with your life  
Did someone come and shoot your with wife  
Just as you planned  
Will you live or will you die  
Are you that butterfly  
  
Sorry  
How many times must I say  
Life is not a cake to separate  
What do I have to do  
To save you from worry  
Cut off my nose  
To spite my face

High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man,  
and the love train rides from coast to coast.  
D.J.'s the man we love the most.  
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean and smash every hope of democracy as  
the head line says you're free to choose  
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes.  
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah, yeah.  
  
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds.  
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds.  
  
I spy tears in their eyes they look to the skies  
for some kind of divine intervention.  
Food goes to waste!  
So nice to eat, so nice to taste.  
Politician granny with your high ideals  
have you no idea how the majority feels?  
So with out love and a promised land,  
we're fools to the rules of a government plan.  
Kick out the Style!  
Bring back the Jam! yeah, yeah.  
  
And anything is possible when you're sowing the seeds of love.  
Anything is possible sowing the seeds of love.  
sowing the seeds, the birds and the bees, my girlfriend and me in love.  
Feel the pain, talk about it if you're a worried man, then shout about it.  
  
Open hearts fell about it. Open minds think about it.  
Everyone read about it. Every one scream about it everyone.  
Everyone read about it, read about it, read it in the books,  
in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read.  
  
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds.  
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds.  
Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds,  
sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds of love.  
Mister England sowing the seeds of love.  
  
Time to eat all your words, swallow your pride, open your eyes.  
High time we made a stand and shook up the view of the common man.  
And the love train rides from coast to coast, every minute of every hour.  
"I Love a Sunflower," and I believe in love power, Love Power, Love Power!!!!  
  
Sowing the seeds An end to need, And the Politics of Greed With Love.  

Man, I never slept so hard  
I never dreamt so well  
Dreaming, I was safe in life  
Like mussels in a shells  
Rolling and controlling all the basements and the backroads of our lives  
Fill their dreams with big fast cars  
Fill their heads with sand  
Holy white we'll paint the town  
The color of our flag  
Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man ?  
Standing on the corner of the third world  
Hungry men will close their minds  
Ideas are not their food  
Notions fall on stony ground  
Where passions are subdued  
Color all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side  
Standing on the corner of the third world  
When we gonna learn?  
Who we gonna turn to?  
The promises they make  
The call for attention  
Compassion is the fashion  
Free to earn, our pockets burn  
We buy for love  
Die for love  
Hold me I'm crying  
Hold me I'm dying  

Scratch the ice  
Let the telephone ring  
Sense of time is a powerful thing  
And we love to laugh  
Love to cry  
Half alive  
We love to  
Go slow when we're dancing for rain  
Dry skin flakes where there's ice in the vein  
And we love to cry  
Half alive  
  
Is this the start of the breakdown?  
  
Scratch the earth  
Dig the burial ground  
Sense of time won't be easily found  
And ten out of ten  
For the ones who defend  
Pretend too  
Breakdown is a final demand  
(We stand firm with our heads in our hands)  
As we love to to cry  
Half alive  
  
Is this the start of the breakdown?  
I can't understand you  
Is this the start of the breakdown?

It's a sad affair  
When there's no one there  
He calls out in the night  
And it's so unfair  
At least it seems that way  
When you gave him his life  
  
And all this time he's been getting you down  
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around  
And convince him  
Just talk to him  
'cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon  
He's an only child in an only room  
And he's dependent on you  
  
And it seems so strange  
That at the end of the day  
Making love can be so good  
But the Pain of birth  
What is it worth  
When it don't turn out the way it should

A waking world of innocence  
So grave those first born cries  
When life begins with needles and pins  
It ends with Swords and Knives  
Oh dangerman, oh dangerman  
Your blade fits like a glove  
When forged in steel  
Time cannot heal  
That blood red bond of love  
In times of trouble you're an open book  
With the change in the way you look  
And its sad love's not enough to make things better  
Turn the tables, we'll burn the fables  
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams  
Fooled by now, we mystify the past  
Like a dream, like it never happened  
When life begins with needles and pins  
It ends with Swords and Knives  
God save those born to die  

Is it an horrific dream  
Am I sinking fast  
Could a person be so mean  
As to laugh and laugh  
On my own  
Could you ease my load  
Could you see my Pain  
Could you please explain  
The Hurting  
  
Could you understand a child  
When he cries in Pain  
Could you give him all he needs  
Or do you feel the same  
All along  
You've been told you're wrong  
When you felt it right  
And you're left to fight  
The hurting  
  
Get in line with the things you know  
Feel the Pain  
Feel the sorrow  
Touch the hurt and don't let go  
Get in line with the things you know  
Learn to cry  
Like a baby  
Then the hurting won't come back

Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
These fingers aren't my fingers  
These hands are not my hands  
No one sees and no one cares What gets broken  
Not for rhyme and not for reason  
What gets broken  
What gets broken  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
In the river my machinery  
Slows to a heartbeat  
Echoing ghost just laid by  
Those who whistle while they work  
Out of time and out of season  
What gets broken  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are

These things  
That I've  
Been told  
Can rearrange  
My world  
My doubt  
In time  
But inside out  
This is the working hour  
We are paid by those who learn by our mistake  
This day  
And age  
For all  
And not for one  
All lies  
And secrets  
Put on  
Put on and on  
This is the working hour  
We are paid by those who learn by our mistake  
And fear is such a vicious thing  
It wraps me up in chains  
Find out  
Find out  
What this fear is about  
Find out  
Find out  
What this fear is about  

Heaven comes to he who waits  
But I know I'm getting nowhere  
And all the deeds of yesterday  
Have really helped to pave my way  
Though there's no one near me now  
How come everyone can touch me  
You see the torture on my brow  
Relates to neither here nor now  
  
Watch me bleed  
Bleed forever  
Although my face is straight, it lies  
My body feels the pain and cries  
  
Here the table is not bare  
I am full but feeling empty  
For all the warmth it feels so cold  
For one so young I feel so old  
  
Watch me bleed  
Bleed forever  
It's not allowed to be unkind  
But still the hate lives in my mind  
  
I'll make no noise  
I'll hide my pain  
I'll close my eyes  
I won't complain  
I'll lie right back and take the blame  
And try to tell myself I'm living  
And when it's all been said or done  
Where do I go?  
Where do I run?  
What's left of me or anyone when we've denied the hurting?

What ya gonna choose the poison or the lines  
Lived with crazy pain in all your life  
Something in your mind just tells you no  
Hope in conversation starts to flow  
  
Stuck inside a wheel, inside a wheel  
Wondering everyday is it all for real  
Blinking every time a cold wind blow  
Our love don't fill a mile in rose  
  
Danger remains  
Wat ya gonna do when the old man reads you dry  
Step down from the plane and pluck the eye  
Slide in deeper closer to the bone  
Don't you just wish your heart was made of stone?  
  
Waxing like an old crack 45  
Counting out the ways you could stay alive  
Placing all the banks and feel the stones  
My love won't leave her ways of foam  
  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
  
Who killed tangerine?  
The prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Who killed tangerine?  
  
Who killed tangerine?  
The prettiest girl I've ever seen  
Who killed tangerine?  
  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over  
And when you think it's all over  
It's not over, it's not over

Someone's drinking all alone  
Someone's left the TV on  
I don't suppose  
No I don't suppose  
  
Someone's sleeping in my bed  
Someone's let the genie in  
I don't suppose  
No I don't suppose  
  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today  
  
Baby's gone and died again  
Taken by the tide again  
And it's no surprise  
She hates goodbyes  
  
Someone's folding paper planes  
Someone's on the line again  
Someone's crying at the sonnet  
Someone's hiding from someone  
  
I don't suppose, no I don't suppose  
You know who you are  
Who you are  
Who you are today

You better love loving and you better behave  
You better love loving and you better behave  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Calls her man the Great White Hope  
Says she's fine, she'll always cope  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Well I feel lying and waiting is a poor man's deal  
And I feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel  
It's a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
Trades her soul as skin and bones  
Sells the only thing she owns  
Woman in Chains  
Woman in Chains  
Men of Stone  
Men of Stone  
Well I feel deep in your heart there are wounds Time can't heals  
And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe  
Well you know what I mean  
It's a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
It's under my skin but out of my hands  
I'll tear it apart but I won't understand  
I will not accept the Greatness of Man  
It's a world gone crazy  
Keeps Woman in Chains  
So Free Her  
So Free Her  

Hallelujah, the king is dead. He said  
"Love was the knife "  
And now he'll dream some magic queen might try and save his life  
They say his famous final words  
Came from the heart of the man  
He made his bed on love denied  
He played Jeckyll and Hyde till the day he died  
Too late for the young gun  
To lead a simple life  
Too late for the young gun  
This is the year of the knife  
See the mountains crumble  
Feel the fire go cold  
Summer will turn to winter  
Love will turn to stone  
They say his famous final words  
Came from the heart of man  
I made his bed on love denied  
Now I ain't gonna sleep tonight  
Too late for the young gun  
To lead a simple life  
Too late for the young gun  
This is the year of the knife
