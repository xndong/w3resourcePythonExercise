All I feel is pain it seems today  
A dark angel leads me to evil far beyond the grave  
Declares me a phantom demon I don't know  
It just cannot be defied  
At Hell this reflection stares at me  
And then I lose my mind  
It betrays me  
  
Oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, If looks could kill then death would be my name  
Oh oh oh oh, In hell I'll burn in flames  
Oh oh oh oh, So come inside the fires feel  
  
Angel of Death is bloodied now  
He's the one inside  
Tortured, scored that strike  
Against the fear, it feeds the fire  
Near me now, the demon's son  
Bruiser I'm the one  
Erase my soul for all your sins can never be undone  
I can't contain it

It's such a steep climb up the mountains south side  
It has a cloud that acts in such peculiar ways  
Accident count rising, a young girl prophesizing  
To protect their race they'll seize her mind  
  
At this altitude it's freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell who's seen the crawling eye?  
At this altitude it's freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell who's seen the crawling eye?  
  
These evil demon eyes, under cloud cover hide  
They have great tentacles to tear apart their prey  
All these men are dying, crawling eye decapitizing  
Fiends without a face attack mankind  
  
At this altitude it's freezing  
Aliens control human beings  
No one has lived to tell who's seen the crawling eye?

When confrontation comes down to the wire  
I'll use my cyclotrode and commence the fire  
  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
You're never gonna get me  
  
Being followed, I get quick to the chase  
I take my cyclotrode right out of the case  
Atomic force electrocutes your motor  
Leaving dead in flames I always escape  
  
You're never gonna get me

Oh, Rah  
  
Father almighty turn the darkness to day  
Father providing turning desert to grain  
God's son the pharaoh speaks to Rah calling his name  
Oh rah, devour those who dare open my grave  
Place a curse in his hand  
  
The mummy's hand  
The mummy's hand  
  
My tomb so mighty scorns the world as time slips away  
Thieves hunt for bounty through the stone they search for a way  
Treasure inviting to my lair where hell awaits  
Rotting this body steals the souls of those who betray  
Place your curse in his hand  
  
The mummy's hand

It seems like only yesterday  
I embraced the eternal flame  
I wanna know if I am, I am only ashes  
If the sun should shine on me  
  
I wanna taste  
What your life has to offer  
The longing, the lonely  
At Collinwood, at Collinwood  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
See the full moon rise  
Casting its dark shadows  
The beast will feed tonight  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
As the pale moon rose  
Casting its dark shadows  
For whom the bell will toll

Whoa oh, "Here comes the dead"  
  
Open graves, ghouls a plenty  
Zombie army machine is ready

There was life here once  
The tension, the harshness of life  
Lost in the flow of time  
Now comes crumbling down  
The land will be covered in darkness  
Premonitions of sorrow and anger, even so  
  
Things rush on, fleeing, changing  
Never facing it straight on  
To all things under creation  
Never facing it straight on  
  
Well I know  
(Whoa) Day the Earth caught on fire  
  
People wander aimlessly  
The great spring of life runs dry  
Come face to face with a world of darkness  
Now comes crumbling down  
The land will be covered in darkness  
Premonitions of sorrow and anger, even so  
  
Things rush on, fleeing, changing  
Never facing it straight on  
To all things under creation  
Never facing it straight on  
  
Well I know  
(Whoa) Day the Earth caught on fire

Turn the lights down low  
And close the door, oh  
Future is coming  
Future rising up  
  
Whoa  
Shotgun blast, a demon piece of lead  
With both eyes open  
I wait up for the kill  
Feel the evil  
Feel the heat as I blast you open  
  
Death comes ripping  
And it's going, death comes ripping  
You feel the heat as death comes ripping  
Rip your back out  
And death comes ripping out  
  
Flesh and blood  
Too weak for you  
Turning it over  
A little too late to penetrate  
  
Death comes ripping  
And it's going, death comes ripping  
You feel the heat as death comes ripping  
Rip your back out  
Death comes ripping  
  
And it's going, death comes ripping  
You feel the heat as death comes ripping  
Rip your back out  
Death comes ripping

Within your eyes  
I can see the death ray  
Within your mind  
  
I can't take another stare from you

Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania  
My father was a wolf  
Demonomania, Demonomania, Demonomania  
My mother was a whore  
You check and see

Humans are weak

Torn from the heavens, they fall from the sky  
And walk the streets among mortal men  
They hide in shadows,  
Keepers of the night  
  
Mortal life is weak,  
Can't hold back the demons  
The blood pours as rain  
And soon you'll be alone  
  
Descending angel  
Stand by my side  
We'll face the night  
Descending angel  
  
We guard the gates of hell just one more night  
For in the morning will bring the light  
  
Born and created in the image of a god  
The heavens fall no savior has been sent  
No one to guide us,  
Alone we face the night  
  
Mortal life is brief for the rebel angels  
They make their final stand  
  
And soon you'll be alone  
Descending angel  
Stand by my side  
And face the night  
  
Descending angel  
We'll guard the gates of hell just one more night  
Forever ends tonight!

Once upon a long time ago  
In the home of the big maker  
And some often die, and some as he tried  
To sell his soul ever after  
  
I have the power  
You have the nerve  
You will be mine, I request your service  
A flash of his crown and the spread of his wings  
  
I hold the power the devil has seen  
Inside the blood of the dying light by the silence  
Is the soul of your born, like I promised it is torn  
Pull the strings and hear my laughter  
  
No use in trying, the damage is done  
What have I done to my beautiful son?  
The deal has been ceased, sucked inward to hell  
I keep locked these secrets so no one can tell  
  
Once upon a long time ago  
The evil!  
Awaken and find your looking through the eyes of a man-made evil monster  
  
Devil Doll!  
Devil Doll!  
Evil be thy master!  
  
Devil Doll!  
Devil Doll!  
Evil be thy master!  
  
No use in trying, the damage is done  
What have I done, oh, my beautiful son  
  
The deal has bead sealed, sucked inward to hell  
I keep locked these secrets so no one can tell  
Awake and you'll find that you're looking through the eyes  
Of a man-made evil monster  
  
Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master  
Ooh oh oh The man has evil monsters  
Ooh oh oh Evil be thy master

So make this demon offering  
Best demon offering  
Curious about the eye of death, oh

Into lots of people  
Curious about the eye of death, oh

Anything is what she is  
Anywhere is where she's from  
Anything is what she'll be  
Anything as long as it's mine  
And the door, it opens, is the way back in  
Or is it the way back out  
  
Anyplace is where she'll be  
Anyplace, she'll see you from  
Lies and secrets become your world  
Any time, anywhere, she takes me away  
And death climbs up the steps one by one  
To give you the rose  
That's been burnt by her son  
  
Point me to the sky above  
I can get there on my own  
Walk me to the graveyard  
Dig up her bones  
  
I have seen the demon's face  
I have heard of her death place  
I fall down on my knees in praise of the  
Horrible things that took her away  
And death climbs up the steps one by one  
To give you the rose  
That's been burnt by her son  
  
Point me to the sky above  
I can get there on my own  
Walk me to the graveyard  
Dig up her bones

Enduring throughout the ages  
The transmitter lies  
Once the chambers open the signal will be sent  
To another world... far beyond the stars

See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
The fever rots  
The brain goes numb inside  
I feel the blackout coming  
A boiled blister pops inside  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razor-sharp precision  
Mouths that mouth the sweetness  
Dank of final breath upon my chest  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
We lasted all night  
The dogs keep up and snickering  
Just stay with me one moment  
Then I'll go away  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razor-sharp precision  
I'll burn in hell  
Before I plunge into life's darkness  
Darkness  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
A fiend without a face

If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs  
Would you still love me anyway?  
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed  
Would you still love me anyway?  
Why don't you love me anyway?  
  
Cutting with the knife, blood is spilling everywhere  
She will be my wife  
Secondary spine  
Incisions must be accurate  
I know just what to do  
My hands are trembling  
I can't spare to slip up with this knife  
  
Her beauty so illogical  
The beast come gliding in  
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin  
Dance to the burning flame  
Pleasure exhumes the pain  
The night bursts into flame  
Dance Helena... Dance  
  
If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs  
Would you still love me anyway?  
There's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be  
And I close the door on my fantasies  
Why don't you love me anyway

Check into horror hotel  
This place is creepy and it's somber too  
And a little vampira wrapped on my neck, said  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me  
  
Well, take it up to room 21  
Where all the creatures gonna have their fun  
And underworld dangers and underworld scum  
Take it up to room 21  
  
And down the hall with my vampire girlfriend  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me, here at  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me  
  
Gather round the place of the demon whore  
And my girl in room 21  
Well, underworld dangers and underworld scum  
Take it up to room 21  
  
Down the hall with my vampire girlfriend  
Say something, say something  
You want to start something with me here at  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me when it comes down to necking with girls  
  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
Horror hotel, horror hotel  
It's up to me

Upon this threshold of disaster  
The birth of the eleventh plague  
The fires burn at night I begin to doubt the smell of burning flesh will ever
fade away  
  
The touch of death is all around us  
A thousand corpses block our way  
A man-made germ makes almost everyone commit suicide just to rise and eat
their dead  
Night of the living dead  
  
We're hunting humans, whaooo-ooo  
We're hunting humans, whaooo-ooo  
We're hunting humans , whaooo-oo  
We're hunting humans  
It's killing time every day  
  
I can't control this eerie feeling  
An evil screaming in my head  
I don't think I'll last the night  
There is no cure for this genocide or resurrection of the dead  
Night of the living dead  
  
We're hunting humans, whaooo-ooo  
We're hunting humans, whaooo-ooo  
We're hunting humans , whaooo-oo  
We're hunting humans  
It's killing time every day

If you're gonna scream, scream with me  
Moments like this never last  
When do creatures rape your face  
Hybrids opened up the door  
  
Ooh baby when you cry  
Your face is momentary  
You hide your looks behind these scars  
  
In hybrid moments  
Give me a moment  
  
Give me a moment  
Give me a moment  
  
Ooh baby when you cry  
Your face is momentary  
You hide your looks behind these scars  
  
In hybrid moments  
In hybrid moments  
  
In hybrid moments  
In hybrid moments  
  
Give me a moment  
Give me a moment

Light  
In the doorway  
Shining so bright  
In the doorway  
I clench your hips  
For the flesh  
You tore my prose  
  
In the doorway  
Animal lie  
Like the doorway  
As you hide  
Hear it then  
Will you let me in  
  
Let me in  
Oh  
  
In the doorway  
We were so young  
In the doorway  
Release the black dogs  
On our breasts  
We'll never rest  
  
We'll never rest  
We'll never forget  
I ain't never gonna let you rest  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  

People see us everywhere  
They think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive  
I know it's only make believe  
  
My one and only prayer  
Is that some day you'll care  
My hopes, my dreams come true  
My one and only you  
No one will ever know  
How much I love you so  
My only prayer will be  
Someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe.  
  
My hopes, my dreams come true  
My life I'll give for you  
My heart, a wedding ring  
My all, my everything  
My heart I can't control  
You rule my very soul  
My only prayer will be  
Someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe  
  
My one and only prayer  
Is that some day you'll care  
My hopes, my dreams come true  
My one and only you  
No one will ever know  
How much I love you so  
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes  
You are my every dream  
But it's only make believe

A fortress in the sky  
What's left of life it holds  
We live on borrowed time  
  
Along a glowing moonlit pier  
Their armies still advance  
From the murky depths they rise  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
(Walk the earth)  
Land of the dead  
  
Massive flames arise  
They burn out of control  
In the slums it's genocide  
  
Evolved they find a way inside  
Those who could escape  
Had no chance to survive  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
(Walk the earth)  
Land of the dead  
  
Tonight, tonight  
Zombies walk  
Land of the dead  
The dead

I got something to say  
I killed your baby today  
And it doesn't matter much to me  
As long as it's dead  
  
Well I got something to say  
I raped your mother today  
And it doesn't matter much to me  
As long as she spread  
  
Sweet lovely death  
I am waiting for your breath  
Come sweet death, one last caress  
  
Go, sweet lovely death  
I am waiting for your breath  
Come sweet death, one last caress

A very old friend came by today  
Cause he was telling everyone in town  
Of the love that he just found  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
  
He talked and talked and I heard him say  
That she had the longest blackest hair  
The prettiest green eyes anywhere  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
  
Though I smiled the tears inside were burning  
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye  
He was gone but still his words kept returning  
What else was there for me to do but cry  
  
Would you believe that yesterday  
This girl was in my arms and swore to me  
She'd be mine eternally  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known  
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows  
Out on the street, danger's real, the killer's still at large  
A trail of death through sewers to the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
This town has worn thin everybody knows  
Panic in the news and the terror grows  
A tunnel full of filth escape into the night  
Another hole to dwell in the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on

Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on

They called us walking corpses  
Unholy living dead  
They had to lock us up  
Put us in their British hell  
  
Make sure your face is clean now  
Can't have no dirty dead  
All the corpses here are clean, boy  
All the Yanks in British hell  
  
I don't want to be here in your London Dungeon  
I don't want to be here in your British hell  
Ain't no mystery why I'm in misery in Hell  
Here's hoping you're swell

Go!  
  
Of all the things they taught you I'm telling you this son  
All the wars fought before won't compare to this one  
Giant spiders prepare to take over  
  
Here comes another mutant suicide-squad  
You blast them out but now you're way off course  
You start to shiver and shake  
I'm calling you Houston  
  
Am I following all the right leads?  
or am I about to get lost in space?  
When my time comes they'll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride?  
  
Communication's lost we crash to the earth  
Too late to see the giant spider monster giving birth  
The future is here and here is the future  
  
Am I following all the right leads?  
or am I about to get lost in space?  
When my time comes they'll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride with me?

(Oh) We're cursed from a time so long ago  
This my son, you should know  
The quakes we've been having at night  
Is the birth of the Mega-Mites  
Centennial breeding in the midnight sun  
Caused by a war, never won  
Mistakes of a man in the past  
Results of a nuclear blast  
  
Man versus man, land against land  
Life blew apart from greed in their hearts  
  
Every hundred years they're born again  
Feeding on women, children and men  
The day of the coming is tonight  
The year of the Mega-Mite  
The live tonight, but they'll die tomorrow  
One days suffering, pain and sorrow  
The only safe place is the sea  
Just a legend of history  
  
Man verses Mite, winless fight  
Wars begun, we pray for the sun  
  
Do you feel the march of the Mega-Mites  
Crashing down cities in the distant night  
Feel the ground rumbling beneath your feet  
The march is on, now you see them start to eat  
Prepare the men for the ride, it is time to fight  
Unholy war, human race versus Mega-Mite  
Our only way to the sea, man's victory  
We mustn't fear, we must charge, it's our destiny  
  
Cursed from the start, we ride to their heart  
Fight or be damned, maybe our last stand  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
With hope in our eyes, we're eaten like flies  
The menacing monsters arrive  
Killing us all, we must stand tall  
Fighting just to say alive  
Must survive, cannot hide  
  
So we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Yeah, we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
Ride in the night, fight for your life  
Charging the mighty beasts  
Death is at hand, life is a stand  
Mega-Mites enjoying a feast, retreat  
  
So we ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
Ride, ride, ride  
Don't you know it's all we can do  
  
The war is lost, our lives it cost  
Humans head for the sea  
The Mites have won, until the sun  
Rises up over the east, no more feast, for the beasts have deceased  
  
Now my son you know of the Mega-Mites  
100 years they'll be back to live at night  
Tell your son to pass on the holy word  
Or human life will be gone, it must be heard  
Man is not the only one to rule the earth  
Like he was in the past from the day of birth  
The Mega-Mites are always in victory  
Man is not, he goes home, back to the sea  
Back to the sea, back to the sea, back to the sea

Their eyes for many centuries  
Peered in from space  
Sincere the hope, their wise believed  
They could teach our race  
  
But yet on Mars, a darker side  
Like all things that God made  
Their tribe of war, would heed them not  
"Earth they must invade"  
  
The fire in the skies  
Them devastate the land  
The warlord chief commands  
  
The humans fight and die  
Our planet laid to waste  
Monsters invade the earth from space  
  
It was then, in our darkest hour  
When everything seemed lost  
The hearts of men would not concede  
No matter what the cost  
  
They forged a sword of sound and steel  
Upon the Martian doors  
The voice of war would thunder there  
And "Mars would be no more"  
  
The Martian cities fall  
The death of the warrior tribe  
Mars attacks, now their planet won't survive  
  
Their world turn into ash  
The terror on their face  
Mars explodes, cast out as rubble into space  
  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh  
Mars Attacks: monsters invade the earth from space  
  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh

Singled out the kids who are mean to me  
Get straight A's but they still make fun  
I don't give a, I'll laugh last  
Stayed in every night  
  
Do my homework so I'll be smart  
Girls all say I'm a little fucked  
Mommy I'm a good boy  
Mommy I'm a fuckin' savior  
Mommy I'm alive  
  
Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight  
  
Rip the veins from human necks  
Until they're wet with life  
Razor-blades love teenage flesh  
An epidermoty  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Killed a girl on lovers' lane  
I kept her toes and teeth  
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
  
Killed a girl on lover's lane  
I kept her toes and teeth  
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep  
I'll bring back a souvenir  
For it's my mommy's dream  
  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight  
  
Kill tonight, kill tonight  
Kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight, kill tonight  
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight  
Mommykill tonight, kill tonight

Here we go  
  
I was working in the lab late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
When my monster, from its slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
  
He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash  
And it's a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash  
  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
  
He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash  
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash, they caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash  
  
Well, the zombies were having fun  
The party had just begun  
The guests included the Wolfman  
Dracula, and his son  
  
(He did the mash)  
The scene was rocking, all were digging the sound  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, The Crypt Keeper Five  
  
They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash  
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash, they caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash, they played the Monster Mash  
  
Now everything is cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living, this Mash was meant, too  
When you get to my door, tell them Only sent you  
  
Mash, then you can Monster Mash  
He did the Mash, and it's a graveyard smash  
Then you can Mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can Mash, then you can Monster Mash  
  
Wha-oo  
Monster mash  
Monster mash  
Oh, Monster mash  
Oh!

Go  
It's a missile girl  
In a missile world  
  
Human tongue feels aluminum-plate  
It's a missile boy  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Death machine and man in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Tracking system checks out pulse, all systems go  
Go go go go go  
Rocket-blast fury with a manual sex-drive  
Go go go go go  
  
It's a missile girl  
With a long white face  
A missile girl, well  
  
Nike is her name  
You remember it  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Deadlier than any girl on any world  
Oh oh oh oh oh

A go go go go go

A go go go go go

There I go and then it's over

We have been waiting for you  
We have been waiting for you, for you  
We're still waiting for you to come inside  
You won't be leaving, you are mine  
I am afraid that the end is near  
No more moments of moonlight  
We're still waiting for you to come inside  
You won't be leaving, you are mine  
I'm so afraid that the end is near  
No more moments of moonlight  
We'll still be waiting, I'm still waiting for you  
Those sick dead eyes tell me, tell me you are mine  
I am afraid that the end is here  
No more moments of moonlight  
I have been there to push you through  
Down, down, down through the deep dark wells  
Through the animal realm  
Let me be the one, the first to welcome you to hell  
Your poor pathetic lies and evil ways  
Have brought you here, give it all to me  
I need for you to stay here with me  
Don't go away  
I'll stay here with you until the end of time  
Until it all goes away, don't run this way  

There calling me creatures of the night, beautiful music,  
Animal instinct survived the serpents tongue.  
So ancient before the dawn of time, like the rock of ages,  
I'm the blood of mankind.  
Oooohhh I've seen it all.  
Oooohhh from grace men fall, babylon curse of all creation,  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity.  
One million years bc, one million years bc, one million years bc  
Ten thousand centuries ago, cast down from heaven to pilage below.  
The serpents eyes still watching for it's easy prey,  
Feed upon the hopeless the weak and afraid.  
Oooohhh I've seen it all.  
Oooohhh from grace men fall, babylon curse of all creation,  
Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity.  
One million years bc, one million years bc, one million years bc

People see us everywhere  
They think you really care  
But myself I can't deceive  
I know it's only make believe.  
  
My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care,  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you.  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe.  
  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you,  
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything.  
My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul,  
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me  
But it's only make believe.  
  
My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care,  
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My prayer, my hope, and my schemes, you are my every dream  
But it's only make believe

Complications inside of me  
Reminds me that my heart won't always beat  
The ugly face of death that's smiling  
At my rotting teeth  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I was waiting for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You feel my heart explode against the wall  
  
Oh  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
I'll be a martyr for the hated  
The weak, the ugly, the lost  
  
I will die here in this sorrow  
I won't wait for tomorrow  
Palpitate the pulse until  
You resurrect my soul from the wall  
  
Whoa  
Talk about me  
Laugh about me  
Cry about me  
Nail me to the cross  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
Whoa

Jealous cowards try to control  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
They distort what we say  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Try and stop what we do  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
When they can't do it themselves  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, it's no use  
  
Societies arms of control  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
Laugh at us behind our backs  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
I find satisfaction in what they lack  
Rise above, we're gonna rise above  
  
We are tired of your abuse  
Try to stop us, but it's no use

As I walk along,  
I wonder what went wrong,  
With our love, a love that was so strong.  
And as I still walk on,  
I think of the things we've done  
Together, while our hearts were young.  
  
I'm walkin' in the rain,  
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,  
Wishin' you were here by me,  
To end this misery  
And I wonder  
I wonder,  
Why,  
Why she ran away,  
Yes, and I wonder,  
where she will stay,  
My little runaway,  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
  
I'm walkin' in the rain,  
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,  
Wishin' you were here by me,  
To end this misery  
And I wonder  
I wonder,  
Why,  
Why she ran away,  
I wonder,  
where she will stay,  
My little runaway,  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.  
Run, run, run, run, runaway.

There's 52 ways to murder anyone  
One and two are the same  
And they both work as well  
  
I'm coming clean for Amy  
Julie doesn't scream as well  
And the cops won't listen all night  
  
And so maybe I'll be over  
Just as soon as I fill them all in  
  
And I can't remember when I saw her last  
We were running around and having a blast  
But the backseat of the drive-in is so lonely without you  
I know when you're home  
  
I was thinking about you  
There was something I forgot to say  
I was crying on a Saturday Night  
  
I was out cruising without you  
They were playing our song  
Crying on a Saturday Night  
  
As the moon becomes the night time  
You go viciously, quietly away  
I'm sitting in the bedroom where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes  
Now I'm watching  
Watching you die  

How 'bout a little fire scarecrow?  
  
Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here  
I'm telling you people best beware  
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey  
Back on my post by the crack of day  
  
Lock your doors, watch your back, it's true  
Turn around how do you do  
I'm the scarecrow man, I'm the scarecrow man  
  
People dying every night  
Mutilations a terrible site  
Look 'round the victims really hard  
Scarecrow's death straw calling card  
  
And I'm coming and killing it's true  
Turn around how do you do  
I'm the scarecrow man, I'm the scarecrow man  
scarecrow man, scarecrow man  
  
I'm the scarecrow man  
I'm the scarecrow man  
  
Hangin' in a field you'll never know I'm out here  
I'm telling you people best beware  
I creep into town, I'm hunting my prey  
Back on my post by the crack of day  
  
I've come to kill you, I will  
I'm gonna eat you be still  
I'm the scarecrow man

A chill runs up your spine  
It crawls into your brain  
The freezing touch of fear  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream  
  
It's driving me insane  
Although you try to fight  
Dragged from the silence where you hide  
'Til you... Scream  
  
Scream  
I can't wait to hear you  
I can't wait to hear you  
Scream

She walked out with empty arms  
Machine gun in her hand  
She is good and she is bad  
No one understands  
  
She walked in in silence  
Never spoke a word  
She's got a rich daddy  
She's her daddy's girl  
  
She loves naked sin  
He loves evil sex  
She has lost control  
They are growing old  
  
She will hide in silence  
Then her day will come  
She was virgin vixen  
She is on the run  
She is on the run  
She is on the run  

There's some kinda love  
And there's some kinda hate  
The maggots in the eye of love  
Won't copulate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whaoh oh, oh oh oh  
  
Hear the cats cry  
Liitle tortured babies in pain  
Cracked necks by sttled limbs  
They don't hesitate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah, whoah, oh  
  
There's some kinda love  
And there is some kinda hate  
I'm gonna tell you all about it now  
The maggots in the eye of love won't copulate  
  
And it's a whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
Baby whoah oh oh oh oh  
I said whoah whoah oh, whoah oh  

Traded in my bible for a little black cat  
The time of Armageddon's here  
Some call me the son of the morning  
God knows I'm the angel of light  
  
I drink my water from a wolf's footprint  
My soul's redemptive work of Christ  
God knows I'm the angel of light  
  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Devil  
  
Believers be on guard  
Be strong and take a stand  
The time of Armageddon's here  
Some call me the son of the morning  
  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Speak of the Devil  
Devil, devil

Through the years, million tears  
Drops of blood glistening  
And she sings, speaks of dreams  
What will come, what will be  
Of a time yet to come  
I must look, try to see  
Speaks of love, speaks of dreams  
Of eternity  
  
I've a bad feeling inside  
As I'm drawn to a place  
A hundred corpses  
Woven graves  
The widow now lay inside  
The future is told through her eyes  
This web be not my grave  
  
From what I'm seeing  
It's not hard believing  
The words of her spell as she speaks  
  
I have a feeling  
I won't be leaving  
One second more, and I'm spellbound  
  
I want to look in her eyes  
See what the future will bring  
One step too close and I'm dead  
  
A numbing cold freezing inside  
Darkness and gloom  
As she spins her web  
It takes your life  
  
Face to face, eye to eye  
Times unwinding  
As she sings, all it seems  
To hypnotize me  
Touch of doom, for her groom  
She's paralyzing  
Hers to feast when deceased  
Her trap surrounds me  
  
They won't stay open, my eyes  
The vision's beginning to blur  
Fever beginning to rise  
Spins her web  
The face of death in her eyes  
The kiss of death is on her lips  
The grip of death is in her thighs  
Spins her web  
Spins her web  
  
It's no use pleading  
The beast is needing me  
For the spell has been cast  
  
I feel her kisses  
My life dismisses  
One last kiss and I'm spellbound  
  
Death is the only surprise  
Cunning her prey with her lies  
Taking you down then you're  
Spellbound  
Too many brave men have died  
To know what tomorrow will bring  
Another cast on a silk tomb  
Spellbound  
  
Death is the only surprise

Spellbound  
Spellbound

This isn't really death, this isn't really life  
This isn't really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not sit up, don't be playing  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not change my fucking hair  
  
We have no reasons but we still have fun  
Then I blow up and you whispered my name  
  
Wait until I rip your back to shreds  
I wave my blue suede shoes  
That's all that remains of your spine  
  
I want excitement  
Your spinal remains  
I want to stand here  
In your spinal remains  
In chains  
  
This isn't really death, this isn't really life  
This isn't really anything I think I like  
  
And I will not grin or piss on the flag  
Not for you or anyone  
I will not plug a fucking ass  
  
I want to stand in  
Baby your spinal remains  
I won't save it  
Baby your spinal remains  
They're making me sick

In blood their names were written  
To hell their souls committed  
Three hundred years have passed  
The book still binds  
Corbis still waits  
  
It's what you put your faith in  
Return what has been taken  
Fiends he's set to find  
They have no eyes  
For them it's too late  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
  
Nearer draws it's shadow  
Furious winds howl  
Darker than their souls  
The storm arrives  
Exposing its prey  
  
Striking without warning  
The tempest holds their jury  
Judgment has been cast  
Falling from the sky  
There's no escape  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
The devil's rain  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you

The darkness bleeds violent sights  
It purges from within  
Death, it holds you in its arms  
And kisses you goodnight  
  
Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes  
Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite  
Oh, it purges from within  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed  
Inside a dream  
  
It's over, it's over  
This haunting, it's over  
They cut my wrists and watch me bleed  
They stop haunting me  
  
The darkness bleeds violent sights

We become  
Erupt in violence  
Destroy the silence  
Our time has come  
Go  
  
We are the outcasted, ancient descendents  
The ones who've been calling and  
Would you still die for the dead, yet still living  
Starved of a time that's now come, whoa-oh  
  
We are the children  
The hungry children  
  
We become  
Erupt in violence  
Seduce the silence  
Our time has come  
Go  
  
We are the kindred, Hell's ancient descendent slaves  
Begging the night not to go  
Would you still die for the dead, yet still living  
Starved of a life that's now gone, whoa-oh  
  
We are the children  
The hungry children  
  
We become  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it, you need it  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it, you need it  
Blood quench the hunger  
You want it, you need it  
  
Oh, whoa

Dry drunk on a corner  
Wet waste of a girl  
Theme for a jackal  
  
Play you death-song  
You probably listen  
Stand idly by as they rape your children  
Like you do now  
In fact you showed them how  
  
All thoughts are in place  
All deeds are complete  
Play, theme for a jackal play  
  
Die sweet prince  
Meat tastes like mince  
The jackal's eaten enough for today  
  
Die sweet prince  
Meat tastes like shit  
Enough to make that jackal spit  
  
Spit jackal spit  
Spit and choke on the lives you've taken  
You can't shake them loose  
  
All morsels are gone, they're too small  
Accessible from a source so tall  
Little sister all of my love  
  
Bitch  
Bitch, she is  
Cut her from the inside out  
  
Dead daughter in the river  
Entrance gained by her liver  
Play, theme for a jackal play  
  
They play you a death-song  
You probably listen  
Stand idly by as they rape your children  
Like you do now  
In fact you showed them how  
Play, theme for a jackal play  
Play, theme for a jackal play  

Furious the exodus walks  
Along the maddening march of death  
With the furor and the masses  
Whose supremacies is the dominion  
Alien bodies stiff and cold  
Your inner sane turns numb  
You transform into a rage  
Too naive to understand  
  
And as they go on the sacrifice grows  
We're living on ground zero, fire  
This island earth  
Target locked, systems checked, enter code  
We're living on ground zero, fire  
(Fire, this island earth)  
  
Locked up in a room  
Human beings in a cage  
The sentence a scienced death  
As they pull the triggers of ray guns  
Evil blackened eyes of youth  
Absorbing life's hidden anguish  
Death thrown all about the ground  
Or those who wouldn't fight  
  
And as they go on the sacrifice grows  
We're living on ground zero, fire  
This island earth  
Target locked, systems checked, enter code  
We're living on ground zero, fire  
(Fire, this island earth)  
  
We're living on this island earth (this island earth)  
We're living on this island earth (this island earth)  
We're living on this island earth (this island earth)  
We're living on this island earth

Six super star destroyers landing in the east  
They plan to form a wall, then push us to the sea  
We deployed our forces, moving to attack  
Those who see their eyes, never answer back  
  
Call the high commander  
Tell him of the siege we're under  
We're ready to roll, we're ready to roll  
We're ready to roll, get ready to rock  
  
Missile silo doors are opened, coordinates are placed  
Six billion tons of power, thrown back into their face  
One blinding blast of light, after that we see  
Their huge electric eyes staring back at me  
  
Prepare the thunder thruster  
Ultra-sonic molecule buster  
Get ready to roll, get ready to roll  
Get ready to roll, get ready to rock  
  
They went to a hill on the shore and assembled the gun  
To do a thing that before no one had done  
Now we sit and we wait, we have nowhere to run  
We see their lights through the night, turn the thunder thruster on  
  
With a sonic boom the waves of sound are thrust  
Upon our enemies, it shatters them to dust  
No one left to battle, ships pools of molten lead  
But our world's destroyed, who knows how many dead  
  
Turn off the thunder thruster  
Dig a hole and put it under  
Never to rock, never to rock  
Never to rock, never to rock  
Rock, rock, rock, roll

He'll tear you apart  
For he knows what to do  
And he knows what to say  
He'll match your will  
For if it's weak  
You're his prey  
  
But still I try  
As I ride by the light of the moon  
Heart burstin' inside  
As I fly, evil around me now looms  
The trial of the soul when there's nothing left you can say  
For all your lies weigh heavy against you today  
  
Now be judged  
On what is locked  
Deep inside  
Battle till death  
For your honor  
For your pride  
In your heart you must know  
What is just  
What is true  
When the devil looks in your face  
It's just him  
It's just you  
  
My battle ordained  
Flesh, blood, horror and pain  
In God, I put my trust  
That He'll save my soul if I'm slain  
Before the final battle as the storm turns heading my way  
Behold the invincible weapon  
The only thing that'll save you today  
  
One thing I know  
The true test of a warrior's soul  
His battle lies within  
Deep in his heart where evil takes it's hold  
Once foretold  
The mightiest sword you could hold  
Is a heart that is true  
When the battles ensues  
As the prophecy unfolds  
  
For his thoughts  
Are so quick  
From his mouth  
Roll the lies  
If you listen  
To him  
You are caught  
By surprise  
  
Believe or die, our swords clash - rings the bell of the doomed  
Millions who've tried before  
The fires of Hell have consumed  
But his deadliest blows  
My sword seems to jump in their way  
Over and over in my mind these are the words that I say  
  
One thing I know  
The true test of a warrior's soul  
His battle lies within  
Deep in his heart where evil takes it's hold  
For I was told  
Of the incredible power it holds  
Against anything will victory bring  
In the trial of the soul  
  
For the sword that you hold  
Draws it's power from your soul  
Quicker than light, cutting deep in the night  
Where evil blood runs cold  
So to the bold  
Prepare the weapon you must hold  
And ask of the Lord  
Victory to our swords  
As we face the dangers untold

There are paint smears on everything I own  
The vapor rub is lying on a table of filth  
Christmas cards to which I never reply  
My eyeballs absorb only blue filtered light  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
  
I wish they'd put prince namor on the tube  
Hold on, I think I have to puke  
There's a spot in the corner where I always go  
I like to feed the flies that I know  
  
But please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
Please don't feed my television screen  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
  
Babies in prison, they call it a womb  
Nine month sentence, no parole  
Slivers of steel stuck in your lungs  
Breathe deep, we need a donor for blood  
  
Jaguars at the cemetary  
Cadillacs grazing at your grave  
Zeniths grazing at your grave  
Sonys grazing at your grave  
  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty  
We're all right  
Tv casualty, tv casualty

1, 2, 3, 4  
We walk the streets, I'm out to get you  
We bite  
Just a feast of gore and blood  
We bite  
Carnivores live for pleasure  
We bite  
Strike out like a wolf's endeavor  
We bite  
  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite, we bite, we bite  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite  
And when I get your blood I rip your throat  
Your blood I rip your throat  
I want your blood, I rip your throat  
To drink some blood  
  
We bite, we bite, we bite, we bite  

5:25 August fifth, 1962  
Found her lying on her chest  
Her face all turning blue  
You think it was an overdose  
But could it have been the pact  
Could it have been the Kennedys  
Was it LAPD  
  
It ain't a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny, funny, funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
Rotted corpse, sex decay  
Breasts all full of slugs  
No answer for the accident  
Her cunt has all dried up, you see  
  
5:25 August fifth, 1962  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
Make it seem a suicide  
  
It ain't a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny, funny, funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
It ain't a mystery  
Baby not to me  
Funny, funny, funny mystery  
Baby not to me  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  

Wipe out the weak and dying  
I've got no use for you  
Sent from Hell, I know they're lying  
Just another sacrifice  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
Exterminate the undetermined  
I've got no use for you  
Sent from Hell, I know they're lying  
Hang her by her neck to die  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
We're on a head hunt  
We're on a blood hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
and we're gonna get you  
We're coming after you too  
  
We're on a witch hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
  
We are on a witch hunt  
Hunt her down for, will she sink or float?  
We want independence from her spell.  
  
Were under a spell  
We're on a head hunt  
We're on a blood hunt  
We're on a witch hunt  
and we're gonna get you  
We're coming after you

See the pyramids along the Nile  
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle  
Just remember, darling, all the while  
You belong to me.  
  
See the marketplace in old Algiers  
Send me photographs and souvenirs  
But just remember when a dream appears  
You belong to me.  
  
I'll be so alone without you  
Maybe you'll be lonesome too  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember till you're home again  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
  
I'll be so alone without you  
Maybe you'll be lonesome too  
  
Fly the ocean in a silver plane  
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain  
Just remember till you're home again  
You belong to me  
You belong to me  
You belong to me
