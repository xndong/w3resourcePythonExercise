[Verse 1]  
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast  
Watching you pretend you're unaffected  
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go  
But I won't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said you let it go, you kept it  
Working hard to perfect it  
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control  
Would you let it go?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
If you let me, I'd be there by now  
Close to you

You're not easy to love  
You're not easy to love, no  
You're not easy to love  
You're not easy to love, no  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
Cause if you really wanna be alone  
I will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Sometimes I get you  
Sometimes I don't understand  
Sometimes I love you  
Sometimes it's you I can't stand  
Sometimes I wanna hug you  
Sometimes I wanna push you away  
Most times I wanna kiss you  
Other times punch you in the face  
  
'Cause every minute you start switching up  
And you say things like you don't give a fuck  
Then I say I'm through with you  
Take my heart from you  
And you come running after me and baby I'm back with you  
  
Oh, you're not easy to love  
You're not easy to love, no  
You're not easy to love

Oh I hate it  
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I,  
Will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
Sometimes I catch you  
Sometimes you get away  
Sometimes I read you  
Other times I'm like where are you on the page  
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever  
But you're so complicated  
My heart knows better  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I,  
Will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated  
Oh why  
  
I'ma stick around just a little while longer  
Just to make sure that you're really sure  
You like sleeping alone  
I'ma stick around just a little while longer  
Just to make sure that you're really sure  
You like sleeping alone  
  
Why is everything with you so complicated  
Why do you make it hard to love you  
Oh I hate it  
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I,  
Will throw my hands up 'cause baby I tried  
Everything with you is so complicated

Looking back it's hard for me to see  
Just how I could have been so blind  
Like an actor on a movie screen  
You played the part with every line  
Well every story doesn't have a happy ending  
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow  
  
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending  
But boy I think you need to know  
  
(Coulda been the one)  
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
(Shoulda been the one)  
Didn't know just what you had boy  
Now it's just too bad boy  
(After all is said and done)  
You're a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
'cause you coulda been the one  
  
There's nothing left to say  
Coulda been the one  
Coulda been  
Shoulda been  
  
My momma didn't raise no fool  
She said play with fire you get burned  
You laughed at me, I laugh at you  
Now it seems the table's turned  
I must admit I really thought you had potential  
But I could not have been more wrong  
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials  
You had your chance but now I'm long gone  
  
(Coulda been the one)  
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
(Shoulda been the one)  
Didn't know just what you had boy  
Now it's just too bad boy  
(After all is said and done)  
You're a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
'cause you coulda been the one  
  
You coulda been the one baby  
(You coulda been the one)  
Oh yeah  
  
You played yourself boy  
And there is no denying it  
It's just the way the story goes  
You made your bed boy  
Better go and lay in it  
But know that you'll be laying there alone  
  
You coulda been the one  
  
(Coulda been the one)  
I would give it all to catch you when you fall boo  
(Shoulda been the one)  
Didn't know just what you had boy  
Now it's just too bad boy  
(After all is said and done)  
You're a cheater and a liar  
Went to play with fire  
Boy I hope that you enjoyed your fun  
'Cause you coulda been the one

You saw me on the television, setting fire to all the buildings  
Yeah I guess you saw me stealing, but you've no idea what I've been needin'  
Talk about when we were children, not the kind of kid that you believe in  
You saw me on the television, saw me on the television  
But that's just the half of it, yeah you saw the half of it  
This is the life I live, and that's just the half of it  
  
Saw me on the television, hanging out my dirty linen  
You're entitled to your own opinion  
Sit and shake your head at my decision  
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing  
Make it seem as if I'm always winning  
But you saw me on a television  
Yeah you saw me on a television  
  
But that's just the half of it

Go hard or go home  
Back to your residence  
Soon the red dogs will give the block back to the presidents  
I used to run my own block like Obama did  
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then  
You couldn't even come in my room, it smelled like a kilo  
Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino  
Trying to sell they peeping my bag they can't afford it  
Tell 'em to give me back my swag, they tryin' to clone me  
See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt  
What that make me, Louis Mane?  
I'm in an all white party wearin' all black  
With my new black watch call it the heart attack  
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist  
Yeah, they say they're hard  
They ain't hard as this  
Hard! The one word describes me, if I wasn't doin' this  
You know where I be, too hard  
  
Where dem girls talkin' trash, where dem girls talkin' trash  
Where they at, where they at, where they at?  
Where dem bloggers at, where dem bloggers at

That's how much I love you  
That's how much I need you  
And I can't stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)  
  
But you won't let me  
You upset me, girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)  
Can't remember what you did  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do  
So that I can't stay mad at you  
For too long, that's wrong  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch  
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)  
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)  
But I just can't let you go  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)  
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)  
  
Sad, and it's not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just ain't right  
  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
But I just can't let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me  
And your kiss won't make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So you'll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)  
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)  
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)  
That's how much I need you (I need you)  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And I hate that I love you so, so

[Verse]  
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty  
So pardon if I'm impolite  
I just really need your ass with me  
I'm sorry 'bout the other night  
And I know I could be more creative  
And come up with poetic lines  
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and "I love you"  
Is the only thing that's in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe  
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe  
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late  
You light my fire  
Let's stay up late and smoke a J  
I wanna go back to the old ways  
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray  
With a little bit too much to say

Mmm, mmm, ohh, no, oh, no  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy  
I'm addicted to you  
Gotta have it for all the things that you do  
I, something 'bout this feeling is crazy  
Amazing, mistakes all night and day  
Makes my temperature rise  
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized  
I'm feeling something that I can't understand  
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand  
Its survive, it's your style, it's the way that you smile  
Get a little rush when I hear your name  
It's so magnetic when you're here next to me  
Hold me closer, happens so naturally  
We connect, it's electric, this feeling inside  
Didn't know that even if I tried  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy  
I'm addicted to you  
Gotta have it for all the things that you do  
I, something 'bout this feeling is crazy  
Amazing, mistakes all night and day  
Makes my temperature rise  
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized  
(No)  
You got me spinning like a marry-go-round  
Feels like I'm flying but I ain't left the ground  
Falling fast, I'm afraid, can't escape there's no way  
Never had a feeling like this before  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy  
I'm addicted to you  
(I'm addicted to you, baby)  
Gotta have it for all the things that you do

I, something 'bout this feeling is crazy  
(Crazy)

Mistakes all night and day, makes my temperature rise  
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized  
(Hypnotized)  
It's amazing how you drive me crazy  
Boy, keep doing watcha doing  
'Cause you're really getting through to me, I  
Day and night, babe, you know, I can't fight it  
Just one look into my eyes  
And you know you got me hypnotized  
(Ohh)  
Something 'bout the way that you working me  
Teasing me, pleasing me easily, boy

Amazing, mistakes all night and day  
Makes my temperature rise  
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized  

Another day another reminder that your not here with me,  
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories,  
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart,  
  
Chorus  
I can hear the music playing,  
See the lights upon the tree,  
I can feel the joy in every soul,  
But for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part,  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you.  
  
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away,  
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?  
There's to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I.  
  
Chorus  
  
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars,  
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!  
  
I can hear the music playing,  
See the lights upon the tree,  
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me it's incomplete,  
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas,
without you.  
  
See I tried but it jut aint right, without you.

Wait  
You ain't even thinking what you say  
Your words leave me frozen like a lake  
And dropped under the surface  
You killing out  
The one thing  
That gives us purpose  
  
Stop  
Take a look at love  
You'll never know  
'Cause I'm not gonna let you  
Leave me feeling cold  
So don't you come here  
There'll be no more tears  
In this atmosphere  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
Why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
You  
Don't understand  
The way of  
What you do  
But I made it through  
The other side  
I'm through  
And I took this hard  
And you can see me speaking  
From a dead cold start  
  
All that I asked for  
Is love that  
Don't hurt soul  
So why did you come here?  
Tell me  
Why did you come here?  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to ice  
My whole world turns to  
  
I  
Can hold my head up high  
As frost covers the ground  
And I can see sunlight  
Through these clouds  
  
Yeeah  
Yeeeeah  
  
Own invited  
I don't know  
Why you felt like  
You could try to come  
Within' a hundred miles  
I'm a fighter  
But I don't want  
To fight the cold  
And every damn time  
That you come close  
  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
An icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I'm frozen like an icicle  
I don't know  
What you came here for  
Got me frozen like an icicle  
An icicle

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away  
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway.  
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one  
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, on your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight  
  
Sometimes you move so well  
It's hard not to give in.  
  
I'm lost, I can't tell  
Where you end and I begin.  
  
It makes you burn to learn  
I'm with another man.  
  
I wonder if he's half  
The lover that I am.  
  
Now you've gone somewhere else, Far away  
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you).  
But you feel my breath, On your neck  
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you).

Baby, baby, please believe me  
Find it in your heart to reach me  
Promise not to leave me behind  
(Promise not to leave me behind)  
  
Take me down, but take it easy  
Make me think but don't deceive me  
Torture me by taking your time  
(Talk to me, talk to me)  
  
'Cause you keep me coming back for more  
And I feel a little better than I did before  
  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind  
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

And I feel a little better than I did before  
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind

No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you, you  
  
Another tear, another regret boy, that you're so far away  
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride  
Remember singing by the fire  
There's to much that's in the daylight  
I keep reliving you and I  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me it's incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do  
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you  
  
Time we tried to build a snowman  
The time we tried to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didn't know then  
That we'd ever be apart  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me it's incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do,  
It just don't feel like Christmas,  
No it just don't feel like Christmas without you, ooh baby  
  
See I tried but it just ain't right, right without you.

[Verse 1]  
I'd rather be smoking weed  
Whenever we breathe  
Everytime you kiss me  
Don't say that you miss me  
Just come get me  
  
[Hook]  
Don't know why, just know I want to  
Don't know why, just know I want you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'd rather be breaking things  
Cause we can't see  
We're too busy kissing  
Just making scenes  
Here come the police  
They know about your history  
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?  
Don't care why, just know I love you

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
  
Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love  
But I guess I guess I guess is all good  
You can play the game, I'mma still do my thang  
Ain't no better way for it to be put  
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering why you always call my
name  
You think I'm gonna wait around  
I ain't got all day  
  
You don't need another lover  
Don't you let it go  
I already got it covered, let the others know  
  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
  
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
  
Think I give a damn boy don't you know who I am  
I ain't runnin' 'round kissing no dude  
Think somebody else like me gon' come around  
Boy you got it misunderstood  
Put it in your face but you wreckin' us yet  
Like you can't recognize a good thing  
  
Now that you got a chance  
Tell me what it's gon' be?  
  
You don't need another lover  
Don't you let it go  
I already got it covered, let the others know  
  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
  
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump  
  
You say it's my fault, OK I get it  
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it  
See you put up your wall  
You know you did it, the rise and the fall, just admit it  
You say it's my fault, okay I get it  
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it  
It's the the rise and the fall  
It's the the rise and the fall  
And you could have had it all  
  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle  
Is waitin', come and, jump on it  
If you want it let's do it  
Ride it, my pony, my saddle

Jump on it, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump, jump, jump on it  
Jump on it, jump on it

[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse:]  
It's like spending time with you  
Just doing absolutely nothing  
That makes me happy  
When you're at work putting on your  
T-shirt and I love it, absolutely love it  
  
[Hook:]  
It's the smile of a child  
It's your eyes, it's your hair  
It's the touch of your skin,  
That's what gets me there  
It's also enticing  
Waking up from a nice dream  
To a beautiful morning with you by my side  
That's nice  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse 2:]  
It's like walking through the sprinklers  
Smelling every flower one by one  
Mmm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah  
It's like telling me you love me, showing me you love me baby, my pretty baby  
  
[Hook:]  
It's the smile of a child  
It's your eyes, it's your hair  
It's the touch of your skin,  
That's what gets me there  
It's also enticing  
Waking up from a nice dream  
To a beautiful morning with you by my side  
That's nice  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
  
[Verse 3:]  
It's like Saturday, ohh, four day weekend, ohh, Hiding and seeking with you  
Like we do, it's beautiful  
  
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhhhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy  
Just as long as it makes you happy  
If it makes you happy, just be happy

Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Never don't lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Kisses don't lie  
  
Emotions come and go  
Almost how the wind will blow  
There so little in this world to trust in  
Seduce themselves with lies  
Some don't realize  
They call it love but its really only lustin'  
  
So you see you and me  
We're gettin' close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause I'm caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Never don't lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why  
Kisses don't  
No they don't  
Kisses don't lie  
  
You whisper in my ear  
But are your words sincere  
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife  
You see I'm nobody's fool  
I play by my own rules  
So please think twice before you step into my life  
  
So you see you and me  
We're gettin close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause I'm caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin' me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie  
  
Emotions come and go  
Almost how the wind will blow  
There so little in this world to trust in  
Seduce themselves with lies  
Some don't realize  
They call it love but its really only lustin'  
  
Cause when you kiss me

Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in  
I try to run but there's no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses don't lie

You can't lease my love x9  
Oh, this was just an empty space  
That both we tried to live  
With windows and a can of paint  
And we began to build  
  
In spite of that  
(Try to build it up x3)  
In spite of this  
(Try to build it up x3)  
  
I have felt such an imbalance  
Loved my way around it  
And everyone around believed  
That one of us was in it for the profit  
(For the profit, for the profit)  
Just for the profit  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me  
Break from me  
Break away from me  
You tried to lease my love  
Lease my love, lease my love  
But you can't cheat my love  
Go on and lease my love  
  
Lease my love, lease my love  
You can't cheat my love  
I knew this day will come,  
It came so very quick  
I knew that once we fell apart  
No rule will ever stick  
And we would fold the profit  
(Fold the profit x5)  
  
Now we're months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me

[chorus:]  
I got a house, but I need new furniture  
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?  
The truth is I will love you the same  
But why complain when you buying gucci, babe?  
  
You might see me in the spot  
Ya boy think I'm hot  
So I came up in here to get what you got  
I'm hot like the block  
Uh huh, you like that  
Know you wanna bite that  
Uh huh, yeah, right there  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...  
  
[Bridge:]  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
(What you got up in them jeans? Put it on me, or get lonely)  
Lemme get that (huh)  
(You know, five-car garages, name on your bank account, all day massages)  
(Lemme hit that, huh)  
(I wanna put it on blast)  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
Better slow down 'for I make you crash, boy  
Got what you want, baby, got what you need  
But we can't proceed  
Unless you got that for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a put you on the spot  
Keep the sheet in knots  
I bought me a Benz  
You buy me the yacht  
A girl need a lot  
The girl need some stocks  
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (Ya get it?)  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Boy, I know you want my love  
Oh, oh, oh  
Nothing is free in this world  
Oh, oh, oh  
Unless my love is your love  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm not a gold digger  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

What am I supposed to do with this heart  
How do I take it off, if the love ain't on, it's like a work of art  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
How was I to know that my love was delusional  
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul  
In love we all will fall but, we fell a little harder  
What am I supposed to do with this heart  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right, to be lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
It may be wrong but it feels right  
All my fears are gone tonight  
I'm lost in paradise  
  
I'm so lost in paradise  
If I open up my eyes  
I can see the storm, I can see the sky  
I can see the darkness flashing lights  
All my fears, don't deny  
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise  
  
Lost in paradise  
Yeah, lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise

Took a chance, rolled the dice on me and you  
Opened up, let you in my world  
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control  
Swept away, so proud to be your girl  
But when you write a story much to fast  
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a plaything  
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing  
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing  
When it's wrong you gotta let it go  
Now I know  
Now I know  
  
Remember when, we said our love would last forever  
But then again, how are we to know  
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather  
A sunny day can suddenly turn cold  
Time will teach you all you need to learn  
But there'll always be a first time you get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't regret a single day  
The joy and pain along the way  
A broken heart's the price we pay  
As sad as it may seem  
Baby can't you see  
It's the way it's gotta be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
Now I know  
I know

Here's a little story I gotta tell  
'Bout this boy I know so well  
Back in the day was cool and all  
He fell in love, I fell in love  
I thought he was the one for me  
Other boys I could not see  
And look what happened to our love  
I'm like how could it be  
  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
But boy you broke my heart  
And now I'm standing there  
It shoulda been me and you  
It coulda been you and me  
  
Now all I got are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
Now baby its killing me  
I'm saying its killing me  
The fact that you ain't around  
Baby, I'm falling down  
I need me a remedy  
Been looking for remedies  
I need you to be around  
Baby I'm hurting now  
I know you're a better man (when I was your girl)  
This land is a better land (when you're in my world)  
  
Today will be better, babe  
If it were like yesterday, so happy and lovely  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Are these photographs  
All I've got  
All I've got  
  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you, you, you  
Got nothing without you  
  
All I've got are these photographs  
I remember when I used to make you laugh  
I don't wanna be stuck in the past  
But you're all that I have that I had  
And I don't wanna lose what we've felt this far  
This is me and you, you're my superstar  
I'll give anything baby, here's my heart  
My heart, my heart  
  
My heart don't stop  
My heart be beating over  
My loving never stops  
Even though that it's over  
Girl I been reminiscing  
With that way that Casanova  
Way back when we was kissing on your grand momma's sofa  
Girl I got us lovey dubby on my photo album  
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein  
You had your Guess jeans on  
Looking sexy on home?  
Girl why couldn't I be the one?  
  
Why, why, why  
Why couldn't I be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
Why couldn't you be the one?  
(Why, why, why)  
  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
All I've got  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you, you, you  
Its nothing without you  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
Its nothing without  
All I've got  
All I've got are these photographs

[Chorus: x2]

Just a thought  
To add suspense  
To all the games  
Of discontent.  
  
Fear is real  
But not self-taught  
You let others  
Be the cause.  
  
There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
You say it draws near,  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
Tear down  
Those mighty walls.  
Reinvent  
The way you talk.  
  
Look ahead,  
Now down below,  
Or high above,  
Where angels flow.There we go racing towards the sun,  
Ignoring all the noise,  
Striving for the grace of man.  
People play this great charade,  
And always miss the point.  
Never fall for prophecies.  
  
Waiting to see  
Our kind disagree.  
You draw the line  
And stick to your pride.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You write the book  
On the way...  
  
It ends.  
  
(Guitar solos)  
  
You say it draws near  
That it will be clear.  
You act so convinced,  
A fortress you've built.  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand.  
You wrote the book  
On the way it all ends.  
  
It ends.

What's up?  
I know we haven't spoken for a while  
But I was thinkin' bout you  
And it kinda made me smile  
So many things to say  
And I'll put em in a letter  
And thought it might be easier  
The words might come out better  
How's your mother, how's your little brother?  
Does he still look just like you?  
So many things I wanna know the answers to  
Wish I could press rewind  
And rewrite every line  
To the story of me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried  
To get you out my mind  
But it don't get no better  
As each day goes by  
And I'm lost and confused  
I've got nothin' to lose  
Hope to hear from you soon  
P.S. I'm still not over you  
Still not over you  
  
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on  
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've gone  
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me  
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me  
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the t.v.  
Boy it ain't easy  
When I hear our song  
I get that same old feeling  
Wish I could press rewind  
Turn back the hands of time  
And I shouldn't be telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Did you know I kept all of your pictures  
Don't have the strength to part with them yet  
Oh no  
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste  
But some things a girl can never forget  
  
[Chorus]

We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
  
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious  
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious  
'Cause the beat gonna chase my body  
Shakin' aside my bones  
And you pushin' all my buttons, takin' me outta my zone  
Yeah  
  
[Bridge:]  
The way that you stare, starts a fire in me  
Come up to my room you sexy little thing  
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease  
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would push up on me  
I wish you would light me up and say you want me  
Push up on me  
  
I know many guys just like ya, extremely confident  
Got so much flavor with you like you're the perfect man  
You wanna make me chase ya like its a compliment  
But let's get right down to it  
I can be the girl that can break you down  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break we breaking down  
  
I wanna see how you move it  
Show me, show me how you do it  
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)  
Baby there ain't nothing to it  
Baby who you think you're fooling  
You wanna come get me outta my dress  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down  
We break, break, we break, break, we break, break, we breaking down

Just to sleep, just to sleep  
Put them lighters up, up  
Put them lighters up, up  
  
My body is cold, I need your help  
I'm coming down from a perfect spell  
Can I take a hint of your love's device  
Inhale the rum, you're just in time  
Your fingertips leave me hypnotized  
And when it hits my lips I am paralysed!  
Cause we come too far, and it feels so right  
So put up a fight, just enjoy the ride!  
No wrong or right, just want the light!  
  
Chorus:  
So put them lighters up, when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up, I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters, put them lighters up  
  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up, up, up  
  
Strike a match while I catch my breath  
Burn it down, I see the take  
Open my eyes and let my spirit bright!  
Cause we come too far, and it feels so right  
So put up a fight, just enjoy the ride!  
No wrong or right, just want the light!  
  
Chorus:  
So put them lighters up, when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up, I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up, up, up

Take off my shirt, loosen the buttons and undo my skirt  
Stare at myself in the mirror  
Take me apart, piece by piece  
Sorrow decrease, pressure release  
I put in work  
Did more than called upon, more than deserved  
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)  
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first:  
  
[Chorus]  
Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
Who am I living for?  
Is this my limit, can I endure some more?  
Chances are given, question existing  
  
Take off my cool  
Show them that under here I'm just like you  
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool  
Or a human with flaws?  
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause  
Take the abuse  
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose  
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? (No)  
But the question that lingers whether win or lose:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dear diary  
It's Robyn  
Entertaining is something I do for a living  
It's not who I am  
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal  
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt, I think I suck sometimes  
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good  
(Ooo, yeah)  
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst 'cause I have to always keep my guard up  
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am  
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am  
  
[Chorus]

There could be a freak accident  
There could be a fatal disease  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
We could all fall down  
Before our Saviour could return  
I know we hate to think about it  
But it's as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me, please  
  
The earth could quake to ruin  
We could drift off in our sleep  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
The ocean crushed the shore  
And take us down forevermore  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me, please  
  
I know we hate to think about it  
But it's as real as you and me  
It's as real as you and me

Baby, baby  
When we first met, I never felt something so strong  
You were like my lover and my best friend  
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it  
And all of a sudden you went and left  
I didn't know how to follow  
It's like a shock that spun me around  
And now my heart's dead  
I feel so empty and hollow  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
And now I feel like  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
It's like I checked into rehab  
And, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
I gotta check into rehab  
Cause, baby, you're my disease  
  
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?  
You'd do anything for the one you love  
Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there  
It's like you were my favorite drug  
The only problem is that you was using me  
In a different way than I was using you  
But now that I know it's not meant to be  
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you  
  
And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you  
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?  
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back  
And you're the one to blame  
Cause now I feel like  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Uh, uh, now, ladies, gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Uh, now gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(My ladies, gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Uh, now gimme that)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking  
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more  
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking  
I should've never let you enter my door  
Next time you wanna go on and leave  
I should just let you go on and do it  
Cause now I'm using like I bleed  
  
[Chorus]

Baby please, you don't have to explain the reasons  
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons  
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name boy  
It's okay, cause what we got it ain't gonna change boy  
  
As long as we've been together  
You've always been the one  
Nobody knows you better  
When all is said and done  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And you're loosin' your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?  
Who ya gonna run to?  
  
You and me we go back to jump rope and grade school  
Memories when you were tryin' so hard to play cool  
I don't mind I know that you gotta go through your changes  
Take your time sometimes are hard to rearrange it  
  
As long as we've been together  
You've always been the one  
Nobody knows you better  
When all is said and done  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And you're loosin' your grip  
And you cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?  
Who ya gonna run to?  
  
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do ( I do)  
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to (bye to)  
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who be there  
  
You know I'm gonna be right there (right there)  
  
When your friends start to trip  
And your loosin' your grip  
And u cant find your way back home  
When your world falls apart  
And you're lost in the dark  
And you know that your all alone  
When you just can deal, and you need something real  
Someone that'll always come through  
Who ya gonna run to?  
Who ya gonna run to?  
  
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in

Why am I so in love?

Baby slow down just hear me out  
There's something I gotta let you know  
No need push no need to rush  
You know you had me from hello  
  
When it comes to my heart I don't play  
Baby boy can't you see the stop sign  
You're movin' much to fast  
Baby love doesn't grow in a day  
Just get it right the first time  
Make this feeling last  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby if your willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
Don't you know that it's getting late  
And I know what's on your mind  
I know this feeling is crazy  
It's mutual baby  
But we don't have to rush something real  
Baby if you're willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
  
Boy can't you see I'm not tryin' be  
The girl who gets taken for a ride  
If you take your time then you will find  
There's so much more to me inside  
And just say there's no need to delay  
Your telling me to trust you  
Boy you know I want to baby  
But my heart can so recently break  
Before we take this very far show me who you really are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby love doesn't grow in a day  
Let's get it right the first time  
And make this feeling last

From the moment of our inception  
Yeah we were destined  
To be together (together)  
Two planets on a cosmic collision  
Yeah were on a mission  
To last forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
And so gravity took hold  
And it's never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh, oh, eh, eh  
Eh, uh, oh  
  
I see your name spelled out in the sky  
Lighting the night like a constellation  
Now let's be touch (go for a ride)  
The speed of light a supernova sensation  
  
[Chorus:]  
And so gravity took hold  
And it's never letting me go  
Like a tractor beam  
To infinity lost sense of all control  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Uh, oh, eh, eh, eh, uh, oh  
It's written in the stars, oh  
Eh, eh, yeah, yeah, eh, eh  
  
I need your forcefields  
I gotta keep it real  
To keep me from burning (burning oh)  
Don't want to drift away  
Floating in outer space  
There's no way I'm returning oh  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
And our love is written in the stars  
Already written in the stars  
If I'm from Venus you're from Mars  
Our love is written in the stars  
  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, It's written in the stars  
Oh, oh, eh, eh, it's written in the stars

Haters gonna hate

The truth leads to the lies  
The heart ain't always right  
And I see that love is blind now

Without no trust there ain't no us boy  
  
[Chorus]
