[Verse 1]  
When I was a nipper  
I boarded a clipper  
Sailed the seas as a goods importer, oh!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Edward Teach is my name  
But I earned my fame  
As Blackbeard the pirate of the water, oh!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Was a jolly chap  
With a jaunty cap  
Always gave my crew good quarter, oh!  
But I'm best known for  
Blood and guts and gore  
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Best known for  
Blood and guts and gore  
And a vicious reign of murdering and slaughter, oh!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Left my home in Bristol  
With a sword and pistol  
Bid a fond farewell  
To old Blighty, oh!  
  
[Verse 6]  
What my enemies feared  
Was my thick, black beard  
Which I always enjoyed  
Setting light to, oh!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Once I had a thing  
For a captive's lovely ring  
That shone like a jewel in the nighty, oh!  
When the man said no  
I just said 'Oh! '  
And chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '  
  
[Hook]  
Man said no  
He said 'Oh! '  
Chopped off his hand and said 'Rightio! '  
  
[Verse 8]  
Oh, I love to sail the ocean  
With my flag that inspired emotion  
With it's smiling pile of skull and bones  
Smashing hearts with a violent stabbing motion  
  
[Verse 9]  
And I love to escape detection  
And to win my crew's affection  
Which was nothing to do with the twelve guns he wore  
On his belt that were for protection  
  
[Verse 10]  
I was awfully nice  
But I had the odd vice  
Which occasionally caused a commotion  
The thing that I'd do  
Was shoot members of my crew  
If they didn't show enough devotion  
  
[Bridge]  
The thing he'd do  
Was shoot members of the crew  
If they didn't show enough devotion  
  
[Verse 11]  
Once when very irate  
I shot my first mate, Israel Hans  
For a bit of pleasure, oh!  
And when my debt's grew  
Killed half of my crew  
To increase my share of the treasure, oh!  
  
[Verse 12]  
Was doing well then  
Seemed to run out of men  
My captives boarded at their leisure, oh!  
Smoted me dead  
Then cut off my head  
And displayed it on my mast for good measure, oh!  
  
[Outro]  
Smoted him dead  
Chopped off his head  
Displayed it on the mast for good measure, oh!

I bet you think the Stuarts were an English dynasty,  
But we only came to England when the crown belonged to me,  
Our clan may hail from Scotland  
But our tales are not a bonnie one, you'll see.  
  
We got the blue blooded blues,  
In our blue Stuart shoes,  
Each king queen and heir  
Had a personal nightmare,  
Have you heard the news?  
We got the blue blooded blues.  
  
Let's start with me, King Robert iii,  
Some say I was a fool,  
Once fell off my horse and hurt my self,  
Quite badly, how un-cool,  
Ended up with a limp,  
And limp was what they called my rule.  
(And I tell you for why).  
  
We got the blue blooded blues,  
Strapping sons, he had two.  
One in prison, starved in jail,  
The other captured, epic fail,  
The worst of kings, my review,  
I got the blue blooded blues.  
  
The next Stuarts all called James,  
But none was lucky Jim,  
James I hid down a sewer,  
Got caught by assassins.  
James ii was less unpopular,  
But killed by his own cannon so, pretty dim  
(And it doesn't end there. You're not wrong)  
  
We got the blue blooded blues,  
So many ways to lose.  
3 and 4 killed in battle,  
5 lost at war and that'll,  
Explain why we got confused,  
About the Stuart clan blues  
(Sing it Mary go on girl)  
  
I'm Mary queen of Scots,  
Misfortune I had lots  
To Queen Liz was a threat  
She threw me into prison yeah  
Still accused me of plottin'  
Can you see where I'm heading?  
Liz is a Tudor, take a guess  
Beheaded? Yeah!  
  
Well after queen Liz died,  
I was made King of England too.  
Became James the first in England,  
But the Stuart luck stayed true  
Guy Fawkes try to blow me up,  
And turn me into Stuart stew  
  
(One more time! Yeah! )  
We got the blue blooded blues,  
Not the role I would choose.  
With my son Charles a decapitee,  
We briefly killed off royalty,  
Stuart mourners it's true...  
Cause we're the blue blooded blues  
(That's what I'm talking about)

[Intro]  
Gonna cause a stink  
Won't be the first to blink  
I'm not who you think  
Don't mess with me, I'm Boudicca  
  
[Verse 1]  
My husband Presotagus died  
He was a Celtic king  
I was his queen, so due to me  
Was half of everything  
  
[Verse 2]  
Roman law gave half to me  
So half was what they got  
Till their nasty soldiers came  
And took the blessed lot  
  
[Verse 3]  
Hey mister  
I say you got the wrong end of the stick  
His answer turned this sister  
Into one angry chick!  
  
[Chorus]  
No man, Roman'll  
Push around this woman  
You won't get far, with Boudicca  
Foeman, yeoman,  
Smash the Roman foeman  
All say yah! Yah! Boudicca  
  
[Verse 4]  
I built a massive army  
Headed straight for the city  
Beat 'em all with ease  
And like me, it wasn't pretty  
  
[Verse 5]  
Chopped 'em and hacked but  
What made their red blood curl  
Bad enough being beaten  
But beaten by a girl?  
  
[Verse 6]  
Wacked 'em, smacked 'em  
Boy how we attacked 'em  
Near and far, ha ha ha!  
Flayed 'em, slayed 'em  
Up and down parade 'em  
Boudicca Toughest by far!  
  
[Hook]  
Colchester, London, St. Albans  
Everybody talk about dead Romans!  
  
[Verse 7]  
We marched on up the Roman road  
That's known as Watling Street  
They trapped us in the forest  
Then thrashed us to our defeat  
  
[Verse 8]  
By now you'd guessed I'm not the kind  
Of girl to sit and cry  
Be sold a slave to Romans?  
You know I'd rather die!  
  
[Verse 9]  
They tried to take me prisoner  
So I led the Roman boys on  
Instead of giving in to them  
I swallowed special poison!  
  
[Chorus]  
Martyr, smarter  
Capturer, non-starter  
This was our last hurrah!  
Slaughtered, dismembered  
Our tribe always remember  
Boudicca! Superstar!  
Boudicca! Superstar!

[Intro]  
I love to be a British queen  
I am Victoria, you see  
Now where's my British butler  
With my British cup of tea?  
Tea is not from Britain, ma'am  
From India it was brought  
Yes, for your cuppa, thousands died  
And many wars were fought  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, my British things  
It seems that tea is not  
British things, my British things  
Can I sweeten it a jot?  
  
[Verse 1]  
Do tell me sugar's British though  
No, it's Caribbean imported  
For sugar in your cup of tea  
Slavery's been supported  
I know it's wrong, your majesty  
But slaves in Africa  
Worked hard in fields of sugar cane  
To sweeten up your char  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, ah British things  
I thought that there were many  
British things, ah British things  
  
Afraid there's hardly any  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know your British cotton vest  
What's wrong with it?  
Explain!  
The cotton's from America  
And picked by... slaves again!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Your empire's built on fighting wars  
That's how your income's swollen  
Your British things are from abroad  
And most are frankly stolen  
  
[Hook]  
Whatever next? Go on! Pray tell!  
Our British queen is foreign as well?  
  
[Verse 4]  
It's true, I am of foreign descent  
And your husband, Albert? A German gent!  
At least I've got a British name  
Victoria's Latin... that's a shame!  
  
[Chorus]  
British things, ah British things  
There are no, we declare  
All our favourite British things  
Seem to come from elsewhere!

I'm Knox a famous surgeon  
And I earn my daily bread  
By studying cadavers  
Which are bodies not long dead  
One day two suave young gentlemen  
Appeared within my view  
I'm Mr Burke, I'm Mr Hare  
How do you do?  
These gents explained that their  
Acquaintance had just passed away  
It seemed the body'd only been  
A goner for a day  
Excuse the curious offer  
Said Hare or was it Burke?  
But would you care to slice this up  
To see how corpses work?  
Well it's always a palaver  
Getting hold of a cadaver  
So I said yes I'll ahve her  
Oh, it's a he!  
  
This body taught me much about  
What makes a person poorly  
Why some men live to 99  
And some die prematurely  
How these thing function perfectly  
And others won't repair  
How everything is, interlinked  
Oh what's that doing there?  
  
'Til one day there was nothing left  
And all my work was spent  
Then Burke and Hare turned up again  
My, how convenient!  
Another slab of fresh  
Human organs, bone and flesh  
Another gory sesh, excellent news  
(Laughs evilly)  
  
As time went on these kind men  
Brought me several guys and gals  
My lab was choca-block  
With all their freshly passed on pals  
I paid them lots of money  
Bodies came from everywhere  
You really are a busy Mr Burke  
And Mr Hare  
  
They seemed such cultured gentlemen  
I never did suspect  
That Burke and Hare were not so nice  
I really should have checked  
Then one day a policeman came  
Asked if I've seen a chap  
I hadn't, but days later  
His corpses turned up in my lap  
  
It seemed that these acquaintances  
Of Burke and Hare actually  
Were not their friends and  
Did not always die naturally  
Burke and Hare had murdered them  
It was plain to see  
Then brought the corpses to my lab  
And pocketed the fee  
  
The two men were arrested  
But one of them set free  
Poor Burke was hanged  
But happily his corpse was sent to me  
Oh bit wiffy!  
Still much to learn

[Intro]  
My name is, my name is  
My name is, Charles ii!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I love the people  
And the people love me  
So much that they restored  
The English monarchy!  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm part Scottish, French, Italian  
A little bit Dane  
But one hundred percent party animal  
Champagne?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Spaniels I adored  
Named after me too  
Like me, they were fun  
With a nutty hair do!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Is today my birthday?  
I can't recall  
Let's have a party anyway  
Because I love a masked ball!  
  
[Chorus]  
All hail, the king!  
Of bling! Let's sing!  
Bells ring! Ding ding!  
I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 5]  
King Charles, my daddy  
Lost his throne  
And kings were banned  
They chopped off his head  
Then Olly Cromwell ruled the land  
  
[Verse 6]  
Old Olly wasn't jolly  
He was glum, and he was proud  
Would be miserable as sin  
Only sinning's not allowed!  
  
[Verse 7]  
When Olly died, the people said  
'Charlie, me hearty!  
Get rid of his dull laws  
Come back, we'd rather party!  
  
[Verse 8]  
This action's what they called  
The monarchy restoration  
Which naturally was followed  
By a huge celebration!  
  
[Chorus]  
The King of Eng! (Land say!)  
No sin! Too sing! (Okay!)  
Or anything!  
All say, I'm the king who brought back partying!  
  
[Verse 9]  
Great London Fire was a whopper!  
In my reign, London city came a-cropper!  
So this king did what was right and proper  
Fought the fire, proved I'm more than a bopper  
I'm a fire stopper!  
  
[Verse 10]  
Married Catherine Braganza  
She was a love so true  
There would never be another  
Well... Maybe one or two!  
  
[Verse 11]  
Lucy Walter Nell Gwynne  
Moll Davies Barbara Villiers  
You think that's bad  
But her name's not as silly as  
Hortense Mancini!  
  
[Verse 12]  
As king, I must admit  
I broke the wedding rules  
But who cares when I brought back  
The crown jewels?  
I reinstated Christmas  
Make up, sports and even plays  
I was the merry monarch  
They were good old days!  
  
[Chorus]  
When said and done!  
King Charles did run!  
England for fun!  
I was the king loved by everyone  
My song is done!  
  
[Outro]  
Party anyone?

[Intro]  
Ra, ra, Cleopatra!  
Famous beauty coming at ya!  
Ra ra, patra Cleo!  
Guys all go gaga for me-o!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I am a leader  
And a lady and a queen  
I'm Cleopatra  
Such a queen, never been seen  
I am a pharoah  
Yet they're-o meant to be guys  
But I don't care-o  
I just wear-o beard disguise  
  
[Verse 2]  
My mum and dad were pharoahs  
I thought my rule's due  
But both my older sisters  
Thought that they should rule too  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh dear, they both died!  
I wonder who that would leave  
Little me-o, pharoah Cleo?  
Okay, no time to grieve!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Think that's alarming, you'd be right  
But it gets worse  
Married my half brother  
And we ruled the universe  
  
[Verse 6]  
That bad romance  
Led to an overcrowded throne  
But then he died, boo-hoo  
So now I rule alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  
All hail lady Cleo!  
Wah, wah, wah, la, la  
Coolest pharoah by far!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Fashion topped my list of vices  
Bathed in asses' milk and spices  
Then I dressed like goddess Isis  
Long, black hair in ringlets nicest  
Viper's tooth for men entices  
Finest linen robe, top prices!  
  
[Verse 8]  
Married another brother  
He's an okay geezer  
But never told  
Of my love for Julius Caesar  
  
[Verse 9]  
Had Caesar's child and hoped  
That he'd be crowned king  
My bro said no, I said 'Oh! '  
And I murdered him  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I am Cleopatra  
Egypt's royalty  
The ruling pharoah, don't you dare-o  
Mess with me!  
  
[Verse 10]  
My pokerface smiles  
Only when I see  
A man who takes my fancy like  
Oh! Mark Antony!  
  
[Chorus]  
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  
Another Roman leader  
Wah, wah, wah, la, la  
No Egyptian crowd pleaser  
  
[Chorus]  
Ra, ra, Cleopatra!  
Finally, I'd met my matcher!  
Ra, ra, patra Cleo!  
Ends in death for him and me-o!  
  
[Outro]  
My life was a drama  
I was one kooky mama!  
Wah, wah, wah, you know  
Today I'd be a favourite of the  
Paparazzo!

Deafeated by Octavian , who we , we don't respect  
Factum killed in Actum , as my poor Ant , has been decked  
Yeah , I was wrecked.  
Now it's T H E E N D  
I'm sure that spells the end for me  
Octavian will display me in a cage  
The world will gloat.  
I can't go on (sung for a long time till next line)  
Won't be paraded round the streets  
Octavian (long time)  
Not your extoic parakeet  
Won't your spoils from victory  
I'll spoil your party  
I can't go on (long time)  
(Antony)  
I'm miserable , I'm so depressed  
How did it  
Come to this  
Octavian don't like me  
Cause I dumped his  
Plain old sis.  
For Queen Isis  
(Cleopatra)  
I'm trying to sustain our rule  
Don't hold me up to ridicule  
Snap out of this , you moping fool  
You're not helping at all !  
(Antony)  
I can't go on (long time)  
Without my sweet Roman romance  
My love has gone  
Living alone , not in my plans.  
Octavian my boss ?  
I'd sooner eat my hair.  
I can't go on (long time)  
(Octavian)  
I must try and capture Cleo  
(Cleopatra)  
Octavian must not take me-o  
(Antony)  
She'll kill herself just for me ?  
She must adore me !  
( Cleopatra)  
I'll foil Octavian with this plot  
(Antony)  
She's dead ?  
(Cleopatra)  
Not yet I'm not !  
Octavian)  
She must not die (long time)  
So much more popular than me  
Cleopatra)  
And so I die (long time)  
Octavian)  
This'll look bad on my CV  
Antony and Cleo gone.  
What a blooming pair of drama queens ! (long time  
So all hail meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Everyone thinks they know the story  
Of Dick Turpin's highway glory  
But my past was far more gory  
Was no saint  
  
You think life is one big antic  
My profession is romantic  
Hate to be pedantic  
But it ain't  
  
HA  
  
As a butcher down in Essex I was handy with a knife  
Had a sideline as a poacher led a less than honest life  
  
The notorious gang of Gregory  
Liked my style and dedication  
They signed me up and gave me  
A real robber's education  
  
We rampaged through the Essex farms  
We stole and robbed and fought  
But when the law came for us  
I escaped and they got caught  
  
I became I highway man  
Was daylight robbery  
  
HA  
  
I was no prince charming  
Nothing dandy about me  
  
HA  
  
The truth is, I was violent  
And with my good mate, Matt King  
Robbed travelers at gunpoint  
Money, watches, anything!  
  
My horse wasn't called Black Bess  
Although that's what you've read  
Was no romantic hero  
Shot not one but two men dead  
  
The legend that surrounds me  
Misses out the crucial part  
I was a ruthless killer  
With a ruthless killer's heart!  
  
Was a vicious highwayman  
A source of pain and tears  
  
HA  
  
When you hear how my story ends  
You won't believe your ears  
  
HA  
  
I ran away to Yorkshire  
Changed my name to John Palmer  
Was sent to prison  
After stealing chickens from a farmer  
  
Wrote a letter to my family  
A plea it did relate  
The postman saw the envelope  
And here's the twist of fate  
  
He had taught me how to write  
So he'd knew I'd lied  
"that's not John Palmer's hand!  
That's Dick Turpin's!" he cried!  
  
Was a vicious highway man  
My crimes had brought me fame  
  
HA  
  
Was stitched up by a postie  
That's not glamorous  
THAT'S LAME!  
  
HA  
  
No more stand and deliver  
You'll remember this I hope  
  
HA  
  
It's no fun hanging with highwaymen  
When you're...  
  
Hanging from a rope!

Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.  
Some might say I ruined their lives.  
  
Catherine of Aragon was one  
She failed to give me a son.  
I had to ask her for a divorce  
That broke her poor heart, of course  
  
Young Anne Boleyn she was two,  
had a daughter the best she could do  
I said she flirted with some other man  
And off for the chop went dear Anne.  
  
Lovely Jane Seymour was three,  
The love of a lifetime for me.  
She gave me a son, little Prince Ed,  
Then poor old Jane, went and dropped dead.  
  
Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.  
Some might say I ruined their lives.  
  
Anne of Cleves came as four,  
I fell for the portrait I saw.  
Then laid on her face and cried, 'She's a horse! I must have another divorce.'  
  
Catherine Howard was five,  
A child of nineteen, so alive.  
She flirted with others, no way to behave.  
The axe sent young Cath to her grave.  
  
Catherine Parr she was last.  
By then all my best days were past.  
I lay on my deathbed aged just fifty-five,  
Lucky Catherine the last stayed alive.  
(I mean, how unfair!)  
  
Divorced, beheaded and died.  
Divorced, beheaded, survived.  
I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives.  
You could say I ruined their lives.

We are the Roundheads, we don't want kings no more,  
That's why we started the English civil war.  
People say we're no fun, but we disagree,  
Especially when explaining, parliamentary democracy.  
We are particularly excited by the notions of jurisprudence...  
  
That's enough dullness, we're the Cavalier crew,  
Supporting King Charles, and everything that he'll do.  
Puritans bore us, it's really a crime,  
When your parliamentary business cuts our partying time.  
  
Roundheads, soundheads, keep the music down heads,  
Rules and regulations led, dull but fair.  
Cavaliers three cheers, wackier head gears,  
We live to boogie with our peers. Unfair? Don't care!  
  
I am the king, I can do what I like,  
Start up a war, or a big tax hike.  
Got a French wife, she's a catholic.  
  
O law!  
Really King Charles, we're not quite sure!  
  
Insolence! Is that how you talk to the Crown,  
I am the King, I'll just close Parliament down.  
  
I'll think you find, that's in breach of due process.  
Here's what we say to that (spit) Now clear up this mess!  
  
Roundheads, soundheads, witches should be drowned heads,  
Don't believe in crowned heads, Parliament's our thing.  
Cavaliers three cheers, your superiors,  
We're all toffs who cry 'Here, Here' and 'God Save The King'.  
(That's me!)  
  
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!  
  
Cavaliers! Roundheads! The English Civil War!  
Why is it called 'civil'? May I kill you please? Sure!  
  
Love civil wars, to be fought on this land,  
If I get to power, Christmas will be banned.  
  
No chance Cromwell, victory will be mine,  
You'll never pass a ban on mince pies and mulled wine.  
  
That's what you think, just wait 'til you're caught,  
I'll also scrap theatre, music and sport.  
Your pathetic war will finish even before it's begun,  
We've taken Charles prisoner, the Roundheads have won!  
  
(Oh!)  
  
Victory three cheers, Cavaliers in tears,  
No power for years, I'm the leader of the pack!  
Charles head Roundhead, hurrah now the king's dead,  
Sins binned, instead a righteous track.  
(But we'll be back!)

Lead 1:  
The famous Roman Empire,  
  
Lead 2:  
Was the biggest, meanest neighbourhood.  
Lead 3:  
We four were the baddest emperors,  
  
Lead 4:  
And by Bad we don't mean Good!  
  
Lead 1:  
My name is Caligula  
A rotten, Roman pig-ula  
If you told me a fib-ula  
I'd hack your hands to stumps!  
One time, I killed a priest  
Who'd come to sacrifice a beast  
You'd think it's sad that he's deceased  
We all laughed like chumps!  
  
I'm very hairy, but take note  
If you so much as whisper "Goat!"  
With an iron rod you will be smote  
In a good mood today, so I won't slit your throat!  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 2-4:  
He's bad!  
  
Lead 1:  
A shameless rotten cad!  
Do you still have limbs since meeting me?  
Then I guess you should be glad!  
  
Lead 2:  
Your nastiness was fabulous  
But my name's Elagabalus  
And I was far, far worse  
Just listen to my verse  
I was quite notorious  
For catapaulting venomous  
Snakes at Rome's enormous  
Crowds, oh, how they fled  
If you won a lottery prize  
I'd give you bees, dead dogs and flies  
My house guests got a nice surprise  
A lion in their bed!  
  
You'd think to children, I'd be cuter  
No, I was their biggest executor  
Used their guts to read the future  
Says here I should get a job as a school tutor!  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 1,3,4:  
He's bad!  
  
Lead 2:  
Could argue I was sad!  
Hated through our empire  
From Great Britain to Baghdad!  
  
Lead 3:  
Afraid your claim is bogus  
'Cause my name is Commodus  
And no one else could be  
A worse emperor than me  
There never was a greater  
Pretend gladiator  
If the booing got too loud  
Made the lions fight the crowd  
Just one man was grander  
Julius Alexander  
So I killed him, see  
'Cause I'm the emperor, me  
  
I'm bad!  
  
Lead 1,2,4:  
He's bad!  
  
lead 3:  
My actions truly rad!  
You only got the emperor job  
'Cause you were chosen by your dad!  
  
Lead 4:  
To me, you all score zero  
My name is Emperor Nero  
Evil men you're not  
I'm the worstest of the lot!  
My rule was full of fear-o  
Yes, men from far and near-o  
Called me a fighting hero  
Or I would have them slayed!  
Changed the Olympic season  
So the medals went to me, son  
Burned Christians for no reason  
Just a fun game I played, you know  
  
Poisoned my stepbrother  
Ordered men to kill my mother  
Tried to drown her but she fled  
So I had her stabbed instead  
Wait! There's more!  
With my first wife, dear Octavia  
I showed truly bad behaviour  
Chopped her head off, gave it to  
My girlfriend who I then killed too  
  
I'm bad! So baddy!  
Of badness, I'm the daddy!  
Come on, I want to see  
A more evil bloke than me!  
  
Lead 1,2,3:  
You're bad! Real bad!  
Nothing more to add!  
We all thought that we were awful  
But you were really, truly mad!  
  
Lead 4:  
I'm the baddest emperor the Romans ever had.

[Verse 1]  
Greeks:  
In 776BC Olympics were begun  
Greece was the only country, so naturally we won  
Cheats built bronzes of God Zeus were we honest winners  
The answer's no we had more statues than you've had hot dinners  
Our games meant truce was called in war a peace every 4 years  
But wrestling was so violent that bouts could end in tears  
No girls allowed to watch or run that might sound rude  
But makes sense when I tell you we competed nude  
  
[Chorus]  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Love for Olympic heroes  
FLAME  
We'd like one next however  
Sadly it's Emperor Nero  
Hey watch it you two, alright  
  
[Verse 2]  
Emperor Nero:  
I went from Rome to Greece so I could play them at their games  
In 67AD you know I won Olympic fame  
Told them to include a contest based on poetry  
Not much good for sportsmen no, but brilliant for me  
Crashed my racing chariot but still awarded gold  
Hey my Olympics my rules  
To argue would be bold  
I won every medal that was up for grabs  
The crowd loved it well they had to or I would have had them stabbed, OK?  
  
[Chorus]  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Olympic champion that's me  
My games were emperors own round  
  
Greeks:  
FLAME  
  
Nero:  
Think I was bad in 393  
Christian Rome had them banned  
  
[Hook]  
all:  
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over  
  
Nero:  
  
SHAME  
  
[Verse 3]  
Baron de Coubertin:  
WAIT not so fast  
  
I'm Baron de Coubertin, a famous French historian  
I read of the Olympic Games thought I should try restoring them  
They'd be just like the old days I said but did propose  
That unlike Greeks Victorians should do them wearing clothes  
In 1896 we launched the games in dear old Greece  
Hoped it would make men more morale as well as less obese  
We built a stadium so we could start to play  
Games of the modern Olympics which we still have today  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
I'm on my personal glory  
But no-one remembers my name  
  
All:  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin:  
So here to finish our story  
A man who has gold plated fame  
  
[Verse 4]  
Jesse Owens:  
I'm Jesse Owens fastest man in 1936  
I took home 4 gold medals yeah, but that's just the basics  
What you should know about the fact I was victorious  
Is, it made Herr Hitler mad ha it made him furious  
Hitler said Berlin should be the games Germanic base  
So he could show the world Aryans were the master race  
I won in 4 events he had to back pedal  
His evil theory destroyed with every medal  
  
[Chorus]  
All:  
FLAME  
It's gonna burn forever  
Olympics are never in doubt  
FLAME  
A fire of sporting endeavour  
You realise it's actually gone out  
Olympic, Olympic  
FLAME

[Verse 1]  
I'm George IV, the regent king  
Which means I was just standing in  
Acting king because my dad  
George III had gone barking mad!  
(Banana)  
Great palaces, I did design  
Buckingham was one of mine  
Art and fashion, I so rated  
And wives? That's more complicated!  
  
[Chorus]  
Actresses and duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldn't stand my wife  
(He couldn't stand his wife!  
Go away!)  
  
[Verse 2]  
I only married Queen Caroline  
When my debts began to climb  
'Cause if I agreed to tie the knot  
I said I'd pay off the lot!  
  
[Verse 3]  
But the wedding caused all sorts of strife  
'Cause I already had a wife  
A divorced Catholic? Dad did sigh  
But the mad old goat just wouldn't die!  
(Still here! Oh, spoke too soon!  
At last, I can go solo!)  
  
[Verse 4]  
As true king, my reign began  
Though I was now older than your nan  
And as the ruler of our nation  
I banned my wife from my coronation  
  
[Verse 5]  
And knowing now that I did hate her  
She promptly died just three weeks later  
But all those pies that I got through  
Meant ten years later, I died too!  
(Hello, have we met? I'm a kangaroo!)  
  
[Chorus]  
Actresses, duchesses  
The great loves of my life  
I loved more girls than I ate pies  
But I couldn't stand my wife  
I had just ten years on the throne  
Do you remember that?  
No, all that you remember is...  
I was really fat!

A gorgeous georgian lady, is quite a sight to see,  
For some splendid beauty tips, pay attention listen to me.  
  
White is beautiful dear ladies, smear your face with paint of lead,  
Never mind the lead had made the men who mixed it I'll or dead.  
  
Take some silk of red or black, cut a circle or a cresent,  
Stick it on your face to cover, smallpox scars, it's much more pleasant.  
  
Shave your eyebrows, clean away, take a trap and catch some mice,  
Make false eyebrows with the mouse skin, stick them on, you'll look so  
Nice.  
  
Next you need a monster wig, if you want to look real smashing,  
Once your wig has reached the roof, then you'll be the height of fashion.  
  
Decorate your lovely hairpiece, use the feathers of a parrot,  
Add some ribbon, fruit and flowers, from your ear then hang a carrot.  
  
Make your face look soft and chubby, pack your mouth with balls of cork,  
Hang your flash teeth in the middle, hope you don't choke when you talk.  
  
Now you followed my advice, last of all you need a fan,  
Flutter it oh so demurely, then your sure to bag your man.

Sailors:  
Were the Georgian navy  
We've never been beat  
Thanks to Admiral Nelson  
Commander of the fleet  
  
Nelson:  
The only things I've lost is this eye and this arm  
  
Sailor:  
Yes, playing with these balls  
Can really do you harm (ow)  
He's the gaffe  
He's the boss  
Knows every naval trick  
Surprising thing about him is  
Sailing makes him sick  
  
All:  
Georgian navy  
Georgian navy  
This is gonna be your Waterloo  
Nelson's navy  
Nelson's navy  
We're gonna sink one more than you!  
  
Nelson:  
England expects every man to do his duty right  
  
Sailors:  
Your side's not just from England  
You trying to start a fight?  
  
Scottish sailor:  
I'm from Scotland  
  
Irish sailor:  
Ireland  
  
Welsh sailor:  
Wales  
  
A transfer from France:  
I transferred from the French  
  
All:  
We've even got West Indians sitting on the bench  
  
Nelson:  
Some of them were forced to sign some chose to join my crew  
  
sailors:  
We fight to get our win bonus  
Mostly we fight for you  
  
England (sort of)  
England (well, nah, it's not)  
We're gonna sink one more than you  
Rule Britannia  
Rule Britannia  
  
Nelson:  
When it comes to my attack the gunners are my team  
  
Gunners:  
We got the strongest arsenal the world has ever seen  
Thanks our team practice we are magic with a ball  
  
Nelson:  
It means the French and Spanish ships  
Don't stand a chance at All  
  
Sailors:  
We can get nasty injuries  
Sometimes it's best to die  
If you're hit by the enemy  
You're lucky to survive (Magic sponge? Magic saw!)  
  
Nelson:  
You've got to wait to fight  
Only do it when it's right  
Got to break their line  
They'll be swimming in the brine  
Pick your time to shoot  
Then they're ships we're going to loot  
Going to be a hoot  
For scurvy have some fruit  
  
Sailor:  
Half-time orange, anyone?  
  
All:  
Georgian navy  
Georgian navy  
  
Nelson:  
Won at Trafalgar but got shot (ow!)  
  
Sailors:  
Nelson's Navy  
Nelson's navy  
You think it's all over  
  
Nelson:  
(Kiss me, Hardy)  
  
Hardy:  
It is now!

Settle down, class  
Now you've passed  
Your grade one pyramid selling  
Yeah, the time has come  
For me to drum  
Some facts into you about spelling  
  
Oh, it seems to me  
Your abc  
Skills are less than terrific  
So buck up, boys  
As we master the joys  
Of the lovely hieroglyphics!  
  
Everyone needs their abc  
It's as simple as... Vulture, foot, basket  
You know how to sing doh-ray-me  
Easy to spell, it's... Hand, eye-thingy, owl  
  
Abc  
Vulture, foot, basket  
Doh-ray-mee  
Hand, eye-thingy, owl  
  
You'll pass with ease  
And find it's a breeze  
The rules are scientific  
Don't have to be smart  
All you do is start  
With simple phonetic glyphics  
  
Next you get two letters, a set  
More things called logographic  
Finally third, the form of a word  
Determinitives... Horrific!  
  
Everyone needs their... Flamingo, house, sun  
It's simple, but 'sun' can mean duck, everyone  
You all know how to write your name  
Except for me - Tutanephututakhamen  
  
Flamingo, house, sun  
Means duck to some  
Tutanephututakhamen  
Let's leave that one!  
  
If you find it hard, don't be afraid  
To go and ask your mummy for aid  
Now it's time for a spelling bee  
That's not how you spell bee, see me!  
Foot, reed, reed, easy!  
  
Cat, pig, dog, rat, dog, frog  
Make your spelling magnific  
You can go up and down  
Left and right and around  
No punctuation in hieroglyphics  
  
A, B, C, D, E, F, G  
Just seven hundred characters or so  
Now that's done  
Let's have some fun  
With numbers, here we go!  
  
Everyone needs their 1, 2, 3  
It's as simple as... Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye  
You can all count to ninety-nine  
Easy to write it's... Hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop, hoop  
Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye  
  
1, 2, 3  
Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye eye  
Ninety-nine  
Hoop hoop hoop hoop, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye...  
Basket?

[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We fight by day, and when it's not so bright  
We're not so bright!  
  
[Verse 1]  
We like to beat, and chop and stab our wicked enemy  
But all the time we try to stick to rules of chivalry  
Rule one, we have to do brave deeds for some great lady fair  
I'd write poems, I would joust, and I would fight a bear  
(Well, maybe a teddy bear. Oh, I can't! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We charge ahead, but never left or right  
We're never right!  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rule two, we have to practise in the noble art of war  
Battle for our king and country, that's what knights are for  
And if there is no war to fight, a-hunting we will go  
We hunt for deer and rabbits too, so long as they are slow  
(Otherwise we can't catch them! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
We are fighters and our armour's always tight  
And these swords aren't light!  
  
[Verse 3]  
Rule three, in war we aim to capture other knights alive  
Their families pay us lots of dosh so long as they survive  
We act like gentlemen, and only fight with other gents  
A real knight, he would never fight against peasants!  
(Anyway, peasants pong! Eurgh! )  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
And our only aim in life is to fight  
I'm a knight, I'm a knight and I'm a knight  
When we ride to war we're such a splendid sight  
We are a sight!

I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus,  
No rich man could ever surpass us.  
Wanted people to say I was brave,  
But I lost my first fight and hid in a cave.  
Living there could be a pauper's nightmare,  
But if you're rich like me then you don't care.  
I called my slave to the cave to ask it,  
To cook a feast and lower in a basket.  
  
Those Romans think they're minted,  
But they aint rich like me.  
You can't call yourself loaded,  
Till you can buy an army.  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,  
They're more famous than me.  
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,  
There's no-one richer than me.  
I'm minted!  
  
I back General Sulla,  
Everyday my wallet got fuller.  
Took the land off enemies to flog it,  
Used the cash to fill my pocket.  
If I heard of a house on fire,  
I'd rush over and be a quick cash buyer.  
My fireman would then douse the flames, boom!  
Another big house to my name.  
  
Those Romans think they're minted,  
But they aint rich like me.  
You can't call yourself loaded,  
Till you can buy an army.  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,  
They're more famous than me.  
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,  
There's no-one richer than me.  
I'm minted!  
  
I bought an army for fighting Spartacus,  
At the start my men lost heart-acus.  
I killed on in ten in a killing spree,  
So they were more scared of me than the enemy.  
Smashed the slaves, it got real gory,  
But then Pompey stole my glory.  
To show it was me that crushed the horde,  
Nailed up the slaves like on a billboard.  
They're splinted!  
  
Not enough to be a politician,  
Wanted triumph, took my army on a mission.  
Got owned by the Parthian Persians,  
They killed me, but you'll hear two versions.  
The famous one's quite hard to follow,  
They gave me boiling gold to swallow.  
But the true way they made me pay,  
They used my head as a prop in a play!  
Embarrasing!  
  
Those Romans think they're minted,  
But they aint rich like me.  
You can't call yourself loaded,  
Till you can buy an army.  
Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar,  
They're more famous than me.  
But I'm the worlds richest geezer,  
There's no-one richer than me.

Policeman:  
Everything your teacher says  
Is proved to be a fable  
There never was an Arthur  
Nor the knights, nor a round table  
The lady of the lake  
Was just a made up story too  
I hate to disappoint you all  
But it's not true!  
It's not true!  
  
Teacher, though you jibber  
You're just a great big fibber  
There was no Excalibur  
  
Teacher:  
Galahad?  
  
Policeman:  
No such lad  
  
Teacher:  
Lancelot?  
  
Policeman:  
Lance-not  
  
Teacher:  
Guinevere?  
  
Policeman:  
Dear, oh dear!  
  
Merlin:  
Look at me, I'm real enough!  
  
Policeman:  
Not true, Merlin! Disappear!  
There were no wizards, so it's clear  
That it's not true!  
  
Teacher:  
While we're on the subject  
I'm afraid I must confess  
Though dick Turpin was a highwayman  
He never owned Black Bess  
And Tutankhamen's tomb  
Was never hit by any curse  
There never was a dragon slain by George  
It gets worse!  
  
Pirates never made their victims  
Walk the plank on ships  
Sir Walter Raleigh wasn't first  
To bring back spuds or chips  
  
Policeman:  
Robin Hood and Marian  
A made up story too  
Outlaws out in Nottingham?  
It's not true!  
It's not true!  
  
Teach, you're such a liar  
Your pants are catching fire  
There never was a Friar Tuck  
  
Teacher:  
Viking hat?  
  
Policeman:  
No horn on that  
  
Teacher:  
King Alfred's cake?  
  
Policeman:  
Big mistake  
  
Teacher:  
It never fried?  
  
Policeman:  
The old books lied  
Frankly, I deplore ya  
I hope these kids ignore ya  
'Cause in fact, Queen Victoria  
Never said 'We are not amused'  
  
Victoria: (spoken)  
Your children think I said what?  
  
Teacher: (spoken)  
They think you said "we are not amused", your Highness  
  
Victoria: (spoken)  
Really? That's quite funny, isn't it?  
  
Policeman and Teacher:  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  
Ha, ha ha!  
It's not true, it's not true!  
It's not true, it's not true!  
It's not true, it's not true!  
It's not true!

Ok, pamplemousse, baguette and brie. Are you ready?  
  
I'm Joan Of Arc from Domremy, religious visions came ter me.  
God said 'Save France from the English' and make Dauphin Charles, king!  
Dauphin means heir to the throne, but England claimed the crown as their own.  
  
We had a hundred years of war. This girl had to do something!  
So I did it like a dude, cut my hair.  
Gave up wearing dresses, bought a pair.  
Of trousers, no blouses. Said I wanna fight Angleterre.  
  
Charles let me join the army, army, army.  
Know that might sound barmy, barmy, barmy.  
I proved impressive,  
Hit by an arrow a-a-and lived.  
  
English troops I over ranny, ranny, ranny.  
Defeated them at Patay, Patay, Patay.  
We saved Orle-eans and Charles was crowned tres bon!  
  
Me leading troops- a long shot,  
But I was a lucky mascot.  
Inspired soldiers with brav-er-y.  
Fought injured and sur-vived.  
  
But in 1430, Burgundians captured me!  
King Charles couldn't pay my ransom.  
No-one told me, why!  
  
Being prisoner was not my style, tried escaping from my capture's vile.  
But then the English who fought me, bought me! Made me stand, trial!  
  
So where was King Charlie, Charlie, Charlie?  
He'd given up and left me, left me, left me.  
In the Engli-ish snare.  
Whole thing so un-fair.  
  
They put me in a uh- hu? N-nunnery.  
They said don't be uh-hu? F-funnery.  
If you dress like a-a male.  
We'll put you in men's jail.  
  
Joan of Arc? You're charged with sorcery.  
You're just jealous cos God speaks ter me.  
Say you speak to saints? In this discourse? What language do they speak?  
French o'course.  
Pah! Now you're in prison, they have failed yer.  
I say it's God's plan that you're my jailer.  
Here's a trick question in that case. Do you think you're in God's grace... ?  
  
If I am not, may God put me there, and if I am, may God so keep me.  
  
Oh your smart remarks go round the houses.  
You're guilty of heresy.(and wearing men's trousers)  
  
Despite my testimony, mony, mony.  
Condemned for reasons phony, phony, phony.  
But my will did no-ot break.  
So they tied me to a-a stake.  
  
Burned alive was my destiny, tiny, tiny.  
And here is the irony, rony, rony.  
My death led France to put on war paint.  
And crush the English so now, I'm a saint.

It was the summer of 793  
When we sailed across the Great North Sea  
Comets crossed the skies that night  
Must have known something wasn't right  
  
We arrived upon your English shore  
And you offered friendship  
But we wanted more  
Yeah, so much more!  
  
We're tearing up this place tonight  
Literally!  
We're gonna set this sleepy town alight  
Literally!  
We'll kill and steal and burn and drink  
'Cause us vikings don't care what you think  
Woah oh oh!  
  
Let me in, won't you please  
We're here to raid your monasteries  
We're primed and ready to attack  
And we love how monks just don't fight back  
  
You'll die or become a slave to me  
Though our slaves often get chucked up in the sea  
If the boat's heavy! Yeah, yeah!  
  
You're gonna lose your head, my friend  
Literally!  
We're gonna getcha in the end  
Literally!  
And I'll drink a toast from your skull  
'Cause we're vikings and that's how we roll!  
  
(Play that axe, Ragnor!)  
  
We're gonna paint the whole town red  
Literally!  
With the blood of the dead  
Literally!  
We'll take everything that you own  
And get back on our ship, and go back home  
Woah, oh oh!  
  
We're going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We're going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We are going home  
Woah, oh oh!  
We are going home  
Woah, oh oh!

Me name Mary Seacole, famous nurse  
To de Crimean boys  
No, me not Florence Nightingale  
Dat mix up, me annoys  
  
Me learn me skills in Jamaica  
Where me mother nursed de sick  
And I tink it might be destiny child  
To be a war medic  
  
If you're coughing  
You should have a drink with it  
If your diet's poor  
You should really tink upon it  
  
If it's cholera,  
Rehydration's best for it  
If it's fever  
Better take some rest for it  
  
Wha-oh-oh, wha-oh-oh  
Wha-oh-oh-oh!  
  
When Crimean War broke out  
Me apply for Florence's crew  
She turn me down because me black  
Yep, weird I know but true  
  
History still says me name  
Cos me not one to moan  
Me ask me friend Thomas Day for help  
And set off on my own  
  
If you need it  
Put a massive plaster on it  
If you're bleeding  
Shouldn't be disaster for it  
  
If your leg broke  
Going to need a plaster on it  
If you're constipated  
Take oil of castor for it  
  
Wha-oh-oh, wha-oh-oh  
Wha-oh-oh-oh!  
  
Once here, in Crimea  
Me became a pioneer  
Me carpenters engineered  
A hotel at the new frontier  
  
Set up on the front line  
In 1855  
Independent woman  
Saving soldiers lives  
  
Welcome to the British Hotel!  
  
Me boarding house became de haunt  
Of de great and good  
Though it wasn't glamourous  
It was built of old bits of wood  
  
Supplied the troops with kits and clothes  
Served both de rich and poor  
Me nursed right upon de battlefield  
While Florence worked far from de war  
  
I'm a nursing lady  
Put a splint on it  
Me see a wounded man  
Better sprint to it  
  
Earned fame from de war  
And my stint in it  
But the Crimean shame  
Is me a skint from it  
  
When de War was done  
Me never have a dime  
Despite the work me do  
Bankruptcy was mine  
  
I'm a fierce lady  
Never fazed by it  
Wrote a book  
And earned funds raised by it  
  
Me hotel  
Men owed their lives to it  
Going down in history  
That's my prize for it!

I'm a welsh noble, I mobilised Wales against the English  
Fought King Henry Four because Wales abhorred English rule  
But my uprising, it went a bit wrong and this song tells the surprising tale.  
  
Owain Glyndwr!  
Welsh hero, of the hour!  
It all began 'cause my neighbour, a vindictive man,  
Baron Grey De Ruthen was spreading untrue things 'bout me!  
  
Said I was a rebel who planned to repel England's king,  
Not really true but more than a few were convinced.  
So, I decided, to take up the mantle, was given the handle of Prince.  
Of Wales!  
  
You don't have to be Welsh to feel Welsh pride.  
Even kingsman Henry Hotspur ended up on my side.  
We claimed Welsh ground, then in Hereford rain meant,  
The king nearly drowned, washed away in his tent.  
So partly thanks to Welsh weather,  
I was crowned, think I'm gunna dance now!  
  
I had great plans for new government, new law and churches.  
But Henry the Fourth had dried off and revenge was his game.  
We were defeated, he blocked supplies to Wales,  
Our crops failed and starvation came.  
  
Owain Glyndwr!  
My family sent to the tower.  
As Welsh towns fell, and we all know that never ends well.  
So I disappeared but my name is revered throughout Wales.  
  
Owain Glyndwr!  
Father of the fight for Welsh power.  
Welsh legend holds that should Wales ever need someone bold.  
I'll rise up to help them, I'm due, I'm six hundred years old!  
  
Henffych well i'are arwr mawr Cymru  
Owain Glyndwr!

I'm Pachacuti, the Incan lord  
All other tribes dreaded  
My name means 'he who shakes the earth'  
Not that I'm big-headed  
  
When it comes to claiming nearby lands  
I was the type to risk it  
But it's how I treat dead enemies  
That really took the biscuit  
  
I drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Turn teeth into charms  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Make flutes out of their arms  
(Pachacuti!)  
  
Once on a hillside, my troops hid  
To cause a rival strife  
And when they jumped out, it looked like  
The ground had come to life  
  
The rocks they are my warriors  
I then used to boast  
And that little lie helped us win wars  
But violence helped the most  
  
I drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Turn teeth into charms  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Make flutes out of their arms  
(Pachacuti!)  
  
If you were a rival chief  
We'd kill you fast and then  
We'd stuff you like a scarecrow  
But one for scaring men  
  
Then we'd rest your bony fingers on  
The stretched skin of your belly  
And in the breeze, they'd tap that tum  
Like a drummer, but more smelly!  
  
Drink from their skull  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Pull out their teeth whole  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
Use their skin as a drum  
(Do the Pachacuti!)  
I've never had so much fun!  
(Pachacuti!)

We're the pilgrim fathers  
You may have heard rather  
A lot 'bout our notions  
Crossing the ocean  
On the good ship Mayflower  
But it's true our journey  
Turned into quite a commotion.  
  
People report that we sported these hats  
But that's not true, I mean, would you?  
Anyway the main thing to say  
We began the usa  
Our little band of religion fans  
From the East Midlands.  
  
We all believed slowly  
That England was becoming less holy  
So set off for Holland  
Cause there we had friends  
But in the end seemed the Netherlands  
Would never be the land, we planned.  
  
Couldn't stand to remain on that terrain  
So again we rearranged  
To start a new nation with our congregation  
A new and calmer life took a farmer and a builder and his wife  
And a clerica, to find America.  
  
Oh it's a new world  
It wasn't new to the natives  
Still we thought we'd claim it  
Yeah, it's the new world.  
  
I still remember 9th of November  
The year 1620 and we saw plenty of land  
We thanked God when we found ground  
I kept calm but it didn't go as planned.  
  
Couldn't land on the sand  
A month later though, we made it  
New Plymouth man, we claimed it  
The natives said not  
But ran when we shot.  
  
Moved there it proved yeah  
That life would be tough  
Cause we didn't have enough  
Of the right stuff.  
Did you know had no seeds we could grow  
Although William Mullins had stacked  
126 pairs of shoes in his pack  
Now that's whack.  
  
A fishing rod, a plough,  
A pig, or a cow  
Would have been a much better idea  
But now there's no food for us to eat  
Does this mean that we'll meet with de feet!  
  
No fun in the new world  
I'm glad we've arrived here  
But will we survive here  
Yeah, in the new world.  
  
People were staving  
Our numbers halving  
And when the winter winds blew  
Even fewer live through  
It wasn't pretty in our new city  
But the natives took pity even though  
They didn't have to.  
  
Man called Squanto  
Showed us how to grow maize  
Catch eel for a meal  
Build shelter in the baze  
Tribe gave us a feast  
Our starvation ceased  
What they had done  
Turned us back from the dead  
To the living and to this day  
That's why we have thanks-giving.  
  
In Massachusetts built a colony it's true  
They say modern America was founded by our crew  
It's a new world  
But we can't call it England  
Let's call it New England  
Yeah, in the world.  
  
My home was in Plymouth  
Lets call it New Plymouth  
I got an idea let's call this New Hampshire  
Wait I'm from Newcastle  
Can we call it New Newcastle?  
Nah!  
It's a new world.

I was sure that you'd love me  
To that hope, I did cling  
'Cause I'm... Richard the third  
And... Everybody loves a king!  
  
Thought I did a good job  
Why do you disagree?  
There's a lot of people  
Spreading nasty rumors 'bout me  
Every word is a lie  
So I'm singing this song  
'Cause the history books  
Have been telling it wrong!  
  
I Never had a limp  
Always walked my full height  
Never had a hump  
And my arm was all right  
Never took the crown  
With the ilegal power  
Never killed my nephews  
The princes in the tower  
Tudor propaganda  
It's all absurd  
Time to tell the truth  
'Bout King Richard the third  
  
My brother Edward, died  
His kids too young to rule  
So... I took the throne  
Why not? I'm nobody's fool!  
  
Thomas More wrote a history  
Said I'd murdered Edward's boys  
Shakespeare said their death  
Was an evil ploy  
But I say those two  
Are historical vandals!  
They've ruined my image!  
I mean, what a scandal!  
  
Never bumped off  
Those harmless young heirs  
Never buried them  
Under the Tower of London stairs  
Never poisoned my wife  
Bumped off her daddy  
This is me, sweet Richard  
Do I look like a baddy?  
Never was two-faced  
Sure you'll agree  
I was misunderstood  
King Richard three  
  
Can you imagine it?  
I'm the last Plantagenet  
Beaten by Henry  
In the Wars of the Roses  
The Tudor dynasty  
Didn't care that much for me  
Now I'm painted as a baddy  
That's why one supposes... (continues while next verse is sang)  
  
Never forget  
When you hear of my crimes  
Never drowned my brother  
In a massive vat of wine  
Never said 'a horse!  
My kingdom for a horse! '  
Who made that up?  
Why, William Shakespeare, of course!  
  
Now my tale is told  
You won't hear a bad word  
About a special ruler  
King Richard the third  
Arg it's a wasp it's a wasp

Today I'm starting High School  
Where boys are turned to men  
I packed my sword and shield  
We don't use paper and pen  
Everyone's a jock here  
We don't have Spartan nerds  
The weedy kids were left to die  
As breakfast for the birds  
  
We're taught to love a fight  
We're taught not to be meek  
And if we're good they feed us  
Three square meals every week  
  
Let's go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
A Spartan kindergarten  
I'm the boss that's understood  
I smack them if they're naughty  
And I thwack them if they're good  
I'm feeling rather peckish  
I'm gonna steal some food  
Caught! I'll have to punish you  
Ungrateful Spartan brood  
  
We promise not to steal  
We're not the thieving sort  
Stealing is considered good  
What's bad is getting caught  
  
Let's get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School  
  
We have a bunch of contests  
To see who is the best  
The leanest, meanest,  
Roughest, toughest Spartan contest  
This one is my favourite game  
Lashings of good fun  
Didn't feel a thing  
I want my mum  
  
We passed our last exam  
And it's Spartan graduation  
Straight away we go to work  
No time for celebration  
Ten years active service  
In the army  
No diversion  
There's only one job for a Spartan  
Killing lot's of Persians!  
  
Wondering about love?  
It's banned until you're thirty  
High School doesn't teach romance  
It teaches fighting dirty  
  
Let's go fighting now  
Fighting is exciting now  
Rocking at the Spartan School  
  
Let's get beating now  
Learn lies and cheating now  
Rolling at the Spartan School!

I'm sure you've heard the Stone Age occurred,  
For two and a half million years.  
But there's more of Stone Age to engage,  
Than maybe it first appears.  
  
Dinosaurs, Neanderthals,  
Let's make this clearer.  
Didn't live together,  
Came from different eras.  
That's not all I can tell you,  
So much more to be known.  
About the many phases,  
In the ages of stone.  
  
Shooby-dooby-doo-wap  
  
It's all the rage.  
  
To skiddly-bap-doo-wa  
  
Brush up on your Stone Age.  
  
Oh yeah! All right!  
  
It's fine to define,  
An era Palaeolithic.  
But you're gonna have to be,  
A little more specific.  
Do you mean lower,  
When ancient beings first used tools?  
Or middle Palaeolithic,  
When Neanderthal ruled?  
  
That's when Homo sapiens,  
Starts to emerge.  
But just in Africa,  
It's long before the global surge.  
Not till upper Palaeolithic,  
Forty thousand years ago.  
Did Neanderthal and Homo sapiens say hello,  
Neanderthal and Homo sapi,  
Living in caveman harmony.  
  
Language was invented,  
Cave painting art.  
Then Palaeolithic ended,  
Which meant the start.  
Of phase two-be-doo-be-doo-wap  
  
Turn a new page.  
  
Skiddly-bap-doo-wah  
  
Buck up on the Stone Age.  
  
Oh yeah! All right!  
  
This is where it starts to,  
Get all scientific.  
Palaeolithic's followed by,  
The era Mesolithic.  
Then Neanderthals are wiped out,  
By the ice age - horrific!  
After which the Neolithic age,  
Was terrific.  
  
Man learned to farm,  
Built homes so they could settle.  
Then some other folks turned up,  
And they discovered metal.  
Beaker men from Europe,  
Found bronze and outgrown.  
The simple and traditional ways of stone.  
  
Bronze Age was invented,  
By now man was flying.  
'Cause hot on it's heels,  
Came the age of iron.  
Celts, Druids,  
Religion then Rome.  
By now a distant memory,  
Those ages of stone.  
  
Shooby-dooby-doo-wap  
  
Since that metallic stage.  
  
Skiddly-bap-doo-wah  
  
There was no more Stone Age.  
  
Shooby-dooby-doo-wap  
  
Now you know what is known,  
About the many phases of the ages of stone  
  
Yeah! All right!

George I:  
I took the throne of England  
Just 'cause I was protestant  
A German prince whose English stank,  
King George number one  
  
George II:  
I like to argue, now that's clear  
Especially with my father here  
And when he died of diarrhoea  
I fought with my son  
  
George III:  
I broke records with my sixty year reign  
  
George VI:  
And I broke the scales with my giant frame  
  
all:  
Born to rule over you  
King George four, three, one and two  
You had to do what we told you to  
Just because our blood was blue  
  
George I:  
I was a hunk, girls adored me  
Ladies all swooned before me  
They would do anything for me  
Or I'd have their husbands killed  
  
George II:  
Had a war with Prince Charles Bonnie  
  
George III:  
Everyone said that I was f-f-funny  
  
George IV:  
I spent everyone's money  
  
All:  
Our subjects were not thrilled  
  
George I:  
I was the sad one,  
  
George II:  
I was the bad one  
  
George III  
I was the mad one,  
  
George IV:  
and I was the fat one  
  
All:  
We were born to rule over you  
Georges one, three, four and two  
England's kings, though we were German too  
Him, then him, then me, then you  
  
(We were born)Born to rule over you(born 2 rule)  
  
George I:  
Gorged on fruit then I died on the loo  
  
ALL:  
People hated us, and we hated them too  
Born to rule over you  
  
Born to rule over you  
  
George III:  
Me I was as batty as a bonkers kangaroo  
  
George IV:  
Me I would have been more at home in a zoo  
And now, now our song is through.  
  
Yeah...  
  
Georges  
  
George III:  
Banana

Well, I'm a real life cowboy  
Just a quiet, humble fella  
That's what we're like  
Apart from Mike  
Yeah, I'm more of a yeller!  
  
Sing songs to pass the evenings  
And because it soothes the herd  
So they won't stampede  
Unless Mike sings lead  
And shouts every single word!  
  
(Mike!)  
  
(Sorry!)  
  
'Cause we're cowboys  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on your tv  
We've never held up banks at all  
We're poorly paid  
And kinda small  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Stick with me!  
  
On your horse for eighteen hours  
And that saddle sore's a curse  
Then you feed your horse  
And yourself, of course  
Though beans just make it worse!  
  
Then you're back driving cattle  
That's what being a cowboy means  
Moving those beasts from west to east  
Sorry, it's the beans!  
  
'Cause we're cowboys  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you've seen in the movies  
We're not big hunks like that John Wayne  
'Cause our horses would complain  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Join us please!  
  
You should be aware  
We have some customs that are strange  
Like saying 'Howdy! ' not 'Hello'  
When you're out here on the range  
  
Never touch a cowboy's hat  
Never ride his horse  
So what would happen if I took your old mare?  
Well, I'd shoot you, of course!  
  
(Fair enough!)  
  
Cowboys,  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on silver screens  
We didn't go out starting fights  
'Cause unions fought for our rights  
Now Mike will do a solo thanks to beans!  
  
(How was that?)  
  
(It stunk!)  
  
And now my friend, I fear  
That the end is drawing near  
'Cause we only ruled the range for twenty years!

Welcome to our monastery  
Please have a chair  
Good to see you monks  
So deep in prayer  
Once the praying's finished  
Your chores must be done  
The main rule of a good monk's life is no fun  
  
We have to pray eight times a day  
Seven days a week  
And copy all these manuscripts  
In writing so antique  
I'll finish off this letter 'a'  
Once I've ploughed our field  
Milked the cows, mucked the sows, vegetables peeled  
  
I'll be doing that and praying too  
Very well gents, I'll bid you adieu  
Advenium regnum tuum  
  
(Okay brothers, I think he's gone)  
  
Now the bishop's not around  
Throw off these religious gowns  
Hunky, chunky, funky monks  
Get down!  
  
It's not all hymns and prayin'  
It's not all work and no playin'  
So let's start misbehavin'  
And get with the funk!  
  
We love to have a party  
Eat food that is hearty  
Let's get the boozin' started  
Drunk like a monk!  
Play that monky music, funk boy!  
  
Just wanted to check  
That during my absence  
You're honouring your  
Mealtime vow of silence  
  
Althought we didn't oughter  
We liked to hunt and slaughter  
Don't need no bread and water  
Just funk, funk, funk!  
  
Monastery is jumpin'  
Party beat is thumpin'  
Just lacks a certain somethin'  
A funky nun!  
Get in the party habit, girlfriend!  
  
It's true that life  
Is tough here  
But you obey the rules  
That is clear  
That's why we're a place  
Of great repute  
What's this?  
I see we have a new recruit  
Welcome to our monastery  
What's your name?  
  
She- he can't talk  
And his name is... Wayne  
Amen!  
Ah men!

Of Egyptian Kings we know oh so many things,  
Cause the archaeologists have dug their tombs.  
Now we're here to show, how to treat a dead pharaoh,  
Make a mummy that can decorate you room.  
  
First your dead kings lain on a table where his brain,  
Is pull out with a wire through his nose!  
Then his guts and lungs, stomach, liver must be bunged,  
In four jars so they do not decompose.  
  
Pour out salt to dry on the body, let it lie,  
There for forty days until it mummifies.  
In the bandage wrap up the body leave a gap!  
For the mouth and pop in artificial eyes.  
  
In the coffin cold lay out prayers in little scrolls,  
That will guard him on his journey far ahead.  
Pack his tomb with wealth, Which he'll need for his health,  
If he makes it to the country of the dead.  
  
Now you've done your job, there are villains who will rob,  
So our mummy and it's coffin we defend.  
Build a pyramid high, so it points up to the sky!  
Place your dead king deep inside and that's the end.

[Intro]  
Twas the age of queen Victoria  
A period notorious  
So many brand new goods we did create.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Our list is long and glorious,  
Though I don't intend to borious  
Was a time of great invention  
  
Was it really? What did we invent then?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well I'm just about to mention,  
Drum roll please lets raise the tension  
We invented this. Music hall.  
  
Is that all?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Well...  
A chap called Henry Bessemer invented molten steel  
Which led to other chaps creating the automobile  
Which let to petrol, tires and bikes so all that was required  
Was roads so concrete came and tarmac thought up to  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your hired!  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooooh. Concrete, tarmac, steel.  
The automobile  
Seal of rubber wheel  
Such inventive zeal  
Still there's plenty to reveal.  
  
[Verse 5]  
Victorian brains worked over time to come up with ideas.  
We invented lights bulbs.  
Nice one!  
Cheers!  
  
[Verse 6]  
Type writers and radios, now news was fast conveyed. Hello?  
A telephone was no good till a second phone was made. Hello!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Our inventors did not snooze,  
Always had another rouse.  
The latest flushing loo  
Films that did amuse.  
Flashbulb cameras to use.  
  
[Hook]  
What a picture! What a picture!  
  
[Chorus]  
Vacuum cleaners, toilet paper, postboxes and stamps  
Toilets, aspirin, anesthetics, locks, electric lamps.  
Sewing machines, X-rays, comics, ice cream in a pot.  
Easter eggs and rockets, we invented the whole lot.  
  
Ooo... !  
  
Hang on there's more  
  
[Chorus]  
Trains and lines and bridges and the underground as well.  
Paddle steamers prams and disinfectant for their smell  
Sterile doctors instruments, one last unmentioned brand.  
Victorians invented the worlds first conveyor band.  
  
[Bridge]  
Cuddly toy?  
Invented 1902. The year after Victoria died.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oooohhh, barometers were new  
Iron ships a coo  
What genius!  
Thank you.  
Seems we're almost through  
  
[Outro]  
Just one little oversight...  
[Boom]  
We... Invented... Dynamite.

My name is Shakespeare, William  
I owned a feather quill, I am  
The writer most familiar to you  
  
My way with words amazes me  
Came up with so many phrases me  
That still the number dazes me too  
  
Oh, "You've got the be cruel to be kind"  
"If truth were known", "Love is blind"  
Yet each of these quotes you will find  
It's what I do  
  
"Seen better days" (That's one of his)  
Ah, "Salad days" (He is the biz)  
"All the world's a stage"  
They call me Billy Whizz  
  
May seem kind of scary  
I'm a walking dictionary  
Sturdy with the wordy Shakespeare
