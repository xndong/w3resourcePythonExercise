Life's good, friends are hard to find and now one of mine is dead.  
And things I should have said to her, I shall say to you instead.  
Mona, Mona, so much of you to love, too much of you to take care of, Mona,
Mona.  
You got too big to keep and too damn old to eat.  
  
When you where just a football at your mama's side,  
I reckon everyone figured you for a barbecue when you died.  
And here I'm thinking about you lying underground pushing up a pine tree in my
field.  
Oh, Mona, Mona, you can close your eyes. I've got a twelve-gauge surprise
waiting for you.  
  
Since the day she passed away, everything's just the same.  
Everywhere I go, somebody mentions her name.  
Sometimes it's easiest to tell a friend a lie, they don't understand the way I
feel.  
Oh, Mona, Mona, so much of you to love, too much of you to take care of, so
long.  
  
Now she is gone and I am left alone as you can see.  
But ever since I caused her death, I do miss her company.

When I was just a child, my life was,  
Oh, so simple.  
And the ways of the great world  
Seemed strange and funny.  
Then when I was a young man,  
I learned of that machine  
That turns out all those bails of precious money.  
  
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money,  
Oh, that money machine.  
Now you can measure you manhood by it.  
You can get your children to try it.  
You can bring your enemies to their knees  
With the possible exception of the North Vietnamese.  
It takes a strong hit from the money machine, sitting on top, on top of the
world.  
Strong hit from the money machine,  
Sitting on top, on top of the world.  
  
Oh, General Motors and IBM.  
AFL-CIO and all the king's men.  
When I began the game,  
See me singing about the fire and rain.  
Let me just say it again,  
I've seen fives and I've seen tens.  
It was a strong hit from the money machine, Sitting on top, on top of the
world.  
Strong hit from the money machine,  
Sitting on top, on top of the world.  
  
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, ha ha
ha.  
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.  
Give me that dough, give me that dough, give me that dough, give me that
dough.  
  
Been living in the lap of luxury too long.  
Please, Mr. DJ, won't you play my song.  
Maybe my baby will listen on the radio.  
Come back home to me, help me spend my dough.  
I need a strong hit from the money machine. Sitting on top, on top of the
goddamn world.  
Strong hit, babe, from the money machine, woo, sitting on top, on top of the
world.  
  
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.  
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.  
From that money machine.

Mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
Oh, mud slide, i'm dependent on you  
I don't know but i've been told  
There's a time from time to time  
I can't eat, i can't sleep  
But i just might move my feet  
'cause there's nothing like  
The sound of sweet soul music  
To change a young lady's mind  
And there's nothing like a  
Walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind  
Mud slide i'm depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon  
  
I've been letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
Yes, i'm letting the time go by  
Letting the time go by  
  
I'm gonna cash in my hand and  
Pick up on a piece of land  
And build myself a cabin back in the woods  
Lord, it's there i'm gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts to changing for the good  
Now the reason i'm smiling is over on a island  
On a hillside in the woods where i belong  
I want to thank jimmy, jimmy, john, nick and laurie  
The no jets construction for setting  
Me down a homestead on the farm  
  
Mud slide, i'm depending upon you  
Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon

Things may always stay the way they are,  
Still my head looks for a change  
From time to time.  
I don't really mean to look that far  
Turn on the music, strike up the music,  
Let the music change my mind.  
  
Now don't I dig the big time rock and roll.  
Sit in the darkness and be somebody else.  
A time which after all is under control  
Crank out the music,  
Give me music, let the music fill the air.  
  
My dear friend, your head's been sinking  
Like a stone.  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime.  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime.  
There's a symphony inside you,  
There's a thousand things for you to do,  
So come on.  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd.  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so.  
What I hear in here is violins  
Give me music, miss the music,  
Let the music be there too.  
I'll never know what to do  
Unless you let the music be there too.  
  
You see this man his head's been sinking  
Like a stone.  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime.  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime.  
There's a symphony inside you,  
There's a thousand things for you to do,  
So come on.  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd.  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so,  
Well, you know, what I hear in here is violins  
Strike up the music, lay on the music  
Let the music be there, too.  
Never know what to do unless you  
Let the music be there too.

Watch my back and light my way  
(My traveling star, my traveling star).  
Watch over all of those born  
St. Christopher's Day  
(Old road dog, young runaway).  
They hunger for home but they cannot stay,  
They wait by the door,  
They stand and they stare.  
They're already out of there,  
They're already out of there.  
  
My daddy used to ride the rails  
(So they say, so they say).  
Soft as smoke and as tough as nails  
(Boxcar Jones, old walking man).  
Coming back home was like going to jail.  
The sheets and the blankets  
And babies and all,  
No, he never did come back home,  
Never that I recall.  
  
Never mind the wind,  
Never mind the rain,  
Never mind the road  
Leading home again.  
Never asking why,  
Never knowing when,  
Every now and then,  
There he goes again.  
  
She had a cat and a dog named Blue  
(My traveling star, my traveling star).  
A big old stove and a fireplace, too  
(Old road dog, young runaway).  
She told me loved me like it was true.  
I knew I should stay,  
I knew I would go.  
Run, run, run away.  
Run, run, run away, boy.  
  
Run before the wind,  
Run before the rain,  
Over yonder hill,  
Just around the bend.  
Never knowing why,  
Never knowing when,  
Every now and then,  
There you go again.  
  
Tie me up and hold me down  
(Oh, my traveling star).  
Bury my feet down in the ground  
(Oh, old road dog).  
Claim my name from the lost and found  
And let me believe this is where I belong.  
Shame on me for sure for one more highway song.  
My traveling star, my traveling star...

Mount up, move on,  
May you find the way back home.  
  
Down and down we go,  
Down into bright October,  
Brothers in arms no more  
Now that the war is over.  
Have you waded in  
And been to hell?  
Will you lie upon the sofa,  
See to the decoration of your shell  
Now that the war is over?  
  
Mount up, move on,  
Damn the darkness,  
Speed the dawn,  
They lost, we won.  
Try to find  
Your way back home, native son.  
  
Down and down we go,  
Down into bright October,  
Brothers in arms no more  
Now that the war is over.  
Have you waded in  
And been to hell?  
Will you lie upon the sofa,  
See to the decoration of your shell  
Now that the war is over?  
  
Mount up, move on,  
Damn the darkness,  
Speed the dawn,  
They lost, we won.  
Try to find  
Your way back home, native son.

We were ring-around-the-rosy children  
They were circles around the sun  
Never give up, never slow down  
Never grow old, never ever die young  
  
Synchronized with the rising moon  
Even with the evening star  
They were true love written in stone  
They were never alone, they were never that far apart  
  
And we who couldn't bear to believe they might make it  
We got to close our eyes  
Cut up our losses into doable doses  
Ration our tears and sighs  
  
You could see them on the street on a Saturday night  
Everyone used to run them down  
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight  
Not enough tough for this town  
  
We couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole  
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all  
They were glued together body and soul  
That much more with their backs up against the wall  
  
Oh, hold them up, hold them up  
Never do let them fall  
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin  
That names us and claims us and shames us all  
  
I guess it had to happen someday soon  
Wasn't nothing to hold them down  
They would rise from among us like a big baloon  
Take the sky, forsake the ground  
  
Oh, yes, other hearts were broken  
Yeah, other dreams ran dry  
But our golden ones sail on, sail on  
To another land beneath another sky

Everybody knows that I'm just a Joe that likes to hang around,  
Talking about my problems, bringing other people down.  
Well this may be so, but not long ago, I was sitting on the top of the world.  
Sure is strange how things can turn themselves around.  
  
When I'm in need of a little bit of consultation, used to call on my Uncle
John.  
Took a trip down to West Virginia, found him dead and gone.  
And as some sort of silly little consolation, they gave me a ticket back.  
What you gonna do with folks like that?  
  
You can talk about bands of angels,  
And they think you come with your soul in your hands to set their children
free.  
But you talk about little bit of understanding, things that happen day to day.  
Some of you folks sure enough have been good to me.  
  
You come on talking about angel bands,  
And they think you come with your soul in your hands just to set their
children free.  
But you talk about little bit of understanding, things that happen day to day.  
Someone has been good to me.  
  
Nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you.  
Nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you, nobody but you.  
Nobody but you, say nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody but you.

I'm not much for making little wishes,  
But I'd like a little wish  
To come true for you.  
I'm not talking about loaves and fishes  
But I wish that there was something  
I could do for you.  
Here's a little bit of cheap advice  
To be taken in an hour of need,  
Don't assume that the life you left  
Is the life you have to lead.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
I'd like to know who's knocking on door,  
I'd like to know what they come here for.  
You'd like to say no but the words won't come,  
Come in and sit down,  
Seem to roll off your tongue.  
You forget to remember,  
To never die young,  
One kiss leads to another.  
Brother when you come back home,  
Standing in line, all of your friends,  
Standing in line, party never ends,  
Standing in line, the river flows,  
The river bends,  
Standing in line, all of your friends.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
And that moon will be shining in  
The trees all night long,  
Something bound to happen for sure.  
Soon you'll be stopping by  
Talking to a friend again,  
Swear you ain't never tasted nothing so pure.  
  
When you come home, what you gonna do  
Oh brother, oh brother.  
Don't you try to deny what you know to be true,  
The same mess of misery  
That you done been through,  
Standing in line and it's waiting for you.  
One kiss leads to another, brother,  
When you come back home.  
  
When you come home,  
Your friends are dropping by,  
When you come home,  
The moon is gonna shine.  
When you come home,  
I tell you no lie,  
When you come home,  
They're gonna offer you a line.  
Standing in line, all of your friends,  
Standing in line, party never ends now.  
Standing in line, the river flows,  
The river bends,  
Standing in line, all your so called friends.  
Standing in line, when you come home,  
Standing in line, oh brother, oh brother now.  
Standing in line, when you come home,  
Standing in line, what you're gonna do now?

Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee,  
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see.  
It did rain all night the day I left, the weather was bone dry.  
The sun was so hot I froze myself, Suzanne, don't you go on and cry.  
I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me,  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee.  
  
Well I had myself a dream the other night when everything was still,  
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne, she was coming around the hill.  
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her eye.  
I said, that I come from Dixie land, Suzanne, don't you break down and cry.  
I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me,  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee.

They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walking down that street  
And you ain't had enough to eat  
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere  
  
They say the girls are something else on Broadway  
But looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause how ya gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime?  
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes  
  
Ha! They say that I won't last too long on Broadway  
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say  
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway  
  
Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)  
On Broadway (on Broadway)

Long ago, but not so very long ago,  
The world was different, oh yes it was.  
You settled down and you build a town and made it live,  
And you watched it grow, it was your town.  
  
Time goes by, time brings changes, you change too.  
Nothing comes that you can't handle so on you go.  
You never see it coming, when the world caves in on you,  
On your town, there's nothing you can do.  
  
Main street isn't main street anymore.  
Lights don't shine as brightly as they shone before.  
To tell the truth, lights don't shine at all,  
In our town.  
  
Sun comes up each morning, just like it's always done,  
Get up, go to work, and start the day.  
You open up for business, it's never gonna come,  
As the world roles by, a million miles away.  
  
Main street isn't main street, anymore.  
No one seems to need us, like they did before.  
It's hard to find a reason left to stay,  
But it's our town, We love it anyway.  
  
Come what may, it's our town.

I was raised up family, man,  
I'm glad I'm on my own.  
I was raised up family, man,  
I'm glad I'm on my own.  
I mean, God bless the child  
That can learn to live alone, yeah.  
  
Thinking about my cousin,  
What it was that did him in.  
Could it have been that whiskey,  
Rotgut, bootleg, bathtub gin?  
It's like it took a lot of liquor  
Just to let him live in his own skin.  
  
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina,  
You got to ride it on back  
In Raleigh, North Carolina.  
  
The ship set down on the shore  
Of this uncharted desert island,  
Me and my people fanned out,  
I guess we settled down a little while.  
Ah, but the devil came with the dark days  
Of winter, man, the children ran wild.  
  
I used to know why, no, I don't know why anymore.  
I used to know why, no, I don't know why no more.  
  
I get to wonder at the Kundalini thunder,  
Down under my floor.  
  
You got to ride it on back,  
Take me back.  
Back in Raleigh, North Carolina, yeah,  
Do you want to go?  
Way back in Raleigh, North Carolina.

We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song  
Sing along.  
Time to time I tire of the life that I've been leading  
Town to town, day by day  
There's a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins.  
There are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song  
Forever standing by the cross road.  
Take a side and step along.  
We are sailing away on a river to the sea.  
Maybe you an me can meet again.  
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song.  

It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
I'm going to make a lot of money  
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry  
  
He tried hard to help me  
You know, he put me at ease  
And he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
Now I've gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on

Mama knows and papa knows  
That rock 'n roll is music now.  
Baby's been cutting his teeth on Bo Diddley's,  
I'm a man, man,  
Listen to the Wolfman howl.  
See the white man sailing his ship up on the sea,  
Watch the white man shackle the black man to a tree.  
To the invader go the fruits of war,  
He misses home and his boots are sore.  
He has not got no roots no more,  
He comes for your gold,  
Watch out for your soul.  
  
Cause tennis shoes, and rhythm and blues  
Are second generation  
All across the nation, now,  
And mama knows,  
Papa too rock 'n roll is music,  
Rock 'n roll is music, now.  
To the invader go the fruits of war,  
He misses home and his boots are sore.  
He has not got no roots no more,  
He comes for your gold,  
Watch out for your soul.  
Mama knows and papa knows  
That rock 'n roll is music,  
Rock 'n roll is music, now.

[Chorus]  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time.  
You ain't nothing but a hound dog  
Crying all the time.  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Well they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Yeah they said you was high classed  
Well, that was just a lie.  
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit  
And you ain't no friend of mine.  
  
[Chorus]

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He'll be making a list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees when you're sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good oh, for goodness sake  
  
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry  
You better not pout I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He got the little thin flute, little toy drums  
Rooty toot toot and a ronty tont tont  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Kids in girl and boy land, have a jubilee  
He's gonna build a toy land  
All around the Christmas tree, oh  
  
You better not pout, better not cry  
Better watch out, watch out I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming, now this is serious  
Santa Claus is coming, Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
Oh, you better watch out

Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky.  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Maria's eyes.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
Well, you know about the sugar cane  
That comes from way down South.  
She's got one end in her hand,  
She's got one end in her mouth.  
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
She took me out walking  
To the corner of the world  
Where everyone was a-talking  
About such a pretty little girl.  
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
  
Well the moon is in the ocean  
And the stars are in the sky.  
And all that I can see  
Is my sweet Maria's eyes.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.  
Sarah, Sarah Maria.  
Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.

The old man rhythm's gotten in my shoes  
Know you're sittin' here and singing the blues  
So be my guest you got nothing to loose  
Won't you let me take you on a see cruise  
  
I said  
Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Oh babe please

Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe  
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Ever since the days of old  
Men would search for wealth untold  
They'd dig for silver and for gold  
And leave the empty holes  
And way down south in the Everglades  
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves  
The eagles fly and the otters play  
In the land of the Seminole  
  
[Chorus]  
So blow, blow Seminole wind  
Blow like you're never gonna blow again  
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend  
But I know who you are  
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee  
All the way up to Micanopy  
Blow across the home of the Seminole  
The alligators and the gar  
  
And progress came and took its toll  
And in the name of flood control  
They made their plans and they drained the land  
Now the glades are going dry  
And the last time I walked in the swamp  
I sat upon a Cypress stump  
I listened close and I heard the ghost  
Of Osceola cry  
  
[Chorus]

Well, the sun's not so hot  
In the sky today  
And you know I can see  
Summertime slipping on away.  
  
A few more geese are gone,  
A few more leaves turning red,  
But the grass is as soft  
As a feather in a featherbed.  
  
So I'll be king and you'll be queen,  
Our kingdom's gonna be  
This little patch of green.  
Won't you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Oh, the memory is like  
The sweetest pain.  
Yeah, I kissed the girl  
At a football game.  
  
I can still smell the sweat  
And the grass stains.  
We walked home together,  
I was never the same.  
  
But that was a long time ago,  
And where is she now?  
I don't know.  
Won't you lie down here right now  
  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Oh, September grass  
Is the sweetest kind,  
It goes down easy  
Like apple wine.  
  
Hope you don't mind  
If I pour you some,  
Made that much sweeter  
By the winter to come.  
  
Do you see those ants  
Dancing on a blade of grass?  
Do you know what I know?  
That's you and me, baby.  
  
We're so small  
And the world's so vast,  
We found each other  
Down in the grass.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Lie down, lie down, lie down, lie down.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass.  
  
Won't you lie down here right now  
In this September grass?  
Won't you lie down with me now,  
September grass...

Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us,  
All men and women living on the Earth.  
Ties of hope and love,  
Sister and brotherhood,  
That we are bound together  
In our desire to see the world  
Become a place in which our children  
Can grow free and strong.  
We are bound together by the task  
That stands before us  
And the road that lies ahead.  
We are bound and we are bound.  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest  
  
Shed a little light, oh Lord,  
So that we can see,  
Just a little light, oh Lord.  
Want to stand it on up,  
Stand it on up, oh Lord,  
Want to walk it on down,  
Shed a little light, oh Lord.  
  
Can't get no light from the dollar bill,  
Don't give me no light from a TV screen.  
When I open my eyes I want to drink my fill  
From the well on the hill,  
Do you know what I mean?  
  
Shed a little light, oh Lord,  
So that we can see,  
Just a little light, oh Lord.  
Want to stand it on up,  
Stand it on up, oh Lord,  
Want to walk it on down,  
Shed a little light, oh Lord.  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist,  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest.  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest.  
  
Oh, Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us.  
All men and women living on the Earth,  
Ties of hope and love,  
Sister and brotherhood.

Well, I've been lying in this dungeon  
Since I was eighteen.  
Ten lonely years of my life taken,  
I've been living in the pages of a magazine.  
  
It breaks my heart to awaken.  
Set me free, sleep come free me,  
Please, please, please.  
Set me free, set me free.  
  
Now the state of Alabama says I killed a man,  
The jury reached the same conclusion.  
I remember I was there with a tire iron  
In my hand, the rest is all confusion.  
  
Set me free, sleep come free me,  
Please, please, please.  
Set me free, set me free.  
  
More like an animal and less like a man,  
What they leave you ain't worth keeping.  
Brother let me tell you,  
I got a clock with no hands,  
  
The only way out is through sleeping.  
Set me free, sleep come free me,  
Please, please, please.  
Set me free, set me free.  
  
You get to where you used to be,  
Whoever you claim, it's open to interpretation.  
Just remember your number  
And abandon your name,  
  
And hold on to your name  
And hold on to your imagination, oh no no.  
Set me free, sleep come free me,  
Please, please, please.  
Set me free, set me free.

  
Some children see Him lily white,  
The baby Jesus born this night.  
Some children see Him lily white,  
With tresses soft and fair.  
Some children see Him bronzed and brown,  
The Lord of heav'n to earth come down.  
Some children see Him bronzed and brown,  
With dark and heavy hair.  
  
Some children see Him almond-eyed,  
This Savior whom we kneel beside.  
Some children see Him almond-eyed,  
With skin of yellow hue.  
Some children see Him dark as they,  
Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray.  
Some children see him dark as they,  
And, ah! they love Him, too!  
  
The children in each different place  
Will see the baby Jesus' face  
Like theirs, but bright with heavenly grace,  
And filled with holy light.  
O lay aside each earthly thing  
And with thy heart as offering,  
Come worship now the infant King.  
'Tis love that's born tonight!  
  

It was about five till five on Friday  
We were all getting ready to go  
And the boss man started screaming  
And his veins began to show  
  
He said you and you come with me  
Cause you're gonna have to stay  
My heart was thumping, I was jumping  
I had to get away  
  
[Chorus]  
Some days you gotta dance  
Live it up when you get the chance  
Cause when the world doesn't make no sense  
And you're feeling just a little too tense  
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
  
Well, I was talking with my baby  
Over a small glass of tea  
He asked the loaded question  
He said how do you feel about me  
  
My mind was racing, I was pacing  
But the word just wouldn't come  
And there was only one thing  
Left to do I feel it coming on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance  
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance

Lonely hearted hunter, don't say nothing.  
The hunger and the hurt got only one law.  
Never mind your words, unseen, unheard, unsung, undone.  
Ain't but one place left to run.  
Stand up, stand and fight.  
  
Undercover creature that don't see sunshine,  
Make it in the dark,  
Don't think twice, never mind making nice.  
Black eyes, black sights, black magical rites Tonight, there comes a time,
babe.  
Stand up, stand and fight.  
  
Don't you worry about me, little darling, no,  
I ain't breaking, I'm shaking and aching.  
'Cause I can't stand waiting.  
There comes a time to stand and fight.  
  
Maximum destruction, blood red deadheads  
Tearing it up, wearing it down.  
Never mind my name, I'm unclaimed,  
Unnamed and unashamed.  
I'd like to say fan the flames,  
Stand and fight.  
  
You ain't doing nobody no kind of favors.  
Lying around like a rug on the floor.  
Sooner or later you've got to stand up  
And say you won't take it any more.  
Stand up, stand and fight.

Well, I'm a steamroller, baby  
I'm bound to roll all over you  
Yes, I'm a steamroller now, baby  
I'm bound to roll all over you  
I'm gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock 'n roll  
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues  
  
Well, I'm a cement mixer  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Yes, I'm a cement mixer for you, baby  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Well, I'm a demolition derby (yeah)  
A hefty hunk of steaming junk  
  
Now, I'm a napalm bomb, baby  
Just guaranteed to blow your mind  
Yeah, I'm a napalm bomb for you, baby  
Oh, guaranteed, just guaranteed to blow your mind  
And if I can't have your love for my own (now)  
Sweet child, won't be nothing left behind  
It seems how lately, baby  
Got a bad case steamroller blues

I like to think about the time I met you  
Living with your people down in new orleans  
Mad at your mama cause she'd never let you  
Ride in no nasty limousine  
Later on the levee with the moon up above  
I lost my heart and confessed my love  
Oh lucy, God have mercy  
I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that  
  
One summer night in a field of wheat  
God's sweet lanterns hanging in the sky  
Moving light on your tiny feet  
I knew I had to love you till the day I die  
They talk about amazing grace  
It meant something when I saw your face  
Oh lucy, God have mercy  
I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout that  
  
I think of all the little things that I never told you  
I think I may get to hold you someday  
It's my brain just like a man possessed  
I can't do me no work, I can't get me no rest  
I can't understand it baby  
  
Don't like to think about the way it ended  
I hate remembering the things that I said  
I dream a dream of love so splendid  
I wake up hard in an empty bed  
I wonder who'll be loving you next  
Some fool will be writing bad checks  
Oh now lucy, God have mercy  
I've got to stop thinkin' 'bout you

Now back when this earth  
Was a silver blue jewel  
And back when your grandfather's  
Father was young,  
Men of these shores  
Made and gave up their lives  
Pulling up fish from the sea.  
  
While down in the African slavery trade,  
Stealing young men to cut sugar cane,  
Rum to New Bedford  
And codfish from Maine,  
They were building a wall  
That will always remain.  
  
Oh, the crown and the cross  
The musket and chain,  
The white man's religion,  
The family name.  
Two hundred years later  
And who is to blame?  
The captain or the cargo  
Or the juice of the sugar cane?  
  
The dory man he knows  
When the riptides will run,  
He sets out his nets  
And he sits in the sun.  
He thinks of his family  
And drinks of his rum  
And he waits for the codfish to come.  
  
It's the same god damned ocean  
That keeps them alive,  
It will swallow you up,  
It will let you survive.  
It will heal you and steal you  
And take you away  
Like a note in a bottle  
With nothing to say  
  
Now back when this earth  
Was a silver blue jewel  
And back when your grandfather's  
Father was young,  
Men of these shores  
Made and gave up their lives  
Pulling up fish from the sea.

Well I'm gonna raise a fuss  
And I'm gonna raise a holler  
About working all summer  
Just trying to earn a dollar  
Well, I went to my boss  
Who governs me  
He said, "no, dice, bud  
You gotta work late"  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometime I wonder  
What I'm gonna do  
There ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
  
Well, my mom and papa told me  
Now you better earn some money  
If one of you is gonna go  
Riding next Sunday  
Well, I didn't go to work  
I told my boss I was sick  
He said, "you can't use the car  
Cause you didn't work a lick"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna save two weeks  
Gonna have a fine vacation  
Gonna take my problem  
To the united nations  
Well, I went to my congressman  
He sent me back a note  
It said, "I''d like to help you, hon  
But you're too young to vote"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues  
Now there ain't no cure  
For the summertime blues

Walk down that lonesome road  
All by yourself  
Don't turn your head  
Back over your shoulder  
And only stop to rest yourself  
When the silver moon  
Is shining high above the trees  
  
If I had stopped to listen once or twice  
If I had closed my mouth and opened my eyes  
If I had cooled my head and warmed my heart  
I'd not be on this road tonight  
  
Carry on  
  
Never mind feeling sorry for yourself  
It doesn't save you from your troubled mind  
  
Walk down that lonesome road  
All by yourself  
Don't turn your head  
Back over your shoulder  
And only stop to rest yourself  
When the silver moon  
Is shining high above the trees

A tree grows in my back yard, it only grows at night.  
Its branches they're all twisted, its leaves are afraid of light.  
They say the blues is just a bad dream, they say it lives upside your head.  
But when it's lonely in the morning, you're bound to wish that you was lying
dead.  
  
There's winds out on the ocean, they're blowing just as they choose.  
But then winds ain't got no emotion, baby, they don't know the blues.  
They say the blues is just a bad dream, they say it lives upside your head,
mmmm.  
But when it's lone, lonely in the morning you're bound to wish that you was
lying dead.  
  
My mind is rambling and rambling just like some rolling stone, no,  
Since that nightmare's come to stay with me, baby, my thoughts just don't
belong.  
They say the blues is just a bad dream, they say it lives upside your head.  
But when they visit you around midnight, you're bound to wish that you were
lying dead.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
Everybody knows some holly and some mistletoe  
Well, they help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies in his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to one hundred-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas, yeah, Merry Christmas to you  

Last thing I remember  
Is the freezing cold water  
Reaching up just to swallow me whole.  
Ice in the rigging and howling wind,  
  
Shock to my body  
As we tumbled in, mercy from God.  
My brothers and the others  
Are lost at sea,  
  
I alone am returned to tell thee.  
Hidden in ice for a century to walk  
The world again, Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.  
  
Next words that were spoken to me,  
Nurse asked me what my name might be.  
She was all in white  
At the foot of my bed,  
  
I said angel of mercy  
I'm alive or am I dead?  
My name is William James McPhee,  
I was born in 1843.  
  
Raised in Liverpool by the sea  
But that ain't who I am,  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.  
  
It took a lot of money  
To start my heart,  
To peg my leg and to buy my eye.  
The newspapers call me  
  
The state of the art,  
And the children,  
When they see me, cry.  
I thought it would be nice  
  
Just to visit my grave,  
See what kind of tombstone I might have.  
I saw my wife and my daughter  
And it seemed so strange,  
  
Both of them dead and gone  
From extreme old age.  
See here, when I die  
Make sure I'm gone,  
  
Don't leave 'em nothing to work on.  
You can raise your arm,  
You can wiggle your hand,  
Not unlike myself,  
  
And you can wave goodbye  
To the frozen man.  
  
I know what it means  
To freeze to death,  
To lose a little life  
With every breath.  
  
To say goodbye to  
Life on earth  
And come around again,  
Lord have mercy  
  
On the frozen man,  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.

When Liberty Valance came to town,  
The women folk would hide, they'd hide.  
When Liberty Valance walked around,  
The men would step aside  
Because the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood.  
When it came to shooting straight and fast,  
He was mighty good.  
  
From out of the east a stranger came,  
A law book in his hand.  
A man, the kind of man the west would need  
To ease a troubled land.  
Because the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood.  
When it came to shooting straight and fast,  
He was mighty good.  
  
Many a man would face his gun  
And many a man would fall.  
The man who shot Liberty Valance,  
He shot Liberty Valance,  
He was the bravest of them all.  
  
Now the love of a woman can make a man  
Stay on when he should go, stay on.  
Just trying to build a peaceful life  
Where love is free to go.  
But the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood.  
When it came to shooting straight and fast,  
He was mighty good.  
  
Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return  
That fateful night, that night.  
When nothing she said could keep her man  
From going out to fight.  
But the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood.  
When it came to shooting straight and fast,  
He was mighty good.  
  
Out in the sun, two shots rang out,  
The shots made Liberty fall.  
The man who shot Liberty Valance,  
He shot Liberty Valance  
He was the bravest of them all.

Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound and rode it into Raleigh and on across Caroline.  
We stopped in Charlotte but we bypassed Rockhill, we never was a minute late.  
We were ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown rolling out of Georgia state.  
Had some motor trouble that turned into a struggle half way across Alabam.  
That hound broke and left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham.  
So right away I bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi
clean,  
And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham smoking into New Orleans.  
Someone's got to help me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston
town.  
There's an uncle there who cares a little about me and he won't let the poor
boy down.  
Sure as you're born, he bought me a silk suit, put some luggage in my hand.  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land.  
Working on a T-Bone steak, a la carte, flying over to the Golden State.  
When the pilot told us that in thirteen minutes he would have us at the
terminal gate.  
Swing down chariot, come down easy, taxi to the terminal dome.  
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone.  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk, Virginia, tidewater four-ten-O-nine.  
Tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land calling,  
And the poor boy is on the line.

Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Well I left my job  
About five o'clock,  
It took fifteen minutes  
To go three blocks,  
Just in time  
To stand in line  
With a freeway looking  
Like a parking lot.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Now I almost had  
A heart attack,  
Looking in my rear view mirror,  
I saw myself  
The next car back,  
Looking in the rear view mirror,  
About to have  
A heart attack, I said,  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Now when I die  
I don't want no coffin,  
I thought about it  
All too often.  
Just strap me in  
Behind the wheel  
And bury me with  
My automobile.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
Damn.  
  
Now I used to think  
That I was cool  
Running around  
On fossil fuel,  
Until I saw  
What I was doing  
Was driving down  
The road to ruin.

I open my arms to hold you, you turn away you turn away.  
I feel it just like I told you, how can you turn away?  
The things that we said last Saturday night, you turn away you turn away,  
Now you want to throw that away, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And now your eyes won't meet mine, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?  
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.  
  
And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.  
I'll dry these tears that I'm weeping for you and take my turn to turn away,
yeah.

We were walking in paradise, never did notice.  
Blind in the Buddha land, looking for solace.  
We had been told of a place,  
Far beyond this vale of tears.  
We could never have guessed,  
We were already blessed.  
There we were, where we are in the garden.  
  
Didn't we climb on up Er Mei, temple to temple?  
Yes and all and all along the way,  
The day was simple.  
Didn't we reach the top, didn't we gain our goal?  
Did we finally stop, surprised by the cold?  
  
We were walking in paradise, never did tumble.  
Blind in the Buddha land, looking for trouble.  
We had been told of a place  
Far beyond this vale of tears.  
We could never have guessed,  
We were already blessed.  
There we were, where we are,  
In the garden, in the garden.

So much for your moment of prayer,  
God's not at home there is no there, there.  
Lost in the stars, that's what you are,  
Left here on your own.  
  
You can only hope to live on this earth,  
This here is it, for all it's worth.  
Nothing else awaits you, no second birth,  
No starry crown.  
  
For an unbeliever like you,  
There's not much they can do  
That would turn you away.  
Though I hate to see you surrender,  
You need to surrender,  
We must find you a way to  
Look up from your life, up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
  
There's a river running under your feet,  
Under this house, under this street.  
Straight from the heart, ancient and sweet,  
On its way back home.  
Even in the middle of your sadness,  
The everyday madness, the ongoing game.  
Even when you can't find a reason,  
Still there is a reason,  
You don't need to name it.  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
  
Oh, even for a minute to find yourself in it,  
To wait by the stream to drop out of your dream,  
Look on up, look up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.  
Look up from your life, up from your life,  
Look on up from your life, look up from your life.

When this old world starts a getting me down  
And people are just too much for me to face  
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs  
And all my cares just drift right into space  
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be  
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no  
So when I come home feeling tired and beat  
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet  
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd  
And all that rat-race noise down in the street  
On the roof, that's the only place I know  
Look at the city, baby  
Where you just have to wish to make it so  
Let's go up on the roof  
And at night the stars they put on a show for free  
And, darling, you can share it all with me  
That's what I said, keep on telling you  
That right smack dab in the middle of town  
I found a paradise that's trouble proof  
And if this old world starts a getting you down  
There's room enough for two, up on the roof  
Up on the roof, up on a roof  
Everything is alright, everything is alright  
Come on  
Drop what you're doin' tonight and  
Climb up the stairs and see with me, babe  
We got the stars above and the city lights below  
Up on the roof, now

Beneath the tide the fishes glide,  
Fin to fin and side to side.  
For fishy love has now begun,  
Fishy love, finny fun.  
  
Paper moon, paper heart, pink balloon,  
Work of art.  
Al Capone, Bugs Moran, Valentine's Day.  
Bootleg gin, porkpie hat, dew Drop Inn,  
Dirty rat, through the heart Cupid's dart, Valentine's Day.  
  
Oh, day to repay the one that you love,  
Gentlemen, take off your hats as I speak thereof.  
Just a brief break from the push and the shove,  
We may go a few rounds without boxing gloves.  
  
Land your punch, I stand my ground,  
We break for lunch and a second round.  
We set them up, we knock them down,  
Valentine's Day.  
  
Me and you, you and him, him and her,  
Us and them, we keep score love as war, Valentine's Day.  
  
I lost my teeth, I lost my hair,  
I lost my mind, you don't care.  
Love is war, all is fair on Valentine's Day.

Moving in silent desperation,  
Keeping an eye on the Holy Land.  
A hypothetical destination, say,  
Who is this walking man?  
Well, the leaves have come to turning  
And the goose has gone to fly,  
And bridges are for burning,  
So don't you let that yearning pass you by.  
Walking man, walking man walks.  
  
Any other man stops and talks  
But the walking man walks.  
Well the frost is on the pumpkin  
And the hay is in the barn.  
Pappy's come to rambling on,  
Stumbling around drunk down on the farm.  
And the walking man walks.  
Doesn't know nothing at all.  
Any other man stops and talks  
But the walking man walks on by, walk on by.  
  
Most everybody's got seed to sow.  
It ain't always easy for a weed to grow, oh no.  
So he don't hoe the row for no one,  
For sure he's always missing,  
And something ain't never quite right.  
Ah, but who would want to listen  
To you kissing his existence good night?  
Walking man walk.  
Walk on by my door.  
Well, any other man stops and talks  
But not the walking man.  
He's the walking man, born to walk,  
Walk on walking man.  
  
Well now, would he have wings to fly?  
Would he be free?  
Golden wings against the sky,  
Walking man, walk on by.  
So long, walking man.
