Don't let it be said you'd be better off dead  
Words will get mixed up inside of your head  
When you're playing the game can't remember your name  
You know it's fucked up the same  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Fighting back - Come what may  
A good day to die - A cold grave to lie  
A good day to die  
The lies and the greed of the demon seed  
World of the ignorant trying to breed  
Never settled the score as I opened the door  
But you kept wanting more  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Kicking back - Come what may  
A good day to die  
Stand up and fight  
A cold grave to lie  
This secret lie  
Good day to die  
No time to cry  
You tried to fly  
Reach for the sky  
With your Russian roulette you'll take the bet  
Sleeping on coals that you'll live to regret  
In an orgy of death and your crimes and the tests  
Is this your final breath?  
You and me got a lot to say but I won't get down on my knees and pray  
Loud and proud I fight every day  
Fighting back - Come what may  
  
  

My brain fed with ecstacy  
Fills my need  
As I feel my body burst with great speed  
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist  
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list  
A)Feel that rush,with that gold  
Satanic dust  
Feel that pain,the drug induce through  
My veins  
I will in life as I will in death  
Sow the seeds with every breath  
Never will I run,never will I hide  
Only to express myself and feel it deep  
Inside  
Acid  
Now I dream in comatose neuotic state  
As my paranoia grows I must wait  
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die  
Then I'll hit the drug again,take me high  
B) Feel that buzz,for all the goddam  
Good it does  
Feel the flight,that flies me in through  
Day and night  
Now inside my arteries there's no blood  

All devils eve the witches exchange energy  
Black warlocks concentrate predicting prophecies  
Announcing serenade uniting under stars  
The celebration desecration from afar  
Secret - evening - thunder  
Pagans - dancing - under  
Pale moon - rising - watching  
Starlight - gazes - catching  
All devils eve  
All devils eve  
All devils eve the candle red alights the Queen  
The black familiars in pentacles of green  
Flowing the bloodline past millennia so strong  
Reciting atmospheres to tangle mortal song

Pagans - dancing - under  
Pale moon - rising - watching

Magnetic impulses circles painted last  
The psychic inspiration rings the pewter bell  
The bond exists in consciousness invisible  
Secret - evening - thunder

Pale moon - rising - watching

All devils eve  

Living  
Running,  
Out on the streets at night,  
Searching,  
Hoping,  
For the right connection, coz',  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.  
  
Angel dust,  
Need a shot to see me through the day,  
Angel dust,  
Want a lot I've got to get away.  
  
I live my life,  
Like there's no tomorrow,  
Take no chances  
I'm drowning all my sorrows coz' I,  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.  
  
Laughing,  
Crying,  
Every night and day,  
I know,  
You know,  
That I'm a different man because I,  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.

From blackened flame  
Ye shall remain

Defecate on the teachings  
Burn into the dirt  
Suffocate all the preachings  
Bury them in earth  
All hail!  
Black flame of satan  
From frozen fire

High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown into the pit of this unholy row  
Do it all alone down into Belial's home live then die Satan calls his evil
child  
Strengthens his force as the darkness falls laughs at the angels their feeble
calls  
High on their fortress that crumbles before all that in touch with the dark
evil law  
Do it all alone down into Belial's home strike the final chord hail unto the
overlord  
High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown ever further ever down into the pits
of hell  
Now in the bleakness the elders recant thinking of histories the ancients
relent  
Gathered in circles before their host there's no one soul he desires most.  
Do it all alone way down into Belial's home strike a chord hail unto the
overlord

When the snow turns black  
I'll be back - I'll be here  
Between the blinking of an eye  
Welcome back - Cavalier  
When the screams attack  
Before the newborn starts to cry  
Flaming star or the call of the wild  
And it's all in the eyes of a child  
The whispers in the breeze  
Black Xmas - Devils Eve  
Black Xmas - Devil's wine  
The river bleeds in time  
That's the place - In a dream  
Where the red clouds chase  
Across the suns hot blazing sky  
Where he hides his face  
In disgrace - For his queen  
He must choose the way she dies  
And they say when his eyes turn to green  
He'll awake living sin never seen  
That's the clue - To believe  
Watches over you  
Watch his eyes look through  
An instant and you're hypnotised  
False or true - To deceive  
You take his place you're crucified  
Black Xmas - Devils Eve  
The whispers in the breeze  
The river bleeds in time  
Black Xmas - Devil's wine

Come on turn it up, madness  
Stalking the night, feeding fast on my prey  
Draining the life till the dawn of the day  
Drinking and sucking, the blood rushing sweet  
Half crazed with glory, half crazed in the heat  
Blood lust  
Tearing the flesh of the weak and the child  
Sparing no one, the meek and the mild  
I sink my fangs in your neck as you dream  
I am Count Cronos, vampire supreme  
Blood lust  
Blood lust upon me, I'm biting the flesh  
I'll take away your God given breath  
Now, I shall feast on your life giving blood  
Leave you to die on the land you once stood  
Blood lust  

I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep  
As friends gather round and mourners they weep  
My mind thinks of all the things I have done  
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on  
And on and on  
  
As they lower me down into that hole in the ground  
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound  
I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed  
Is this happening to me or is it just a dream  
Summon the dead  
Baphomets call  
Blood on my hands  
  
"Let me out of here!"  
  
My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot  
I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box  
My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight  
I promise the rise of my body this night  
Summon the dead  
Baphomets call  
Blood on my hands  
Screaming in torment  
I'm telling you all  
Take heed of my plea  
Answer my call  
I'm gonna be free

Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn - in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath  
Inferno - You're gonna crash and burn  
Inferno - You're gonna burn in hell  
Blood eyes in burning fury  
Flesh peeling from the bone  
The Gods are judge and jury  
Inferno is their home  
You cry - You die  
As you head for the grave  
Welcome to purgatory  
Your soul is fried  
Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn - in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath  
  
  

I can smell the fear  
Hear the screams of pain  
I must kill or be meat  
I'll say to you  
On this planet of dirt  
Number one comes first  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
Is there life after death  
Do you ask yourself  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
I have smelled the fear  
Heard the screams of pain  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
There's a calm before the storm  
  

Clarisse what perfume you wearing today no don't tell me I know  
And the soap that you washed with  
Come to me don't feel scared I'm not going to bite  
Well maybe just a little maybe just a might  
You know without windows without the wind the rain or snow  
I feel somewhat strange but of course all this you know  
Tell me about the lambs Clarisse tell me why you're scared  
I know when your father died something died in there  
To see simplicity in any mortal thing is a gift few men have  
What makes a killer a madman it's not disgusting it's sad  
I dream of trees now I smell the sea don't you find that fun  
You have the pleasures of the flesh Clarisse you can feel the sun  
But on the darker side you feel the anger rise you feel the satisfying hate  
And if you had to kill against your strongest will you wouldn't shoot that
bullet late  
Please don't judge me so wait just before you go come up closer to the cage  
Let me taste the smells of your own body cells you mustn't covert me with rage  
I ate to feed I killed in kind you believe me don't you hear the echos in your
mind  
They say I'm insane don't they but do they really know why  
They say I'm nothing but a cannibal can't understand or even try  
For in the night when I whisper from my cell and play my pshyciatric game  
In the morning when the inmate's dead they hang a new one to my fame  
If I walked the streets a free man in the heat I couldn't terrify a crowd  
But in a silent home where we'd be all alone you'd need to freshen up a shroud  
Please believe I couldn't hurt you I'd try to make you feel  
Welcomed like a friend I'd have you over for a meal  
Then I'd tear at your silken breast rip out the heart beating and bloody  
Gnaw with lust at your soften neck cutting and spitting and cooking you slowly  
Feed you up like a blooded boar fruit in the mouth and garnished with roses  
Feel nothing for you anymore deader than hell a meal for a hungry man  
  
  

Welcoming the virgins fair, to live a noble life  
In the castle known to all - the Count's infernal wife  
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods  
But, when evening spreads it wings, she rapes them of their blood  
Countess Bathory  
Countess Bathory  
All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals  
The Countess laughs and sips her wine - her skin doth crack and peel  
But when nightime fills the air one must pay the price  
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life  
Countess Bathory  
Countess Bathory  
Living in her self styled Hell, the Countess dressed in black  
Life's so distant - death's so near - no blood to turn time back  
The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age  
Welcomes death with open arms - the reaper turns the page

Chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify  
Raised boy the virgin is pure and good father to the race  
Sinful in sodom with cold blind luster praying to the golden calf  
Walking the land with twelve good men that follow talking the hand of one
whose blind  
Curing the lame causing mutes to speak miracles prevail to the open mind  
Chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify  
Saved for forty days and nights he roamed the desert sand  
No food to nourish only faith temptations close at hand  
Evil abounds in every footstep that he takes in the sand he must stay true  
All this in vain because he'll die for sure saving the frame of all that's
good  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do  
  
  

Placed in the wilderness, naked and cold  
The night draws the warmth from my flesh  
Howls in the distance  
The wolves they catch my scent  
They yearn for my blood warm and fresh  
  
But I  
  
Cannot run, I cannot hide  
I'm moments old, yet terrified  
Snarling breath is on my face  
I am damned in this place  
  
Morning breaks the evening darkness  
Daylight sings so loud  
Father holds my in his arms  
And laughs for he is proud  
'All is well' my mother cries  
A kiss for me her child  
But at night my heart turns black  
And calls me to the wild  
  
In the night where the wolf-bane grows  
In the night when the full moon glows  
  
Cry wolf  
  
Alone in your room  
By the light of the moon  
Your glory is shining so bright  
You prey for the day  
Oh show me the way  
The devil takes over tonight  
It's too late, night is here  
The time that you dread  
The time when you loose all control  
  
Your bodies in pain  
You cry in vein  
Satan takes over your soul  
  
Cry wolf  
  
Even a man who's pure of heart  
He says his prayers by night  
Bane from a wolf when the wolf bane grows  
And the moon's full and bright  
  
I cannot resist their call  
It strengthens as I age  
To the pack to join the feast  
And fear immortal rage  
Never can I live the life  
Of every normal child  
Forever I must answer  
To the call of the wild  
  
The call of the wild

From the Golden seat of Ramses to the ending of the sacred Nile  
The pharaohs of this ancient land the deserts cross countless miles  
Inside the labyrinth where buried is the king his waiting maids countless
gifts lie within  
Mumified entombed the ancient scroll left to rot brain heart and soul  
As they walk through the passages of endless night using sparsely the candles
as their only light  
Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing Kking Tutankhamun  
As the years begin to close and food to nourish sparse insanity starts to
reign to flourish in the dark  
As they walk through the passages of endless time using sparsely the candles
as their only light  
Living only on the storages of food they brought no escape live to die becomes
their only thought  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tutankhamun  
Cursed where this grave is their only thing king Tutankhamun  
And as they walk through the passages of endless night  
Drawing nearer to the last nothing left inside the tomb  
Except the braindead plight lost in histories of the past  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king Tuankhamun  
Cursed where his grave is the only thing king Tutankhamun  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king buried deep inside the pyramid  
Cursed buried deep inside the pyramid king buried deep inside the pyramid  
  
  

At night the corpses rise  
And leave a srench of rotten life  
Eagerly the stagger forth  
To find a friend to gripe  
Copulating in the grounds  
Of their eternal home  
Regurgitate ejaculations  
On their old tomb stones  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the dead  
Licking at their blackened limbs  
The zombie pleasure cries  
Lucifer's immortal glory  
Watch them swapping eyes  
Writhing in a mound of death  
Maggots under the flesh  
Digging fresh arrival thus  
To lovingly caress  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the dead  
Go home you necromancers  
Find true the words I've said  
No place for mortal magic  
There's love amongst the dead  
The walls around the cemetery  
Built high forever strong  
Church of fools demand this  
For the dead don't die for long  
At the dawn of darkness  
The keeper takes his keys  
Locking out the living  
For the dead don't want to leave  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the  
Dead Love - There's love amongst the dead  
  
  

Death throes the seeds of lightning  
Thunder cast in rain  
Castrate humanity  
The woman smells the game  
Complete in time intact  
And weave another year  
Demand apocalypse  
And do not despair  
IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT  
Danger approaches hold on tight  
Ye ancient souls  
The hounds are pacing  
Out in distant roles  
Bring in the alchemist  
And screaming mortal witch  
Sample the moonlight  
And dance with the bitch  
In the dead of the night  
Children start to die  
In a manger of blood  
Dead is the night  
Death sows the seeds of lightning  
Thunder cast in rain  
Castrate humanity  
The woman smells the game  
Complete in time intact  
And weave another year  
Hold your heads up high  
Do not despair  
  
  

Fighting and biting, white thunder and lightning  
Chasing the locust on its trail  
Movements of Majyk, false moves become tragic  
According to winds, how we sail  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra  
Snare of the pharaoh, remember now they know  
Or knew of the universe vast  
Sign of the symbol finds passageways nimble  
Revealing the old Satanas  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the night, flight of the soul  
Flight of your life, spirit of gold, fly  
Searching and searing, sarcastically feeding  
Deceiving the truth from the next  
Enchantment embraces the snake as it ages  
Awaiting the life that is next  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra  

Venus sheds her skin of gold

Pleasing to the eye  
Deadly delight  
Venus arguementor

Summoning the Hounds of Hell  
To do my deadly deeds  
In the magic pentagram  
I plant satanic seeds  
Summing forth the elements  
Lightning, thunder and rain  
Mortals fear this ritual  
They think it is a game  
  
Laughing, crying  
Never dying  
Feel the Earth's core bleed  
Synchronizing, perfect timing  
Watch the Heavens scream  
  
For the Hounds of Hell  
  
From inside the pentagram  
I see the signs of life  
Up from Hell my babies come  
With eternal life  
Summoning infernal bloodlust  
I set the demons free  
Go unto this world  
And destroy everything you see  
  
Laughing, crying  
Never dying  
Feel the Earth's core bleed  
Synchronizing, perfect timing  
Watch the Heavens scream  
  
For the Hounds of Hell  
  

I could hear you screaming  
Heard you cry in pain  
But I thought you were dreaming  
Are you going insane?  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
You're insane  
I could feel you dying  
Again and again and again  
I believed you were lying  
Now I know you're insane  
House of pain  
I could see you bleeding  
Feel you die in vain  
As your flesh started seething  
In your house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
House of pain  
Welcome to the house of pain  
I'm insane  
Welcome to the house of pain  
  
  

I'm in league with Satan  
I was raised in hell  
I walk the streets of Salem  
Amongst the living dead  
I need no one to tell me  
What's wrong or right  
I drink the blood of children  
Stalk my prey at night  
  
[Chorus]  
Look out beware  
When the full moon's high n' bright  
In every way I'm there  
In every shadow in the night  
Coz I'm evil in league with Satan  
Evil in league with Satan  
  
I'm in league with Satan  
Obey his commands  
With the goat of Mendes  
Sitting at his left hand  
I'm in league with Satan  
I love the dead  
No one prayed for Sodom  
As the people fled  
  
I'm in league with Satan  
I am the masters own  
I drink the juice of women  
As they lie alone  
I'm in league with Satan  
I bear the devils mark  
I kill the new born baby  
Tear the infants flesh

Sleepless nights,drenched in sweat.  
A lust for life,endless death.  
  
We're dancing in the fire,  
We're lost in the Flame.  
We're lost in the Fire,  
Nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
  
Day to night,night to day,  
Lost in dreams,that fade away!  
  
Into the fire,  
We're dancing in the flame!  
We're lost in the fire,  
Well nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
  
In the night,alone and dark,deep within the source,  
Tourtured feel the flames of Hell, rising to the cause!  
  
Onbe,two,three,four!  
  
All my life,drenched in pain!  
All my needs,all the same.  
  
We're dancing in the fire,  
We're lost in the falme.  
Dancing in the fire,  
Well nothing stays the same!  
  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  
INTO THE FIRE!  

When dormant eyes burst open  
So we can see the way  
Destiny has spoken  
And there's hell to pay  
The sceptics light the candles  
For the eternal right  
Blinded faith's are broken  
Ghosts of father's die  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
The message burns the answer  
On the bones of the dead  
Without the necromancers  
Hope hangs from a thread  
The chaos devastation  
Licks immortal sin  
Mother earth is now ridden  
Of those who pray to win  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day  
In distant darkened orders  
The prophets read the signs  
The overlords move over  
To let the blood move over  
To let the blood life shine  
Erasing false deceptions  
An antidote for lies  
Religious rigormortis  
When man as beast arise  
Souls as slaves  
Sold as saved  
Judgement day  
Left betrayed  
Final grave  
Judgement day

Regurgitating bones to plant  
And water with your tears

Fear me mortals  
Or your mind and guts will explode  
In your very own sickly self  
You'll haunt the realms of purgatory  
Dying off pain and fear

Beyond two thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind  
Central computer that control and know the simple weakness of mankind  
Humanoid living in a structured will walking in a lifeless path  
Motor with a need to kill need to kill need to kill  
Searching through the wreckages of molten steel and glass seeing all in infra
red and heavy in its mass  
Terminate exterminate the son of Connor Reese you must prevent the bastard
ever being born  
Stop at nothing kill at will but rid the earth of this small child you must
deter this fucking evil spawn  
Mark the dogs for only they know your not human your ot flesh at all  
Break the jaw before it speaks and kill the men that answer to its call  
Justified in genocide and leave them in theiir broken pride until they realize
that it's no use  
Unsuspecting victim one guerilla fighter with a gun the terminator's finally
been let loose  
Try to run but only they know there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide  
Cornered trapped by the death machine don't you go to sleep don't close your
eyes ah  
Beyond twp thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind  
Central computer, that control and know the simple weakness of mankind  
And still the armies of robotic men crushing the humans in their path  
Lifeless of pain and a void of sorrow create a crimson aftermath  
  
  

Unholy city a sinners delight  
No-one was spared out of mind, out of sight  
Hatred and slaughter, degradation and lust  
Self destruction never counting the cost,  
No-one knew the suffering  
Behind the city walls  
No-one heard the cry for help  
No-one heard the call  
  
One thousand days in Sodom  
One thousand days in Sodom  
The ways of god forgotten  
One thousand days in Sodom  
  
Children slaughtered daily there mothers by their sides  
No mercy given no matter how they cried  
The smell of death was near  
It's presence ever near  
The priests lay bound in chains no-one would ever hear,  
No-one knew the blasphemy  
The torture and the pain  
No-one saw the madness  
The priests, they died in vain  
  
Day completes its cycle and night takes on its role  
Satan's cloak shrouds the land and his children spill their fold  
No golden cross of heaven  
Or ancient key of kings  
Could save the world of sinners when the midnight sabbath rings  
Few could hear the suffering  
And the pain of ripping flesh  
But those who did were damned in hell  
And breathed their final breath  
  
One thousand days  
One thousand years you've lived your life in hell.

Haulocost so vast  
While devestation is our homeland  
Light ain't all that fast  
Vesuvious erupts our tune  
Igniting all in reach  
Leaving all in purgatory  
Until time decides to teach  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Wilder than a charging beast  
Our methods set on death  
Elements recharge our songs  
No time to catch your breath  
The richtor scale determines  
If our instruments in tune  
Candle light the new volcano  
Power shines the moon  
Laser lights the soul until  
The final curtain drops  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Corpses guard there dynasty  
But power never dies  
See our raging bolts of hell  
And mayhem in your eyes  
Exorcet the boiling oil  
The volume never stops  
Laser lights the soul until  
The final curtains dropped  
Leaving all in purgatory  
Until time decides to teach  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  

When they opened the gates  
We emerged from the dark  
There was no turning back  
We go straight for your throat  
  
Our time has come  
Through the wars of the damned  
We bring darkness and death  
To your sacred land  
  
See that look in your eye  
Like a long lost child  
But your reign had to end  
You're a poison and dead  
  
Our time is here  
Through the wars of the damned  
We bring darkness and death  
To your dying land  
We lasted throughout  
Despite holy lies  
Impotent to deny  
  
Rege Satanas Satan's reign  
Rege Satanas Satan's reign  
  
The extinction of sin  
Broken churches lay bare  
Now their mental oppression  
Saying nought but prayers  
  
Our time is about  
Through unholy wars  
You are over and out  
Damned day walkers  
  
Rege Satanas Rege Satanas  
Rege Satanas Rege Satanas

Hooded in the mists of time in distant lands of dust  
Here they live and forge the steel that carves out human lust  
Thulsa doom his flesh and bone control of all that's fake  
Lifting head and staring eyes that guide the sinful snakes  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Armies of followers who are guided by his throne  
Blindly walk to Thulsa's steps that foot the black kings home  
On and on the warrior that stalks the beast that killed  
The families of his friends and foe that fall unto his will  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Snakes that come together over palaces of pain  
Gates of flesh that open up to let in acid rain  
All the smells of blasphemy are deep within this hall  
Writhing here in ecstasy awaiting Thulsa's call  
Stretching out and forged in steel a blade drwn from his arm  
Searching for the sacred neck to cure the world of harm  
Slashing through the snakelike scales deep into the core  
Splitting into bone and blood and settling the score  
The truth that lies within the riddle of steel  
Where all our lives begin the riddle of steel  
Steel steel steel steel steel steel steel steel steel  
  
  

Run like Hell, in Hell  
The deadly race begins  
Cyanide, suicide  
No prayers or foolish whims  
Tonight we'll fight  
With glory in our veins  
Can't stop us now  
Our evil always will reign  
  
The master switch is set  
And we must guard the only key  
Rip ride  
  
Satan's speed, our speed  
Incarnate pure alive  
Light up the night  
Were living on a wire  
We choose you loose  
Nobody body catches fire  
Were free you'll see  
We live by our desires  
  
Riding in the air nocturnal  
Living free  
Rip ride  
  
Rip ride  
  
Run like Hell, in Hell  
The deadly race begins  
Cyanide, suicide  
No prayers or foolish whims  
Tonight we'll fight  
With glory in our veins  
Can't stop us now  
Our evil always will reign  
  
The master switch is set  
And we must guard the only key  
Rip ride

Hooded figures, clouded skies  
Fires burn within their eyes  
Pentagram with baphomet midnight strikes

Scream for mercy cry and repent satan claims your soul  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, oh so nice, sacrifice

A virgin's death is needed there  
Sacrifice to Lucifer my master  
Bring the chalice raise the knife  
Welcome to my sacrifice  
Plunge the dagger in her breast  
I insist  
  
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.  
Limbs weaken limbs fly away demons rejoice  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, name your price, sacrifice  
  
Death is swift 'neath satan's sword  
All the same young and old  
Life means nothing to my lord  
Drink from chalice warm and sweet  
Virgin's heart final beat  
Lightning strikes virgin dies  
Satan smiles  
  
S.A.C.R.I.F.I.C.E.  
The moon is black and the witches dance, heaven is denied  
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice  
  

I preach the ways of Satan  
Answer to his calls  
I translate manuscripts  
On ancient Latin scrolls  
In my shrine, my avernus  
I see the gates of Hell  
Guarded well by Chronozon  
Tortured souls do dwell  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I mount the virgin Venus  
Plague the blackened seas  
I am the souls destructor  
Marching without fear  
The night is filled with souls  
In coral exctasy  
The saraband of death  
Will always follow me  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I bear the evil eye  
Possess the unbidden  
I'll bring your dead alive  
And chew your flesh from bone  
I stalk through life and death  
With Gorgon for my gaze  
I breath the immortal pain  
Beware the human race

There's no one to save us, it's kill or be killed  
Living in a jungle you'll hunt with all your skills  
Waiting for a victim, your hunger must be fed  
Better see it coming or you will end up dead  
Taste the anger - I'm seeing red  
Feel the danger - Sleep when I'm dead  
There's no time for mercy, there's no need for sympathy  
Line of fire and chaos in a world of constant greed  
Don't let your guard down, they'll be on you in a flash  
Keep it locked and loaded, you're heading for a crash  
There's no second chances  
You're going full speed  
Headlong into danger  
Your habit needs a feed  
Can't put the brakes on your finished when you stop  
There's no tomorrow and yesterday is lost  
  
  

We are the tyrants  
Messengers of Satan  
We pledge you all  
Raise your hands  
This is the solstice  
Hail legions arise  
We'll raise the roof  
Touch the skies  
  
Were praying for  
The wings of Mayhem to arrive  
The screaming fury burns  
Brings us alive  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
We are the demons  
Children of fire  
Your turn has come  
Live your desire  
Burning ambition  
Were were staying wild  
We stand as one never denied  
  
Defyant and proud  
We stand together  
Metlallic and loud we will fight  
Devestation, pure Hell  
Legions of the night  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
Come on, raise your hands  
  
We are the black metal gods  
  
V. E. N. O. Fucking M.  
  
Are you with us  
Right until the end?  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
Come on right at the back  
You want to be counted as well?  
Stand up!  
And be counted.

Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk  
She looked at me and winked her eye said "see you after class"  
I heard the school bell ring that told me that the day was done  
She called me back and locked the door my lessons just begun  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
Sitting down she crossed her legs her skirt crept up her thigh  
Feeling something start to rise my thought began to fly  
You've been a naughty boy she said now that you can't conceal  
I'll have to punish you the best way that I feel  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
She took my hand and gently placed it in between her thighs  
With open legs and heavy breath she slowly closed her eyes  
Her flesh was aching and her hands began to stray  
On thing that I know for sure I won't forget today  
Teachers pet  
Teachers wet  
Pulled me down forwards her mound teacher tasted sweet sixty-nine  
I don't mean lines this was teachers treat  
Played hide and seek with teachers mouth her lips were warm and wet  
Now today I've had my way and teacher won't forget  

I am the evil one  
The tempter, sinner man  
Archfiend, Diabolus  
Hail Leviathan  
Omnipotence Lucifer  
Asmodeus, my soul  
Feeding off inhuman life  
Blood of liquid gold  
Evil one  
Flesh and bone  
Evil one  
Set in stone  
I, the Royal Prince of Hell  
Command infernal names  
Lightning fills my ancient bones  
Chithulu rise in flames  
Dominating centuries  
Consume the everlasting  
Raising ashes up from earth  
I, Satan, head rising  
Evil one  
Flesh and bone  
Evil one  
Cast in stone  
Kneel  
I kneel to no man  
Rejoice  
I see through your cries  
Believe  
You know not the truth  
Blasphemer  
Jesus fucks you  
Crucify the holy man  
No sermons of a fool  
Universe, infinity  
Behold, evil rules  
Ever pregnant mysteries  
Ahmoon commands the birth  
Howling incantations  
I rise from blackened earth  
Evil one  
Flesh and bone  
Evil one  
Carved in stone  
The evil one  

I have been to Hell and back - kissed satanic Queen  
Traveling at the speed of light - saw thing never seen  
Arm in arm with Lucifer - Belial on my back  
I have swam the lake of flames - walked forbidden tracks  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
I've made love to Lilleth fair - danced the zombies dance  
I have shook the reapers hand - broke his deathly trance  
Present at ungodly births - mutants writhe in pain  
I'm possessed by Hell itself - I'm the man insane  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back  
Ride with me  
To Hell - and back  
You can take a trip with me - Hell's my final home  
If you wish to live at night - watch the demons room  
Holding high the Southern Cross - watch the mortals bleed  
Drink the blood and feel my wrath - watch the mutants breed  
To Hell - and back  
To Hell - and back

Too loud..  
Death defying mayhem volume  
Screaming through the stacks  
Stop and stare at the demons lair  
Burning so fast  
You won't last  
Crazed in sweat and blasphemy  
But still we cannot hear  
Legions rise, fell their eyes  
You live in fear  
You came to jeer  
Don't dicatate to us  
We were the first  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Souls of ninety thousand fold  
Are only steps away  
In the night, flames alight  
Until that day, were here to stay  
Blackened power metal marches  
Through the gates of Hades  
Weak and blind we leave behind  
Bring down the lights  
Inject the ice  
Lucifer sings 'Let it begin'  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Too loud  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  
Too loud for the crowd  
Too loud  

Hell, yeah  
The scent of Zenith clogs the midnight air  
You look around to see yourself and stare  
Hot knives, you know you're not alone  
The thunder burst your mind and cracks your bones  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M, yeah  
This is our hell and that's the way we live  
Your eyes transfixed by a deadly riff  
There ain't no doorway to Satan's mind  
He takes your soul and leaves your shell behind  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Jeff Mantas on lead guitar  
The sins of man dictate eternity  
We are the sons of Satan, we the three  
The final gift of Hades, is Satan band  
And now the future lies in his beloved hand  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
V E N O M  
Drag you to Hell  

Virgin little schoolgirls  
Dirty little nurse  
Teachers, whores and chambermaids  
All lifting up their skirts  
Sister's in the bathroom  
Getting nice and clean  
Telescopic vision  
He's bursting at the seams  
  
Posion pleasures, taken by hand  
Rapid fire, from his pulsating gland  
  
Neighbours at the window  
Trying her new bra  
Young and horny lovers  
Back seat daddys car  
Searching through his bondage  
Cindy's in top drawer  
Blondes, brunettes and redheads  
To satisfy the voyeur  
  
Uncut videos, vibrating eye  
Snakes alive, cause he's never shy  
He's the voyeur  
  
Leggy traffic wardens  
Women of the law  
Coming hard on oral  
She's begging him for more  
Polaroid mistress  
Versatile and lean  
Fingering her naked flesh  
Fuel for his wet dreams  
  
He's had them all  
That's what he says  
The liar  
So little action  
But nobody cares  
About the voyeur  
  
You meet some strange people in this place...  
  
Voyeur  
  
  

Set alight in purgatory  
Tormented moans of pain  
Piercing dark analogies  
Spat out in full disdain  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
  
Diabolus awaits you  
Tearing the flesh from bone  
Slicing edge of sharpened steel  
Terror to call your own  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
  
Earth cracks asunder  
Sharpens the bass to point  
Echoes summoning are'lyeh  
To agony anoint  
  
War against Christ  
War against Christ  
War against Christ

Fight, we will fight right,  
Living low in a world of our own,  
Destined to live right, fight,  
We're taking hell as our home,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.  
  
Kill we will kill death,  
Masturbating on the deeds we have done,  
Hell commands death kill,  
Argue not of feel the death of sun,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.  
  
Leave your souls at his feet,  
Kiss the flames,  
Scorn defeat.  
  
Die we won't die live,  
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know,  
Mortal voids live die,  
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow,  
Burning lives burning,  
Asking me for the mercy of god,  
Ancient cries crying,  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog,  
  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell,  
Welcome to hell.

Come hear the moon is calling,  
The witching hour draws near,  
Come hear the bell is tolling,  
Mortals run in fear,  
Prepare the altar now and hear the virgin cry,  
Hold fast the sacrifice,  
For now it's the time to die,  
All hell breaks loose,  
Hell's breaking loose.  
  
Unveil the pentagram,  
And feel the demons lust,  
Come watch the holy men,  
Who look on in disgust,  
Come taste blood,  
And feel the heat of Satan's breath,  
Look in the sky's and see,  
The warriors of death,  
All hell breaks loose,  
Hell's breaking loose,  
Witching hour.  
  
Our work is now complete,  
The blood runs fast and free,  
And Satan takes his bride,  
And cry's of blasphemy,  
All hell rejoices at the child,  
That she will bear,  
And Satans only son,  
Shall be the worlds despair,  
All hell breaks loose,  
Hell's breaking loose,  
Witching hour.

Deep in the dark of the forest came calls of sound from the wolverine  
As they danced their wicked dance round the fire in a dead trance  
Raising the chalice to the night darkly seek to their own delight  
Sacrifice to the only son saving blood sip it one by one  
Cleansing the altar awaiting the prize the virgin clad whiter than snow  
Holding the mass and presenting the cross pointed inverted below  
Doubles the blade in the cold and blessed night holds it above to be marked  
Hammering down in the soft flesh below ripping and tearing the heart  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take the prize we deliver to the gate  
Cloven the demons cloak ascends from the earth this being never ends  
As they fall to their knees and prey as the night reimburse the day  
Colder than any mortal thing his hands stretch to infinity  
All encompassing the flock there's no life in here any more  
Deeper than hades he brings to his side the man who presented the mass  
Questioning nothing the high priest is drawn kneels to his master's request  
Talking his left hand and passing it slow he ponders the mortal before  
Swiftly he moves and faster than hell he tears out this lunatics soul  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take the prize we deliver to the gate  
Cleansing the altar awaiting the prize the virgin clad whiter than snow  
Holding the mass and presenting the cross pointed inverted below  
Doubles the blade in the cold and blessed night holds it above to be marked  
Hammering down in the soft flesh below ripping and tearing the heart  
Oh lord of this limbionic state take this prize we deliver to the gate  
Deep in the dark of the forest came calls of sound from the wolverine  
  
  

Stand aside, loose your pride  
I'm at the gates alone  
Sourcery, blasphemy  
All welcome in my home  
I'm leaving  
But soon I'm coming back  
Believe me  
I'm hot on your tracks  
Through the night  
Eagles flight  
The Angels kiss my brow  
Tempting me with studded heels  
The bitch is in heat now  
Oh you've got me  
That leather smells so sweet  
I'm on fire  
Breeding sin, breathing lust  
Witches spell ohhh...  
Women Leather and Hell  
Go for it  
Come on turn that mother up  
Dynamite, is right on time  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Destiny won't catch me  
The choice of death is mine  
Salvation is keeping out of sight  
Damnation is joining in the fight
