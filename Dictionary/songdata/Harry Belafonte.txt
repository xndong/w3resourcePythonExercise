Hush little baby, don't you cry,  
You know your mother was born to die  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
The river of Jordan is chilly and cold  
It chills the body but it warms the soul,  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
I've got a little book with pages three,  
And every page spells liberty,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
If living were a thing that money could buy,  
You know the rich would live  
And the poor would die,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
  
There grows a tree in Paradise,  
The Christians call it the tree of life,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over

See the little baby, Amen  
Wrapped in a manger Amen  
On Christmas morning,  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him in the temple, Amen  
Talking with the elders, Amen  
Who marveled at his wisdom  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him at the seaside, Amen  
Talking with the fishermen, Amen  
Walking the side pales  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
Oh, to in Jerusalem, Amen  
On the top branches, Amen  
He talked in splendor  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
See him in the garden, Amen  
Lord have mercy, Amen  
Blessed savior  
Amen, Amen, Amen  
  
Before Hiram, Amen  
They crucified him, Amen  
Amen, Amen, Amen

And I love you so  
Though people ask me how  
How I've lived till now  
I tell them I don't know  
I guess they understand  
How lonely life has been  
But life began again  
The day you took my hand  
And yes I know  
How lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me  
And the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me  
And you love me too  
Your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free  
I'm happy that you do  
The book of life is brief  
And once a page is read  
All but love is dead  
That is my believe  
And yes I know how loveless life can be  
The shadows follow me  
And the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening bring me down  
Now that you're around me

Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Yes it's so long since I've been home  
Seems like there's no place to roam  
Well I've sailed around the Horn  
I've been from San Jose up to Baffin Bay  
And I've rode out many a storm  
  
Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Well I've heard the bawdy tunes  
I've been in honky tonk saloons  
I took my liquor by the vat  
Well I stayed on call for a rousing brawl  
Home was where I hung my hat  
  
Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea  
  
Now I've courted many a girl  
I've been in ports all around the world  
But my rambling days are done  
I've been from Curacao up to Tokyo  
And I've found there's only one  
  
And she is Angelina, Angelina, please bring down your concertina  
And play a welcome for me 'cause I'll be coming home from sea

Annabelle Lee, Annabelle Lee,  
  
Oh the moon never beams  
Without bringing me dreams  
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee  
And the stars never rise  
But I see the bright eyes  
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee  
  
Were never apart for I gave her my heart  
She gave her heart to me  
And I love with a love  
That is more than just love  
My adorable Annabelle Lee  
  
Yes he gave his warm heart to sweet Annabelle Lee  
For he loved her so dearly you see  
To think of her charms  
Have been here in my arms  
To think she loves only me  
  
Heaven offers no more,  
I've been there before  
In the arms of my Annabelle Lee  
Annabelle Lee

By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising  
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door  
Oh, she'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleepin'  
She'll turn softly and call my name out loud  
And she'll cry, just to think I'd really leave her  
Though time and time, I tried to tell her so  
She just didn't know I would really go

She sparkles like a diamond  
Look at all her people  
Look at them dance, look at them laugh  
Singing a song  
They make like happy children  
Wearing friendly faces  
Everyone knows, everyone knows they belong  
Where they belong  
  
Capetown, I'm drowning in your beauty  
Capetown, but my hearts not feeling nicely  
Capetown, angel black, white sin  
Capetown, there's a shadow on your mountain  
Capetown, there's a flaw in your sparkle  
Capetown, there's a crying at your crossroads  
Let me in, let me in, let me in  
  
The rush of silky color  
The sound of Dixie Banjos  
Mongrel melodies in quarter tones  
Streets of Malay marchers  
Hatted in their feathers  
The lilt, the lilt of xhosa Saxophones, xhosa saxophones  
  
Capetown, there's a hole at the heart of you  
A hole where district six used to be  
Capetown, now brown ghosts are dancing  
To be free, oh to be free  
Capetown, there's an island in your ocean  
Capetown, where black blood is running  
Capetown, hear the voices calling from your sea  
You belong to me, oh you belong to me, hmm  
  
Tidy whitewashed houses  
Sprays of wild flowers  
The heart and soul of gentility  
The vineyards, and the orchards  
Warm white sandy beaches  
Old and graceful luxury  
  
Capetown, they're squatting in your desert  
Capetown, in shanties made of plastic  
Capetown exiles in your homeland  
Capetown, struggling with your reason  
Capetown, holding back your madness  
Capetown, it's a bitter fruit you harvest  
Capetown, oh, oh  
  
Capetown I'm drowning in your beauty  
Capetown, but my hearts not feeling nicely  
Capetown, angel black, white as sin  
  
Capetown there's a shadow on your mountain  
Capetown, there's a flaw in your sparkle  
Capetown, there's a crying at your crossroads  
Let me in, let me in, let me in  
  
Capetown, it's a bitter fruit you harvest  
Capetown, let me in, ah let me in  
Capetown you belong to me,  
Capetown you belong to me

Close your eyes  
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep  
Close your eyes  
And I will close mine  
Close your eyes  
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep  
Close your eyes  
Oh this is divine  
Music play something dreamy for dancing  
While we're here romancing it's love's holiday  
And love will be our guide  
Close your eyes  
When you open them dear  
I'll be near by your side  
So won't you close your eyes

Did you know  
All my reserve was just pretend?  
Did you know  
I was only posin? as your friend?  
Did you know?  
Did my eyes play on your face too long?  
Did they say how much I needed you?  
Did the words I try to say in jest  
Seem to come out soundin? much too true?  
Did you know  
Could you see through my disguise?  
Did you know  
Or does my love come as a surprise?  
Did you know?  
I can't believe you haven't guessed  
They was much too much coincidence  
All those times we met by chance  
All where my un-purpose accidents  
Did you know?  
Doesn't matter anyway  
Did you know  
Someone else has said the things?  
I want to say  
So I?ll go, I never should have waited 'round  
In hopes that you would finally see  
But in case I get a second chance  
Now you know just what you mean to me  
Did you know?  

Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
Summer's almost gone  
Summer's almost gone  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
And I feel like I want to travel on  
  
I've waited here for almost a year  
Waitin' for the sun to shine  
Waitin' for the sun to shine  
Hopin' you'd change your mind  
  
Waited here for almost a year  
Hoping you'd change your mind  
Now I feel like I want to travel on  
  
Well, the chili wind will soon begin  
I'll be on my way  
Gone a lonesome day  
Going home to stay  
  
Chili wind will soon begin  
I'll be on my way  
Because I feel like I want to travel on  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
Summer's almost gone  
Summer's almost gone  
  
Done laid around and stayed around  
This old town too long  
And I feel like I want to travel on

While in that gay tropic isle  
I first saw that maiden smile  
Though I had failed in the past  
I said "this is true love at last"  
But then she whispered to me  
That our love never could be  
  
[Chorus]  
Destiny, oh when will I see the day?  
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free"  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me"  
  
My love was motion and grace  
The moonlight soft on her face  
I held her close in my arms  
My heart was quick to her charms  
But then I saw in her glance  
It was just an evening's romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"This could never be" she said pleadingly  
"Don't ever love me"

If I had wings like Noah's dove  
I'd fly up the river just to see  
The woman that I love  
Fare thee well oh my honey  
I say fare thee well  
  
When I woke up this morning  
It was drizzling rain all around my heart  
Oh there was an aching pain  
Fare thee well oh my honey, I say fare thee well  
  
Now when you wore your apron low  
You couldn't keep me  
No you couldn't keep me from around your door  
Fare thee well oh my honey, I say fare thee well  
  
Now you wear your apron high  
You say you never, oh you never you  
Scarcely ever see me passing by  
Fare thee well oh my honey I say fare thee well  
Goodbye woman I know I done you wrong  
Oh fare thee well.

Four strong winds that blow lonely  
Seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
But our good times are all gone  
And I'm bound for moving on  
I look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
Think Ill go out to Alberta  
Weathers good there in the fall  
Got some friends I can go to working for  
Still I wish you change your mind  
If I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
If I get there before the snow flies  
And if things are going good  
You could meet me if I send you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter  
ain't too much for you to do  
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Chorus:  
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life,  
Never make a pretty woman your wife.  
So from my personal point of view,  
Get an ugly girl to marry you.  
  
Chorus  
  
A pretty woman makes her husband look small,  
And very often causes his downfall.  
As soon as he marries her, then she starts,  
To do the things that will break his heart.  
  
But if you make an ugly woman your wife,  
You'll be happy for the rest of your life.  
An ugly woman cooks meals all the time,  
She'll always give you peace of mind.  
  
Chorus  
  
Don't let your friends say you have no taste,  
Go ahead and marry anyway.  
Her face is ugly, her eyes don't match.  
Take it from me, she's a better catch.  
  
Chorus  
  
Say, man?  
Hey baby!  
I saw your wife the other day.  
Yeah?  
Yeah, and she's sure is ugly. Ha!  
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!  
Yeah, alright.  
Unfortunately, she has acne.  
That's a shame, baby.  
Yeah, baby.  
  
Chorus x3

Hear the music and feel the beat  
On every corner, and every street  
Close the Kremlin, the congress too.

At the first annual global,  
Global carnival.

At the first annual global,

At the first annual global carnival.  
(Ah let's have a party)  
Global

Global carnival  
Israel and Palestine forming up a conga line  
The Ayatollah and the Pope  
Doing a limbo under a rope  
Princess Di and the I. Are. A.  
Well, they jamming with a Rasta from Montego Bay  
Forget the left, forget the right  
Ah ah we go party tonight  
At the first annual global,  
Global carnival.

Ah let's do it do it do it do it do it do it  
Sikhs, Basques, Serbo-Croatian  
Cambodians all join in the festivities  
Hindu, Muslin, Jews, Christian  
It doesn't matter what ever your proclivities  
But let me make it very clear  
Nobody goes hungry here  
Margaret Thatcher parking cars  
Fidel Castro passing out cigars  
The C. I. A. And the K. G. B.  
Tye swapping se

That's what made the glory Manger  
And the Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger  
There in a stable she born him  
Cold winter night  
There in a stable she born him  
Cold winter night  
And there in a stable she born him  
On a cold winter night  
And sanctified the glory manger  
And the Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger  
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
All his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
That's what made the glory manger  
And the Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Wasn't that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger

Lyrics:  
Oh, we call the sun ol' Hannah  
Blazing on my head  
Yes, we call the sun ol' Hannah  
And her hair is flamin' red.  
Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah  
Don't you rise no more  
If you come up in the mornin'  
Bring judgment sure  
Well I look at ol' Hannah  
She was turnin' red  
Well I look at my partner  
He was almost dead  
Said if you get lucky,  
Or make it on your own  
Please go down by Julie's  
Tell her I won't be long  
Kept sayin' I was a good man  
But they drove me down  
Yes, I was a good man,  
But they drove me down  
Well, it look like ev'rything  
Ev'rything I do  
Yes, it looks like ev'rything  
I do is wrong

Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the bible says and it still is news  
Mama may have papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That got its own, that got its own  
  
Yes the strong gets more  
While the weak ones fade  
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got its own, that's got its own  
  
Money you've got lots of friends  
Crowding around the door  
When you're gone  
And the spending ends  
They don't come no more  
Rich relations give  
Crusts of bread and such  
You can help your self  
But don't take to much  
Mama may have, papa may have  
But God bless the child  
That's got its own, that's got its own

We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
Let's walk the heavenly road  
I was livin' me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
I was livin' me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
One night I was walking down Fred'rick street  
Poor and hungry, no shoes on me feet  
I passed a door that said "Down with sin"  
It was the smell of food that pull me in  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
Let's walk the heavenly road  
Well, the leader walked up and he shook my hand  
Said "I want you to be a holy man"  
Right away I made a big decision  
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion  
I started over to get some food  
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood  
They dunked me in the water 'bout four, five times  
I couldn't see a thing 'cause I was almost blind  
Singing I've got a sword in my hand  
I'm going to use it well  
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold  
But the sight of the food made me take a hold  
The sisters started to break away  
They said "Kneel, believers, kneel and pray"  
I prayed and I prayed in a new-found style  
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild  
I was about to fall clear out of me seat  
When a man jumped up and said "Before you eat  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die,  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Don't talk

Gomen nasai I'm so sorry gomen nasai  
I am so sorry I made you cry  
Won't you forgive me dear  
Goman nasai nights have been lonely  
My days are blue, because I made a fool of you  
Won't you forgive me dear  
My butterfly heart has brought you pain  
Won't you forgive won't you forget  
Let's be sweethearts again  
Goman nasai nights would be heaven  
Love fill my days  
If you'd believe me when I say  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai  
I love you gomen nasai

I've laid around and played around this old town too long,  
summer's almost gone, yes, winter's coming on.  
I've laid around and played around this old town too long,  
And I feel like I've gotta travel on.  
  
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home.  
Johnny can't come home, no, Johnny can't come home.  
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home,  
'Cause he's been on the chain gang too long.  
  
I've laid around and played around this old town too long,  
summer's almost gone, yes, winter's coming on.  
I've laid around and played around this old town too long,  
And I feel like I've gotta travel on.

Lyrics:  
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew  
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru  
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two  
Cause springtime is here and it's here without you  
As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above  
Springtime is sad without someone to love  
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind  
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine  
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew  
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru  
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two  
Cause springtime is here and it's here without you  
They say that it's best to forget what we had  
Then it is to remember and always be said  
But still I keep wondering each now and then  
If ever I'll see you and kiss you again  
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew  
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru  
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two  
Cause springtime is here and it's here without you

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know  
She is my baby and she lives next door  
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up  
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
When I'm in trouble and I have no friend  
I know she'll go with me until the end  
Everybody asks me how I know  
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"  
That's why I know, oh, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
Now, if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that I'm all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her [KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK] on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
Now, if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that I'm all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her [KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK] on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
Oh, hallelujah  
Don't you know, I just love her so  
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time  
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl

Hurry sundown, let the weary day be over  
I'm so tired of hurt, I've been taken  
My heart has been aching so  
Don't mind struggling, don't mind livin' a little  
If someday my kids are laughing together  
And have things I never own  
I can feel many changes are coming  
Beat them drums in a distance, a drumming  
Telling the world a new future has begun  
Yes, you got to hurry sundown  
I can't wait to see the morning  
There's a lot of work I must lend a hand to  
So bring on that brand new day  
Afraid tomorrow is on it's way  
So hurry down, hurry down sweet sun  

When shadows fall and stars appears  
A pain I feel I cannot hear  
If I could relive that faithful day  
I would not turn my love away  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
When I think of her tender lips  
Gentle touch of her finger tips  
Reminisce on her eyes so fair  
Moonlight soft on her downy hair  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
If some day I should see her smile  
Hold her hand and me heart beguile  
Feel her warmth in her earnest prayer  
Darling shield me from all despair  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  
Now I'm standing alone and sad  
Thinkin' upon the joys I've had  
Time makes fools of men they say  
Take me back to that distant day  
I reveal how I do adore her  
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her  
All my love through out life assure her  
If this moment I could Amour her  

I heard the bells on Christmas day  
Their old familiar Carols play  
And wide and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth good will to man  
  
I thought as now this day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rung so long the unbroken song  
Of peace on earth good will to man  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
There is no peace on earth I said  
For hate is strong and marks the song  
Of peace on earth good will to man  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead nor does he sleep  
The wrong shall fail the right prevail  
With peace on earth good will to man

This is my island in the sun  
Where my people have toiled since time begun  
I may sail on many a sea  
Her shores will always be home to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, island in the sun  
Willed to me by my father's hand  
All my days I will sing in praise  
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand  
  
As morning breaks the heaven on high  
I lift my heavy load to the sky  
Sun comes down with a burning glow  
Mingles my sweat with the earth below  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see woman on bended knee  
Cutting cane for her family  
I see man at the waterside  
Casting nets at the surging tide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray the day will never come  
When I can't awake to the sound of drum  
Never let me miss carnival  
With calypso songs philosophical  
  
[Chorus]

Have you ever seen a rainbow  
Or a garden blooming bright  
Heard the shuffle of a thousand feet  
And drums from morning 'til night?  
  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Get your tamarind and sour sop,  
Mangoes and casaba,  
Bread fruit okra pigeon peas,  
Curry goat and guava  
  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Do you know a brown skin maiden  
With sunshine in her eyes?  
Heard the swallow and the humming bird  
Sing happy as she goes by?  
  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Have you seen the ghost of Morgan  
Or heard a tale you hadn't ought to?  
Have you welcomed the coming dawn  
With a rum an' cocoanut water  
  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down, come we go down  
Down to Kingston market

When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me  
Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree.  
Don't put your faith in love my boy, my father said to me,  
I'll fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree.  
  
Ref (2x):  
Lemon tree very pretty, and the lemon flower is sweet,  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.  
  
Beneath the lemon tree one day my love and I did lie,  
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.  
We past that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree,  
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me.  
  
Ref (2x)  
  
One day she left without a word she took away the sun,  
And in the dark she'd left behind I knew what she had done.  
She left me for another it's a common tale, but true,  
A sadder tale, but wiser now I sing this song for you.  
  
Ref (3x)

My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
No more grief and pain for me  
I heard from Heaven today  
Yes, my Lord's gonna set me free  
I heard from Him today  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
On my way to the promised land  
I heard from Him today  
God's gonna give me His right hand  
I heard from Heaven today  
  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
My Lord, what a mornin'  
Oh, my Lord, what a mornin'  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall

It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed  
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road  
Out of your dust bowl and westward we rolled  
Blue deserts so hot and your mountains so cold  
I wandered all over this green growing land  
Where ever your crops are I lend you my hands  
At the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then  
I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind  
California, arizona, I worked on your crops  
North up to oregon to gather your hops  
I got beets from your ground  
I cut grapes from your vines  
To sat on our table's that light that sparkling wine  
  
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground  
From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down  
Every state of this union us migrants have been  
Oh we come with the dust and we're gone, gone,gone with  
The wind  
It's always we rambled that river and I  
All along your green valley's I'd work till I die  
I traveled this road until death lets me be  
Cause pastures of plenty must always be free  
I's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed  
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road  
Edge of your cities you see me and then  
I come with the dust and I'm gone, gone, gone with the  
Wind

I peeked in to say good-night  
When I heard my child in prayer  
"And for me, some scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"  
  
All our stores were closed and shuttered  
All the streets were dark and bare  
In our town, no scarlet ribbons  
Not one ribbon for her hair  
  
Through the night my heart was aching  
Just before the dawn was breaking  
In our town, no scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair  
  
I peeked in and on her bed  
In gay profusion lying there  
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair  
  
If I live to be a hundred  
I will never know from where  
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons  
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

The fox went out to the chase one night  
Prayed to the moon to give him light  
He had many a mile to go that night  
Before he reached the town-o, town-o town-o,  
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town  
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town  
  
He ran 'til he came to a great big pen  
Where the ducks and the geese were kept there in  
Said a couple of you gonna grease my chin  
Before I leave this town o, town o, town o  
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town  
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town  
  
He grabbed the grey goose by the neck  
Throwed a duck across his back  
He didn't amind with the quack, quack quack  
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o  
Didn't amind with the quack, quack quack  
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o  
Didn't amind with the quack, quack quack  
And the legs all dang-ling down-o, down-o, down-o  
  
Old mother Flipper Flapper jumped out of bed  
Out of the window she cocked her head  
Cryin' John, John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the town-o, town-o, town-o  
John, John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the town-o  
John, John the grey goose is gone  
And the fox is on the town-o  
  
Well, the fox he came to his own den  
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o, town-o, town-o  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town  
Saying Daddy you better go back again  
'Cause it must be a mighty fine town  
  
Well, the fox and his wife without any strife  
Cut up the goose with a carving knife  
They never had such a supper in their life-acapo

Jesus our brother, kind and good  
Was humbly born in a stable of wood  
And the friendly beasts around Him stood  
Jesus our brother kind and good  
  
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown  
I carried His Mother up hill and down  
I carried His Mother to Bethlehem town  
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown  
  
I, said the sheep with curly horn  
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm  
He wore my coat on Christmas morn  
I, said the sheep with curly horn  
  
I, said the dove, from the rafters high  
I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry  
We cooed Him to sleep my love and I  
I, said the dove, from the rafters high  
  
Thus, every beast, by some good spell  
In the stable dark was glad to tell  
Of the gift he gave Emanuel  
Of the gift he gave Emanuel

I think of Andy in the cold wet clay  
Those three are on my mind  
With his comrades down beside him  
On that brutal day  
Those three are on my mind  
There lies young James in his final pain  
Those three are on my mind  
So I ask the killers, "Can you see those three again?  
Those three are on my mind"  
I see dark eyed Michael  
With his dark eyed bride  
Those three are on my mind  
And three proud mothers  
Weeping side by side  
Those three are on my mind  
But I'm grieving yet  
And for some the sky is bright  
I cannot give up hoping  
For a morning light  
So I ask the killers, "Do you sleep at night?  
Oh, those three are on my mind"  
I see tin roof shanties  
Where my brothers live  
Those three are on my mind  
And the little burnt out churches  
Where they sing we forgive  
Those three are on my mind  
I know of Tom paints water tree  
I know the price of liberty  
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me  
Did they also burn the Courthouse  
When they killed those three  
Those three are on my mind  
Those three are on my mind  
Those three are on my mind

Sometimes her hand warm from dreaming  
Finds it's way to my side of the morning  
And in between waking and sleeping  
We make love, we make love  
Sometimes she's quietly busy  
And I smile away all her intensions  
And among her forgotten excuses  
We make love, we make love  
Sometimes we just make love  
Sometimes we just make love  
Wo wo wo  
Sometimes in a room full of strangers  
In the distance of laughter and small talk  
With a look that takes only a moment  
We make love, we make love  
And after a moment of difference  
In the quiet of dying confusions  
On a blanket of gentle forgiving  
We make love, we make love  
Sometimes we just make love  
Sometimes we just make love

Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?  
Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb?

When spring comes around my love  
When spring comes around  
When winter is gone the hills are green  
Song of the lark is clear and clean  
I long for the lands I've never seen my love, my love  
When summer comes around my love  
When summer comes around  
As soon as I feel that sudden breeze  
I hoist my sail to the seven seas  
And let the wind take me where it please my love, my love  
When autumn comes around my love  
When autumn comes around  
As soon as the leaves begin to fall  
I'll anchor in some port of call  
I'll write a letter sending you all my love, my love  
When winter comes around my love  
When winter comes around  
The world will be white with silent snow  
The temperature down to ten below  
And home to the warmth of you I go my love, my love  
When spring comes again my love  
When spring comes again  
You and the lams will play again  
And though I will want to stay again  
You know I'll be on my way again my love, my love

Will his love be like his rum,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
Intoxicating all night long,  
Yes it will, yes it will, everybody,  
  
Drink, drink this toast,  
Drink this wedding toast,  
Drink oh drink this toast,  
To the two we love the most,  
  
Did he wed her in the spring,  
Yes he did, yes he did,  
Did he give her finger ring,  
Yes he did, yes he did,  
  
Will her cooking be the best,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
Make his belly split his best,  
Yes it will, yes it will,  
  
Will she be a perfect wife,  
Yes she will, yes she will,  
Make him work hard all his life,  
Yes she will, yes she will,  
  
Will we dance and sing all night-a,  
Yes we will, yes we will,  
Eat up everything inside,  
Yes we will, yes we will

Lyrics:  
It was a Zombie Jamboree  
Took place in a New York cemetery  
It was a Zombie Jamboree  
Took place in a New York cemetery  
Zombies from all parts of the Island  
Some of them was a great Calypsonians  
Although the season was Carnival  
We get together in bacchanal  
And they singing  
Back to back, belly to belly  
I don't give a damn, I done dead already  
Oho back to back, belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
One female Zombie wouldn't behave  
See how she jumping out of the grave  
In one hand a quarter rum  
In the other hand she knocking Congo drum  
Believe singer start to make his rhyme  
The Zombies are racking their bones in thyme  
One bystander had this to say  
T was a pleasure to see the Zombies break away  
Back to back, belly to belly  
I don't give a damn, I done dead already  
Oho back to back, belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
I goin talk to Miss Brigit Bardot  
And tell her miss Bardot take it slow  
All the men think they're Casanova  
When they see that she's bare foot all over  
Even old men out into beaker  
Find their hearts getting weaker and weaker  
So I goin to ask her for your sake and mine  
At least to wear her ear rings part at the time  
Back to back, belly to belly  
I don't give a damn, I done dead already  
Oho back to back, belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
A lot of World leaders talkin bout war  
And I'm afraid they're going too far  
So it's up to us you and me  
To put an end to Catastrophe  
We must appeal to their goodness of heart  
And ask them to breech in and please do their part  
Cause if this Atomic war begin  
They wont even have a part to breech in  
Back to back, belly to belly-
