I can see you now living like a queen  
In a house that has everything, everything but love  
Crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines  
Yes you'll really have everything, everything but love  
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls  
And as the picture clears  
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone  
Counting her treasures in tears  
Better just a shack where two people care  
Than a house that has everything, everything but love  
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls  
And as the picture clears  
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone  
Counting her treasures in tears  
Better just a shack where two people care  
Than a house that has everything, everything but love  
Than a house that has everything, everything but love  

Now that the truth is hard to face  
I can't forget you once were mine  
Someone else is in my place  
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Clouds my eyes to what I've seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that there's nothing I can do  
  
Please don't try to tie me down  
Those are the words you often say  
I can't help seeing you around  
You smile with surprise, I turn my eyes away  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Oh-oh-ho, clouds my eyes to what I've seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that there's nothing I can do  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Just a little bit of green  
Oh-oh-ho, clouds my eyes to what I've seen  
Just a little bit of green  
When I see you with someone new  
And knowing that there's nothing I can do  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Just a little bit of green

A little less conversation  
A little less conversation, a little more action please  
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
Satisfy me baby  
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music  
  
Drifting through a summer breeze  
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it  
Come along with me and put your mind at ease  
A little less conversation, a little more action please  
  
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
  
Satisfy me baby  
Come on baby I'm tired of talking  
Grab your coat and let's start walking  
Come on, come on  
  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on  
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate  
Girl it's getting late, gettin' upset waitin' around  
  
A little less conversation, a little more action please  
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me  
A little more bite and a little less bark  
A little less fight and a little more spark  
  
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  
Satisfy me baby

Six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds  
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love  
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love  
Look you in the eye and never back up  
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love  
  
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands  
Like the rules that govern our land  
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love  
  
It can lift you up, it can put you down  
Take your world and turn it all around  
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love  
Men like me they worry and doubt  
Trouble their minds day in and day out  
Too busy a livin' to worry about a thing called love  
  
And then I see a mother's tenderness  
As she holds her young close to her breast  
Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called love.

Ou kiss me darling, a miracle starts  
A magic feeling, comes into our hearts  
The spell of love began, when we're alone  
And we're in, a world of our own  
You say you want me, and music I hear  
Touch me my darling, and clouds disappear  
The sky is bright above, and cares have flown  
And we're in, a world of our own  
Holding you close, is heaven  
Only I know, what it's worth  
Knowing you're mine, forever  
Is the greatest wonder on earth  
Nothing can change it, the magic's begun  
When we're together, our hearts become one  
I find a happiness, I've never known  
When we're in, a world of our own  
When we're in...a world of our own  

I could ride around the world in an old oxcart  
And never let another girl thrill my heart  
  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you so?  
  
I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun  
My huggin' and my kissin' belong to just one  
  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you so?  
  
If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat  
I'd give 'em all to you and never take one back  
  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you so?  
  
I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm goin' downtown  
But I'll be kissin' your lips before the sun goes down  
  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you so?  
  
Ain't that loving you baby?  
Ain't that loving you so?

Hello misfortune, how's my old friend "Mr. Misery"?  
I've been away so long I bet you think you saw the last of me  
Got no bed, to rest my head  
No doors or walls or window pane  
Now all I needed was the rain  
Rain, rain, rain, rain  
  
Met a little honey at the "Buzzin' Bumble Bee Cafe"  
Yes I did  
One drink and all my money and that honey bee had flown away  
I'm 'bout as low, as I can go  
I don't really mean to complain  
Now all I needed was the rain  
Rain, rain, rain, rain  
  
All I needed was this rain  
All I needed was the rain, um, um

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton  
Old times they are not forgotten  
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland  
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away  
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie  
Cause Dixieland, that's where I was born  
Early Lord one frosty morning  
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
Glory, glory hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
So hush little baby  
Don't you cry  
You know your daddy's bound to die  
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over

And I love you so  
People ask me how  
How I've lived 'til now  
I tell them I don't know  
I guess they understand  
How lonely life has been  
But life began again  
The day you took my hand  
  
And yes I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me  
And the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me  
  
And you love me too  
Your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free  
And I'm happy that you do  
  
The book of life is brief  
And once a page is read  
All but love is dead  
That is my belief  
  
And yes I know how loveless life can be  
The shadows follow me  
And the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening bring me down  
Now that you're around me  
  
And I love you so  
People ask me how  
How I've lived 'til now  
I tell them I don't know

Listen easy, you can hear God calling  
Walking barefoot by the stream  
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling  
On my face as in a dream  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Saying nothing, lying where the sun is  
Baking down upon our sides  
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses  
Your hands gentle in reply  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
  
Child, touch my soul with your cries  
And the music will know what we've found  
I, hear a hundred good-byes  
But today I hear only one sound  
The moment we're living is now  
Now now now now now now now  
  
Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing  
Cools the sweat inside my palms  
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing  
As you lay sleeping in my arms  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass won't pay no mind  
No the grass won't pay no mind

Angel, with those angel eyes  
Come and take this earth boy  
Up to paradise  
  
Angel, may I hold you tight?  
Never kissed an angel  
Let me kiss one tonight  
  
If I said "I love you"  
Would I be speaking out of turn?  
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn  
  
Angel, make my wish come true  
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you  
  
Angel, never kissed an angel  
Let me kiss one tonight  
  
If I said "I love you"  
Would I be speaking out of turn?  
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn  
  
Angel, make my wish come true  
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you

Don't ever take tour eyes off me  
Not even for a minute  
'Cause like a panther I might pounce  
And that will be the limit  
  
I can be sneaky, fast as a snake  
I strike like a cobra, make no mistake  
And baby you'll be trapped, quick as a wink  
It's animal instinct  
  
Don't think that I won't pin you down  
No matter how you plead it  
I'm like a lion who's been caged  
And you are gonna meet it  
  
Watch out I'll warn ya', sharp as a hawk  
I'm wild as a tiger, I prowl and I stalk  
'cause when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink  
It's animal instinct  
  
You better not be caught off guard  
This wolf is on the search now  
A leopard just can't change it's spots  
And I'm about to lurch now  
I roar like the jungle, I fight tooth and nail  
I just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail  
I'm ready for the kill, I'm right on the brink  
It's animal instinct  
It's animal instinct, animal instinct

Any day now I will hear you say  
Goodbye my love  
You'll be on your way  
Then my wild beautiful bird  
You will have flown  
Any day now I'll be all alone  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Any day now, when your restless eyes  
Meet someone new  
To my sad surprise  
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town  
Any day now  
Love will let me down  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
I know I shouldn't want to keep you  
If you don't want to stay, yeah  
Until you've gone forever  
I'll be holding on for dear life  
Holding you this way  
Begging you to stay  
  
Any day now  
When the clock strikes go  
You'll call it off  
Then my tears will flow  
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town  
Any day now  
Love will let me down  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, any day now  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, any day now  
Don't fly away my beautiful bird  
  
Don't fly away my beautiful bird

Whether you're riding down a highway  
Or walkin' down a street  
It makes no difference baby  
I'm gonna love you just as mean  
'Cause holdin' your little hand  
Makes me feel so very nice  
Anyplace is paradise  
When I'm with you  
  
Whether we're standin' on a doorstep  
Or sittin' at a park  
Or strollin' down shady lane  
Or dancin' in the dark  
Well I can take you in my arms  
And look into your pretty eyes  
Anyplace is paradise  
When I'm with you  
  
Give me a cave up in the mountain  
Or a shack down by the sea  
And I will be in heaven honey  
If you are there with me  
Well kiss your pretty lips  
See the love-light in your eyes  
Anyplace is paradise  
When I'm with you  
  
Baby I'd live deep in the jungle  
And sleep up in a tree  
And let the rest of the world go be  
If you were there with me  
Well I could love you all the time  
Baby, a jungle would be fine  
Anyplace is paradise  
When I'm with you.

I memorized the note you sent  
Go to all the places that we went  
I seem to search the whole day through  
For anything that's part of you  
  
I kept a ribbon from your hair  
A breath of perfume lingers there  
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue  
Anything that's part of you  
  
Oh, how it hurts to miss you so  
When I know you don't love me anymore  
To go on needing you  
Knowing you don't need me  
  
No reason left for me to live  
What can I take, what can I give  
When I'd give all of someone new  
For anything that's part of you?

I'll be as strong as a mountain,  
Or weak as a willow tree,  
Anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be.  
  
I'll be as tame as a baby,  
Or wild as the raging sea,  
Anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be.  
  
In your hands my heart is clay,  
To take and hold as you may.  
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me,  
And in your arms I will stay.  
  
I'll be a fool or a wise man,  
My darling you hold the key,  
Yes, anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be,  
I will be.

Are you lonesome tonight,  
Do you miss me tonight?  
Are you sorry we drifted apart?  
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day  
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?  
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?  
  
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight  
You know someone said that the world's a stage  
And each must play a part.  
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.  
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance  
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue  
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange  
And why I'll never know.  
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me  
And I had no cause to doubt you.  
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies  
Than go on living without you.  
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there  
With emptiness all around  
And if you won't come back to me  
Then make them bring the curtain down.  
  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Are you sincere when you say I love you  
Are you sincere when you say you love me too  
Oh and are you really mine every day, all the time  
I've gotta know which way to go  
Will our love grow, are you sincere  
  
Are you sincere when you say I love you  
Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too  
  
And are you really mine every day, all the time  
I've gotta know which way to go  
Will our love grow, are you sincere

Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And auld lang syne

You don't like crazy music  
You don't like rockin' bands  
You just wanna go to a movie show  
And sit there holdin' hands  
You're so square, baby, I don't care  
You don't like hotrod racin'  
Or drivin' late at night  
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark  
You just wanna hold me tight  
You're so square, baby, I don't care  
You don't know any dance steps that are new  
No one else could love me like you do, do, do, do  
I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why I love you, baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square, baby, I don't care  
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care  
Baby, I don't care  
I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why I love you, baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square, baby, I don't care  
Baby, I don't care, baby, I don't care  
Care, care, I don't care, care, care  

Oh yes, I know it's true  
The more you fall in love  
The more your heart can break in two  
Now that you've said goodbye  
  
For every tender kiss  
I've had the tears I cry  
I gave my heart and soul  
All the love I knew  
  
Oh how much it hurts me now  
To know that we are through  
  
I'll always feel this way  
My arms will be so empty  
You'll return some day and say  
Your love, yes your big love  
Will be here to stay  
Till then it's  
  
Your love yes your big love  
Will be here to stay

Every man has a black star  
A black star over his shoulder  
And when a man sees his black star  
He knows his time, his time has come  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
When I ride I feel that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
So I ride in front of that black star  
Never lookin' around, never lookin' around  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
One fine day I'll see that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
And when I see that old black star  
I'll know my time, my time has come  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star

How many roads must a man walk down,  
Before you call him a man?  
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail,  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
  
Yes and how many times must cannonballs fly,  
Before they're forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
How many times must a man look up,  
Before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have,  
Before he can hear people cry?  
  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind  
  
How many years can a mountain exist,  
Before it's washed to the seas (sea)  
How many years can some people exist,  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
  
How many times can a man turn his head,  
Pretend that he just doesn't see?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

In the twilight glow i see her  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
  
Love is like a dying ember  
Only memories remain  
Through the ages i remember  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Blue moon  
Blue moon  
Blue moon, keep a-shinin' bright  
Blue moon, keep on a-shinin' bright  
You're gonna bring-a me back-a my baby tonight  
Blue moon, keep a-shinin' bright  
  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
A-well-a, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shinin' bright  
Whispered on high  
Love's said goodbye  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
Well I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
I said, blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue  
  
A-well-a, it was on one moonlight night  
Stars shinin' bright  
Whispered on high  
Love's said goodbye  
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know  
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go  
To cry their tears, blue river  
  
It winds along a path of heartache and pain  
Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain  
Like I loved you, and baby I still do  
  
I held you so tight  
You were out of my sight  
I'm feelin' so low  
But I gotta go  
  
Blue river because you never really cared about me  
From now on baby that's where I'm gonna be  
Cryin' over you, by the river of blue

I said, "Take it easy, baby  
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead  
You got my shirt tails  
Flyin' all over the place  
And the sweat poppin' out of my head"  
  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on a workin', child  
This ain't no time to quit"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
I'm about to have myself a fit"  
Bossa Nova, Bossa Nova  
  
I said, "Hey, little mama  
Let's sit down  
Have a drink and dig the band"  
  
She said, "Drink, drink, drink  
Oh, fiddle-de-dink  
I can dance with a drink in my hand"  
She said, "Hey, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
This ain't no time to drink"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
'Cause I ain't got time to think"  
  
I said, "Come on, baby  
It's hot in here  
And it's oh-so cool outside  
If you lend me a dollar  
I can buy some gas  
And we can go for a little ride"  
  
She said, "Hey Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on workin', child  
I ain't got time for that"  
She said, "Go, Bossa Nova Baby  
Keep on dancin'  
Or I'll find myself another cat"

When You're weary, feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all  
I'm on your site, oh, When times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down,  
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
When you're down and out, when you're on the streets  
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you  
I'll take your part when the darkness falls and pain is all around  
Yes, like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine  
Oh, if you need a friend,  
I'm sailing right behind  
Yes, like a bridge over troubled water  
I, I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will easy your mind  

If I can never see you, if I can never hold you  
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace  
I still remember talkin', I still remember laughin'  
I still remember lovin' you a lot and touchin' you  
  
Only bringin' it back, only just bringin' it back  
A familiar face, a familiar face just brings it all back  
Everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back  
Even after so much time, everything's bringin' it back  
  
Thinkin' in my solitude, wonderin' about your attitude  
Thinkin' maybe that your love has died  
There it is, I can see it in your eyes  
A look of sweet surrender, a touch of too much sadness  
'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows  
You just can't stay, but you can't let go

Beware of a gal in britches  
Yo-di-o-di-o  
Never trust no gal in britches  
No-di-o-di-o

Yo-di-o-di-o  
No feminine gal wears britches  
No-di-o-di-o  
She'll beg you to come to the country dance  
You ride twenty miles for the big romance  
She shows up in her brother's pants  
What'd you expect from a girl in britches  
  
Yo-di-o-di-o-i-ay, It's none of my misfortune  
Yo-di-o-di-o-di-ay, Just thought you'd like to know  
Don't marry no gal in britches  
Yo-di-o-di-o  
You'll never know which is which's  
No-di-o-di-o  
She'll put a halter through your nose  
Have you cooking and washing clothes  
While she goes chasing them buffaloes  
Bet your boots, that's a gal in britches.

He was sitting in the witness stand  
The judge's wife called up the district attorney  
Said you free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a twa,  
I saw a woman walking across the sand  
She been a walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay  
To get a brown eyed handsome man  
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man  
  
Way back in history three thousand years  
Back every since the world began  
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear  
For a brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Rounding third he was headed for home  
It was a brown eyed handsome man  
That won the game, it was a brown eyed handsome man

(Tex Owens)  
The cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the dogies bawl  
Where spurs are a-jinglin' a cowboy is singin'  
This lonesome cattle call  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo  
He rides in the sun, till his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Singin' his cattle call.  
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up a squall  
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo  
He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie  
And sings with an ol' western drawl  
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo  
Singin' his cattle call

I said see, see, see rider  
Oh, see what you have done  
I said see, see, see rider  
Oh, see what you have done  
Oh girl, you made me love you  
Now, now, now your lovin' man has gone  
  
Hear what I say  
Well, I'm going away, baby  
And I won't be back to fall  
Well, I'm going away baby  
And I won't be back to fall  
And if I find me a good girl  
I won't, I won't be back at all  
  
Hear what I say, I said  
See see rider,  
Oh see what you have done  
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're in old habits  
Set in your old ways  
Changes are a-comin'  
For these are changing days  
  
And if your head is in the sand  
While things are goin' on  
What you need, what you need,  
What you need is a change of habit  
  
Now if you're in the habit  
To let your temper fly  
When you talk with people  
Who don't see eye to eye  
  
And if you don't believe it  
There's a newer world ahead  
What you need, what you need,  
What you need is a change of habit  
  
A change of habit, a change of outlook  
A change of heart, you'll be all right  
The halls of darkness  
Have doors that open  
It's never too late  
To see the light  
  
So if you're in the habit  
Of putting people down  
Just because they're different  
From the wrong side of town  
  
Well, don't count on any medals son  
They're pinning none on you  
What you need, what you need,  
What you need is a change of habit

Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree  
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me  
I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away  
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree  
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee  
Told them that I love you, they all know its true  
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot  
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot  
Need you in the evening when supper time is through  
What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing  
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string  
If only you would love me say it and tell me so  
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world know  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me  
  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy  
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me

When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues  
Night people hear the call  
From hidden alleys, secret rendezvous  
They come out one and all  
The city by night I'm wide awake  
It never sleeps make no mistake  
Whatever sets off the spark  
A magic glow lights the dark  
Then I'm intrigued by the sight  
Of the city by night  
Those crowded nightclubs  
Those picturesque cafes  
Are scenes no-one forgets  
And I'm enchanted, music softly plays  
By dancing silhouettes  
The city by night I'm wide awake  
It never sleeps make no mistake  
The evening's full of surprise  
It's magic opens my eyes  
And I'm intrigued by the sight  
Of the city by night  
Yeah!  

All right, Hmm

Back porch preacher preaching at me  
Acting like he wrote the golden rules  
Shaking his fist and speeching at me  
Shouting from his soap box like a fool  
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed  
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head  
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be  
Heading for Sunday school  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine  
Drugstore cowboy criticizing  
Acting like he's better than you and me  
Standing on the sidewalk supervising  
Telling everybody how they ought to be  
Come closing time 'most every night  
He locks up tight and out go the lights  
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife  
With his employee  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine  
Armchair quarterback's always moanin'  
Second guessing people all day long  
Pushing, fooling and hanging on in  
Always messing where they don't belong  
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty  
Isn't it a pity that in this big city  
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit  
He could have been a little bit wrong  
Clean up your own backyard  
Oh don't you hand me, don't you hand me none of your lines  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine  
Clean up your own backyard  
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine  
  

I can't explain about last night  
Though things didn't look just right  
Please believe me there was nothing wrong  
I thought about you baby all night long  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie, mmm  
  
Talk about a piece of rotten luck  
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck  
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree  
Very hard to handle like a Model T  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
Please believe me when I say  
Wild horses couldn't drag me away  
From you 'cause I don't have to look too hard  
To see what I've got in my own back yard  
So be forgiving and forget  
Don't say my alibi's all wet (?)  
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb  
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home  
Cross my heart, hope to die  
Well I wouldn't tell you no lie  
  
I wouldn't tell you no lie  
No no no no no no  
I wouldn't tell you no lie

You saw me crying in the chapel  
The tears I shed were tears of joy  
I know the meaning of contentment  
I am happy with the Lord  
  
Just a plain and simple chapel  
Where all good people go to pray  
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger  
As I live from day to day  
  
I searched and I searched but I couldn't find  
No way on earth to gain peace of mind  
  
Now I'm happy in the chapel  
Where people are of one accord  
Yes, we gather in the chapel  
Just to sing and praise the Lord  
  
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find  
No way on earth to gain peace of mind  
  
Take your troubles to the chapel  
Get down on your knees and pray  
Then your burdens will be lighter  
And you'll surely find the way

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone and all the roses dying  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow  
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so  
  
But if he come and all the roses dying  
And I am dead, as dead I well may be  
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an ava there for me  
  
And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me  
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me

Dark moon, way up high up in the sky

Walk like an angel  
Talk like an angel  
But I got wise  
You're the devil in disguise  
Oh yes you are

Have you have any idea who I am  
Yes it's been quite a while  
And it's so good to see you again

Do you know how I tried  
Have you any idea how I tried  
Not to keep you in sight

Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me

Though you're not good for me  
I want you so  
  
It's not the kind  
Of love I dream about  
But it's the kind  
That I can't live without  
  
You're all I'm longing for  
Don't say good-bye  
I need you more and more  
Don't ask me why  
I need you more and more  
Don't ask me why

You know I can be found,  
Sitting home all alone,  
If you can't come around,  
At least please telephone.  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
  
Baby, if I made you mad  
For something I might have said,  
Please, let's forget the past,  
The future looks bright ahead,  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
I don't want no other love,  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.  
  
Don't stop thinking of me,  
Don't make me feel this way,  
Come on over here and love me,  
You know what I want you to say.  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
Why should we be apart?  
I really love you baby, cross my heart.  
  
Let's walk up to the preacher  
And let us say I do,  
Then you'll know you'll have me,  
And I'll know that I'll have you,  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
I don't want no other love,  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.  
  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.  
I don't want no other love,  
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.

Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing in my head,  
My pillow still wet  
From last night's tears  
As I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Kept crying out  
Ringing in my ears  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cry, daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy  
And together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy, ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy  
Please  
Don't cry  
  
Why are children always first  
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst  
It's true but somehow  
It just don't seem right  
'Cause every time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so I wonder  
Will it be the same tonight  
  
[Chorus:x2]  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Don't leave me now  
Now that I need you  
How blue and lonely I'd be  
If you should say we're through  
  
Don't break my heart  
This heart that loves you  
They'll just be nothing for me  
If you should leave me now  
  
What good is dreamin'  
If I must dream all alone by myself  
Without you darling  
My arms would gather dust  
  
Come to these arms  
These arms that need you  
Don't close your eyes to my plea  
Don't leave me now.

Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two  
There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do  
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground  
Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town  
  
[Chorus]  
I got double trouble, I got double trouble  
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah!  
  
I guess there's gotta be two dark clouds hanging over me  
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea  
Every time I think that I have finally got it made  
Some losing cards are played, I just can't make the grade  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I'm gonna lay down my burden, down by the riverside,  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm gonna lay down my burden, down by the riverside,  
I'm gonna study war no more  
  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
  
Well, I'm gonna put on my long white robe, (Where?) down by the riverside (Oh)  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm gonna put on my long white robe, (Where?) down by the riverside  
I'm gonna study war no more  
  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
  
Well, I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield, (Where?) down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield, (A-ha) down by the riverside  
I'm gonna study war no more  
  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  
I ain't a gonna study war no more, I ain't a gonna study war no more  

Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane  
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane  
Down in the alley, just you and me  
We're going bowlin' till half past three  
Just rockin' and reelin', we'll get that feelin'  
Down in the alley, oh baby gee  
  
I wake you now and dig you later  
'Cause you're a fine sweet potato  
We'll have a ball and that ain't all  
Down in the alley, just you and me  
  
The clock is striking a mournful sound  
This time of evening my love comes down  
That's when I'm missin' your kind of kissin'  
Down in the alley, that's where I'll be  
  
Down in the alley, we sure have fun  
We just get started 'bout half past one  
So if you're round just come on down  
Down in the alley and you will see  
  
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane  
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane  
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane  
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane

Drums of the islands you're beating in my heart  
You're with me no matter where I roam  
If ever I wander if ever we're apart  
I know that you will lead me home  
If I should journey across the deep blue sea  
I'll never forget these coral shores  
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me  
And I'll return forever yours  
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill  
The flowers the music of the isles  
These are the things I love and always will  
Though I may roam ten thousand miles

In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart  
And my -pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain  
So I best be on my way  
In the early mornin' rain

Easy come, easy go  
Here, there, everywhere, crazy love is in the air  
Nightfall, mmm, day and nightfall  
So many girls in every port  
You gotta be a juggernaut  
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught  
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  
  
Easy come, easy go  
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound, delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
  
All right!  
When you want love to keep you warm  
There's nothing like a uniform  
You got a port in any storm  
There she blows  
  
Easy come, easy go  
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound, delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come, easy go  
Easy come, easy go

I walk along a thin line darling  
Dark shadows follow me  
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned  
The edge of reality  
  
Oh I can hear strange voices echo  
Laughing with mockery  
The border line of doom I'm facing  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I can't explain  
She drove me to the point of madness  
The brink of misery  
If she's not real then I'm condemned to  
The edge of reality  
  
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me  
The girl with the nameless face  
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me  
With fears that I can't explain  
She drove me to the point of madness  
The brink of misery  
If she's not real then I'm condemned to  
The edge of reality  
  
Reality, reality, reality, reality,  
Reality, reality, reality, reality.

There's a legend of a famous matador  
Who went to meet El Toro  
Though he fought as he had never done before  
He could not beat, El Toro  
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame  
They said time would never heal the many scars  
Brought by the great, El Toro  
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart  
Caused him to hate, El Toro  
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame  
So one night, when no-one was on sight  
The matador, went to finish the score  
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight  
He fought the bull...and they fought once more  
When they found the matador and saw him dying  
He'd never see tomorrow  
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying  
Still walks the proud El Toro  
The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame  

As I read the letters, wow, that you wrote to me  
Well it's you, it's you I'm thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet  
I remember our faded love  
  
I miss you darlin' more and more everyday  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat, I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had  
As I watch the mating of the doves  
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye  
I remember our faded love  
  
Yeah, I miss you darlin' more and more everyday  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat, I still think... think of you  
And remember our faded love  
I remember our faded love  
I remember our faded love  
  
Well, I miss you darlin' more and more everyday  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat, I still think... think of you  
And remember our faded love  
Yeah, I remember our faded love  
I remember our faded love

I'll pack up all my things and walk away,  
I don't want to hear another word you have to say  
I've been waiting for so long  
I just found out there's something wrong  
And there's nothing what get better if I stay  
  
There's no need to explain anymore  
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door  
You used me, you deceived me,  
And you never seemed to need me  
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go  
  
Seems I've been lost in a dream  
Pretending that you care  
But now I've opened up my eyes  
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale  
  
I've been lovin' you so long  
Don't think I'd even know how to forget you  
But now the way that things have been  
I think I'm better off alone  
Than to be with you  
  
There's no need to explain anymore  
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door  
You used me, you deceived me,  
And you never seemed to need me  
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go  
  
Seems like I've been lost in a dream  
Pretending you were mine  
Someday you'll open up your eyes  
And realize that a good man's hard to find

Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder  
Why it should be thus all the day long  
While there are others living about us  
Never molested, though in the wrong  
  
Farther along we'll know more about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by  
  
When death has come and taken our loved ones  
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear  
Then do we wonder how others prosper  
Living so wicked year after year  
  
Farther along we'll know more about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by

Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night.  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said Julie, baby, you're my flame  
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm on fire  
Fever yea I burn for sooth  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said daddy, o, don't you dare  
He gives me fever with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses,  
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Cats were born to give chicks fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade  
We give you fever when we kiss you  
Fever if you live and learn  
Fever till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

Baby you know me well  
You know I mean what I say  
Before I say farewell  
I'll give you just another day  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
  
Tell me what you're gonna do  
You'd better make up your mind  
It all depends on you  
I'm leaving you behind  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
  
Baby you know it's true  
We've been through thick and thin  
But if you don't come through  
You won't ever see me again  
  
You'd better find out what's happening  
Find out what's happening before long, Oh yeah  
If you don't find out what's happening  
You're gonna find out that I've gone now, Oh yeah  
You'd better find, find, better find out  
  
Better find out  
Better find, better find out  
Better find, better find out  
If you don't find, you're gonna find out that I'm gone

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
I won't weep and I won't moan  
'Cause I found you and your love so true  
And I'm keeping you for my own  
  
Heads I win or tails I lose  
I bet my heart to win your love  
The day you kissed me, good luck was with me  
And I thank my lucky stars above  
  
I'm not the kind to play for fun  
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won  
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
The loser has to pay the score  
He lost you and I found you  
And I'm keeping you for ever more  
  
I'm not the kind to play for fun  
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won  
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers  
The loser has to pay the score  
He lost you and I found you  
And I'm keeping you for ever more  
He lost you and I found you  
And I'm keeping you for ever more  
Yeah he lost you and I found you  
And I'm keeping you for ever more  
He lost you and I found you  
And I'm keeping you for ever more

When they gave out eyes like diamonds  
That would shame the stars that shine  
My darlin' my darlin'  
You were the first in line  
When they gave out lips like honey  
That hold a new thrill every time  
My darlin' my darlin'  
You were the first in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But there's no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh, please be mine  
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'  
The first, and the last in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But there's no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh, please be mine  
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'  
The first, and the last in line

Follow that dream, I gotta follow that dream  
Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving  
  
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
When your heart gets restless, time to move along  
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song  
  
But when a dream is calling you,  
There's just one thing that you can do  
  
Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need  
Keep a-movin', move along, keep a moving  
Got to find me someone whose heart is free  
  
Someone to look for my dream with me  
And when I find her I may find out  
Just what my dreams are all about  
  
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
  
Keep a-movin', move along  
Keep a-movin', move along  
Keep a-movin, move along

Fool, you didn't have to hurt her  
Fool, you didn't have to lose her  
Fool, you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool, you could have made her want you  
Fool, you could have made her love you  
Fool, you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Gone now, the love and laughter  
See yourself the morning after  
Can't you see her eyes are misty  
As she said good bye  
  
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her  
Fool, you didn't have to lose her  
Fool, you only had to love her  
But now your love is gone  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Fool, you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool, you could have made her want you  
Fool, you could have made her love you  
Fool, you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool, you didn't have to hurt her  
Fool, you didn't have to lose her  
Fool, you only had to love her

Fools rush in, where angels fear to tread  
And so I come to you my love  
My heart above my head  
Though I see the danger there  
If there's a chance for me  
Then I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Fools rush in, where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love  
So how are they to know  
When we met, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let  
This fool rush in  
  
And I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh  
Fools rush in, where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love  
So how are they to know  
When we met, I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let  
This fool rush in  
  
So open up your heart and let  
This fool rush in  
  
So open up your heart and let  
This fool rush in  
  
So open up your heart and let  
This fool rush in

That's what you get for loving me  
That's what you get for loving me  
Everything we had is gone, you can see  
That's what you get for loving me  
Now don't you shed a tear for me  
I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I've had a hundred just like you  
But don't be blue I'll have a thousand before I'm through  
That's what you get for loving me  
That's what you get for loving me  
Everything we had is gone, you can see  
That's what you get for loving me  
Now there you go, you're cryin' again  
You should have known how things would end  
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend  
I just might pass this way again  
That's what you get for loving me  
That's what you get for loving me  
Everything we had is gone, you can see  
That's what you get for loving me  

Before you go, walk out on me  
Take a look around, tell me what you see  
Here I stand like an open book  
Is there something here, you might have overlooked  
  
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave  
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be  
  
The years we had were not all bad  
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad  
Now you say that you've grown tired  
You want to be by yourself a-while  
  
It would be a shame if you should go  
And find that freedom was a long time ago  
  
I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you  
They just keep on drivin' us apart  
And you could go where I could never find you  
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart  
  
So one more time, for ol' times sake  
Come and lay your head upon my chest  
Please don't throw this moment away  
We can forget the bad and take the best  
  
If you don't have nothing left to say  
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake  
  
And if you don't have nothing left to say  
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring  
I've played a ace and I won the queen  
I walked away with your heart  
  
From a jack to a king  
With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night  
And lady luck played her hand just right  
You made me king of your heart  
  
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game  
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes  
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring  
I played an ace and I won the queen  
You made me king of your heart

And when I find her I may find out  
Just what my dreams are all about  
  
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
  
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need  
  
Keep a-movin', move along  
Keep a-movin', move along  
Keep a-movin', move along

Well hello there,  
My it's been a long long time  
How am I doin',  
Oh well I guess I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  
  
How's your new love,  
I hope that he's doin' fine  
Heard you told him, yes baby  
That you'd love him till the end of time  
Well you know, that's the same thing  
That you told me  
Well it seems like just the other day  
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  
  
Gotta go now,  
Guess I'll see you hanging round  
Don't know when though, oh  
Never know when I'll be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time your gonna pay  
  
Well ain't it surprisin' how time slips away  
Yeah, ain't it surprisin' how time slips away

It's knowin' that your door is always open  
And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag  
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch  
  
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled  
By forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads  
  
By the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
  
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy  
Planted on their columns now that bind me  
Or something that somebody said because  
  
They thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world  
Will not be cursing or forgiving  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
  
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junkyards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
  
I still might run in silence  
Tears of joy might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see  
  
You walkin' on the back roads  
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind  
  
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron  
In some train yard  
My beard a rustlin' coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
  
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're waitin' from the back roads  
  
By the rivers of my memory  
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

Gently your eyes met mine  
Tender, trusting, true  
Gently your hand took mine  
Thrilled me through and through  
  
Gently, oh so gently  
Gentle as the dawn  
Gently, oh so gently  
Our true love was born  
  
Gently your lips kissed mine  
As we strolled along  
Gently your heart touched mine  
Young and warm and strong  
  
Gently the hour is near  
When true loves have to part  
Gently we'll meet again  
One more kiss, sweetheart

They give us a room  
with a view of the beautiful Rhine  
They give us a room  
with a view of the beautiful Rhine  
Gimme a muddy old creek  
in Texas any old time  
  
I've got those hup, two, three, four  
occupation G.I. Blues  
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes  
And if I don't go stateside soon  
I'm gonna blow my fuse  
  
We get hasenpfeffer  
and black pumpernickel for chow  
We get hasenpfeffer  
and black pumpernickel for chow  
I'd blow my next month's pay  
for a slice of Texas cow  
  
We'd like to be heroes,  
but all we do here is march  
We'd like to be heroes,  
but all we do here is march  
And they don't give the Purple Heart  
for a fallen arch  
  
I've got those hup, two, three, four  
occupation G.I. Blues  
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes  
And if I don't go stateside soon  
I'm gonna blow my fuse  
  
The frauleins are pretty as flowers  
But we can't make a pass  
The frauleins are pretty as flowers  
But we can't make a pass  
Cause they're all wearin' signs saying:  
"Keepen sie off the grass"  
  
I've got those hup, two, three, four  
occupation G.I. Blues  
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes  
And if I don't go stateside soon  
I'm gonna blow my fuse  
  
Occupation G.I. Blues  
Occupation G.I. Blues  
Talley ho!

[Chorus:]  
Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy  
Girl happy, can't you see  
  
Every girl I see looks good to me  
What crazy way I were to be  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I see a pretty face  
My heart just heads for outer space  
I need a girl to make my life worth of living  
Yes...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy  
Mama keep your daughter out of sight  
I'm in a loving mood tonight  
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women  
Well...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy  
First nurse that rocked my cradle made me jump to joy  
  
[Chorus] [x 2]

When your asleep beside me, I watch you lying there  
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair  
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry  
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight  
Down life's golden road and you'll always know  
I love you ... girl of mine  
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right  
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night  
I wouldn't blame you darlin' if you walked out on me  
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently  
Oh girl of mine you make my day  
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away  
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me  
Our love will always be  
So girl of mine turn out the light  
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight  
Down life's golden road and you'll always know  
I love you ... girl of mine  

Give me the right  
To hold you tonight  
The tears that I've cried over you  
Give me the right  
You can't say no  
When I need you so  
I want you back in my arms  
Give me the right  
If you looked deep in your heart  
Like I looked into mine  
You'll find that nothing has changed  
Our love was there all the time  
Why make me plead  
For something you need  
I want to bring back the thrill  
Give me the right  
Give me the right  

Say you're mine, then ask me what you will  
All your dreams, my darling I'll fulfill  
Golden coins, I will bring to you  
Silver trinkets and rubies too  
In return dear I'm begging you  
For the pleasures of love  
I'll bring gifts, like you never saw  
Priceless garments that you'll adore  
Persian rugs to enhance your floor  
For the pleasures of love  
Darling, choose anything you please  
Rich brocade, or woven tapestries  
In exchange, I plead on my knees  
For the pleasure of love  
Golden coins, I'll place at your feet  
Precious jewels to make life complete  
All my treasures are yours my sweet  
For the pleasures of love  

Well, I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight  
Well, I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight  
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can  
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man  
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight  
  
I said, meet me and a-hurry behind the barn  
Don't you be afraid 'cause I'll do you no harm  
I want you to bring along your rockin' shoes  
'Cause tonight we're gonna rock away all our blues  
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight

Come on and rock, rock, rock, rock  
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock  
Well, let's rock, rock, rock, rock  
We're gonna rock all our blues away

Everybody's gone away  
Said they're movin to L.A.  
There's not a soul I know around  
Everybody's leavin' town  
  
Some caught a freight, some caught a plane  
Found the sunshine in the rain  
They said this town's will waste their time  
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine  
  
Some gotta win, some gotta lose  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
  
You know my heart keeps tellin' me  
You're not a kid at thirty-three  
Play around you'll lose your wife  
You play it too long you'll lose your life  
  
Some gotta win, some gotta lose  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
  
Some gotta win, some gotta lose  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues  
Good time Charlie's got the blues

Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Our love story gets me so upset  
Like romeo, and juliet  
I'm not smart enough to figure why  
Some folks enjoy, a real good cry  
  
Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Never thought that i would stand a chance  
That you'd give me, a second glance  
But i think that you can play the part  
And give a guy, a happy heart  
  
Happy ending, happy ending  
Give me a story with a, happy ending  
When boy meets girl and then  
They never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
When boy meets girl and then, they never part again  
But live forever happily, like you and me  
  
Like you and me, like you and me  
Like you and me

I saw the harbor lights  
They only told me we were parting  
Those same old harbor lights  
That once brought you to me.  
  
I watched the harbor lights  
How could I help it?  
Tears were starting.  
Good-bye to golden nights  
Beside the silvery seas.  
  
I long to hold you dear,  
And kiss you just once more.  
But you were on the ship,  
And I was on the shore.  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart keeps praying  
That someday harbor lights  
Will bring you back to me.

Well a hard headed woman,  
A soft hearted man  
Been the cause of trouble  
Ever since the world began.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
Now Adam told to Eve,  
"Listen here to me,  
Don't you let me catch you  
Messing round that apple tree."  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
Now Samson told Delilah  
Loud and clear,  
"Keep your cotton picking fingers  
Out my curly hair."  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.  
  
I heard about a king  
Who was doing swell  
Till he started playing  
With that evil Jezebel.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man.  
  
I got a woman,  
A head like a rock.  
If she ever went away  
I'd cry around the clock.  
Oh yeah, ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man.

This is the moment  
I've waited for  
I can hear my heart singing  
Soon bells will be ringing  
  
This is the moment  
Of sweet Aloha  
I will love you longer than forever  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
  
Here and now dear,  
All my love,  
I vow dear  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
I will love you longer than forever  
  
you-a, si-la  
Pa-a ia me o-e  
Ko a-lo-ha ma-ka-mea e i-po  
Ka-'you ia e le-i a-e ne-i la  
  
Now that we are one  
Clouds won't hide the sun  
Blue skies of Hawaii smile  
On this, our wedding day  
I do love you with all my heart

Shackled by a heavy burden  
'Neath a load of guilt and shame  
Then the hand of Jesus touched me  
And now I am no longer the same  
  
He touched me, Oh, He touched me  
And Oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole  
  
Since I met this blessed Savior  
And since he cleaned and made me whole  
I never cease to praise Him  
I'll shout it while eternity rolls  
  
Oh He touched me, oh He touched me  
And oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole.

In a little while you're leavin'  
Starting on the journey home  
Soon I'll be alone, the one who loves you  
La la la la la, somewhere in the heart of Rome  
I'll make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that you'll return  
Minutes I'll be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
I'll keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend I'm not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la, in the heart of Rome  
Suddenly the tears are falling  
As we hear the whistle blow  
Hold me very close before you leave me  
La la la la la, somewhere in the heart of Rome  
I'll make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that you'll return  
Minutes I'll be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
I'll keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend I'm not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la, in the heart of Rome  
I'll make a wish in every fountain  
Say a prayer that you'll return  
Minutes I'll be counting  
May the fire of love still burn  
I'll keep your picture by my pillow  
And pretend I'm not alone  
Make believe that you are with me  
La la la la la, in the heart of Rome  

Well, since my baby left me  
Well, I found a new place to dwell  
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street  
At Heartbreak Hotel  
Where I'll be--where I get so lonely, baby  
Well, I'm so lonely  
I get so lonely, I could die  
  
Although it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken-hearted lovers  
To cry there in the gloom  
And be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby  
Well, they're so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die  
  
Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'  
And the desk clerk's dressed in black  
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street  
Well, they'll never, they'll never get back  
And they'll be so, where they'll be so lonely, baby  
Well, they're so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die  
  
Well now, if your baby leaves you  
And you have a sad tale to tell  
Just take a walk down Lonely Street  
To Heartbreak Hotel  
And you will be, you will be, you will be lonely, baby  
You'll be so lonely  
You'll be so lonely, you could die  
  
Well, though it's always crowded  
You still can find some room  
For broken-hearted lovers  
To cry there in the gloom  
And they'll be so, they'll be so lonely, baby  
They'll be so lonely  
They'll be so lonely, they could die

Hearts made of stone will never brake  
'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
  
These hearts of stone will cause you pain  
Although you love there has stopped just the same  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
You daddy know, I thought you knew, hearts are made of stone  
  
Hearts made of stone will never brake  
'Cause the love you have for them, they just won't take it  
You can ask and plea, please, please, please break  
And all your love is there to stay  
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
You daddy know, I thought you knew hearts are made of stone

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Just pretend that we're together all alone  
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low  
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go  
  
You can't say the words I want to hear  
When your with another man  
If you love me, answer yes or no  
Darling I will understand  
  
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Just pretend that we're together all alone  
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low  
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go  
  
You can't say the words I want to hear  
When your with another man  
If you love me, answer yes or no  
Darling I will understand  
  
Just put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Just pretend that we're together all alone  
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go  
Yes you can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go

Lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile  
I'm tired of walkin' all alone  
Lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile  
You know I just can't make it on my own  
  
I never thought I needed help before  
I thought that I could get by, by myself  
But now I know I just can't take it any more  
With a humble heart, on bended knee  
I'm beggin' You, please, help me  
  
Come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me  
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand  
Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see  
Just where I fit into Your master plan  
  
I never thought I needed help before  
I thought that I could get by, by myself  
But now I know I just can't take it any more  
With a humble heart, on bended knee  
I'm beggin' You, please, help me  
With a humble heart, on bended knee  
I'm beggin' You, please, help me

[Chorus]  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Right down Santa Claus Lane.  
  
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer  
Pulling on the reins.  
Bells are ringing, children singing,  
All is merry and bright.  
Hang your stockings and say a prayer,  
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's got a bag that's filled with toys  
For boys and girls again.  
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,  
What a beautiful sight.  
Jump in bed and cover up your head,  
Because Santa Claus comes tonight.  
  
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,  
Riding down Santa Claus Lane.  
  
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy,  
He loves you just the same.  
Santa knows that we're God's children,  
That makes everything right.  
Fill your hears with Christmas cheer,  
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He'll come around when the chimes ring out  
It's Christmas morn again.  
Peace on Earth will come to all  
If we just follow the light  
Let's give thanks to the Lord above,  
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.  
  
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

He's your uncle, not your dad  
He's the best friend you ever had  
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts  
Just remember Pearl Harbor  
The Alamos and nothing could be worse  
He's your favorite relative  
And he needs a lot to live  
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed  
And he'll send back what he don't need  
If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation  
By deprivation of temptation  
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible  
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?  
When he calls you as he may do  
Don't be frightened, red white and blue  
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad  
He's your uncle, not your dad  
If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver  
The food is lousy up the river  
It's give and take and he does all the taking  
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?  
Life has two things you can't subtract  
Death and taxes to be exact  
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare  
He's your uncle, he's your uncle, not your dad  

All right girls, I'll show you what to do  
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through  
By the numbers there ain't much time  
We're gonna start an assembly line  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
You get the sandpaper, you get the pails  
You get the hammer baby, you get the nails  
You get the paint, you get the brush  
'Cause we're gonna give it the special touch  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
We got a magic potion that will help us win  
I don't know how to spell it but dip right in  
Blako-oxy-tonic phosphate, it's the latest scoop  
But that's all right girls you can call it "Goop"  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Work the sandpaper, hammer that nail  
Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail  
Get a rhythm going, nice and easy  
Come on and use a little elbow greasy  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
O.K. girls, we're all through  
I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do  
We'll fall right down and have some fun  
And I'm gonna kiss you all one by one  

Hey Jude, don't be a fool  
Take a sad song and make it better  
The minute you let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey Jude, don't let me down  
Take a sad song and make it better  
The minute you let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
Let it out and let in  
Hey Jude begin  
To making the world a little better  
Don't you know that it's a fool  
Who plays it cool  
In making the world a little better  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let it out and let in  
Hey Jude begin  
To making the world a little better  
Don't you know that it's a fool  
Who plays it cool  
To taking the world upon your shoulder  
  
[Chorus]

You may ask me how I know my Lord is real (my Lord is real)  
You may doubt the things I say and doubt the way I feel (the way I feel)  
But I know he's real today he'll always be (he'll always be)  
I can feel his hand in mine and that's enough for me  
  
I will never walk alone he holds my hand (he holds my hand)  
He will guide each step I take  
And if I fall I know he'll understand  
Till the day he tells me why he loves me so (he loves me so)  
I can feel his hand in mine  
That's all I need to know  
  
I will never walk alone he holds my hand (he holds my hand)  
He will guide each step I take  
And if I fall I know he'll understand  
Till the day he tells me why he loves me so (he loves me so)  
I can feel his hand in mine  
That's all I need to know  
  
I can feel his hand in mine  
That's all I need to know
