I broke down on a Japanese street  
Words unsaid they scar so deep  
Bullshit, Palanuik both make me choke  
Too much JD too much coke  
  
She says speed up I want to go faster  
She holds on but I outlast her  
Build it up but what does that matter  
We can build it up but we always watch it shatter  
  
Get up the house is on fire  
Get up I want to get higher  
Get up you mother fucking liar  
You make me feel alone  
  
I burned out in Shibuya station  
Lost all my friends hazard occupation  
Manic Compression like quicksand slip  
Ate too many mushrooms I'm gonna be sick  
She says slow down you're going through the motions  
  
I start to crash like a plane in the ocean  
Build it up but what does that matter  
When the shit goes down we all fucking scatter  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never said I wanted to try  
Never said I wanted to live this lie  
All you said was good-bye  
All I ever said was to get me out of here  
  
I focus on the flame  
Set it off  
Wasted what a shame  
Set it off  
Focus on the flame  
Set it off  
We were once the same  
  
[Chorus]

I got a girlfriend  
Only she don't know it yet  
I got a six string best friend  
Who sleeps with a broken neck  
I want to make my mark  
Change the world, with this flow  
But, all this doubt in my head  
It won't let me go  
  
Can't you see I want to lock my door and shut out all the world surrounding me  
Safe from the problems and the pressures caused by insecurities  
  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll!  
Get up! Get up!  
Take my heart and my soul!  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll  
On and on and on  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
I got a heartache  
She's my insecurity  
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me  
I want to breakout, carpe diem,  
I know, but all this doubt in my head It won't let me go  
  
Can't you see I want to find my own direction on this busy one-way street  
Where all the influential people never bother helping me  
  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll  
Get up! Get up!  
Take my heart and my soul!  
Get up! Get up!  
Let the good times roll  
One and on and on  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
This is the anthem  
Out to all the misfits  
If you feel you don't belong  
If you don't give a shit  
About authority  
About majority  
About conformity  
Shout it out  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
Let us go!  
  
Everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in  
We shout the anthem of our lives  
Just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in  
We shout the anthem of our lives  
Just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But I'll fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives

Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, are you feeling like me too?  
I need to get an answer out of you, well  
All the days  
All the time  
All the lies lie on the line  
Did you just try to set me off? well  
Yeah ya know I'm easy  
And I know it's true  
That this situation  
Isn't so easy on you  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, Is there truth behind your lies?  
Is all this love  
Or is it compromise? well  
All the days  
All the time  
No regrets you're on my mind  
Did you just try to set me off? well  
Yeah this awkward silence  
Feels so cold and used  
Is this infatuation  
Or am I addicted to you?  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Re-re-re-reverse the beat  
Back up direction  
Tries and trust and planned out deception  
The look in your eyes  
Verbal dissection  
Lose myself in you  
And then sex then rejection  
Self destruct in you arms  
As your words stacks kill  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Hey you, are you feeling lonely too?  
I need to get some answers, some answers  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
'Cause I  
I need to know what you want, I  
I wonder how you feel, and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  
Are you for real?  

We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We won't stop.  
Gonna crush the day  
Take any cheap shot  
Thrown our way  
Get high on top  
Of the world at bay  
And we're never coming down, never coming down, never!  
  
So we'll bleed on through and suffer the bruises  
Take all the blame but no excuses  
First one to blink is the first that loses  
So we're never looking down, never looking down, never!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're Automatic!  
It's a heart break,  
But it won't be long  
Like an earthquake,  
We kick it strong  
Make your world shake  
Cross the line that's drawn  
And we're never looking back, never looking back, never!  
  
So we'll lick our wounds, rise from the ashes  
Kick down the door and break the latches  
Gasoline dreams so we strike with matches  
So we're never giving up, never giving up, never!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're automatic like an addict passin' out on the lawn  
When we're chargin' into battle like Genghis Khan  
And you're god damn right we'll prove you wrong  
This block, this city, is where we belong!  
  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no going back  
We came to join in the fight  
We're not alone  
We're automatic tonight  
There's no looking back  
We came to put out the lights  
We're not alone tonight  
  
We're automatic tonight!  
  
We're automatic tonight!

I'm feeling lost,  
I'm feeling like my heart's  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
  
Awaking and taking the cycle of breaking up  
To a whole new level  
Shaking and faking like you're making a hard choice not to settle  
Imbedded, I'm think headed  
I shredded all the letters you sent  
Don't get it. why'd you let it get this far  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
And I crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
I'll fated,I skated,  
To the party faded,and I saw you there  
I waited, hated, getting ignored  
You stated you didn't care  
Flashes of car crashed and  
Your ashes burning the cement  
The curtain fails, last call, credits roll  
We have reached the end  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save you every time you crash and Burn  
Crash and burn  
  
I'm sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Sick of endings  
I'm done pretending  
Tired of fighting  
I'm sick of always trying  
  
I'm feeling lost,  
I'm feeling like my heart's  
Been carved out with a spoon  
Put on display for all to witness this decay of me and you  
I just want you back to normal  
I think you don't know just how you feel  
And every time you think of me  
Remember how things used to be not long ago  
  
Whoa  
  
Lights out lights out Pass the herb  
Lights out lights out kiss the curb  
Lights out lights out your heart has turned  
Who's going to save me every time I crash and Burn  
I crash and burn  
I crash and burn

This is me, I've got a nasty sense of humor  
And a case of high anxiety  
If you please, I would rather be alone  
Let the water running judge me  
  
So I got my life together  
But it's half of what it should be  
So you think you can make it better?  
You better help me, help me  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
  
Can't you see I got a perfect explanation  
But keep it deep inside of me?  
Pardon me, but if you really want to know it  
Then you better learn to judge me  
  
So you've got you're life together  
But you say you gotta have more  
So you think I could make it better  
Just be careful what you wish for  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
  
Paper clip prediction  
But these pictures are deceiving  
'Cause their colors lost their place  
And now they're dripping down and bleeding  
  
And they're running and running away  
Packed it up and leaving  
And these dreams turn to nightmares  
Like a promise with no meaning  
  
So be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it  
If this is what you live for  
You might as well forget it  
  
You don't know what you're in for  
This war will never end  
Be careful what you wish for  
You just might get it, get it, get it  
You just might get it, get it, get it, so hold tight  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
There's a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
  
Hang on but prepare, can't live up to you  
Hold on, hold on  
(You just might get it)  
There's still a part of me that can't escape my insecurities  
Hang on, this is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
This is me  
(Be careful what you wish for)  
This is me

LH cause 714 is the area  
Everybody grab a friend and jump on in  
Get a new view and a message to send  
Look for the truth and hand you can lend  
But you Got something to prove  
A turn of your back and you're on the move  
And me I get to see  
  
All of the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
  
So your a big shot now, still don't know who you are and  
Everything you want and need is at your feet, so what  
Good times  
Drink your red wine  
Try not to think of things left behind  
You're a star  
  
And you've made it this far  
Strange how you really don't know who you are  
Divide All your time and your pride  
Take all the names that you've learned in stride  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
God damn  
  
Here it comes again  
My friend, I'll stay to the end  
But I need some room so that I can get in This place  
It's all a waste  
Your energy spent on just getting a taste  
  
And me  
I get to see  
All the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
  
No way today  
So ideal  
Your time is running but you don't know why  
And nothing comes for free when you don't want to try  
So unreal  
Your time is running and I see it  
All of your life did you really want to be it  
Your time is running out

Did you ever get the feeling that you were all alone  
And no one ever knew you and you never had a home  
And the lights and the colors do their best to distract you  
Fuck you. I don't even know why I like you  
It's all a blur [x2]  
Like a picture,it's all a blur  
You don't know what you're missing  
You don't know what you're missing  
I've been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But it's impossible to watch you fade away  
Did you ever stop believing after all was said and done?  
When you turned to your friends but they were long gone  
And the sky and the snapshots remind you  
I trust you and I'm always going to miss you  
It's all a blur, it's all a blur  
Like a picture  
Reminds me who you were  
[Repeat Chorus]  
Every time I see you look at me  
I see those distant eyes and your looks are fading  
Every time you're next to me  
I want to talk and feel and act like we used to  
Cause everybody knows and everybody cares  
Until they're walking in my shoes  
And now I know  
It's you that I cannot lose  
It's all a blur  
And I owe you  
You can take it all  
When I call, pick up the phone like you used to  
It's all a blur  
Like a picture  
It's all a blur  
You're just a blur!  
I've been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But it's impossible to watch you fade away  
Trying, dying so hard  
I've been denying that I'm not scarred  
I've been crying, lying so far  
But it's impossible to fill this space  
Impossible to take your place  
Impossible to watch you fade away  
Watch you fade away [x3]

I'm up and I'm alright  
Push on with all my might  
Got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What?  
I am the man  
What?  
Who's the man  
Try to front like you want to try and understand  
But you don't know man  
Through the times that we shared  
I know that you care  
And I know you  
  
And I'll go where you want to go cause I feel this way  
And I care what you got to say cause I feel this way  
So I stepped up and I said I just don't understand  
He said just come and check it out man  
  
I'm up and I feel fine  
I won't drop till I get mine  
I got to find a way to get away today  
  
Because I am the man  
What?  
I am the man  
What?  
Who's the man?  
Try to front like you want to try to understand  
But you don't know man  
Through the times that we shared  
You know that I care  
Cause I know you  
  
Here we go  
Hip hop nation, vibe affiliation  
All that I need is mind emancipation  
Got to find a way to get away  
Got to find something to make me want to stay  
Cause all that I see is jaded  
Now I can't even see straight cause I'm faded  
Stressed cause of strain and you know that I'm leaving today  
And I care what you say, but I feel this way

I never wanted to go  
I never wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
Caught in a trap of routine  
Caught in a shitty old scene  
I'll tell you a secret  
I need it  
Take a trip and you'll see what I mean  
  
Time is just not, only seconds in a day  
'Cause what you got, can be taken all away  
With just one shot, yeah nothings here to stay  
Why don't you get up? 'Cause this ime it's going down  
  
Wanting and waiting  
Dreams are fading  
Things will never be the same  
Ever changing and rearranging  
Will you notice anyway?  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
One day you'll look, and see that things are not the same  
The time you took, has been taken all away  
The hands you shook, don't even know your name  
You better get up cause this time it's going down  
  
I never really wanted to go  
I never really wanted a way  
A way to see it, believe it  
I know that you're not leaving today  
  
Take a look and see that things are not the same

Why's this motherfucker lookin' at me  
Is there something more that he wants to see  
I've got a gun and the motherfucker's loaded  
One more punk and you're dead and bloated, because  
  
All this shit, you disgust me  
Can I hate you, cause you're not like me  
So, me and my boys beat him down  
3 against one boy, whose the clown?  
So I never had a fuckin' education  
Sell a little drugs, to battle inflation  
Sleep with a girl that I sometimes pay  
Fuck it, better than bein' fuckin' gay anyways  
  
See one walkin' and it makes me mad  
This I learned from dear old dad  
Hate all the things you don't understand  
Hate all the things you don't understand  
So I hate all the things I don't understand  
Hate all the things I don't understand  
Hate all the things I don't understand!  
  
Nurtured with a fist  
Shove instead of a kiss  
Glare instead of a wink  
Listen to me, boy don't fuckin think!  
And hate him because he's gay  
cause he doesn't live our fuckin way  
So I grew up to hate what I am  
Hate what I hate  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man

Hell yeah, woo  
Punk rock trippin' with the flavor of hip hop  
Spittin' out venom as I'm watching all your heads bob  
Representing for the outcasts and the have nots  
Feigning to find light in a world that has blacked out  
Your middle fingers up, yeah, put 'em up, we've had enough  
We take a shot to the chin with a grin, we're tough  
We know exactly why you're here so make it clear, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone  
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Rising from the ash, counter clash, there is no doubt  
Swinging from the rafters are the kids who never sold out  
Holding out for hope, this shit is dope, hear the crowds shout  
Fighting to survive, one day we'll make them tap out  
We'll raise your voices up, yeah, raise 'em up, we've had enough  
We're standing up and now we're being heard the gloves are off  
The voice is loud, we have the crowd, the time is now, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone  
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Get up tonight, stand up and fight  
They are here, they are in sight, they're inside  
And I can't go alone on this microphone  
Is this on? Is this on?  
This flow is definitive, make your throat hurt  
A gagged voice with no choice, it's so limited  
Hell yeah, come on, hell yeah, it's on  
Bounce to the boom of the beat of the drum, drum  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Hell yeah  

Hello tomorrow and good-bye to yesterday  
We've been waiting for this moment  
And we still don't know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say good-bye  
  
Nothing but good things are coming my way  
If you are going please let me stay  
You bring me down when I'm getting high  
You turn me on, I amplify  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
I won't bleed like this forever  
I'm down to ride but my wings are severed  
Blindside blitz evacuation  
I'm stuck in hell your on vacation  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day  
I'm still waiting for tomorrow  
Tired of living in yesterday  
I've been waiting  
Waiting for the day I'd be over you  
  
Oceans, devotions, these notions run dry  
Floating away and I don't know why  
Spend all my days in a bottle thinking  
You're like an anchor got me sinking  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
1-2-3, 1-2-3  
  
Say good-bye now and mean it forever  
Got to move on and keep it together  
Forget the things that you've said and you've done  
That's in the past, here comes the sun  
  
1-2-3 times you've broken me (Broken Me)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello tomorrow and good-bye to yesterday  
We've been waiting for this moment  
And we still don't know what to say  
We may never find the answers  
or know the reason why  
Why we both decided we should say good-bye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello tomorrow  
1-2-3  
I'd be over you (hello tomorrow)  
1-2-3  
I'd be over you

Here she comes to ruin my day again  
Right away she's start with shouting  
Making this the best week ever  
If only she could scream forever  
Here she comes to pick at my faults again  
Right away she's punching, kicking  
Making this the best week ever  
Better off dead than together  
Stab your dagger right through my heart and twist  
Does this turn you on?  
Follow it up by punching my face with your fists  
Does this turn you on?  
Now on the ground, cut open both of my wrists  
Does this turn you on?  
Say you love me and suffocate me with a kiss  
Whatever turns you on!  
Here's to me calling off this war  
Here's to me walking out that door  
Here's to the only casualty  
Here's to the mess that you made of me  
Here she comes to ruin my perfect game  
Doctor says she's borderline insane  
I don't know what I like better  
Being comatose or just being with her  
Here she comes to point her fingers down at me  
With all ten of her personalities  
I don't know what I like better  
Saying goodbye or saying that I hate her.  
Stab your dagger right through my heart and twist  
Does this turn you on?  
Follow it up by punching my face with your fists  
Does this turn you on?  
Now on the ground, cut open both of my wrists  
Does this turn you on?  
Say you love me and suffocate me with a kiss  
Whatever turns you on!  
You always get to me  
Here's to me calling off this war  
Here's to me walking out that door  
Here's to the only casualty  
Here's to the mess that you made of me  
You always get to me  
Always get to you  
Always do your worst to get the best of me  
Me always pushing you  
Always pushing me  
Always manage to being the worst in you!  
Here's to me calling off this war  
Here's to me walking out that door  
Here's to the only casualty  
Here's to the mess that you made of me  

Anesthetized by these lies  
I don't believe in truth  
And I apologize  
But my sacrifice  
Has nothing to do with you  
  
'Cause I've been victimized  
Like ocean size  
From the blood your needle drew  
And I apologize  
But my demise  
  
Has everything to do with you  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
You were there one day  
But you're here no more  
Like a stroke through the heart  
  
And you play the whore  
'Cause you stole my soul  
Kleptomaniac  
Now I can hate myself take my anger back  
  
Love is a violent attack  
You cut me down  
I feel no pain now  
This nightmare is almost through  
  
I hit the ground  
No need to feel now  
My time here is all but done  
All but done  
Now I'm up in the attic  
Where the rafter's strong  
So many reasons to be tragic  
  
And the list is long  
If you think I've lost hope  
You were never wrong  
'Cause the churning of the rope  
Is my battle song  
  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
  
You we're there one day  
But you're here no more  
Like a stake through the heart  
And you play the whore  
  
'Cause you burned my soul  
Pyromaniac  
You can hate yourself take your anger back  
Love is a violent attack  
I can't stand on my own feet now  
  
I can't crawl forever and a day  
Felt like I was getting stronger  
Before you turned and walked away  
I apologize  
But my demise  
Has everything to do with you

Well I'm tired, so tired of getting up and wasting another day  
I wish the picture on the wall would still say it all  
But now yesterday is so far away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
And I think this house is not my home  
I think that I'd rather be alone tonight  
I'm trying, trying to fake it  
  
I'm tired, so tired, of giving up and taking all the blame  
I wish the shouting and the fights would stop for the night  
Can't close my eyes and make them all go away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the part where you say  
You can't stay together just for me  
This is the part where you make me choose  
On whose side I want to be  
This is the part where you decide  
What's going to be best for me  
This is the start  
Now we grow apart  
Now we grow apart  
  
[Chorus]

Drop in, hey  
  
Call us degenerate, heads in a purple haze  
Breaking our necks with crime that pays  
It's the war of Rolex versus renegades  
So place your bets and burn the beds you made  
  
You know we're never bending or breaking, forsaking anything  
Bonded together we can share in the pain  
And we can feel it, believe it, timing is everything  
And this time we're going out with a bang  
  
Right now, I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now, fight for a new beginning  
Right now, ignite and light the shape of the world you're living  
And I'm sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
We fight the eminent threat like a macrophage  
Blood tears and sweat with a war we wage  
If we can't get the key we'll break the cage  
Bleed for liberty and get machines to rage  
  
You know we're never fearing or faking, braking for anyone  
We come together, yeah we're just having fun  
And we can feel it, believe it and there goes the neighborhood  
And this time I think you're misunderstood  
  
Right now, I can feel the world is spinning  
Right now, fight for a new beginning  
Right now, ignite and light the shape of the world you're living  
And I'm sticking with the fuse so tight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
We've been dreaming it, bleeding it, believing what they say  
While they're killing it, leaving it and lying all the way  
Heard the counterfeit syndicate is growing everyday  
But we're over it, today we're gonna light the way  
  
Ignite, light it up, ignite, light it up  
Ignite, light it up, ignite tonight, ignite tonight  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide  
  
Take me kicking and screaming  
Or give me something to believe in  
Don't let me down, we're running on high  
Ignite worldwide

'Cause I'm a user  
A schmoozer  
A big dollar loser  
But that don't matter 'cause my friends call me a bruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me  
  
'Cause I'm not funny  
Honey  
A big oaf-why dummy  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
  
Yo, get out get out  
The way of the money man  
Ladies know I'm dope so consider me contraband  
Fellas are just jealous 'cause they're ponies and I'm a mustang  
Don't try to hang 'cause I'm out with a big bang  
  
Get get down  
All the ladies want to be with me  
Get get down  
All the fellas compete with me  
Get get down  
And I know that I'm trippin'  
But I really don't care 'cause this is how I'm livin'  
  
All the ladies all the ladies want to know me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
All the fellas all the fellas want to be me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
Intimidated by me  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
'cause I'm money  
  
'cause I'm a user  
A schmoozer  
A big dollar loser  
But that don't matter 'cause I drive a land cruiser  
And I get chicks  
Too many chicks want me  
  
'cause I'm not funny  
Honey  
A big oaf-why dummy  
But that don't matter 'cause I know I play with money  
And I get drunk  
Too many drinks want me  
(Slow down)  
  
I got a time bomb tick, tick, tickin'  
Just like Anthrax  
Boys want to battle so I got me a battle axe  
Climax, your girl screams my name when you have sex  
I should charge a sales tax  
  
Get get down  
All the ladies want to get with me  
Get get down  
All the fellas compete with me  
Get get down and I know that I'm trippin'  
But that don't matter 'cause this is how I'm stickin'  
  
All the ladies all the ladies want to know me  
They ignore me  
Intimidated by me  
All the fellas all the fellas want to be me  
They ignore  
Intimidated by me  
Intimidated by me  
  
Everybody look at me  
I'm pimp-ass money  
I know you wish to get with this tonight  
Everybody look at me  
Flier than Mr. T  
I know you wish to get with this tonight  
  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
Well, who needs them anyway?  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money  
'cause I'm money

I've got girls, they're in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
It's ten till two, the clock won't move  
Detention hall is better with beer  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do it all in my room  
I can be a rockstar with a bad attitude  
I am the king in my room  
I can ground my mom and dad if I choose  
  
Shapow!  
How do you like me now?  
Shazaam!  
I don't think you understand  
Shaquick!  
Hey, I got a ten inch, tv screen  
Only in my room  
  
I've got green, it's in my room  
The only thing is my room is not here  
Pitching tents inside my pants  
And there's a pool of drool by my ear  
  
I can take it all in my room  
I can be a quarterback and the coolest guy in school  
I can get on down in my room  
I can go and freak Rebecca Romijn in the nude  
  
[Chorus]

We got bruised wrists, kick flips, sending an invasion  
They say loose flips, sink ships, so might get your probation  
No more teeth, six in the mix, ripping' round rotation  
Chuck E. Cheese chips or kung fu kicks, just a kids sensation  
So turn the radio on, press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off, what's done is done  
Turn the radio on, it's never enough  
I wanna change it all, I want it all  
But you can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
We want star ships, banana clips and start a hip religion  
And a postscript recensionship to help them find a vision  
But the bad pray for double play and move with pre-precision  
And like arsenic, we're getting sick of all our indecision  
So turn the radio on, press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off, what's done is done  
Turn the radio on, it's never enough  
I wanna change it all, I want it all  
But you can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
It's like working on the pieces when the puzzle doesn't fit  
It's like the feeling that you get right before you get hit  
It's like the ground opened up and swallowed you when you sit  
It's like, be careful what you have 'cause now you got shit  
It's like, you can't always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You can't always get what you want  
It's like a time bomb  
You can't always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  

Let it ride  
How did everything get messed up?  
Let it go  
Now I got myself all stressed out  
Hold on to my hand, I'll show you where to go  
Take you anywhere you want to go  
Take a ride  
Now that everything is fucked up  
Take it slow  
And I got you all stressed out  
It's out of your hands and I know you wanted more  
What did you want it  
Four shots of Jack just to relax and get my head straight  
Wait for a sign a reason not to escape  
Meditate, point break, mistake  
Cigarette burns while my hand shakes  
You can't go back  
Tomorrow brings another day  
Another chance, some other way  
And time won't stop for you  
Not even if you want it to  
Let it ride  
Try to tell myself to hold on  
Let it go  
But I always to let myself down  
Thought that you had it down but now you just don't know  
Bottom dropped  
I spun so fast that I lost my bearings  
Gather myself while everyone is staring  
Have been asleep while my patience runs thin  
Damn, what the fuck did I get myself in  
And I miss my best friend  
Cause we don't hang out anymore  
I'm gonna sit and watch the waves crash on the shore  
Break my fall and I'm just gonna kick it on the floor  
Forevermore  
[Repeat Chorus]  
And I stopped keeping score  
Is that what you're looking for?  
And I stopped keeping score  
Start over  
[x2]  
[Repeat Chorus]

Well some wear their feelings right on their sleeve  
And some want to feel what's inside of me  
But I've been here twice before oh  
I've been here twice before  
And I notice you  
Spy satellite snapping shots from the skylight  
Endo you know buffers up to a highlight  
Ink to the skin tight burned in the sunlight  
If present lived hindsight, you would be dynamite  
Butterfly crucify yourself straight gemini  
Checking out grey clouds burning out blue skies  
Even high tides rail slides break for landslides  
Just another ride got shot goodbye side  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you again and  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you here again  
Well some wear their feelings right on their sleeve  
And some want to feel what's inside of me  
But I've been here twice before oh  
I've been here twice before  
And I notice you  
Spy satellite snapping shots from the skylight  
Endo you know buffers up to a highlight  
Ink to the skin tight burned in the sunlight  
If present lived hindsight, you would be dynamite  
Butterfly crucify yourself straight gemini  
Checking out grey clouds burning out blue skies  
Even high tides rail slides break for landslides  
Just another ride got shot goodbye side  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you again and  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you here again  
You wanted something different  
You confused the lines  
And now you're trying, you're trying to make this  
Better 'cause you know you can't rewind  
Can't go back if that's what you're doing  
'Cause everything looks dope in slow motion  
But you got taxed in all the commotion  
Then you got waxed for all your devotion  
Floating in space  
No locomotion  
'Cause everything looks dope in slow motion  
But you got taxed in all the commotion  
Then you got waxed for all your devotion  
Floating in space  
No locomotion  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you again and  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you again  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you again and  
Don't let me go  
I know I'm always late to see you  
I can't wait to see you here again  

Enrique played in a band  
Down at the sand  
He hustled women and worked on his tan  
Drove an IROQ Camero quadraphonic 8 track stereo  
He was a sharp dressin' suave  
Cultured and smooth ladies man  
  
Maria stared in the show  
It's all that she knows  
She loved Enrique and Bilar and snow  
She knew her lover had others,  
But her heart was a desperate young soul  
She sold a night to a stranger  
While searching for her pot of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
We can dance to the rhythm,  
We can dace to the mornin' light  
On a sultury summer night  
The time is right for love  
Livin' libido loco days  
  
Arturo led a small gang  
A downtown thang  
He loved Maria the young bird who sang  
He bought her heart for a night, with some lines at the local disco  
She wore his love on her face, in the back of Arturo's limo  
  
Enrique was quite aware, of Maria's afair  
He vowed 'vengence Arturo I swear  
He brought his blade to the fight,  
But they both suffered their final blow  
Now Maria's in mourning,  
As she's left to live life alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's been twenty years past, since Maria's been last  
To the disco where she lost her soul  
She wipes a tear from her eye,  
And she still fights memories of ago  
As her new limo ride let's her in  
And asks 'how much, let's go  
  
[Chorus]

You can lie to me and say it's you I adore  
You can poison me and drown me on the shore  
You can kick me again when I'm down on the floor  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
You say I'm desperate and if I'm desperate  
At least I'm honest  
At least I own it  
And if I'm desperate  
Reap what you sow  
Give me some more!  
Give me some more!  
  
She said, thanks for my misery  
Then I said, Hell needed company,  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said, "I wish you were dead"  
  
Left me out in the gutter  
To settle a score  
Poured salt on my wounds  
When my stitches tore  
And now I'm giving it back  
'Cause payback's a whore  
I'm slamming the door  
I'm slamming the door  
'Cause now I'm over  
And since I'm over it  
Ill be honest  
I think you're heartless  
I think you need this  
Reap what you sow  
I'm slamming the door!  
I'm slamming the door!  
  
She said, thanks for my misery  
Then I said, Hell needed company,  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said, "I wish you were dead"  
  
You can lie to me and say it's you I adore  
You can poison me and drown me on the shore  
You can kick me again when I'm down on the floor  
Give me some more  
Give me some more  
Left me out in the gutter  
To settle a score  
Poured salt on my wounds  
When my stitches tore  
And now I'm giving it back  
'Cause payback's a whore  
I'm slamming the door  
I'm slamming the door  
  
She said, thanks for my misery  
Then I said, Hell needed company,  
And maybe a new lobotomy would  
Make easier to throw it all away  
She said, "I wish you were dead"

Let's go  
The lights are on but there is no one home  
Yeah, I'm the type of guy that shouldn't be left alone  
They say just one more night of observation  
There's nothing like a permanent vacation  
I break down like you want me to  
But I will not give control to you  
Sniff like a pound of glue  
Forget all the things you'll put me through  
Dial up the residue  
Now I'm nuts, just like a blue cashew  
I go psycho, psycho  
Psycho, psycho  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health  
Whoa, these conversations with myself  
Whoa, they say that only time will tell  
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health  
I'm happy in my mental health  
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, go  
Hey, meet a friend of mine, now where'd he go?  
He's probably sitting there but you would never know  
They say just one more shock, try not to resist  
They say lie down and bite on this  
You let the shocks away  
But the voices in my head are here to stay  
No bullshit tests today  
I get more drugs than the DEA  
One day they'll do a play  
They take your shoelaces away  
We go psycho, psycho  
Psycho, psycho  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health  
Whoa, these conversations with myself  
Whoa, they say that only time will tell  
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health  
Straitjacket, bad habit  
'Cause I live for the havoc  
This static, illmatic  
Double dose is just like magic  
Straight jacket, let's have it  
You pump up all my panic  
Welcome, this is my life  
A padded room up in the attic  
And all I want is to go home just for a bit  
But these padded rooms are the shit  
Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health  
Whoa, these conversations with myself  
Whoa, they say that only time will tell  
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health  
Psycho, psycho  
I'm happy in my mental health  
Psycho, psycho  
I'm happy in my mental health  
Psycho, psycho  
I'm happy in my mental health  
Psycho, psycho  
I'm happy in my mental health  

I know a girl who welcomes the world  
I think though the world is spoiled  
And she holds on to me  
She holds my head up so that I can breathe  
And I've found that when I'm on the ground  
She's the only one still sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she won't let me down  
And I get mine  
  
No way I could ever leave today  
Cause she listens to the dumb things that I say  
And I seem to get high  
With just one smile as she walks on by  
And I found that when I'm on the ground  
She is the only one sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she won't let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
There's only one girl in this world  
Who understands the real me  
There's nothing superficial, artificial  
You get just what you see(End)  
  
I know a girl who takes up my world  
Takes all of me and every breath that I hold  
We meet and she makes me feel free  
With one look she knows just what I need  
And I've found that she's got me bound  
Cause she's the only one that my mind surrounds  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she won't let me down  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know a girl who wakes up my world  
Brings in the warmth when I'm feeling cold  
And she's got places to be  
But she says that she would rather stay here with me  
And I've found that when I'm on the ground  
She's the only one sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she won't let me down  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Lie to me  
Tell me that everything will be all right  
(Who-o-a) Lie to me  
Don't say it didn't mean anything  
1-2-3 GO!  
I should have known when my kicks  
Crossed the hinge on your door  
That you had something more in store  
Implore  
Do not push my back up to the wall  
Do not push my back up to the wall  
This is a set up  
Rush adrenaline  
Fake, phony, fed up  
Bass, Alkaline  
This is a set up  
Waste everything  
You never told me  
'Til the pressure started building  
You never told me  
I was wrong  
I was right  
I was right  
You never told me  
'Til the building started shaking  
Now I'm surrounded on all sides  
Lie to me  
Tell me that everything will be all right  
(Whoa) Lie to me  
Don't say it didn't mean anything  
Lie to me  
Killing joke cause your smile was the calm to the storm  
And the ties that bind have been torn  
I said  
Do not push my back to the wall  
Do not push my back to the wall  
[Repeat Chorus]  
You take this for granted  
Right?  
And I never wanted anybody else  
You took this all for granted  
You took it all
