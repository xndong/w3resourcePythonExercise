I wanted love so very bad that  
I could almost tasted it  
And so I gave mine all to you  
And hoped you would not wast it  
I laid awake the whole night long  
And wondered was I wrong  
But when you woke and touched my face  
I knew that I belonged  
  
Belonging to someone I find is very necessary  
The load is lighter on your mind  
When someone helps to carry  
And even though I'm strong enough  
To make it on my own  
I would not even care to try  
To live my life alone  
  
For if I lived my life alone  
With no one to belong to  
There'd be no one to pledge my heart  
Or sing my song of love to  
My melodies would soon dry up  
And the words would leave me too  
It all would come to pass if I  
Could not belong to you  
  
I wanted love so very bad that  
I could almost taste it  
And when I gave mine all to you  
I knew you would not wast it

Everyone's thinkin' when he comes home  
He'll be takin' you back from me  
But nobody knows just how deep our love goes  
And he'll never take you from me  
  
Now I know that you never meant to cheat  
And I never meant to steal  
But you only forget when there's better yet  
And I know that's how we both feel  
  
It's a change of heart  
Look out for some rain  
When you change your heart  
One man's loss is another man's gain  
  
Everyone's sayin' when he comes home  
He'll loosen my hold on you  
But they just don't know that you're free to go  
And love's my only hold over you  
  
And I knew the night that your tears were fallin'  
What you were goin' through  
You knew it'd be hell but you had to tell him  
Now it would be me and you  
  
It's a change of heart  
Worked out for the best  
When you change your heart  
Save yourself and forget all the rest

I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
You're old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go.  
  
And what we're here for  
What do you fear for  
It's hard enough to hear the though in mind  
That now you're there  
And then you're gone  
Let's get in  
  
I could I could keep you company could  
I could I could keep you so happy can  
I can I can I make you feel really fine  
We could we could we make love this time  
We could we could we make love so fine  
You're old enough to know from where we  
Come and where we go.  
  
You're never really tried let yourself be satisfied  
Now don't deny it  
Until you try it  
You're played the game so long  
You think that life goes on and on  
You better use it  
Before you lose it.

Daughter, don't give your love to the first man you see.  
Just bide your time so your heart will be free to find the one,  
Girl you don't have to run.  
  
Daughter, don't think that love has gone out of style,  
Just some folks every once in a while don't understand  
How this world was planned.  
  
Now I know you're wondering how  
You know when the real thing is comin' your way,  
When you live for him and not you  
You'll know that it's truly comin' to stay.  
  
Daughter, I know it's hard to make yourself wait,  
But when the right man comes it's never too late  
So don't you cry ,  
He'll be here by and by, and steal your heart away.

I found her diary underneath a tree.  
And started reading about me  
The words she's written took me by surpise  
You'd never read them in her eyes.  
They said that she had found the love she waited for.  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
When she confronted with the writing there,  
Simply pretended not to care.  
I passed it off as just in keeping with  
Her total disconcerting air  
And though she tried to hide  
The love that she denied,  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
And as I go through my life, I will give to her my wife  
All the sweet things that I can find.  
  
I found her diary underneath a tree.  
And started reading about me.  
The words began stick and tears to flow.  
Her meaning now was clear to see.  
The love she'd waited for was someone else not me  
Wouldn't you know it, she wouldn't show it.  
  
And as I go through my life, I will wish for her his wife  
All the sweet things that she can find  
All the sweet things they can find

Should've kept on goin'  
But the hurt was showing  
When she looked at me that way  
I had to stay  
I knew I had to get to know her name  
The town was weary  
She was to marry  
Someone planned years ago  
Her eyes said no  
I knew I had to get to know her name  
And when I got her all alone  
She told me through the tears  
That she didn't really loved him  
But he'd waited for so many years  
She said she couldn't break his heart  
She'd rather live with hers  
And though I told her she should leave with me  
She just could not believe with me  
Should've kept on goin'  
Better that than knowin'  
That he made her his wife  
He took her life  
You know I didn't even know her name  
You know I didn't even know her name  

Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life  
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on my life  
You been locking apart of your love away  
You been holding out on me  
I just want to get down deep inside of you  
  
So that I can set you free  
Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your mind  
Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find  
I would never be judge you for what you are  
You can say what's in your heart  
It's the things that you're hiding that bother me  
And it's keeping us apart so  
If you really love me like you like to say you  
Really do  
  
Gotta open up and let the rest of you come  
Shining through  
Don't shut me out, shut me out of your life  
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on my life  
Such a beautiful thing we could come to know  
If you'll only trust in me  
I just want to get down deep inside of you  
So that I can set you free and  
Turn you loose so you can see, so  
  
Don't shut me out, shut me out, out of your life and  
Don't shut the door, shut the door, door on your  
Sweet, sweet, yeah  
  
Don't be afraid, be afraid, afraid of what I might find, no  
Don't lock the door, lock the door, door on your  
Sweet, sweet mind.

Love, look at the two of us  
Strangers in many ways  
We've got a lifetime to share  
So much to say  
And as we go  
From day to day  
I'll feel you close to me  
But time alone will tell  
Let's take a lifetime to say,  
"i knew you well"  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow  
For all we know  
  
Love, look at the two of us  
Strangers in many ways  
Let's take a lifetime to say  
"i knew you well"  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow  
For all we know.

First time it's rained since I came to the city  
Seemed like a good time to write  
And even now as I look out my window  
Rain clouds are chasing the light  
  
The play games of magic in the night  
  
Lately I've stayed with the lady from Denver  
She said to come by for awhile  
Took me on down to her place by the river  
Carried me off on her smile  
  
We play games of magic all the while  
  
I hope this letter finds you well  
I wrote to tell you 'bout my change of plans  
I won't be home tomorrow night  
I'll be alright I hope you'll understand  
  
All of my life I've been looking for somethin'  
But I guess you know me by now  
Searching for secrets and being the eternal child  
Playing games of magic all the while.

  
All your life you've waited  
For love to come and stay  
And now that I have found you,  
You must not, slip away  
I know it's hard believin'  
The words you've heard before  
But darlin' you must trust them just once more,  
  
'Cause baby goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
If you wake up and I'm not there,  
I won't be long away  
'Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl  
Will bring me back to you.  
  
I know you've been taken,  
Afraid to hurt again  
You fight the love you feel for me  
Instead, givin' in  
But I can wait forever,  
A-helpin' you to see  
That I was meant for you and you for me  
  
So remember goodbye  
Doesn't mean forever  
Let me tell you goodbye  
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again  
  
Though we may be so far apart,  
You still will have my heart  
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl  
'Cause now you're home at last.

Hold tight  
I want to dance with you this whole night  
I hope the music never slows up  
I hope this place don't never close up  
  
Hold tight  
Cause you're the only one who feels right  
Girl I know it's now or never  
I want to dance with you forever  
  
So hold on tight, never let me go, baby  
Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love  
And when you get yourself in motion  
Girl it's tearing my emotions right in two  
  
Hold tight  
And we will dance into the moonlight  
All the stars they will surround us  
We will be so glad we found us  
  
So hold on tight, never let me go, baby  
Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love  
And when you get yourself in motion  
I get loving notions all for you, yes I do  
  
Hold tight  
And we will dance into the moonlight  
I hope the music never slows up  
I hope tomorrow never shows up

I'm a fake  
I can't ever write my own lyrics  
Maybe it's because I don't have any imagination  
I'm a fake  
  
I listen to weird music  
Music that no one has heard about  
Maybe it's because I want to be different.  
I'm a loner  
  
I believe in god  
Sometimes I even read the bible  
Maybe I should become a catholic or a baptist  
I'm religious  
  
I never tell the truth  
Not even to myself  
Maybe I just need attention  
I'm a liar  
  
I eat candles  
And sometimes I eat worms  
Maybe I just need a shrink  
I'm mentally disturbed  
  
I bet you didn't see that one coming?  
Haha

Can't say I don't love her  
Still I can't pretend  
That my heart is torn just knowing that I'm losing my bestfriend  
If it's easier said and done  
Then someone tell me why  
Though I try,  
I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
I could tell her that I'm sorry  
Hope she'll understand  
She will have to do with someone else  
All that we have planned  
I'd rather her hear the truth  
Than hurt her with a lie  
So I tried,  
But I can't find the words to say goodbye  
  
Now I know  
I have to go  
There's no other way  
But goodbye is not what I can bring myself to say...  
  
If I told her "see you later"  
Then I might be wrong  
'cause this voice inside is driving me  
To find where I belong  
I know I must leave her now but everytime I try,  
Don't know why,  
Ibut I can't find the words to say goodbye...  
Don't know why,  
I can't find the words to say goodbye....

I don't love you  
I just want you  
If I don't have you never be the same  
I don't love you, but girl you'd drive a man  
Insane  
I don't love you  
But I need you  
I don't even want to know your name  
Every single minute you know is causing me  
Great pain  
I don't come from 'cross the RR tracks  
I don't need no little body hangin' off my back  
If you got plans for me  
You'd better start singin' the blues.  

I use the soap to wash the dirt off my face  
I write with pencil so that I can erase  
But what's to do when someone's taken my place with you, with you  
  
I know to stop when the light turns to red  
And when it rains I know to cover my head  
But what's to do when I wished I were dead over you, over you, over you  
  
Do do do do do etc.  
Plannin' to write off tomorrow  
Do do do do do etc  
Hopin' to wash off the sorrow  
  
I woke to find that my world was not there  
It ceased to me when I found you did not care  
And my ambition vanished into thin air along with you, with you  
  
Now my emotions find it hard to let go  
And as for me I'll find a new road to hoe  
But maybe this time I will take it more slow than before, before  
Than before

If a picture paints a thousand words,  
Then why can't I paint you?  
The words will never show the you I've come to know.  
If a face could launch a thousand ships,  
Then where am I to go?  
There's no one home but you,  
You're all that's left me to.  
And when my love for life is running dry,  
You come and pour yourself on me.  
  
If a man could be two places at one time,  
I'd be with you.  
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.  
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,  
I'd spend the end with you.  
And when the world was through,  
Then one by one the stars would all go out,  
Then you and I would simply fly away

It don't matter to me  
If you really feel that  
You need sometime to be free  
Time to go out searching for yourself  
Hoping to find time to go to find  
  
And it don't matter to me  
If you take up with someone  
Who's better than me  
'Cause your happiness is all I want  
For you to find your piece of mind  
  
Lotta people have an ego hang up  
'Cause they want to be the only one  
How many came before it really doesn't matter  
Just as long as you're the last  
Everybody's moving on and try to find out  
What's been missing in the past  
  
And it don't matter to me  
If your searching brings you back together with me  
'Cause there'll always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
'Cause it don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter to me  
  
'Cause there'll always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
'Cause it don't matter to me

Just like yesterday  
You come upon my mind and take it away  
Just like at the time  
The things we did made our hearts skip away  
Down on my knees I prayed  
Kind woman don't go astray  
When it seems at times  
I've got my mind and heart all straight away  
Just when you've become  
A memory of the past and fade away  
I see your face and think of all  
Of all that we had  
With of the things that you brought me  
Now was it so bad  
Makes me wonder  
Just like yesterday  
You come upon my mind and take it away.

Put your cards on the table  
Gotta lay your money down  
Show your heart if you're able  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
I've waited long enough  
This time I'm gonna call your bluff  
And see what you got  
And what you been keepin' from me  
  
Girl if you really mean it  
Put your lovin' on the line  
'Cause if I've never seen it  
How 'm I gonna know it's mine  
  
Baby I'm through...  
With nothin' but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down  
  
All these moves you been makin'  
Like a game of keep away  
I've had all I'm a-takin'  
It's catchin' up to you today  
  
'Cause baby I'm through...  
With nothin' but talk from you  
Gotta lay your money down

You know I've got to leave here  
If I can pull myself up to the door  
You see I've tried my best to stay here  
But I can't see you anymore  
There's something I've just gotta tell ya  
There's something keeps bringing me down, ya know  
There's one thing more I've just gotta ask ya  
Won't you please let me go?  
  
If I'm to meet my master  
If I'm to rule my fate  
You know it couldn't come any faster, babe  
But see I know it's not too late  
  
Time has not been good for us  
No time has not been kind  
We've done all that we could for us  
More time won't change my mind  
  
And when my life is over  
And I'm walking out in the rain  
Let me lie down in the clover  
And look up to the sun again  
It's not that I did not love you  
But something kept bringing me down, ya know  
There's something that I've just gotta tell you  
Once again now, baby  
Let me go, let me go

Move over  
Move over  
Let the man in  
Move over  
Look out you'll let the man of sin in  
He may tell you what be think of you  
Not by his words but by the things be 'll do  
Move over  
Move over  
Let be man come in  
Move over  
Move over  
Let his love come into your heart  
You may think you're 'bout to be abused  
Yeah, but then again you just might be amused  
Move over  
Move over baby  
You're too far over  
Move over baby  
You may think that he's a friend in need  
But I've heard it said that he's a friend indeed  
Move over  
Move over baby  
You're got to move ever if you want his love  
Shine into your heart.  
  

Everybody needs a someone  
Waitin' to be there when things are a-lookin' down  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out, find your one and only  
Somewhere out there  
Someone will care for you and then...  
Never let her go  
Never let her go  
  
You may wonder how you know love  
When the moment comes that you've been a-dreamin' of  
Well true love takes a little longer  
Your heart beats a little stronger  
You'll know it's real  
Inside you'll feel you're home at last... Then  
Never let her go  
Never let her go  
  
So if you feel a little lonely  
Go out, find your one and only  
Open your heart  
Give love a start and watch it grow... And  
Never let her go  
Never let her go

You know that lately people ask what I'm  
Doin' sittin' home alone all by myself  
They know I'm used to bein' out and about and they  
Don't know just what's become of myself  
They say the swinger can't swing it no more  
But they don't know what I'm hidin' behind my door  
Because you know I know I've never known nobody  
Nobody like you, nobody to do what you do  
And when you're leavin' poor me all alone  
You got me sittin' here sufferin' by my telephone  
I been left, I been right  
And when I'm wrong I know you're gonna make me  
See the light  
Because you know I know I've never known nobody  
Nobody like you, nobody like you.  
White other people dancin' romancin' and chancin'  
Their lives every saturday night  
Watchin' TV drinkin' tea her and me  
And maybe even have us a fight  
'Cause an argument can be outta sight  
When you love to argue and you know how to fight  
I don't care about soul  
I don't even care about no rock and roll  
You know I don't care about nothin'  
Nobody, nobody but you.

She's fallen from grace  
Somewhere in space  
The twilight has come and there is no tomorrow  
And night after day  
She's driftin' away  
And time is run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady don't you cry  
This time you'll stay high  
Lately when I've seen her  
She would smile as if to say  
That the worst was over  
And there'd soon be brighter days  
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'  
She goes to the door  
And ask just once more  
She gives everything she could beg, steal or borrow  
And each time is her last  
But time moves too fast  
And time has run out for our lady of sorrow  
Lady don't you frown  
This time you won't come down  
Just today I watched them as  
They carried her away  
And I can only hope that she  
Has found a brighter day  
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'  
Had there been someone near to care what then?  

Part-time love  
I need somebody who's consistent  
With me  
Someone already there when I need  
Company  
'cause when l'm feeling low  
I don't want to have to go out  
Looking  
For a part-time kind of love  
  
And when the dreams and rainbows  
Start to disappear  
Don't want somebody up and running  
Out here  
'cause when you stop and start  
Baby it's just too hard upon  
My heart  
That part-time kind of love  
  
And I can't take you darling living here  
Wait and see  
I want somebody who's committed  
Now to me  
Somewhere, someday you'll have  
To take a chance  
So if you like the music baby  
Get up and dance  
  
And if we grow together daring to dream  
I know we'll find our shares of  
Peaches and cream  
And when the juices flow  
I don't want no no no excuses  
Just want your full time love  
For me  
Just want your full time love  
For me.

Used to be my pleasure  
When I'd wake up in the morning  
Just to open my eyes and see you  
Just to find you were lying there  
But mornings now they seem to be an everyday affair  
I'm just a picture in the memory of your mind  
  
All I ever wanted  
Every dream that I've ever cherished  
Was to share in a kind of magic  
That only lovers ever share  
All you ever offered me  
Was the moment then and there  
I'm just a picture in your mind  
  
I used to want you, oh how badly did I want you  
I could not stand the hunger  
I used to stay awake at night and think of nothing but you  
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me  
It made me so damn happy  
I couldn't satisfy my craziness for you  
  
Now the spell is broken  
And my dreams they've all turned to ashes  
But I still have a love for living  
By loving you I've only just begun  
Love is never easy when it's given just by one  
I'm just a picture in your mind  
  
I used to want you, oh how badly did I want you  
I could not stand the hunger  
I used to lie awake at night and think of nothing but you  
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me  
It made me so damn happy, babe  
I couldn't satisfy my craziness for you  
  
Found a few more answers  
And I'm ready for tomorrow  
But I still have to stop and wonder  
If I've learned anything from what we've done  
Love is never easy when it's given just by one  
I'm just a picture in your mind  
Picture in your mind

I WOULD SAIL AROUND THE WORLD  
LOOK FOR GOLD AND DIVE FOR PEARL  
BUT I KNOW I WILL NEVER GET TO GO  
I WOULD LIKE TO WIN A PRIZE, BE IN EVERYBODY'S EYES  
BUT IT'S TRUE, I WOULD PROBABLY NOT GET TO  
  
MY LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SIMPLE  
NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHEN I COME AND GO  
AND MY DREAMS ARE ENDING AT SUNRISE  
AND DREAMING JUST DON'T MAKE IT SO  
  
SO I'VE LIVED WITHOUT REGRETS  
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING AND YET  
NOW AND THEN, WISH THAT I COULD START AGAIN

Save This Dance For Me  
  
I'll never forget that look in your eyes  
The first time I held you and we realized  
Something so special was growing inside  
Feeling's so deep.... Not easy to hide  
We talked of forever and how we would wait  
But the band started playing  
Now am I too late... Won't you  
Save this dance for me and I will lead for you  
God has gave me one last chance before my life is through  
And in your arms when the music stops is where I want to be  
So tell him no and save this dance for me.  
  
No one's been able to hurt me before  
And I'll never love like this anymore  
Cause there's no one else like you in this world  
So much a woman but I call you "Girl."  
I don't mean to doubt you but still I could lose  
And I can't live without you so  
Please when you choose... Won't you  
  
Save this dance for me and I will lead for you  
God has gave me one last chance before my life is through  
And in your arms when the music stops is where I want to be  
So please be brave and save this dance for me  
I won't give up so save this dance for me.

Seventeen, it's been a while since I was seventeen  
And the years since have been mighty lean  
But there's no use complaining  
  
And forty-two has a way of creeping up on you  
And my chances left are getting few  
But there's still time remaining  
  
And I've been waiting for someone, who loves the way I do  
Girl I got my fingers crossed, in hopes it might be you  
  
Seventeen, it's been a while since I was seventeen  
And the years since have been mighty lean  
But there's no use complaining  
  
And forty-two has a way of creeping up on you  
And my chances left are getting few  
But there's still time remaining  
  
And I've been waiting for someone, who loves the way I do  
Girl I got my fingers crossed, in hopes it might be you  
  
Twenty-one, that's how many different jobs I've done  
I remember quitting every one  
With no hesitating  
  
And thirty-three, that's how many women left on me  
I don't have too good a history  
But I don't mind waiting  
  
Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen  
Cause love is always seventeen  
  
Wonder if you'll be the one to end this lonesome heart  
Cause girl I got a lot to give and I'd sure like to start  
  
Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen  
Cause love is always seventeen

She's a butterfly  
But she flies too high  
She won't speak the truth  
She don't make excuses  
She don't seem to care  
But you want her anywhere  
'cause she's the only one  
She don't make the scene  
But that don't chnge a thing  
You just plan and scheme  
You insist on dreamin'  
She won't play your game  
But it's all the same  
Now she's the only one  
She knows too well that she's the only one  
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one  
You want to say it's over, but it's just begun  
She's the only one  
She knows too well that she's the only one  
She doesn't care if you're the lonely one  
It's not the way you planned it  
But she's really got you on the run  
Your one and only one  

I need, baby I need your love right now  
And I want, baby I wanna show you how  
C'mon, you know that we've waited long enough  
And now it's time  
Time to be lovers.  
  
I tried, tried to be only one with you  
And it's hard but baby it's worth it all for you  
And it hurts, makin' me wait for you this way,  
I can't go on.  
So c'mon and...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.  
  
I know we haven't known each other long  
But still something so right just can't be wrong  
Besides, it ought to be up to  
Me and you.  
  
When it's time, time for each other.  
I live, live for the day we're made as one  
Look back, back over all the things we've done  
But now, baby I need your love right now,  
I can't go on.  
So c'mon and...  
  
Chorus:  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.  
  
Take me now, take my love  
Make come true the feelings I've been dreamin' of  
Take me now, take me fast  
You can trust in me,  
Our love will ever last.

Who draws the crowd and plays so loud  
Baby it's the guitar man  
Who's gonna steal the show  
You know, baby, it's the guitar man  
  
He can make you love  
He can make you cry  
He will bring you down  
Then he'll get you high  
Somethin' keeps him goin'  
Miles and miles a day  
To find another place to play  
  
Night after night who treats you right  
Baby, it's the guitar man  
Who's on the radio  
You go listen to the guitar man  
  
Then he comes to town  
And you see his face  
And you think you might  
Like to take his place  
Somethin' keeps him driftin'  
Miles and miles away  
Searchin' for the songs to play  
  
Then you listen to the music  
And you like sing along  
You want to get the meaning  
Out of each and every song  
Then you find yourself a message  
And some words to call your own  
And take them home  
  
He can make you love  
He can get you high  
He will bring you down  
Then he'll make you cry  
Somethin' keeps him movin'  
But no one seems to know  
What it is that makes him go  
  
Then the lights begin to flicker  
And the sound is getting dim  
The voice begins to falter  
And the crowds are getting thin  
But he never seems to notice  
He's just got to find  
Another place to play  
  
Either way  
Got to play  
Either way  
Got to play

Sure gets funny thinkin' 'bout money  
Makin' my daily bread,  
The more you make, the more they take  
You never seem to get ahead,  
You break your backs just to pay your tax  
Then you don't like the way that it's spent,  
Somewhere back we jumped the track  
This isn't what the governmeant...  
  
Bet my now I've made a hundred thou  
But I ain't saved a dime,  
The IRS came out best  
They got my money every time,  
  
It can't be fair when the millionaire  
Never has to give them a cent,  
Sad to say we've lost the way  
This isn't what the governmeant ...  
  
Then the war , don't know what for  
Somebody said it had to be fought,  
I'se sposed to go but I said no  
'Cause I'se afraid I might get shot,  
but here I am on my hands and knees  
scrubbin' in my dungarees  
I got burned but I finally learned  
This isn't what the governmeant  

Empty nights - endless days  
Sometimes love turns out that way  
Yes I know - it went too fast  
But you can't keep livin' your life in the past  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
It's up to you to make the best of your life  
Open your eyes it's another day  
She was there - she was gone  
You don't know how you'll get along  
I've been there - and I recall  
Better that than never to have loved at all  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
You've got to go and make the best of your life  
For every night there's another day  
Yes you say you've been in love before  
You've been around and you know the score  
But when the tears fill your eyes  
Then sometimes they can blind you  
So my friend - you must know  
Love will come - and love may go  
But when it does don't despair  
Every space has someone just meant to be there  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
I know you're gonna make the best of your life  
Today's the first day of the rest of your life  
Lift up your eyes, it's the rest of your life  

Too much sorrow  
Too much pain  
Too many reasons  
No to go back again  
Leavin' without her  
Is too much to bear  
But when we're together  
Too much nothin' to share  
But too much love  
I've never seen  
Too much love  
I don't know what it means  
  
Not enough caring  
Too many lies  
Sooner or later  
One too many goodbyes  
I got no reason  
For hangin' around  
And all my possessions  
Start to weighin' me down  
But too much love  
I've never known  
Too much love  
I need some of my own

Took the last train  
  
Took the last train to st. Tropez  
Had in mind to dance the night away  
Experimented with a cognac high  
When in france you give everything a try  
  
Soon the crowd dwindled down to two  
Not a soul around but me and you  
You just smiled in french and took my hand  
Spoke the words I tried my best to understand  
You're tellin' me-  
  
Viens chez moi  
Ce soir va jamais terminer  
On va rester toujours ensemble-you're  
Tellin' me  
  
Come with me  
Tonight will last forever  
We wiii stay together always  
  
Wake the next day and found her note  
Love ya, goodbye that's all she wrote  
And every night down at the place we met  
I wait for her and those sweet words I  
Can't forget  
You're tellin' me-  
  
Viens chez moi  
Ce soir va jamais terminer  
On va rester toujours ensemble-'cause  
I want you to  
  
Come with me  
Tonight will last forever  
We wiii stay together always

Truckin' down the highway  
Get outta my way  
Always in a hurry  
Always in between  
That's where you can find me  
Truckin' down the highway  
Sittin' in the cab of  
A ten ton machine  
Gettin' pretty tired of stoppin'  
In old run down cafes  
Some day I'm gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Gonna make some inroads  
Drivin' home a payload  
Truckin' down the highway  
Like you never seen  
Gettin' pretty tired of lookin'  
In truck stop cabarets  
Some day I'm gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Then you're gonna find me  
Truckin' down the highway  
Sittin' in the back seat  
Of a long limousine

Welcome To The Music  
Bread  
(David Gates)  
  
Welcome to the music - welcome to the Guitar man  
Know you're gonna love it - gonna do the best we can  
And to help us along - think we're gonna need us a band  
  
Lately we been playin' - travelin' in the jets and cars  
Smilin' at the people - lookin'at the rock and roll stars  
I tell you Carnegie Hall's better than those honky tonk bars  
  
Well if it's true what music can do  
To soothe the savage beast like they say  
Well just relax and lie on your backs  
'Cause beastly is the way we play  
  
Now we're through talkin' - gonna speak another day  
Love to play it funky - love to hear the symphony  
And to star us along - Larry's gonna play it in "see"  
Don't touch that dial - won't you come and stay for awhile.
