Headed out for Austin, now were half way down the road.  
Hollering budda-budda-budda-budda-by!  
Steady staring out the window.  
It fells good, it fells nice, it feels like you need it.  
And back out on the road is where we like to be seated.  
We got half-pint style, we got a b-boy style.  
We got half-pint style, we got a b-boy style.  
We got to put that shit together in a creative style.  
We put that shit together in a creative style.  
  
Outside on the pavement I won't feel afraid,  
there's a little piece of paper saying how we walked that May.  
Back out on the highway, and this hurts to say,  
No one's got fingers, I got no one to blame.  
  
I can't make you overstand, rising up in a hip-hop stance.  
Society's got to me.  
That's all you need!  
  
Headed out to Houston, now where halfway out the door.  
Hollering budda-budda-budda-budda-by!  
Staring out the window.  
It fells good, it feels nice, it feels like you need it.  
I know how females like to be treated.  
A license for me and the stars up above,  
And on the interstate I fell love, love, love.  
And If I never realize then that's how it has to be,  
And all DJs out there got to give me money.  
  
Back out on the freeway, I won't fell sane.  
Little yellow headlights look like snails smashed in the rain.  
Back out on the highway, and this hurts to say,  
Blown out speakers, I got no one to blame.  
  
I can't make you overstand, rising up in a hip-hop stance.  
Society's got to me.  
That's all you need! Yea.  
  
I can ???, but I won't see,  
Because no one can tell you, you've got to be afraid.  
We got to go back on the highway, live behind the wheel.  
I want it real!

I don't want to go and party,  
I don't want to shoot the pier,  
I don't want to take the doggie for a walk,  
I don't want to look at naked chicks and drink beer,  
I don't want to do a bong load, and go and wrench on the car,  
I don't want to hose the dog shit down,

For us all to pay.  
  
I don't want to watch no porno,  
And I don't want to play guitar,  
I don't want to spank the monkey,  
I don't want to go down to the corner bar,  
And I ain't even got to listen  
To all the stupid shit you got to say.  
I don't want to do a god damn thing.  
I don't want to,  
Want to leave my bed today

Let me tell you about a girl I know  
Had a drink about a hour ago  
Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell  
  
She heard a noise and she looked through the door  
And saw a man she'd never seen before  
Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile  
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door  
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar  
"My brand new car is parked right outside  
How'd ya like to go for a ride?"  
And she said "Wait a minute I have to think."  
He said, "That's fine. May I please buy you a drink"  
One drink turned into three or four and they left and got into his car  
And they drove away someplace real far  
  
Now babe the time has come  
How'd ya like to have a little fun?  
And she said "If we could only please be on our way, I will not run."  
  
That's when things got out of control  
She didn't want to, he had his way  
She said, "Let's go"  
He said, "No way!"  
Come on babe it's your lucky day  
Shut your mouth, were gonna do it my way  
Come on baby don't be afraid  
If it wasn't for date rape I'd never get laid  
  
He finished up and he started the car  
He turned around and drove back to the bar  
He said "Now baby don't be sad, in my opinion you weren't half-bad."  
She picked up a rock.,threw it at the car, hit him in the head, now he's got a
big scar  
Come on party people won't you listen to me  
Date rape stylee  
  
The next day she went to her drawer, look up her local attorney at law,  
Went to the phone and filed the police report and then she took the guy's ass
to court  
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge he screamed, "She lies that
little slut!"  
The judge knew that he was full of shit and he gave him twenty five years  
And now his eyes are full of tears  
One night in jail it was getting late  
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed  
But the guards paid no attention to his cries  
  
That's when things got out of control  
The moral of the date rape story, it does not pay to be drunk and horny.  
But that's the way it had to be  
They locked him up and threw away the key  
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind  
Even though he now takes it in the behind  
  
But that's the way it had to be  
They locked him up and threw away the key  
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind  
Even though he now takes it in the behind  
Date rape!  
  
She didn't want to, she didn't want to, she didn't want to, she didn't want to  
Take it!

[Chorus]  
Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.  
All the people in the dance will agree  
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC  
Me, and me and Louie run to the party  
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder.  
  
Me and my girl got this relationship.  
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit  
On lock down like a penitentiary  
She spreads her loving' all over and when she comes home  
There's none left for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh take this veil from off my eyes  
A burning sun will someday rise  
What am I gonna be doing' for a wife  
Said I'm gonna play with myself  
Show them how we come off the shelf  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Evil  
I've come to tell you that she's evil  
Most definitely.  
Evil  
Ornery, scandalous, and evil  
Most definitely.  
  
The tension is getting hotter.  
I'd like to hold her head underwater.  
  
Me and my girl,  
Got a relationship  
  
Me and my girl,  
We've got a relationship  
  
My girl, got a relationship,  
Oh and my girl  
  
Take a tip, take a tip, take a t-t-t-t-t-tii-up.  
  
[Chorus]

Stolen from an Africa land  
Chased out with a knife  
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike  
Oh well the bars are always open and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
If I was Bob Marley I said could you be loved  
If I was Half Pint I'd ball the lord up above  
If I was Mike Tyson I'd look for a fight  
If I was a Boomtown Rats I would be stayin' up all night  
If I was the King Ad-Rock I would get stupid dumb  
If rhymes were Valiums I'd be comfortably numb  
  
If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do,  
I'd point that shit straight at the sky  
And shoot heaven on down for you  
Because the bars are always open, and the time is always right  
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night  
And it goes  
  
I want a lover, I can't find the time  
I want a reason, I can't find the rhyme  
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford,  
Just lay on the ground like I fell off my skateboard  
Now a days, as clear as you please, strap with protection or strap with
disease.  
Laughter, it's free any time just call me  
439-0116 when your down with Sublime you get  
Funky fresh lyrics, you get nothin'  
  
Stolen from an Africa land  
Got chased out of the bar  
I saw my best friend tonight, so don't push me too far  
  
I'm gonna run come down with the new lyrics,  
Get hit get hip don't slip you knuckle heads  
Racism is schism on a serious tip  
You don't believe me that I won't bust your lip.  
I hear the mountain, it hard to climb  
Ruffle the rhythm and it must be Sublime  
Listen yellow lover yeah it right on time  
We got cricket with the quickness and the bass line  
  
Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news oh, hey  
Tell them reggae music is on the loose  
Here I am from the place where the sun keeps shine new style in a unique
fashion  
And good, good vibes that keep on playin', playin'  
  
People want to come up and they want to tell me smokin' crack cocaine better
than sensi  
You're pumpin' that shit yo we're sick of it  
Teakin' every weekend and we just can't take it  
We don't want plastic

"You could hear the fuckin' fleas crawlin' on my nuts"  
  
Out my window cool and bright  
Fade so slowly into night  
Funny how things look the same  
Now that my friend Ebin's changed  
  
Ebin was a cooly that I used to know  
Now he's down with the PLO  
He's cold kickin it live with the KKK  
No XXX, no JFA  
  
Cooly was sportin' black denim shoes  
Dealing he was looking for something to use  
With a pistol in his pocket and a bottle of booze  
Well, it could be me or it could be you  
Oh feels like my whole life is rearranged  
  
Oh Ebin you changed  
Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, Ebin you  
Oh how you changed  
Oh you changed,

I give you a hard time, didn't want to stay  
Got outta jail just the very next day  
It's plain to see my friend Ebin is a Nazi  
He was a Nazi yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Hooked on crack just the other day  
Now he's down with the CIA  
We got covert operation in Vietnam  
Making hits and assassination he's long gone  
  
He went down to protect his country  
Eat Mexican food and makes lots o' money  
Come back a God and drive a big white car  
And take himself a plane down to Nicaragua  
Well it feels like I'm the only one to blame  
  
Oh Ebin you changed  
Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, Ebin you  
Oh you changed,

You can stay here.  
Hey man.  
On that one.  
You got a good Samaritan here.  
The mother-fuckers knocked on the door and arrested him for being drunk in
public.  
What's goin' on?

He usually doesn't speak.  
Like, every two weeks.  
He speaks in tongues.

I swear sometimes you're taking me for granted  
I swear sometime you're a whore  
I swear but I know there ain't no reason  
Cause everything is such a bore  
  
At night I had a dream, though it made me sick  
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick, (my goodness!)  
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault  
Said it's time that it happened to me  
But I know that the show was much more than a blow  
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low  
Waiting for the tide to get low  
  
If I was an ant, live upon the wall  
Tell me baby would it make any difference at all  
If I was a roach on a tree tell me would you smoke me?  
Bright lights put me in a trance  
But it ain't house music, makes me want to dance (word)  
I don't gamble but I bet  
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette  
Hold me close I always play the mack  
With the monkey on my back.

Oh, in a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast to your lips  
And later you move and slip  
And if you have to don't trip  
  
I don't know how they manage  
But believe me Mister, they do  
If you ever live there  
You just listen and don't be no fool  
  
In a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
Later you move and trip  
If you have to just slip  
  
No one ask no question  
No one tell no lie  
Listen to me people  
It's the reason why  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
And later you move and trip  
And if you have to just slip  
  
I don't know how they manage  
But believe me, Mister, they do  
If you ever live there  
You just listen and don't be no fool  
  
In a little district  
In a neighborhood  
People movin' swift  
Like they think they should  
  
A word from your mouth  
Your lights get knocked out  
A blast from your lip  
Later you move and trip

Maybe one breath away  
I'll find the words to say  
I'll sit and light the bong  
I'll hold my hit in real long  
  
I don't know if I can go up inside of you tonite  
Oh Mary baby, please don't fuss and fight  
  
You've heard the line before  
Mary, baby, please don't think I'm a whore  
If you come home with me  
Turn off the lights lock up the door and start gettin' busy  
  
I don't know if I can go so far up inside you tonite  
Mary, baby, I could do it right  
  
When we got to her pad  
Mary, baby, started callin' me her dad  
As she gave me head  
We could not find the damn bed  
  
Fifteen years old plus one  
Hotter than a microwave oven  
  
Mary, baby, daddy is comin' home

Wake up in the morning and its hard live  
Hard to live yes its hard to live  
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give  
But everyday its getting harder to live  
  
But I would up for being down with the ho  
Still I know I got mic control  
I'm aware of the high and the low  
I've got spiritual mic control  
  
But I move culturally  
Unfortunately, its left up to me  
All real lovers that wanna be ho's  
What we need is just mic control  
  
'Cause its not what you're saying but  
What's in your soul  
Mic control, its called mic control  
Do you have mic control  
You know this style is well original  
  
At the party I got reason to give love in whole  
Mic control, I've got mic control  
I know I'm a reason come not to live  
But every day its getting harder to live  
  
I'm aware of the high and the low  
Mic control, mic control, mic control  
Heart and soul we've got mic control  
  
But I move [for]tually  
Unfortunately, I'm an opponent to me  
Here lies something real  
Mic control we've got mic control  
Do you have mic control

The time has come to reach a new realization 'tween me and you  
Time to clear the rumors sensations and things that just are untrue.  
Well I thought I heard you behind me  
With a knife straight for my back.  
It's quite clear that I'm back in the swing of living  
Although I might not be on the right track.  
  
Oh thought I might drown but its hard to be givin'.  
Downtown's where's you'll find me do some and got a hand.  
Although I never listen girl, I damn well understand.  
And you think, I'm so damn feeble.  
I can't see through your lies, you're just a crock of shit,  
With a pretty smile, and I refuse to compromise.  
  
Oh, don't give me such a heavy, heavy, heavy load  
  
You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can found in a lie.  
Maybe some grain of inspiration, for song that's deep inside.  
  
Oh, tears running down your face,  
Just screaming look me in the eye.  
Well I'm licking straight at your twisted face,  
And it's enough to make me cry.  
  
Oh, I payed the price of loving you,  
In more ways than one.  
Wrapped around your finger but I think my time has come,  
But I never can be too sure 'cause I like to have a little fun.  
  
Oh, what fun it would be to blow my mind and fall into the sun.  
A mind is a precious thing to taste.

I got so much trouble on my mind  
That it feels just like I'm always sleeping with the enemy  
But I know the real world always gets the last word  
And that's why you gotta kick reality.  
So don't tease me and try to say I should care.  
I might as well go out for mine  
Cause everybody's going out for theirs.  
  
So don't tell me about a fake drug war  
Go cut education programs more  
The people will one day learn and rise  
Cause not everyone is out to score.  
  
People always ask me why people are all fucked up  
At every corner liquor store.

I never thought that when I grew up I would be in a band  
And travel to all the best spots in the land  
I'm not here to brag or boast  
I'm just here to tell you 'bout the spots that I love the most  
  
Natural bridges on a clean west swell  
Breaks over the reef like a bat out of hell  
Stockton Avenue gets hollow and mean  
And on a big day it works like a machine  
Outside Stockton gets hot like a glove  
Swift St. John's St. into Michell's Cove  
Big Steamer Lane makes you wish you were a trout  
When it's mackin' so hard only two dudes paddle out  
  
A huge Summertime South swell hit when I'm in my hometown  
I'm a surfside boy, is where I can be found  
Or up and down the coast  
Checkin' the spots that I love the most

Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
Your girlfriend said so but I don't really know  
That don't mean we fucked around that night last week when you left town  
  
I was tweakin' by myself one night that's when I wrote this tune  
Didn't have no need for that bed in my hotel room  
Sometimes right now since I've left the pen  
I feel like I'm right back there again  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
  
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone  
My girlfriend said so, she's a little ho  
That don't mean I fuck around, I like to keep that higher ground  
  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from  
Don't tease me, don't tease me, don't tease  
Sometimes I pray, waiting waiting for some bright holiday  
So I bought myself a gun and I'm right back right back where I'm from

By the rivers of Babylon  
Where he sat down  
And there he wept when he remembered Zion.  
  
Oh from wicked, carry us away from captivity  
Required from us a song  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?  
  
So let the words of our mouth  
And the meditations of our hearts  
Be acceptable in thy sight  
Over I  
  
By the rivers of Babylon  
Where he sat down  
And there he wept when he remembered Zion.  
  
Oh from wicked, carry us away from captivity  
Required from us a song  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?  
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?

On the east side that's where I met my Ramona  
"I wanna go to a party", That's what she said  
Lonely, that's what I've been here's my telephone number, call me  
And to a party, a house party  
Whole loop a people just rally around me  
And love, she send a message of love  
She said, "I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap"  
Ramona please step back  
Now she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my Heina  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now she's selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one? Tell me  
And she said, "You're not the only one, but your the best, Bradley"  
Now I'm waiting for my Ruca  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina  
I know tonight I'll be behind her  
And I barely pulled up with my Heina  

Down in Mississippi where the sun beats down from the sky  
They give it up and they give it up and they give it up  
But they never ask why  
Daddy was a rollin', rollin' stone  
He rolled away one day and he never came home  
  
It ain't hard to understand  
This ain't Hitler's master plan  
What it takes to be a man  
In my mind, in my brain  
I roll it over like a steamin' freight train  
It ain't hard to ascertain  
  
You only see what you want to believe  
When you light up in the back with those tricks up your sleeve  
That don't mean I can't hang  
But the day that I die  
Will be the day that I shut my mouth and put down my guitar  
Sunday morning hold church down at the bar  
Get down on your knees and start to pray  
Pray my itchy rash will go away  
  
Back up y'all it ain't me  
Kentucky Fried Chicken is all I see  
It's a hellified way to start your day  
If I make you cry all night  
Me and daddy gonna have a fist fight  
It ain't personal, it ain't me  
  
I only hear what you told me to be  
I'm a backward-ass hillbilly  
I'm Dick Butkiss  
You know I lie  
I get mean, I'm a thief in the dark  
I'm a ragin' machine  
I'm a triple rectified ass son of a bitch  
Rec-tite(tm) on my ass and it makes me itch  
I can see for miles and miles and miles  
My broken heart makes me smile  
  
In my mind, in my brain  
I go back and go completely insane  
It ain't personal, it ain't me  
If I make you cry I might  
Be your daddy at the end of the night  
Take a load from my big gun  
  
You only see what you want to believe  
When you creep from the back  
I got tricks up my sleeve  
Twenty four seven the devil's best friend  
It makes no difference  
It's all the same in the end

Girls don't go crazy  
  
Woman, hold your man tight  
  
Every day I love him just a little bit more,  
A little bit more, a little bit more  
Everyday I love him just a little bit more  
And he loves me the same  
  
Every day I love her just a little bit more,  
A little bit more, little bit more  
Everyday I love her just a little bit more  
And she loves me the same  
  
Baby if you want to get on  
  
Oh baby if you want to get off  
  
It makes no sense at all  
  
I saw red  
  
I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that  
  
I shot dead  
  
Everyday I wake up just a little bit more  
Feelin' like a dog out on the yard  
Because that's just how we are  
  
Everyday I wonder if it's over  
When I wake up realizin' that we hate  
And brake down the war  
  
You say it's black, but I can't believe you  
  
And if you say it's white,  
You say I'm tryin' to deceive you  
  
And I'm aware of the high and the low,  
And I'd be waiting for you in the middle but I just lack control  
  
Baby if you want to get low  
  
Oh baby if you want to get high  
  
It makes no sense at all  
  
I saw red  
  
I saw red, I saw red, one more sacred lover that  
  
I shot dead  
  
Girls, don't go crazy,  
Girls, don't go crazy,  
Oh girls, don't go crazy when the men use you, oh  
  
Oh, woman hold your man tight  
If it makes you feel right, it's your own life

As I was walkin' down rub-a-dub square  
Not a chill to the window but a little to the air  
From another direction she was calling my eye  
It could be an illusion but I might as well try  
Might as well try  
  
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes  
And I knew without asking she was into the blues  
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls  
I knew right away she was not like other girls, like other girls  
  
Well I ain't never been right as I ain't never been wrong  
As everything works out the way it does in this song  
Cause once in a while you get shown in the light  
In the strangest of places if you look at it right  
  
It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above  
Because the women took a lovin' over me  
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus  
Because I sold off all my personal property  
  
A tie-tie-dyed dress, she was a psychedelic mess  
We toured to the north, south, east and west  
We sold some mushroom tea,  
We sold some ecstasy,  
We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP  
And now I hear the police coming after me  
Yes now I hear the police coming after me  
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair,  
She's got the police coming after me  
  
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves  
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues  
And there ain't nothin' wrong with the love that's in her eyes  
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by, let her pass by.  
Oh just let her pass by

Janie always said I was a mess  
I'm sorry 'bout that mess  
I made her bleed  
I'm planting my seed  
Still I knew it could take it if I opened up the rhythm  
I knew it could make it  
I hope her parents love her  
  
So, feelin' the acid on the brain  
Still I got that frame I made  
Her bleed yes she wants that lovin' you see  
Well if you live you want to give or get old  
And if you never knew that we get old, you live it up, live it up  
You get old, believe me when I say  
  
It's the same shit everyday  
But I got to know my place  
And if you don't it fucks you in your face  
I know her parents love her  
I hope her parents love her  
I hope her parents love her so  
  
Billyed back in 1983, what did you do for me  
I made her bleed  
I'm planting my seed  
I knew we could make it  
But I only knew that the bitch would break it  
I hope her parents love her  
So my God look at me  
If he had to go I know  
I know I'm barely lovin' my holy creed  
You never knew that was what you need  
Oh my God honestly believe it or not its a disease.  
I hope her parents love her  
I hope her parents love her, so

She takes her time when it's time to get ready.  
Always has her way.  
Always leaves me waiting by the phone.  
She told me more than once to take it slow  
And I said OK.  
But lately I've been sleeping all alone.  
I'm not breaking up inside  
I'm much to proud to moan.  
Baby please come home.  
  
I feel a little lucky so I try to play it cool.  
I think she laughs inside.  
With the words that burn like fire in my mouth.  
Try to be a man like I got the master plan, night out on the town.  
Drink and dance and we can turn it out.  
  
Whoa, maybe it's how your body moves I just don't know,  
Maybe it's just the way you move so slow.  
  
[Hello?]  
[Hi it's me]  
[I thought I told you not to call me here]  
[I know I just really needed to talk to you]  
[Get a clue babe, there's nothing to talk about.]  
  
(Click!)  
  
Ask me why I play myself play myself for a fool.  
Swear I would do most anything.  
Walk a mile to see her smile.  
Walk a mile just to rock for a while.  
Babe I'm thinking with my ding-a-ling.  
  
Whoa, I've been doing some thinking,  
Now I just don't know.  
Maybe just the way you move so slow.  
Maybe 'cause you move so slow.  
Maybe 'cause you move so slow.  
  
But sitting on the verge of tears does not become my twenty two years.  
You took my shame, and you took my pride,  
And now you gonna take me for a slow ride.  
  
But uh, uh. Waiting, waiting on the phone.  
Got the words that burn like fire in my mouth.  
Come on down reggae style,  
Wind up your body like a bass line wild,  
Drink and dance and we can turn it out.  
  
Whoa, I'm not going crazy but I just don't know,  
  
Maybe 'cause you move so slow. [Repeat x3]  
  
Like love,  
Move nice and low.  
  
Slowride! [Repeat x3]

I smoke two joints in the morning  
I smoke two joint at night  
I smoke two joint in the afternoon  
It makes me feel all right  
  
I smoke two joints in time of peace  
And two in time of war  
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints,  
And then I smoke two more  
  
Daddy he once told me,  
"Son, you be hard workin' man"  
And momma she once told me,  
"Son, you do the best you can"  
Then one day I met a man,  
He came to me and said,  
"Hard work good and hard work fine,  
But first take care of head"  
  
Whoa rock me to the night  
Jah say

If you want to live, treat me good.

I'm like a steppin' razor to watch my sides,  
I'm dangerous, so dangerous.

All that I need, look at all the love we've found.  
I won't run and pull the one jack move  
They love her for the Kingston sound.  
  
Flava-Flave and I-C-E  
Once said something that made me  
Want to burn my liquor store down to the ground.  
But I just can't leave the pad, cuz I'll surely wind up dead,  
'Cuz I know there out there out there waiting and watching for me.  
Still I got my yellow cat and my wooden baseball bat  
And my shiny silver gat and if my homey my back then I got  
  
All that I need, look at all the love we've found.  
I won't run and pull the one jack move  
They love her for the Kingston sound.  
  
I won't slip, and I won't trip. Send Matt Vargas to regrip.  
While I'm wrenchin' on my ride, in that secret pad where we hide,  
There's always lotsa fun stuff to do,  
Like relax and design a brand new tattoo.  
Play with my cross-word puzzle book, I'm even learning how to cook.  
  
Have you seen that little whore Betty?  
Someone said she stole my Freddie  
And if she made off with my last clean ring,  
I'm gonna kill that fuckin' ditch pig.  
So what?  
Outta my, outta my, outta my, outta my secret pad,  
Cuz I know your talkin' about me baby, makin' it hard to live.  
Cause I, don't want no money dick, don't want no money down.  
My secret tweaker pad is now the hottest pale spot in town I guess.  
Take it nice and easy.  
Don't want no sheriff breakin' down the door to raid me.  
  
All that I need, look at all the love we've found.  
I won't run and pull the one jack move,  
They love her for the Kingston sound.  
  
Baby you wanna give me kisses sweet,  
Only for one night with no repeat.  
Baby you wanna leave and never go,  
But the taste of honey is worse than none at all.

So tell me if you really want to be a superstar  
But fiesta on the mike and will surely take you far  
You made that drop on the 24 tracks  
We mix it all down then we put on wax  
  
Beginning is hyped when you playin in the bars  
A bottomless pit where you make loose and far  
Take away your privacy and take your guitar  
Then take your woman and impound your car  
  
My beginning of wisdom I won't take you too far  
First you gotta sell your soul to be a superstar  
Baby if you got it forget about that  
Your money don't concern you that's a natural fact  
  
Shut up your mouth before you get knocked down  
We're gonna listen to your voice upon the speaker box  
First you get a manager but what does he do  
I'll be the first to tell you baby that I don't have a clue  
  
We're gunna make a phony image for the MTV  
Hear it on the radio say damn that's me  
Whenever I get over on a 3 piece hog  
Jesus and her mom are gonna break your arm  
  
Put your ass in the john to be a superstar  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your reknown position and you just can't hide  
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff  
  
All over the world you gotta take that trip  
And then you never thought you'd see the day you'd act like this  
Your rep is getting bigger than a B-52  
And then it goes around the world before it gets back to you  
  
Hey our love has started can you believe  
Before your eyes this shit just come back to me  
Oh my God I take a rest on the side  
So long so long so long so long I'll see ya  
  
Oh my God if I'd a let my own  
I'd take it turn around and place it home  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your renowned position and you just can't hide  
  
Whoa it's the position  
I just can't hide  
Bo  
Whatcha want whatcha need  
  
Give it a bunch of mine and you just can't miss  
Your love feels like this

Whoa if you love me punani punani

Want the dogs? Let em go. Let em

You can see it every day,  
Cause your freedom ain't free

On the eastside, that's where I met my Ramona,  
"I wanna go to a party," that's what she said  
Lonely, that's what I been  
  
Here's my telephone number call me  
And to a party a house par-ty  
Whole lotta people just rally-round-me and love,  
She send a message of love  
She said I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap, BAH BAH.  
Ramona please step back  
  
Cause she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my hiena  
She moved from Long Beach down to LA  
Right now she selling oranges by the freeway  
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one tell me  
And she said "Your not the only one, but your the best Bradley"  
And know now I waiting for my Ruca and I barely pulled up with my hiena  
I know tonight I be behind her, don't fuck around with my hiena.

Early man walked away  
As modern man took control  
There mind's weren't all the same  
(And) To conquer was their goal  
So he built his great empire  
And he slaughtered his own kind  
(And) He died a confused man  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
(He) Killed himself in his own mind  
  
Let's Go!  
  
Were only gonna die from our own arrogance  
That's why we might as well take our time.

What happened?  
Wake up in the morning,  
Clock says half past one  
I have no sunglasses  
As I step into the sun  
  
There's no recollection  
Of the evil things I've done  
My head feels like I musta had some fun  
  
What happened?  
  
Last thing I remember  
I was chillin' at a party  
Pinching girlies' asses  
I was drinking recklessly  
  
I know I did something  
Lord what could it be  
Woke up in the morning  
And all my friends hate me  
  
What happened?  
  
What I'm I doing here  
Who is this girl in my bed  
What is this shit on my face  
My God, what is that awful smell  
  
[Chorus]  
She may be an angel  
She may be a queen  
She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese  
Through a bottle at a bouncer  
Didn't think that he was cool  
Pissed in someones drink  
And through a bike into a pool  
  
Driven down the side walk  
Like a crazy possessed fool  
I broke every single traffic rule.  
  
What happened?  
What happened?  
  
Let's go  
  
[Chorus]

Early in the morning, risin' to the street  
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet  
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong  
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone  
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high  
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot  
  
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got  
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot  
Never start static I just get it off my chest  
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest  
Take a small example, take a tip from me  
Take all of your money, give it all to charity  
  
Love is what I got  
Within my reach  
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach  
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve  
Try and test that you're bound to get served  
  
Love's what I got  
Don't start a riot  
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot  
  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
  
(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away  
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay  
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot  
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock  
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same  
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane  
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me  
  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
  
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that  
Lovin', is what I got, I got I got I got I got

Hahahah, (here it goes)  
  
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,  
Welcome to tonights presentation,  
Its brought to you by us,  
And its non-fiction  
  
Everybody saw  
The last movie we made,  
And this one called 'What's really goin wrong'  
  
What is really, what is really goin' wrong  
Well what is really, what is really goin' wrong  
  
Sublime in the place livin' up chickens creation  
In 1996 to make you buy this cinematation,  
This is what they, agree to show to you  
It's not really the truth  
But you'll believe it through and through  
  
What is really, What is really goin' wrong  
What is really, What is really goin' wrong  
  
What is really, What is really Goin' wrong  
What is really goin' wrong  
  
What is really, what is really goin' wrong  
What is really, (what is really), What is really, what is really goin' wrong  
  
What is really goin' wrong  
What is really, what is really goin' wrong

Well we realized so long, long ago, and I bet you,  
That we've seen it all, the lies won't get you.  
I've got fourteen miles to go,  
I've got rhythm comin' sense I've got the sto.  
But I won't wanna come around our love. So why?  
If you are rich, I'm gonna hang you on the wall.  
  
I'ma find you.  
And when I find you, I'm gonna get your lovin' arms today.  
So we fight to get, we fight to get our weary arms to bed.  
Real love's something that I still hope people make there own places to go.  
And now in '94 were gonna lie some more.  
In 1994 were going to die some more.  
It it ever going to be the last show?  
It's going to be the last drive,  
Boss to proud to make the cars that we drive.  
The women don't mind, I've got ample time,  
They don't wonder why that they do.  
  
That's work that we do, a work that we do is work that we do.
