Lady Supermarket with an apple in her basket  
Knocks in the manager's door,  
Grooming to the muzak from a speaker in shoe rack  
Lays out her goods on the floor,  
Everything she's chosen is conveniently frozen.  
"Eat it and come back for more!"  
  
Lady Window Shopper with a new one in the hopper  
Whips up a chemical brew,  
Croaking to a neighbor while she polishes a sabre  
Knows how to flavor a stew.  
Never need to worry with a tin of "Hurri Curri"  
"Poisoned especially for you!"  
  
No use to complain  
If you're caught out in the rain,  
Your mother's quite insane.  
Cat food cat food cat food again.  
  
Lady Yellow Stamper with a fillet in a hamper  
Dying to finish the course,  
Goodies for the table with a fable on the label  
Drowning in miracle sauce.  
Don't think I am that rude if I tell you that it's cat food,  
"Not even fit for a horse!"

Here it comes, here comes another day  
Another decision on the way  
Well here it comes, here comes a covered display  
Of preferences to make  
Well here it comes, here comes a knock on the door  
Open it for an opportunity  
Well here it comes, here comes another day  
For memories to be made  
  
Eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
  
'n there it was, it was a perfect take  
And were you asleep or awake  
There it was, it was a perfect time  
To speak your mind  
'n there it was, it was a chance of a lifetime  
It flew right by and what did you do?  
Well there it was, it was another day  
For memories to be made  
  
Eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
I've got my eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
Because you never know  
What you might see

Six billion ants crawling on a plate  
Six million ants crawling on a plate  
None of them give back as much as they take  
Six billion ants crawling on a plate  
  
Doesn't mean you should just because you can  
It doesn't mean you should just because you can  
Like Abraham and Ishmael fighting over sand  
It doesn't mean you should just because you can  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact of life  
  
Now some of us build and some of us teach  
Some of us build, some of us teach  
And some of us kill what some of us eat  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact of life  
  
Nobody knows what happens when you die  
Nobody knows what happens when you die  
Believe what you want, it doesn't mean you're right  
  
That is a fact of life  
That is a fact

And when I have some words  
This is the way I'll sing  
To a distortion box  
To make the music sing  
then, I'm gonna have to write a chorus  
Gonna need to have a chorus  
And this seems to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm blue in
the face, yeah, were gonna need to have a chorus, gonna have to write a
chorus, and this seems to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm
blue in the face.

I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close, feels like mine  
All mine  
I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close it feels like mine  
All mine  
  
I remember the feeling  
My hands in your hair  
Hands in your hair  
I remember the feeling  
Of the rhythm we made  
The rhythm we made  
I need to land sometime  
Right next to you  
Feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
Right next to me

I do remember one thing.  
It took hours and hours but..  
By the time I was done with it,  
I was so involved, I didn't know what to think.  
  
I carried it around with me for days and days..  
Playing little games  
Like not looking at it for a whole day  
And then... looking at it.  
  
To see if I still liked it.  
I did.  
  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
I repeat myself when under stress.  
  
I repeat...  
The more I look at it,  
The more I like it.  
I do think it's good.  
  
The fact is..  
No matter how closely I study it,  
No matter how I take it apart,  
No matter how I break it down,  
  
It remains consistent.  
I wish you were here to see it.  
  
I like it.

Indoor fireworks amuse your kitchen staff  
Dusting plastic garlic plants  
They snigger in the drought  
When you ride through the parlor  
Wearing nothing but your armor  
Playing Indoor Games.  
  
One string puppet shows amuse  
Your sycophantic friends  
Who cheer your rancid recipes  
In fear they might offend,  
Whilst you loaf on your sofa  
Sporting falsies and a toga  
Playing Indoor Games, Indoor Games.  
  
Your mean teetotum spins arouse your seventh wife  
Who pats her sixty little skins  
And re-insures your life,  
Whilst you sulk in your sauna  
'cause you lost your jigsaw corner  
Playing Indoor Games, Indoor Games.  
  
Each afternoon you train baboons to sing  
Or swim in purple perspex water wings.  
Come Saturday jump hopper, Chelsea brigade,  
High bender-trender it's all Indoor Games.  
  
No ball bagatelle incites  
Your children to conspire,  
They slide across your frying pan  
And fertilize your fire,  
Still you and Jones go madder  
Broken bones-broken ladder-  
Hey Ho

Earth, stream and tree encircled by sea  
Waves sweep the sand from my island.  
My sunsets fade.  
Field and glade wait only for rain  
Grain after grain love erodes my  
High weathered walls which fend off the tide  
Cradle the wind  
To my island.  
  
Gaunt granite climbs where gulls wheel and glide  
Mournfully glide o'er my island.  
My dawn bride's veil, damp and pale,  
Dissolves in the sun.  
Love's web is spun, cats prowl, mice run  
Wreathe snatch-hand briers where owls know my eyes  
Violet skies  
Touch my island,  
Touch me.  
  
Beneath the wind turned wave  
Infinite peace  
Islands join hands  
'Neathe heaven's sea.  
  
Dark harbor quays like fingers of stone  
Hungrily reach from my island.  
Clutch sailor's words, pearls and gourds  
Are strewn on my shore.  
Equal in love, bound in circles.  
Earth, stream and tree return to the sea  
Waves sweep sand from my island,  
From me.

A flower lady's daughter  
As sweet as holy water  
Said, "I'm the school reporter  
Please teach me", well I taught her.  
  
Two fingered levi'd sister  
Said, "Peace", I stopped I kissed her.  
Said, "I'm a male resister",  
I smiled and just unzipped her.  
  
High diving Chinese trender  
Black hair and black suspender  
Said, "Please me no surrender  
Just love to feel your Fender".  
  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Are like apples you stole in your youth.  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Been around but are versed in the truth.  
  
Stone-headed Frisco spacer  
Ate all the meat I gave her  
Said would I like to taste hers  
And even craved the flavor  
  
"Like marron-glaced fish bones  
Oh lady hit the road!"  
  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Are like apples you stole in your youth.  
All of you know that the girls of the road  
Been around but are versed in the truth.

I guess I tried to show you how  
I'd take the crowd with my guitar  
And business men would clap their hands  
And clip another fat cigar  
  
And publishers would spread the news  
And print my music far and wide  
And all the kids who played the blues  
Would learn my licks with a bottle neck slide  
  
But now it seems the bubble's burst  
Although you know there was a time  
When love songs gathered in my head  
With poetry in every line  
  
And strong men strove to hold the doors  
While with my friends I passed the age  
When people stomped on dirty floors  
Before I trod the rock'n'roll stage  
  
I'll thank the man who's on the 'phone  
And if he has the time to spend  
The problem I'll explain once more  
And indicate a sum to lend  
  
That ten percent is now a joke  
Maybe thirty, even thirty-five  
I'll say my daddy's had a stroke  
He'd have one now, if he only was alive  
  
I like the way you look at me  
You're laughing too down there inside  
I took my chance and you took yours  
You crewed my ship, we missed the tide  
  
I like the way the music goes  
There's a few good guys who can play it right  
I like the way it moves my toes  
Just say when you want to go and dance all night...

In the dream I fall into the sleepless sea  
With a swell of panic and pain  
My veins are aching for the distant reef  
In the crush of emotional waves  
  
Alright, get a hold of yourself  
An' don't fight it, it's over your head  
It's alright, the rumble in your ears  
It's alright to feel a little fear  
An' don't fight it, it's over your head  
It's alright, you wake up in your bed  
  
Silhouettes like shivering ancient feelings  
They cover my foreign floors and walls  
Submarines are lurking in my foggy ceiling  
They keep me sleepless at night  
  
Hey, can you picture the sight  
The figures on the beach in the searing night  
And the roaring hurt of my silent fight  
Can you pull me out  
Of this sleepless night  
Can you pull me out?

Health-food fagot with a bartered bride  
Likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride  
Once had a friend with a cloven foot  
Once he called the tune in a checkered quit  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
In the door on the floor in a paper bag  
There's a shoe-shine boy with a gin-shop slag  
She raised him up and she called him son  
And she canonized the ground that he walked upon  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, Cadillacs blue jeans  
  
In the night he's a star in the Milky Way  
He's a man of the world by the light of day  
A golden smile and a proposition  
And the breath of God smells of sweet sedition  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
Sing hymns make love get high fall dead  
He'll bring his perfume to your bed  
He'll charm your life 'til the cold winds blow  
Then he'll sell your dreams to a picture show  
  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary  
  
Cadillacs, blue jeans, dixieland playing on the ferry  
Cadillacs, blues jeans, drop a glass full of antique sherry

Well, first of all,  
I couldn't even see his face.  
I couldn't see his face.  
He was holding a gun in his hand.  
Umm, I was thinking  
This is a dangerous place  
This is a dangerous place  
  
I said, "I'm nervous as hell from this stuff.  
I thought those guys were going to kill me for sure.  
They ganged up on me like that.  
I couldn't believe it.  
Look, I'm still shakin'.  
Weird.  
There out in the streets like that.  
It's a dangerous place.  
It's a dangerous place."  
  
So, suddenly, these two guys appear in front of me.  
They stopped.  
Real aggressive.  
Start at me, you know.  
"What's that?" "What's that on that tape?"  
What do you got there?"  
I said, "huh?"  
They said, "What are you talking into that for?"  
I said, "It's just a tape, you know"  
"Well play it for me"  
I said "oh, no"  
I put it off as long as I could.  
And finally they turned it on, you know  
They grabbed it from me.  
Took it away from me.  
Turned it on.  
And it said, "He held a gun in his hand. This is a dangerous place."  
They said, "What dangerous place?" "What gun?" "You're a policeman!"  
And the deeper I talked, the worse I got into it.  
I talked, I told him, I said, "Look man, I'm not talkin'"  
It went on forever.  
Anyway, I finally unbuttoned my shirt, and said,  
"look, look, I'm in this band, you know, I'm in this band you know,  
and we're makin' a recording, you know.  
It's about New York City, it's about crime in the streets.  
"The explanation was going nowhere, but,  
Finally, they just kinda let me go, I don't know why.  
So I walk around the corner,  
and I'm like shakin' like a leaf,  
and I thought, "This is a dangerous place"  
  
Who should appear, but two policeman.

Oh they're touching  
They're touching each other  
They're feeling  
They push and move  
And love each other, love each other  
They fit together like two hands  
  
I am a face  
in the painting on the wall  
I pose and shudder  
And watch from the foot of the bed  
Sometimes I think I can  
Feel everything  
  
The wind is blowing  
My hair in their direction  
The wind is bending my hair  
There are no windows in the painting  
No open windows, no open windows, no

I come back, come back  
You see my return  
My returning face is smiling  
Smile of a waiting man  
  
I be home soon soon soon  
Soon cry on your shoulder  
Your shoulder against my burning tears  
Tears of a waiting man  
  
One two three four one two three  
I wait every moment  
I wait, wait for my chance  
I wait for my friend to say  
Hello, you waiting man  
  
Feel no fret feel no fret feel no fret  
You can wait and feel no fret  
And so I wait so I wait so I wait so I wait  
I return face is smiling  
  
Be home soon cry on your shoulder  
Tears of a waiting man  
Every moment wait for my chance  
My friend say hello feel no fret  
You can wait and I wait and I wait  
And home I am

Close your eyes and look at me  
I'll be standing by your side  
In between the deep blue sea  
And the sheltering sky  
If we find no words to say  
To the rhythm of the waves  
Then we'll both surrender there  
Walking on air  
  
And the worries of the day lie down  
Under cover of the fading clouds  
The secrets of the night  
Come alive in your eyes  
You don't have to hurry  
You don't have to try  
Cause you don't have a care  
You're walking on air
